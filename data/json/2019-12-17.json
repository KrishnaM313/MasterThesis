It is essential that all EU institutions contribute, within their respective roles, to upholding the rule of law in the EU. In this regard, the recent visit of Parliament’s delegation to Malta and today’s debate are of great importance. As President von der Leyen made clear, she is concerned by recent developments in Malta. The Commission has been following the developments in Malta very closely. The Commission condemns the assassination of the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. Her murder was an attack on the free media and is of grave concern to Europe as a whole. Media freedom is the foundation of our free and democratic society. Journalists must feel safe to work in Europe. If not, democracy as we know it will be under threat. It is not the Commission’s role to comment on ongoing national investigations, but we have said very clearly, many times, that we expect a thorough and independent investigation, free from any political interference. I repeated this message directly to the Maltese ministers I spoke to recently. Europol is in Malta and has supported the investigations in Malta as a top-priority case, with experts on the spot and from Europol headquarters. The support activities are ongoing and will continue. It is crucial that all those responsible are brought to justice as soon as possible. The people of Malta – and first and foremost, the family of Daphne Caruana Galizia – demand truth and justice, and we stand with them. I also made this very clear during my visit to Malta in June 2018. Our role – the role of the Commission – is to address more structural and systemic issues, in particular in the area of the judiciary and the fight against corruption and money laundering, and we have done just that. The Commission has already been clear on the issue. There are a number of structural reforms that Malta is undertaking or needs to undertake. This was clearly stated in the European Semester country-specific recommendations, which were adopted by the Council on 9 July 2019. The Commission also brought infringement procedures regarding the incomplete transposition of the Anti-Money Laundering Directive and adopted an opinion on measures to be taken by the Anti-Money Laundering Supervisor following the adoption of a finding of breach of Union law by the European Banking Authority. And we are not the only ones on whose advice Malta can rely. In its opinion of December 2018, the Venice Commission and, in its evaluation report on Malta in April 2019, the Group of States Against Corruption of the Council of Europe also raised a number of concerns in line with those of the Commission. The Commission is in regular contact with the Maltese authorities and will continue working with the authorities to accelerate these reforms. I will, in particular, highlight the following priorities for urgent action. One of the top priorities for Malta is to strengthen the independence of the judiciary, in particular the safeguards for judicial appointments and dismissals, and to establish a separate and fully-independent prosecution service. There is also a need to strengthen efforts to detect and prosecute corruption and the enforcement of the anti-money laundering framework. I am aware that the Maltese authorities have, on several occasions, expressed their intention to proceed with the necessary reforms in the areas of concern I have mentioned, but there is still a lack of significant progress. The latest developments show that no further time should be lost. The Commission has underlined that any reform must comply with EU law and European standards relating to the rule of law. We have strongly encouraged Malta to properly consult the Venice Commission. As regards the prosecution services, Malta adopted the State Advocate Act in July 2019 and appointed its first State Advocate. However, concerns remain as regards, among others, the lack of checks and balances in the appointment procedure of the Attorney General, which, in practice, is still under the power of the Prime Minister. The Commission expects the Maltese authorities to implement in full the recommendations of the Venice Commission and to follow up on the findings and recommendations of the European Commission. We are in contact with the authorities. Commissioner Reynders and I both talked with Justice Minister Bonnici last week, and we will continue to insist on the need to accelerate the reforms. Just yesterday, Commissioner Reynders sent a letter to the Maltese authorities outlining the concerns and need for speedier reforming. Let me emphasise that the rule-of-law issues are European issues. The EU is built on mutual trust among its Members, and each European citizen deserves justice. This is why we will continue to closely follow the situation. We stand ready to work with the Maltese authorities on all these aspects and to provide support where necessary. More generally, we will soon put in place a new rule-of-law mechanism covering all Member States, including Malta, to improve prevention, dialogue and monitoring. This will cover judicial independence, as well as anti-corruption and aspects of media pluralism relevant to the rule of law.

She believed that no one was above the law, not an ordinary citizen, not the wealthiest and the powerful, not even the Prime Minister. She fought until the end for what she believed was right. Those who planned her assassination may have silenced her voice, but they inspired thousands of people to speak out, and thousands can’t be silenced.  Something is wrong when those who promised to serve the people use the institutions against the people. Something is wrong when a democratic government is under suspicion of covering up the assassination of a journalist. Something is wrong when the freedom of expression is not freedom anymore, but a deadly risk. The Union cannot afford a country in economic ruin. How can we afford a government in moral ruin?  From here I call on you directly, Prime Minister Muscat: the eyes of all journalists across Europe are on you. I call on you directly: every day that you remain in office is a shame for democracy and an offence to the memory of Daphne Caruana. I call on you directly: every day you are in power is a slap in the face of thousands of Maltese people asking for justice and truth. Prime Minister Muscat, if your office – the office of the Prime Minister – has been involved in a murder, what else do we still not know? You must step down, Prime Minister Muscat. This is not about you anymore: it’s about Malta.  In this dark moment of the history of Malta, the European Parliament and the EPP stand together with the Maltese people. You are not alone.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Malta is still investigating the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was murdered as a result of her investigation. This murder has deeply shaken us all and there can be no doubt that the perpetrators and those behind it must be prosecuted.  At the same time, it is about corruption and, therefore, about the state of the rule of law as a whole. Last but not least, the opinion of the Venice Commission has made it clear that the constitution, laws, procedures for the designation of persons in public authorities, which have been in place since Malta's independence, need to be revised in order to ensure the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary. This is a difficult task in a country of about half a million people, where close ties between officials are almost inevitable. Developments in recent years have created a deep distrust in parts of the population. A particular challenge also for the investigation, in particular for the right balance between information to the public on the one hand and confidentiality of investigations on the other. Nevertheless, there are initial successes: perpetrators have been arrested, a suspected middleman and one or at least one of the perpetrators of the murder has been identified. The support of Maltese authorities by Europol, the FBI and the Dutch authorities was and is welcome and helpful. The reform of the Constitution and the judicial system is also the first positive development involving the government, the opposition and the civilian population, and if possible accompanied not only by the Venice Commission, but also, of course, by our European Commission. What happens next? The investigation into the murder and, in particular, the connection with corruption and the sale of citizenships is far from complete and must continue intensively. For at the moment, Malta is a symbol of corruption for many, and it should be our joint responsibility to change that, there should be no such thing in the middle of Europe.  Investigations must continue, objectively in tone, consistently in action and always in compliance with all rules and rights of the rule of law. In addition to the wider investigations and procedures in Malta, however, we should also use the experience to take a preventive look at the sale of citizenship, including in other Member States.  Of course, we finally need to launch the EU-wide rule of law mechanism for all states and, finally, finally, to re-establish confidence in democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights – that must be our common objective.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2019-12-17.json", "name": "Sophia in 't Veld", "mepid": "28266", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew Group. – Mr President, I thank the Commissioner. We are here today not just to condemn a murder, but to discuss the response of the EU institutions. And in that context I note that once again the Council is absent, and that is significant – they’re not taking responsibility for any of this. We visited Malta two weeks ago and what we saw has not reassured us; it has basically fanned our concerns. I’m also deeply concerned about the lack of urgency that I sense in the Council in particular, and to a lesser degree in the Commission. I welcome that this Commission is at least taking steps – in contrast to the previous Commission that was completely silent – but we have to realise that we are dealing here with hard-nosed criminals who are literally ready to kill. They’re not going to be terribly impressed by a bureaucratic response, or by the Venice Commission, or by infringement procedures. They are criminals: that’s what we’re dealing with. And what is more worrying are the connections between those criminals and politics, all the way up to the Office of the Prime Minister. That is what we are talking about and this is part of the fabric that is the European Union.  Now the question is, at the end of this will we be able to look ourselves in the eye? Will we be able to look into the eyes of the family of Daphne Caruana Galizia and say that we have done everything in our power – everything? Yes, Ms Sippel, within the limits of the rule of law, but the presumption of innocence should never become the pretence of innocence.  First of all there is the immediate term, and that is to safeguard the integrity of the murder investigation. I note here that, although it is not our task to call for the resignation of the Prime Minister – that is the duty of the Maltese parliament and it should not be absolved of its responsibility – I do think that we should point out here that his continued presence in the Office of Prime Minister is cause for grave concern, because if there is a risk – real or perceived – of meddling with the investigation, basically we are eroding trust in the investigation, trust in the authorities and trust in the rule of law. Therefore, I would like to really urge the European Commission to immediately start the dialogue in the framework of the rule of law, and I’m glad that the Commission sent a letter yesterday.  The Council should be deeply ashamed of itself – the government leaders who are sitting at the table with the Prime Minister of Malta refusing to even discuss what is going on. It is deeply shameful. They should take responsibility for the integrity of the European Union.  Of course, in the longer term, there is the rule of law reforms, the constitutional reforms, banning corruption, money laundering, ending the sale of passports and all the rest of it, but, in conclusion, we have to recognise that this is not a technocratic issue, nor is it just a legal issue: this is an issue of taking political responsibility for the health of the democratic rule of law in the European Union as a whole, because if we don’t – and don’t now – this disease will spread.

We cannot afford a culture of gridlock within the European Union in the prosecution of corruption and money laundering. The weakest link in the Union is always our common problem. That is why it is crucial that the European Commission now uses all the means of the rule of law to change these conditions, which we see not only – but in particular concentration – in Malta. I would warn against one thing: we should not be blinded by the arrests and progress made in the Caruana Galizia murder case. What we are seeing in Malta is a long list of high-level allegations of corruption, right up to the President's office, in the area of corruption and money laundering. We do not see any consistent investigations there and certainly no corresponding arrests and convictions.  That is why it is now up to the Commission to put in place the measures that we have in legal terms: the European Union is a community of law and must also abide by the law when changing circumstances in Member States. But we can do much more than the old Commission did. In essence, despite two important resolutions by the European Parliament, the old Commission has put its hands in its lap and has done little. What is preventing you from opening infringement proceedings under Article 43 against all States that sell passports for refusing to cooperate loyally between Member States?  What is preventing you from ensuring that, in a Member State such as Malta, public procurement systems are regularly used for corruption, to initiate infringement proceedings for breaches of procurement rules in Europe?  What is preventing you from ensuring that the planning law sector in Malta, which, incidentally, also destroys the environment, finally tackles corruption there? What prevents you from opening infringement proceedings in the area of anti-money laundering policy, not only on individual specific issues, but also because of the systematic non-application of the law?  In other words, we have a long list of possible infringement procedures, including in the area of infringement of the separation of powers, where the current Maltese Government is not seriously implementing the recommendations of the Venice Commission. So you are launching infringement proceedings and ensuring that the first steps are taken in the context of the rule of law procedure, which systematically tackles the problems of the rule of law in Malta.

As the Commissioner rightly said: no journalist can die because he has done his job well. Daphne Caruana was investigating corruption in Malta, a country that has seen a worrying increase in illegality in recent times. Briefly, I would like to remind you of what was reported in the press.  The Schengen visa scandal, which would also have been sold to Libyan citizens, including potential jihadists, in order to be able to move freely around Europe. The scandal of the so-called golden passports, sold would appear to be EUR 650 000, and reports by Europol denouncing how money was obviously laundered on the island from illegal events, not to mention all the Maltese amnesia on immigration.  In these cases, all criticism was directed against Italy and against the then minister Matteo Salvini. But how many times has Malta not worked, I repeat, not to rescue migrants at sea, who were then transported to Italy by NGOs?  We would like to remind you that among the great supporters of the Maltese Prime Minister there are many European socialist governments, including the former government of a gentleman named Matteo Renzi, an Italian. Let us remember how Matteo Renzi tweeted his support and said: the man who solved the migrant affair is a premier, but he is not Conte, he cheers Milan, but he is not Salvini, his name is Joseph Muscat and he is the premier of Malta.  It is no coincidence that Salvini attacks him because Muscat is a leader, not like him. Using a euphemism we could say that the former prime minister could have done better to think well before expressing these reflections, given the serious news events that then happened on the island.  But I would also like to point out that another man from the Italian left, the former Under-Secretary for European Affairs, Sandro Gozi, who was a candidate with En Marche in the last European elections – and who will perhaps soon sit on these benches in the Renew Group – and former adviser to the Elysée Palace on European affairs, was also an adviser to the Maltese Government, it seems that he resigned in October 2019. I see, therefore, ladies and gentlemen, a great deal of hypocrisy on the benches of this House, where we have never missed the opportunity to criticise, for example, Italy, Matteo Salvini, but also our Hungarian friends for wanting to stop illegal immigration, for wanting to defend Europe's Christian roots in order to stand up against a European Union of banks and democracy. Perhaps, before criticising anyone else, some groups would have done better to check the situation within their political family, so as to avoid bad figures. Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that the spirit of Advent will bring greater coherence, greater serenity and, above all, greater justice to all.

Action has to be taken against whoever is responsible, whoever those persons may be. Malta is currently experiencing unprecedented circumstances that shook the whole society, and we want these realities to be addressed in a constructive manner. Several recommendations have been made. Some of the judicial changes proposed have already been carried out. Others, including recommendations by the Venice Commission and Country Specific Recommendations, are in the process of being carried out, and they will continue to be carried out.

It was not aimed at any political party over another; it was not driven by partisan beliefs; she had no personal interest; it was just trying to reveal the extent of a widespread system of corruption in an island less populated than some French cities, where almost everyone can benefit from the system. Today, what she had discovered and these links between politics, government and corruption are coming to light and, worse, her murder seems to have been covered at the highest level of power. This concerns us, the Commission, Parliament and the Council, not only because the rule of law is a foundation of our European democracy - we regularly remind us in the case of Hungary, Poland and other states that break the rules of law - but also because this explosive situation in Malta has been able to develop because of the shortcomings of the European Union in terms of the rules against tax havens. Malta is not the only tax haven in the European Union; it should not be possible in the European Union to buy a citizenship at a price of gold. We cannot simply disapprove of it by saying,'\"Certainly, it is immoral, but it is legal.\" No, it must no longer be legal, and if we can't do anything about it because it is the responsibility of the States, we should at least think about decoupling national and European citizenship in these specific cases of passport purchases. An entire culture in Malta was built on easy money, hosting oligarchs, hiding money laundering, and this seems to have rotten the institutions at the grassroots level. The systemic risks are immense today. Whatever the political colour of the government, we do not have to distribute good points and bad points between the different political forces here at European level. We need to challenge the overall golden passport process. We must also reaffirm the need for the rule of law in our European democracy, and this is the second lesson of this tragic history. The Commission proposes to create a rule of law mechanism which would include, among other things, an annual report on the rule of law in each Member State.

We have paid tribute to his memory in this European Parliament on numerous occasions, but the story is not over. In the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, which I have the honour to preside over, we heard the testimony of their three children—Andrew, Paul, and Matthew—and offered them our commitment, first of all, for justice to be done. Justice must be done. We've got to see that justice is done.  And that means entrusting that the police investigations involving the FBI, Europol and Interpol will completely lead to the clarification of all responsibilities falling, and that, of course, the judiciary will do its job in Malta. But there is more to it: the European message - in Malta and throughout the European Union - of the fight against corruption must be underlined in order to end the sale of golden passports, which open up access to the free movement of mobsters. In the European Union as a whole, in Malta and everywhere, money laundering from illicit businesses must be ended, and with collusion between political power and money, especially in a country that turns out to be a hard-hit territory, the smallest country in the European Union, with the smallest population in the entire European Union. But above all, we need to ensure that we are finally going to establish a rule of law, fundamental rights and democracy mechanism, which we have asked for time and time again in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. We support the missions that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has deployed in Malta; the last one, urgently, resciently, just a week ago.

Yet over the past few years, the European Commission and the European Council refused to take any measures against the Maltese Government, and even now the Council remains silent.

This year, 49 journalists have been killed worldwide in connection with their profession, 57 media professionals have been kidnapped, and 389 media professionals have been imprisoned for their work last year. A large proportion of these journalists have paid with freedom or even life for having stepped on the feet of the powerful in their work, for uncovering grievances, for threatening power. So did Daphne Caruana Galizia. The assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia was the second anniversary of the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia in October. As a journalist, she paid for her commitment to the truth with her life. Our solidarity is with her and her family. We owe them to act.  Daphne Galizia's fight for transparency and against corruption was not in vain. She must also be personally justice.  There are three things that apply. Firstly, we will do our part to ensure that all those responsible and complicit in her death and the crimes she wanted to expose are held accountable. The whole truth must come to light.  Secondly, we must ensure that journalists are able to carry out their work safely. A free press, which can also be a threat to the powerful, is fundamental to our society and a functioning rule of law in all EU Member States and worldwide.  We must fight the root of the problem. We must combat this, which is why Daphne Caruana Galizia was an investigative officer. We must not stand by when the values of the rule of law are trampled underfoot. We must stand up and act to combat corruption, to combat money laundering, to protect the independence of the judiciary and independent prosecution. We must examine the allocation of the so-called golden visas and passports, which exist in 17 Member States of the European Union, and impose rules on them.  We also need to strengthen a free and self-confident civil society that can speak out when fundamental problems arise.

They arose in the context of the horrendous murder of journalist Ms Caruana Galizia and also beyond. The murder has been duly investigated in past years and disclose the big result. There have been fatal failures of judgment even at the top level. The political price for them is being paid. The situation in Malta now is one of transition, both at the political level and that of the criminal investigation. What is needed is a dispassionate review of the situation, leading to reforms that will ensure no future repetition of past mistakes. True, the criminal investigation arrived at sensational findings, even more sensational allegations have been made on that basis. We have heard them being repeated during this debate, mostly for political jockeying. This runs contrary to the interests of the Maltese people whose commitment to European values is secure. When considering how European values are being respected, we must follow objective criteria applied, to all, by an institution that all can trust. The resolution on which we shall vote tomorrow combines findings, allegations, one sided interpretations in a statement that paints black everything Maltese. It also blacks out the economic, social and cultural progress achieved in Malta during the past years, which is not fair. Soon in Malta there will be a new Prime Minister, heading a new government. They will be committed to a new beginning on governance issues to correct the radical failures of the past, on meting out justice and punishment to all those responsible for the Caruana Galizia assassination, on ensuring a better separation of powers and governance, on combating corruption, on promoting transparency in government affairs. These objectives will be given total priority.  Such commitments will be carried out in all good faith by the Malta Government – that we guarantee.   The current transition should be given a chance to develop. Making premature judgments about it is not the right way.

The task of the European Union, our European Community, is also to set up a mirror of its own. Even to those who are part of our community. Corruption problems are in many countries. In Malta and Slovakia, long before the murder of journalists, institutions should have set up a mirror for the governments that ruled there. They didn't set up this mirror.

Justice needs to be done. The new Commission is very clear on such a need. In the two first weeks in office, the President of the Commission has sent a clear message to the Maltese authorities. We did the same in different phone calls from Vice—President Věra Jourová and myself to the Minister of Justice, Owen Bonnici, and I have sent a letter to the Minister of Justice yesterday. More than that, Europol is at the disposal of the Maltese authorities to take part in the investigations and we have seen some progress in the investigation due to the presence also of Europol and we will continue to follow the progress in the investigations. We need to do that, not only for Daphne Caruana Galizia, for her family, but to defend our values in the European Union. I want to say that the protection of journalists, because I have heard many questions about that, is first of all, of course, a competence of the Member States. But the Commission must also take some initiatives to support the media pluralism and to support also independent journalists that work in all the Member States. And we will continue to do that and maybe will enhance our capacities to do that. Then we need to control a correct implementation of justice reforms after the Country—Specific Recommendations adopted by the Council of 9 July 2019. In my letter, I have insisted on the independence of judiciary with safeguards for judicial appointments and dismissals with a real separate prosecutor’s office. The Commission will present an evaluation on the process reform and propose concrete actions. The Commission has a toolbox to address rule of law concerns and we are ready to make use of it. I recall that the Commission introduced infringement proceedings against Malta for non—transposition of the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, with success. As the situation evolves we will consider which instruments are appropriate, including a possible application of the rule of law framework if it’s needed. And, of course, about all those reforms we encourage the Maltese authorities to consult the Venice Commission on all draft legislation. Third, about the Investor Citizenship Scheme, in the Supranational Risk Assessment, published in July 2019, the Commission highlighted that citizenship investment programmes and investor residence schemes – also known as golden passport and golden visas – entailed significant money laundering threats. The January 2019 Commission Report on Investor Citizenship and Residence Schemes in the European Union highlights that these schemes inherently raise money laundering concerns. Awarding citizenship is a prerogative of the Member States, however, Member States must when exerting their powers in the sphere of nationality, have due regard to European Union law. European Union citizenship brings together rights to all Member States providing solidarity. Together, Member States create the conditions for enjoying EU citizenship. This common achievement should not be exploited by individual Member States’ risky investor schemes. We evaluate if a legislation is needed to find against the abuse of golden passport and if we must introduce infringement proceedings.  To conclude, we need to enhance the culture of the rule of law in all the Member States in the European Union and if we want to speak about the rule of law outside the European Union, it’s necessary to deliver, to do the job at home. It’s the reason why the Commission will organise and will set up a new mechanism with an annual report on the rule of law in all the Member States without any discrimination. It will be the occasion of a real political debate in the Council and also in the Parliament. We have such a process about the budgetary situation of all the Member States. It’s time to have the same political debate about our values, about the values of the European Union. That doesn’t mean the abandon of all the other tools at our disposal. We will continue to introduce infringement proceedings, to organise dialogue on the rule of law, to push through the Article 7 procedures.

I have received the following nominations: Mr Giuseppe FORTUNATO Mrs Julia LAFFRANQUE Mrs Nils MUIŽNIEKS Mrs Emily O'REILLY Mrs Cecilia WIKSTRÖM I would remind you that the vote shall be taken by secret ballot and that, in accordance with Rule 231(6) of the Rules of Procedure, the candidate must obtain a majority of the votes cast in order to be elected.  Abstentions shall not be considered as votes cast.  Since this is a secret ballot on your terminal, a blue light will be lit, regardless of how you voted.  Since, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, before declaring the vote open, I must ensure that at least half of the Component Members of Parliament are present, we will proceed to a vote to check for at least 374 Members.  Then I'd do this attendance check right now.  (The President made sure that at least half of parliament's component Members were present) And so we have the presence, the number is enough.  A moment's more attention. Information on electronic voting has been distributed.  Firstly, after the opening of the vote, the following information appears on the screen: the subject of the vote and the list of candidates.  Place yourself on the name of the candidate of your choice by activating the blue keys at the bottom right of the screen and express your preference by pressing the \"+\" button (left button). The blue light will turn on and an asterisk will appear in front of the name of the selected candidate. To ensure the secret nature of the vote, the asterisk will disappear as soon as you move the cursor.  If you wish to express your presence during the vote without voting for a candidate, press the \"0\" button (center button). Before the vote closes, you have the option to change the choice made by repositioning yourself on the candidate's name and pressing the \"0\" button to cancel the yes vote. Then place yourself on another candidate's name and press the \"+\" button. Is everything clear? We shall then proceed to the first round of voting. The vote is open. Did everyone vote? The vote is closed.  (The results appeared on the President's screen.)

Zunächst einmal ein herzliches Grüßgott. Madam President, the Committee on Budgetary Control (CONT) has posed five questions to the Commission regarding measures against the misuse of EU funds in cases of conflict of interest and corruption affecting the protection of the EU’s financial interests in Member States.  Let me start by providing some context to the questions that we have posed to the Commission. In certain Member States, the systemic risk of semi—legal systems enabling conflicts of interest, irregularities, misuse of funds and fraud is widely present in important policy areas such as agriculture and cohesion. We have cases where politicians allegedly systematically use their power and the influence they have over the implementation of EU programmes in their countries to enrich their companies, friends, family, or themselves. Conflict of interest constitutes in itself a serious threat. We see cases of single bidding in public procurement companies building up monopolies because other companies are thrown out of the competition. We are now facing problems that are beyond project level, so we need to go above this level to tackle them. We need to establish a clear definition of what constitutes a systemic risk and conflict of interest. We need the same legal definition and uniform interpretation of conflict of interest and systemic risk at European and Member State level. These cases threaten to undermine citizens’ trust in the EU institutions and have a negative impact on the implementation of policies. Therefore, our credibility is at stake. European funds must benefit European citizens at large. Audit procedures concerning conflict of interest and other cases of corruption, fraud or systemic failures must be accelerated so that punishment follows swiftly. Additionally, preventive measures must be reinforced. Currently, there is a lack of preventive measures that are effective and in place. If national management and control systems fail, the Commission must receive the possibility to assume decision—making and impose corrections immediately. The CONT Committee has actively monitored the situation since its fact-finding delegation of April 2014 and has been expressing its serious concern about cases of conflict of interest. CONT repeatedly requested in its discharge resolutions and other oral questions, most recently in December 2018, that the Commission take action regarding cases containing risk of irregular use of EU funds in several Member States.  We welcome the fact that the Commission has carried out comprehensive audits regarding the application of EU law. We are alarmed that the auditors detected serious deficiencies in the functioning of the management and control systems and severe cases of conflict of interest. The audits carried out by the Commission confirmed Parliament’s position, laid out in its resolution on conflicts of interest and the protection of the EU budget in the Czech Republic in 2018. They welcome the fact that, since 2018, no payments from the EU budget and the European Structural and Investment Funds have been made to companies directly or indirectly owned by Prime Minister Babiš, following the alleged conflict of interest revealed by the Commission’s auditors. They found that Mr Babis is the beneficiary of funds received by the huge industrial conglomerate. Yes, I would like to underline that there are still open questions about subsidies in the area of agriculture. Furthermore, we cannot accept the fact that projects affected by serious, sometimes fraudulent, irregularities are simply withdrawn from EU funding. Yes, the EU budget is no longer directly affected, but the core problem has not been solved.  The local taxpayer has to foot the bill when contributing to the national budget. EU funds meant to help citizens should go where they are most needed and not into the pockets of oligarchs. CAP money belongs to those who farm the land. In the case of land grabs, when land is taken by force, there is clearly a rule of law issue.  Therefore, we attach great importance to the rule of law conditionality. Rule of law is the basis for shared management. All Member States signed the Copenhagen Criteria, and they must be dedicated to the rule of law. Threats to the independence of the judiciary system, arbitrary or unlawful decisions by public authorities, limited availability and effectiveness of legal remedies, and failure to implement judgment or limitations on effective investigation and prosecution should lead to the reduction or suspension of EU funding.  We call on the Commission to take all appropriate measures at its disposal to protect the EU budget, including the revision of current procedures to increase transparency and to be more effective. We urge the Commission to recover all funds that have been paid out illegally. We insist that the Commission should propose a specific mechanism to support farmers confronted with land—grabbing malpractices, giving them the opportunity to lodge a complaint with the Commission. In the context of the negotiation on the next Multiannual Financial Framework, we call on the Council to take all necessary and appropriate measures to prevent conflict of interest effectively. We call on the Commission and the Member States to fight all forms of conflict of interest and to evaluate the preventive measures taken by the Member States to avoid such a situation. We need to clearly define the minimum standards of the rule of law. Please let’s start to work on these serious issues.

Now about the questions, and maybe I will be a little bit longer, but in order to give a serious reply, I have to take the time. The first question was about misuse of EU funds in Member States involving established schemes, as well as high-level officials/office-holders. In the case of fraud and possible links to high-level officials/office-holders, financial corrections at European level and penal action at national level have been taken in order to protect the European Union budget and to ensure the rule of law. The Commission on National Audits also identified irregularities with some more systemic character in some Member States. However, such systemic irregularities don’t systematically indicate fraud and intentional misuse through the implication of high-level officials/office-holders. Second question: what measures does the Commission take to protect the EU’s financial interest? The Commission takes any allegation of suspicion of fraud and misuse of funds very seriously. It immediately addresses, to the European Anti-Fraud Office, any information pointing to allegations of fraud emerging from citizens, whistle-blowers, or from audits. A series of recent Commission initiatives have significantly strengthened the anti-fraud landscape – for example the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office. The Commission adopted a new Commission anti-fraud strategy in April 2019. In 2018, financial regulation established a definition of conflict of interest applicable to funds under shared management. A further step is the proposal for protection of the Union’s budget in case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in Member States. The Commission is also attentively following allegations of land—grabbing. If land is taken by force, then there is a rule—of—law issue, and the judicial system of the Member State should act. The Commission can assist the Member State, if necessary, by supporting Land Registry reforms. The rule—of—law proposal referred to above would provide an additional tool once adopted. Let me now come to transparency as regards the ultimate beneficiaries of EU funds. I limit my remarks to the funds of the common agricultural policy. EU rules impose that it’s the Member States who have to publish the beneficiaries of the CAP funds annually and ex—post. The responsible Commission services consider that the current publication by all Member States of the data on beneficiaries of the CAP fulfils the transparency requirements. The Commission closely monitors the implementation of relevant transparency requirements in all Member States. What is being done to prevent the artificial break-up of pig farms or enterprises into smaller ones under the same ownership just to avoid the capping threshold for direct payments? Answer: EU rules contain a circumvention clause. It requires that Member States don’t grant any advantage to natural or legal persons in cases where the conditions for obtaining this advantage were created artificially. This would be contrary to the objectives of the legislation. The management and control systems in the Member States are audited by independent certification bodies on an annual basis and by the Commission auditors on a risk basis. The auditors verify if the Member States have put in place controls to detect artificially—created conditions. What about Commission actions on cases that have been recently reported in the media? How to prevent a similar case in the future? In relation to the Czech Republic, the Commission has communicated its final audit results for the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund to the Member State. For the rural development investment measures, the Commission has communicated its latest findings to the Member State. A further question: what are the Commission plans on the basis of Article 61 of the Financial Regulation (2018/1046) on possible situations of conflicts of interest in the Member States? The Commission will follow up on information or complaints with respect to conflicts of interest in all Member States. Audits can also be carried out based on the Commission’s own risk assessment, as foreseen in the audit strategies of the concerned services. The Commission will continue to strengthen monitoring, as the rules applying to shared management have been clarified and strengthened by the new financial regulations. The Commission supports Member States in applying conflict-of-interest rules by preparing guidance, organising exchanges of good practice, and monitoring the national rules on conflicts of interest and their consistency with Article 61 of the Financial Regulation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 95, "date": "2019-12-17.json", "name": "Tomáš Zdechovský", "mepid": "124713", "text": "  for the PPE Group. – Madam President, let me start with one such question. Can you imagine Angela Merkel or Sebastian Kurz deciding on the future budget of the European Union and owning hundreds of companies with benefits and subsidies from the European Union budget? If not, I think we're right in this debate. It must be said that the person who distributes European subsidies cannot be a large beneficiary at the same time. This is, in fact, the main issue that is on the table here, it must be said that one who benefits from European funds cannot manage these European funds. I have been on several missions and this debate should be globally not only about the Czech Republic, but also about Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria or Malta, where politics is really closely linked to corruption or even European subsidies. These European subsidies themselves bring huge opportunities, but they are also becoming the subject of different groups wanting to draw as much money as possible from them.

Parliament has been warning and addressing this problem regularly since 2014 without an effective solution to it.  Article 61(1) of the new Financial Regulation, in force since August 2018, provides that all participants in the implementation of the Union budget, including heads of government, are responsible for complying with the obligation to avoid conflicts of interest. This article also gives greater capacity for action to the Commission, which it has actually exercised, but which is not being sufficient. So it's time to act once and for all. It is clear that we must go all the way to the end of the cases we now have on the table, but one of the Commission's fundamental priorities must be to establish effective mechanisms to enable the active prevention of conflict of interest and, moreover, it is imperative that it be intervened when national authorities are not acting accordingly.  We cannot afford that any kind of conflict of interest could jeopardize the implementation of the European Union's budget and underscore the confidence of its citizens.

I believe that the Commission is aware and this debate proves that the European Parliament is also aware of this, how important and sensitive the protection of the financial interests of our citizens is. It is not only a question of how efficiently and effectively eu funds can be used, but also of Europe not losing its sense of purpose in the eyes of its citizens and losing credibility.  The issue of a potential conflict of interest in politics is something that affects all Member States in no way. We'll deal with it all the time. That is why we need to learn from the experience we have accumulated so far and to make clear rules. And when else should we start this than now? That is, at the moment when the rules for drawing European money for years to come are set. If we have discovered flaws in the system, now is the best time to do something about it. For this reason too, we are very much awaiting the results of the questionnaire survey on how individual Member States are how they are going with the new Financial Regulation. It has proved that its interpretation is not uniform in the European Union. In modern Europe, however, this cannot work. On the contrary, we need a comprehensible and concrete Europe-wide solution with a uniform methodology and interpretation. I would therefore like us to put off politicking for once and take a very serious look at how to better set the rules for the future. Rules that are simple, fair and have European added value and apply equally to everyone. Whether citizens, businesses, politicians, Member States or institutions.

Our EU budget finances oligarchs. We fund the people who abuse our system. Thanks to the excellent work of the media, science and NGOs, some of the names of the oligarchs who are particularly systematically plundering THE EU pots have become known. The most well-known of these is the representative of the Czech Republic in the European Council, Prime Minister Andrej Babic. But he is certainly not the only one. Under public pressure, the Commission has investigated a number of individual cases. However, in order to remain credible to EU citizens, it is essential that we increase the speed of our investigations: suspending payments alone is not enough. If projects have been certified by the Commission as ineligible, there must be consequences. There is an urgent need for transparency. Nevertheless, this issue is about more than individual misconduct: we need to change the incentive structures so that we do not continue to feed oligarchs, but strengthen democrats. The oligarchy is poison for democracy, especially in the structurally weak areas. If the powerful can undermine our democracy through political and economic access to EU funds and even evade the persecution of the rule of law, as seems to be the case in the Czech Republic, then the work of the European Public Prosecutor's Office should begin here. This newly created European Public Prosecutor's Office – and you too, Commissioner Hahn, have a responsibility – is absolutely essential for an adequate budget.

Today's debate on 'conflicts of interest and corruption that have a negative impact on the EU's financial interests in the Member States' clearly shows that we have a fundamental problem with the EU construct. First of all, we are persuading the Member States with angelic tongues to provide us with over EUR 1 trillion for seven years in the expectation that we will distribute the money fairly – let us say cautiously – a large part of the money.  We are inventing wonderful programmes, feeding flowery funds with a lot of money and putting multiple incentives in place so that the Member States can then join in and implement the programmes. Hosts of officials take care of the applications, check the eligibility conditions and draw up any certificates and certificates, which are then checked again by other officials. We in Parliament – more specifically, the Committee on Budgetary Control – are seriously concerned when we see that the risk of illegal use of EU funds in important policy areas such as agriculture and cohesion is becoming apparent. Mrs Hohlmeier, you are right to point out that such cases jeopardise citizens' confidence in the EU institutions and have a negative impact on the implementation of policies. You also put good questions to the Commission. But, after all that I have heard so far, I do not have the impression that the EU's financial interests are now better protected from fraud and corruption than before. Let us be honest: we are only fighting the symptoms and not the causes. Because the system is so complex and because the control systems in the Member States are completely different, and because the interests of the Member States are often contrary to the noble ideas of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I therefore fear that we will achieve nothing by increasing the control burden.  We should fight corruption and fraud first and foremost by asking the systemic question in each funding programme, minimising or even eliminating the flow of money if necessary, and, in particular, by radically simplifying the rules and the conditions of support and making them completely transparent.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 100, "date": "2019-12-17.json", "name": "Bert-Jan Ruissen", "mepid": "197773", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. Mr President, Commissioner, monitoring the use of European funds is emphatically a joint responsibility of the Member States and the Commission. At the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, we have a good system for this with recognised paying agencies and supervision by the European Commission and OLAF. So it is not for me to comment on individual issues. The crucial question is how to ensure that the money ends up in the hard-working farmer and not in the pockets of people who don't need that money at all. In this context, I would like to point out that China and other investors are in the process of buying up land in the European Union. In Romania, for example, 20 000 hectares of land are apparently owned by a Lebanese company. My question to the Commission is therefore: are you aware of such investments, which are also made through legal entities in the European Union? I find this a very undesirable development. Our land and food supply are of strategic importance and must be kept in their own hands. I would ask the Commission to investigate this issue in depth and to see whether the requirements under the common agricultural policy should not be adapted to this, so that at least no money is leaked to investors from outside the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 101, "date": "2019-12-17.json", "name": "Luke Ming Flanagan", "mepid": "124985", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. – Madam President, The New York Times article on CAP was not news to many people here.

Yesterday, Ireland’s Minister for Agriculture announced a pause on convergence. This is a clear message on where he will stand during trilogue negotiations.

Firstly, we need a modern common agricultural policy. We should not stick to an archaic system of paying per hectare, but switching to benefits on the basis of efficiency. If we go from quantity to quality, it also becomes much more difficult to cheat. Secondly, we need a rule of law mechanism that penalises the shortcomings of national authorities and stops them.

I would like to add something to the point, for example, that today we see a trend that large retail chains are buying agricultural land themselves, producing agricultural products there and thus actually creating a value chain from start to finish and, frankly, competing with actual farmers. With regard to the immediate event, I would like to point out once again that we, as the Commission, have reacted quickly here, have been on the ground with audits and now have the task of acting within the framework of our legal provisions and conditions, and they are set out. And if we, as the European Union – Parliament, the Commission – find shortcomings in the rule of law, then we are also the first to be called upon to respect the principles of the rule of law on points and commas. I therefore ask for your understanding, if the current rules provide for confidentiality, if the current rules provide for a certain process sequence, that the other person can also react et cetera, then that takes time. If you do not agree with these rules, you can change them. But at the moment I am forced to abide by these rules, and I will.

The ratification by the EU of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities: we have all taken the legal and political commitment to implement it, and you can be assured that the Commission remains fully committed to its implementation. I have the mandate to work closely with all Commissioners to mainstream disability in all EU policy areas during this College’s mandate. According to the latest figures available to the Commission, approximately 100 million persons in Europe have a disability. They represent a very important share of the EU population, and they must by no means be left behind. The current European Disability Strategy 2010—2020 is the European Union’s main instrument for implementing the UN Convention. Our future policy will pursue the same objective. In my view, the fact that we have a long—term strategy has proven to be essential. Proposing a new strategy for the next decade is certainly an option when evaluating the current one and considering the next steps. Such a follow—up initiative should build on the values enshrined in our Treaties and contribute to the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights, as well as of the Sustainable Development Goals. The Commission is currently carrying out an external evaluation of the implementation of the current strategy. This is in line with the ‘evaluate first’ principle of our Better Regulation Agenda. In consequence, the precise follow-up will be defined and agreed only once this evaluation is finalised by mid—2020. To improve coordination within the Commission and to mainstream the equality dimension – including disability – into all relevant EU policies, we have set up an Equality Task Force. We are committed to consult with the European Parliament and to take into account the two reports it adopted these last years. We will, of course, consult with all relevant stakeholders, in particular with persons with disabilities and the organisations that represent them. For instance, the European Economic and Social Committee unanimously adopted a valuable contribution to the debate just last week, and we are carefully studying those recommendations. On the basis of a thorough review of our European Disability Strategy, we will propose how best to move forward on implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and disability mainstreaming. Our future disability policies will also have to take into account the changes affecting our societies. There are new challenges and also new opportunities. In this respect, I recall that the United Nations Convention recognises that women and girls with disabilities are subjected to multiple discrimination and calls on state parties to ensure the full and equal enjoyment by them of all human rights and fundamental freedoms. To this end, the future gender equality strategy announced by President von der Leyen in her political guidelines will pay particular attention to groups facing multiple disadvantage, including women with disabilities. Digitalisation and accessibility legislation have allowed us to lift some important barriers, but many hurdles still remain for people with disabilities, and in some cases, new barriers have appeared which need to be addressed. The fact that we are evaluating our current strategy does not prevent us from making further progress now. We already use – and will keep using – all tools available to achieve progress across Europe. Areas such as personal assistance or accessible and inclusive education are a primary responsibility of the Member States. However, the Commission is committed to keeping on working together with the Member States and supporting them in their endeavours. The European Semester and EU funds can be used for this purpose. European structural and investment funds already support the deinstitutionalisation and development of community-based services for persons with disabilities in the Member States. For the future programming period, having a national framework for implementing the United Nations Convention is proposed by the Commission as a pre-condition for receiving funding from any of the funds covered by the Common Provisions Regulation. This condition needs to be met throughout the entire 2021-2027 period when implementing the funds. It also cemented the importance of promoting independent living and moving from institutional care to family- and community-based care. The Commission is also working with the Member States to ensure the correct transposition of the European Accessibility Act. A first informal meeting with the Member States took place on 22 November 2019. More meetings are planned in the months to come. I now look forward to hearing your views on our future policies on disability.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 154, "date": "2019-12-17.json", "name": "Στέλιος Κυμπουρόπουλος", "mepid": "197692", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for the reply and I thank the European People's Party for supporting the effort to put this very serious issue on the agenda. No institution, no tradition, no power in the world can stop our thirst for human dignity, for real freedom. And in institutions, we're not just talking about wasted money, we're talking about discarded human lives. People are singed and tied up, without care, because that's how we got used to it. Dignity is to rebel against indifference that is becoming a habit. Don't let human life be thrown away, no way you're going to rise up against corruption and exploitation. Dignity is to honor all our fellow citizens. The big issue is not most money. According to a New York Times report, companies that hire disabled workers have on average 23% higher profitability, as our need to always try to address social barriers makes us innovative.  I call on you all to agree on the basics: institutionalisation is a violation of human rights 'made in EU', a prison funded by the European Commission. Let's stop funding the institutions now. All institutions present a more or less bad picture. The reality in Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, even in Brussels is disheartening. The Charter of Human Rights that preceded the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities stipulates that all citizens, disabled and not, should be able to choose their lives as free people, as equal citizens. Independent living is possible in a society with access to education, health, work, freedom of choice. It is important not only to stick to declarations but to ensure that there is a disability clause in all policies. Can the Commission make investments for inclusion and accessibility a priority in all EU policies? Do you consider accessibility initiatives to be part of our new vision for the New Green Agreement? Can the new Commission confirm that it will actively promote the transition to 'personal assistant', through the promotion of best practices and through the overall transfer of funds to institutions? In addition, can we secure a single labour market for disabled people?

Mr President, Commissioner, some people have to overcome many more hurdles in life than others. When you have a disability, the course you have to go through is much heavier.

If you are in a wheelchair or have a visual impairment or a certain disorder, you are often underestimated. I would like to know from the Commission how it intends to change that. It is well known that the Dutch government lags behind the business community in terms of the recruitment of people with disabilities. What about Europe?

This strategy is at its core about human rights – human rights for everyone in the EU, human rights that are available. One of the important points in the creation of accessible societies is to review the implementation of the Functional Law Convention. It is high time to review it, albeit perhaps a little late.  Let me remind you that 100 million Europeans, European citizens, are waiting for their human rights to be met. Today, many Europeans live without the possibility of real participation in society, including in terms of the labour market, culture, studies and, not least, general elections, and not least the elections to this Parliament. It is unworthy of the world's only union of democracies that the elections to its elected assembly are not available to all its citizens. Our citizens who have a standard-breaking functionality do not have the same opportunity to participate in the European elections. That is why My intention is to push for a resolution that makes the 2024 European elections accessible to all, and here I hope for the support of my colleagues in the European Parliament.  A future strategy must focus precisely on the accessibility of the labour market, anti-discrimination legislation, training for young people, personal assistance and participation in democracy. I wonder how the Commissioner intends to ensure that this happens. Finally, it must, of course, be emphasised by the organisations representing this group in society must be involved in both the development and implementation of such an agenda.

Every day in the EU, the human rights of people with disabilities are violated. In order to guarantee them equal participation in social life, we must become bolder and more consistent. A continuation of the current strategy is therefore not enough. We call on the Commission to present a more ambitious strategy for the post-2020 period for all areas of action and to set clear, binding targets with fixed timeframes. We need strong monitoring with appropriate indicators and sufficient financial resources. People with disabilities must be involved in legislation and monitoring. This is the only way we can be honest about the implementation of the UN-BRK. In addition, we must consistently address the rights of people with disabilities in all policy areas and intersex discrimination at last. This is also the case in the new strategy for equality between men and women. Women and girls with disabilities are particularly often victims of abuse. We must defend their rights to sexual self-determination and the right to family, but we must also protect them from violence.

Well, in describing the Priorities of the European Commission, President von der Leyen has not once spoken the word disability, sad consideration and observation that tells us well what place disabled people occupy on the Commission's priority scale. Disability statistics and figures are disheartening. Disability in Europe affects around 80 million people, who often do not have the opportunity to participate fully in social and economic life due to behavioural and environmental barriers. By 2020, one fifth of europe's population is expected to have some form of disability, also due to an ageing population. These figures tell us that the European Union must do more for people with disabilities and attention to them must become a priority. If we want to create a truly inclusive society, we need determined political will. Let go of useless slogans and focus on the goal with concrete actions. Financial instruments should therefore be increased for people with disabilities, their families and voluntary associations, in particular the structures where they operate.

I will now tell you what such a person looks like, such a life of a person with a disability in Slovakia. Even after birth, it gambles with its potential, because we are completely failing early intervention. After a flawed or late diagnosis, he begins to lag behind his peers from more developed countries. Up to half of children with special needs are educated separately from their peers, even if their disability allows them to attend a normal primary school. People with disabilities can hardly be seen on Slovak streets due to barriers. If a wheelchair user wants to travel by train, it must humiliatingly report it to the railways the day before. Up to 7 people out of 10 with disabilities are completely excluded from the labour market in Slovakia. And we are still talking only about those who have not ended up in disastrous large-capacity facilities that we should have turned into community services a long time ago. The planned strategy after 2020 must bear in mind that we have an acute lack of comparable data and a lack of implementation. Very many countries show superficial improvements on paper that contribute to false statistics, which we then satisfy ourselves with.

That is why I call upon the Commission that when this initiative for a fair minimum wage comes to the table, it will cover all workers and make sure that discriminatory minimum wages for people with disabilities are prohibited in all Member States.

More than 100 million people with disabilities live in Europe today and this number is increasing. Millions of disabled Europeans want to learn, work, participate in public life, travel, lead independent lives without hindrance. Meeting these expectations is not only a commitment for Europe, but a necessity. Europe needs the social, economic and intellectual potential of this group of citizens.  The availability of universal education for children and young people with disabilities and adequate support for teachers are crucial in order not to limit opportunities for further development. The obligation to adapt the workplace rationally, as well as to support european measures for the education and further training of persons with disabilities, the transition from dependence on benefits to employment in the open labour market are the best way to combat social exclusion and poverty.

However, the exclusion of persons with disabilities comes at a huge price – the ILO estimates that this is up to 1 to 7 percent of a country's GDP. I am therefore of the opinion that the new European Union strategy on disability after 2020 should focus on removing these barriers.

This applies both to places where people with disabilities live and work. This is a discriminatory and limiting situation for them to function in society. An alternative to this situation is the organisation of systems to support persons with intellectual disabilities in taking up employment in the open labour market, so-called 'assisted employment' and 'assisted housing' with the permanent or periodic support of a qualified trainer. The European Union should allocate adequate resources to the promotion and establishment of the abovementioned support schemes.

Meanwhile, the poverty rate for people with disabilities is 70% higher than the European average, as well as due to limited access to employment. The aim of the strategy must therefore be to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities and to eradicate discrimination and social exclusion. The creation of a society ensuring the full social inclusion of these people will also bring new opportunities for the development of the European market and the economy.

You are certainly aware that the conference ended 42 hours after schedule – a delay which is testimony to the difficulties encountered during the negotiations.  With your permission, I will come back to these difficulties in a moment. I would like to point out some important progress that was made in the EU’s climate policy last week. Firstly, last Wednesday the Commission presented the European Green Deal, which is a road map to embed climate action into all policies.  Secondly, one of the main priorities of the Finnish Presidency was reached in the European Council which, after a long debate, endorsed the objective of achieving a climate neutral EU by 2050, in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. However, one Member State at this stage was not able to commit to implementing this objective as far as it was concerned, and the European Council will come back to this Member State’s position in June 2020.  The decision by the European Council is a step forward. The EU has now agreed on the common objective of climate neutrality and all the Member States but one have committed to implementing it. It is important that the work continues and that next year all Member States will commit to its implementation.  Now, honourable Members, coming back to the Madrid Conference. I would like to recall what was at stake at the conference, both for the planet and for the EU.  COP25 had three major objectives.  First and foremost, to finalise the rule book on the issue of the carbon market, as laid down in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Second, to complete the review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage, and finally to agree on the extension and revision of the Gender Action Plan.  On these objectives the EU negotiation position was clear. The rules on Article 6 should ensure robust accounting for the use of international carbon markets, should avoid double counting and should also guarantee environmental integrity.  Concerning the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage, the EU should resist calls to create additional institutional mechanisms, but should support instead solutions that would provide for countries to effectively address loss and damage associated with climate change. As to the gender action plan, the EU was supportive of an extension and revision which strengthens gender considerations and women’s participation in climate action.  On 2 December, addressing the conference on behalf of the EU, the Presidency made it clear that, in front of this climate emergency – the one this Parliament declared last month – we had to change our approach dramatically and embrace the green revolution. Our objective being to make Europe the first climate—neutral continent on the planet by 2050. Indeed, during these two weeks of negotiations, it became increasingly clear that there was an elephant in the room – ambition, which was not on the agenda of this COP – turned out to be a major issue.  A number of parties, together with NGOs, the youth with Greta Thunberg, and the public at large, in their thousands in the streets of Madrid, called on the COP to do more to address the climate emergency.  Here I salute our team of negotiators who spared no effort and worked literally 24/7 to achieve the best possible results. Their task was made extremely difficult because a small number of parties either refused to engage or insisted on mechanisms under Article 6 that could potentially be the death knell of the Paris Agreement. Until the very last hours of the COP, the EU showed the maximum possible flexibility in view of striking a deal which would preserve environmental integrity. Unfortunately it proved impossible.  Ladies and gentlemen, there are several lessons to be drawn from this experience.  First, standing by its principles for the common good, the EU is increasingly recognised as the champion and the main actor of the Paris Agreement. By launching the EU Green Deal we translate our words into action.  Second, great progress has been made. Although no agreement was reached on Article 6, the quality of the texts on the table has significantly improved. An agreement on these texts at the COP26 in Glasgow next year seems within reach.  Third, we read in the news that the results of the COP are disappointing, but we should look at what has been achieved. The review of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage and of the framework for capacity building have been successfully completed, and the Gender Action Plan has been extended. And it was agreed that the work on the global climate action agenda would continue beyond 2020.  So, ladies and gentlemen, to conclude, the EU will continue to negotiate the implementation of the Paris Agreement in the same spirit. In 2020 the parties will have to update their nationally—determined contributions and submit their long—term strategy.  I would take this opportunity to call on all parties to update their nationally—determined contributions in a manner that reflects their highest possible ambition.  I look forward to this debate and I thank you very much for your attention.

We stand firm behind the global transition to a climate-neutral future and the Commission believes in a Green Deal for Europe to lead the way.  The COP in Madrid is now behind us. It did not deliver what we had travelled there for on international carbon markets and on other issues. For Europe, there were some bridges that we just could not cross if we want to lead on climate; if we wanted to stay credible towards our international partners; if we wanted to respond to the young people in the streets and to citizens here at home in Europe who are asking for action and a plan for the climate.  To put it plainly, we could not support global rules that would undermine the very integrity of global climate action. We could not endorse an outcome that would take us back on climate instead of taking us, and the rest of the world, forward. But now, we, in Europe, will be looking forward. We will build on the global consensus to work next year to increase climate ambitions worldwide.  I noticed, and I think many of us who were there noticed, that the world is watching us, and they know that our task is more urgent than ever. Last week we presented in your Parliament the European Green Deal, which is our proposed roadmap to take climate action across all our policies. We have committed to climate neutrality by 2050, and we set out a timeline to increase our ambition for our emissions reductions in 2030. That’s Europe’s momentum to increase ambitions worldwide and we will work relentlessly next year to do this.  And I have to say that there were quite a number of countries in Madrid who were interested by this and who want to talk to us to see whether we can create alliances and help them do the same.  By COP26 in Glasgow, we intend to propose to update our nationally determined contributions to tackle climate change. We also need to submit our long-term strategies in line with the Paris objectives and in the European Union we are ready for this. We cannot afford to leave anyone behind.  At the COP in Madrid, Europe showed solidarity with the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change. We must make sure that we help the most vulnerable in their climate efforts so that they are taken along in this effort, that they have the capacity to deal with the changes so that they find courage and hope in a better, sustainable future. You know, nothing makes such an impression as talking to representatives from countries that can quite literally disappear if we don’t do anything about climate change.  So I think that we can build the capacity to deal with the changes so that we, together with them, can find the solutions. This is what our citizens want, in Europe. They want it also for people outside of Europe. The EU and its Member States already provide more than 40% of the global climate finance. Europe will continue to scale it up in line with the Paris Agreement, so we remain firmly committed to boosting global climate finance and to supporting developing countries.  We remain committed to achieving the USD 100 billion financial goal and financing the key funds under the Convention and Paris Agreement. We look forward to the commencement of deliberations on the post-2025 goal at COP26, to submitting information on our finance beyond 2020 next year, and to taking further action to align global finance with the Paris goals. This Commission and this Parliament know that people are calling for action, and that in fact they are taking action on the streets themselves to push us for more ambition and a concrete climate plan. Most of us who have children know they talk to us at home – what are you doing? Are you doing enough? You should be doing more! It’s a good thing. It’s a good thing to see this young generation lead us. It’s a good thing to see that the 16-year-old climate activist was named Person of the Year by Time magazine. It’s good that this generation is taking this huge responsibility.  I think our Green Deal responds to the calls. The Green Deal is a start for Europe to reinvent itself, to base our wealth and our well—being not just on carbon, to get rid of that as an essential element. I believe it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity to deliver a greener and cleaner future for our citizens, without leaving anyone behind.  Next year, on the global stage, we will work with our partners to raise global ambitions. We will fight to make sure that we all face head-on the urgent challenges of climate change. I know we can count on this Parliament to do that, and I know that this Parliament understands that the fact that Europe has only 9% of emissions does not give us an excuse to not do anything, because I’ve also seen in Madrid that if we lead, others will follow. If we lead, others will be convinced to go the same way. If we lead, those who are hesitating today will no longer be hesitating tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 210, "date": "2019-12-17.json", "name": "Peter Liese", "mepid": "1927", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Vice-President Timmermans, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and for the way in which she has been rapporteur for his excellent work and for the work she has done. Given the urgency of action and the legitimate expectations of people, especially young people, this was, of course, a disappointment of what happened in Madrid. In the case of Article 6 in particular, it would have been good if we had achieved a good result. However, we, as the European Parliament delegation, have always said to the Commission and the Council: we would rather not have a deal on Article 6 at all than a bad deal. For there was a danger that we would fall behind the Paris Agreement, that the old world, where not all states have obligations, should be rescued into the new period, when states such as Brazil also have obligations to do something themselves and not just to allow trade in questionable allowances to take place in their country. That is why it was right that the Commission and the Council remained strict here. Outside the official negotiating rooms, there has been a positive development: for several years, I have systematically asked our partners from Japan, South Africa, Mexico and many other major countries: What are you doing to raise your climate target? And until a few months ago there was always a great silence. Some of them did not know what we were talking about at all, when we in Europe were talking about higher ambitions and, in some cases, passed laws that went beyond Paris, they did not know what we were talking about. That has changed. We will find partners, for example with Canada, but also with the listed countries. And we need to keep putting pressure on. That is why the international dimension of climate policy is now more important than ever. That is why the GROUP of European Democrats also wants a high-level climate ambassador.

In retrospect, however, Like all previous speakers, Madrid, despite the good hospitality of Spain and Madrid, did not deliver politically what we are entitled to expect as citizens.  The rule book that would be a strong proof that you are living up to the Paris Agreement was not at all successful. Despite long negotiations and very good intentions, not least on the part of the EU, an agreement on the rulebook was not reached. This is very negative and I would say directly irresponsibly by the countries that should be held accountable for this, such as Brazil, the USA and Russia, which took a very destructive line. The only thing that comforts is that a bad deal would have been worse than no deal. The fact is that a weak regulatory framework could have undermined our ability to make a stronger climate year in 2020. I would also like to pay tribute to the Commission for its work and Mr Timmermans for his hard work in Madrid, also for the Green Deal, which will really be a 'game changer' for Europe, but thus also send a clear message from europe to the rest of the world that we are even more clearly ready to take leadership together with the constructive forces that listen to science and young people.  This is the only way forward. It must be clear. We are going to do more to reduce our emissions in Europe and in europe, but we also need to continue to keep the pressure on the international community for Glasgow, and it is good that we are united in that message.

So we knew what was going on, and what was going on was really disturbing. After coming back from Madrid, I tried to quantify what was actually at stake. A report from the US Department of Energy says that the amount of Russian allowances is about 884 million tonnes, probably the same amount as in China. So had we given in during the negotiations, there wouldn’t have been any policy left. So we did the thing we had to do.  For my part, the most touching discussion we had was actually with the delegation from the United States. There’s an old saying in American politics: the shining city on the hill. That was used in 1630 when the first pilgrims left for the eastern coast. That was a mark of being a leading state in the world. Today, the US is not the shining city on the hill anymore.

But let’s be honest: Madrid was a disappointment. It was clearly a disappointment. It has been stated before. We came to Madrid with little on the agenda, and even that we didn’t manage to conclude. And that does not bode well for next year in Glasgow, because then it needs to happen. In Glasgow, that’s the moment where we can really raise our ambition. And it’s needed. We are still on a track of warming more than three degrees, with all the devastating consequences, and the world is bickering about details, about allowances, taking them from old to new periods, or here in the Parliament, the EPP is saying that we need a climate envoy. This kind of institutional battling doesn’t help the climate. What helps is really more ambition from Europe, and what is important there is that we need it on time. This is really a question to the Commissioner: how do you see 2020 evolving? Because this is going to be a crucial year. How are we going to make it happen that Europe is on time with increasing its ambition so that in September, when there is the EU-China summit in Leipzig, we can really try to get China on board with more ambition? Because that is absolutely needed in order to create dynamics when we go to Glasgow and also to get other partners in the world at a higher ambition level. This kind of choreography is a bit unclear so far, and I would like to hear from the Commissioner what his view is on how he sees 2020. A final comment: the role of some of the countries was clearly just blocking, and one of them was Brazil. And I would also like to hear, both from the Council and the Commission: will this have repercussions for the trade deal that is on the table – Mercosur?

What is different, however, is the general treaty written on paper, and what is different is the specific provisions intended to implement it. The latter proved too difficult. Great progress has been made in Katowice in this area by drawing up the Katowice Book of Rules, but the rules on market mechanisms provided for in Article 6 have been lacking. The reason is obvious – it is these market mechanisms that are a source of income for many parties to the Paris Agreement, which they do not want to give up. For this we still have transparency problems. China continues to prove that it does not want too much transparency in reporting, which calls into question the sincerity of their intentions. That is why today we cannot talk at all about the fact that the principles of protecting our industry from global competition from countries with weaker climate solutions are already a thing of the question.

The Council's agreement to commit to climate neutrality in 2050, the climate emergency declaration adopted in this Parliament, the simultaneous presentation of the European Green Pact with the COP, with the outstanding work of Commissioner Timmermans, managed to engage other governments and ensure that it did not derail the Paris Agreement.

So what we should be doing, starting from today, is to prepare well, as the European Union, for that COP. This is a combination of doing the right things in Europe and, at the same time, being extremely active on the international scene in climate diplomacy. And these are not two different things. You cannot separate these two roles. You need to do the same thing, both at the same time. What are the concrete things we should do internally to prepare? First of all, we need to prepare our climate law so that we can show the rest of the world that we put into law our commitment to be climate neutral by 2050. To do that, we should also indicate clearly what we would be doing intermittently because 2050 is a long way from now, but 2030 isn’t. It’s almost tomorrow, it’s only 10 years, but we should be able to determine what we do in 2030.  To determine that precisely, we will do an impact assessment, but we need to do it in time so that we are timely in preparing our climate law and preparing the clear targets for 2030 so we can take that to the international conference. At the same time, we need to be rather quick in preparing a strategy that offers a future to our farming community with a From Farm to Fork strategy, which says clearly that we need our farmers more than before but in a different way. We should also look at ETS. Where can we improve the ETS system? What is it going to do on shipping? How are we going to apply it in the airline area? What are we doing with different sectors in our economy on ETS, etc., etc.? These things are urgent and we need to work on all these things at the same time. What are we going to do in our building environment? What are we going to do on biodiversity, which is intimately linked to this?  I am mentioning all these subjects because, when you look at a conference like COP, on the surface it looks to be about emissions, but emissions are part of a much broader spectrum. What we’re proposing in the Green Deal is to actually reset our economy. Our economy, our system, our welfare, our well—being depends almost fully today on carbon and we are dependent on that. We’re addicted to that. So we need to get rid of that addiction and we need to make sure that we can create the same level – or better levels – of well—being, welfare and prosperity without having to depend on carbon.  That is a paradigm shift of unprecedented proportion – and it can only happen if we convince other parts of the world to follow suit because I do agree with those who say that if we only do this in Europe, it’s only 9% of emissions and it will not have the effect we want on a global scale. But what is also true is that if we don’t do it in Europe, we will have no arguments to convince others. I experienced – and I hope colleagues had the same experience in Madrid – a lot of interest in many parts of the world for the European Green Deal and also a lot of interest in the idea of setting a target of being climate neutral in 2050.  The rest of the international community is waking up to the fact that this is a completely new way of looking at things. It is no longer believing, like we did many years ago, that by taking incremental steps, eventually we’ll get there. We’re turning things round. We’re saying this is where we need to be in 2050 and then we take steps back until today and then we can chart exactly what needs to be done until then.  Our proposal is not a blueprint, it’s a roadmap. It would give us the opportunity, also through a climate pact, to make sure that the people who are on the streets, the people who have a stake in this – whether it’s in industry or in agriculture or in academia or in trade unions – are part of the conversation and the decision—making. That’s what the climate pact will be.  So this is, I believe, what the European Union has to offer to the rest of the world and we do it for the next generations. We do it because it’s inevitable. We do it because not doing it would be relinquishing our duty in light of the facts that can no longer be disputed, and in light of what science is telling us. We do not have the luxury to sit on our hands. We do not have the luxury to ignore this. We have the duty to act.

As I said, the EU showed both determination and flexibility in order to reach the best possible results, notably as regards ambition and Article 6.

Eventually, under these circumstances, our negotiators considered it safer to refrain from accepting a very bad deal on Article 6.

They are essential for food production and human livelihoods. They are key to supporting our ecosystems. Pollinators are also important for the economy. Their impact is particularly visible in food production. Almost EUR 15 billion of the EU’s annual agricultural output is directly attributed to insect pollinators. For many crops, the contribution of pollinators can amount to half of the market value of the produce. Over the past decades, the number and diversity of pollinators have seriously declined in Europe as well as globally. Many of them are threatened with extinction. This situation is unsustainable. The functioning of our ecosystem and human well-being are at risk. Many different drivers contribute to the decline of pollinators and they are all linked to human activity. Much pollinator habitat has been lost to agriculture, resource extraction and new urban and suburban development. Non-native species take away the natural habitat of the pollinators and unfamiliar parasites and diseases can severely compromise whole colonies of bees.  Intensive farming and the use of harmful pesticides are another big threat for pollinators, destroying their habitat and taking away the diversity of the plants they usually forage on. Climate change and temperature changes also have disruptive effects on pollination. I agree with you that we need effective measures in the EU to address the root causes of pollinators’ decline. The Commission took an important first step in this direction by adopting in June last year an EU initiative especially focusing on pollinators. The Council welcomes this initiative, which seeks to address the problem in an integrated way and to use existing tools and policies more effectively. Like this Parliament, the Council is of the view that in order to tackle the loss of pollinators, more research is needed to address knowledge gaps and to clearly understand the causes and the consequences of the decline. Pollinator species and populations in the EU also need to be better monitored to better understand their status and trends. Only with scientific knowledge and a full understanding of the problem can we address it effectively. It is also important to raise public awareness about pollinators and their importance for healthy ecosystems and for our well-being. Parliament is right in stressing the need to engage citizens, beekeepers and farmers to contribute to pollinator conservation and industry, citizens and governments at all levels have to join efforts.  International cooperation is another important aspect. The Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity agreed on a plan of action for 2018 to 2030 for the conservation and sustainable use of pollinators. In the action plan stakeholders, including farmers, are encouraged to adapt pollinator-friendly practices and address direct and indirect drivers of pollinator decline.  Our Member States are active in raising the problem of pollinators’ decline in the international community. Eleven Member States have joined the Coalition of the Willing on Pollinators established in 2016 at the 13th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Cancún. The members of the Coalition committed to take action and to work together on pollinators and to share their knowledge and the best practices to encourage other countries to take measures in this respect. Last month the Coalition proposed to have a specific target, an indicator for pollinators and pollination, in the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework.  Perhaps the most important and urgent of the priority actions identified by the Commission in the EU pollinators initiative is to tackle the causes of pollinator decline. The EU has already put in place a range of measures, such as the protection of natural habitats through the EU’s nature legislation, support for beekeeping and restrictions on the use of pesticides harmful to bees.  The EU Natura 2000 network of protected areas provides many habitats of vital importance for pollinators, yet these measures have not been sufficient. Measures have also been taken to promote pollinator-friendly solutions in agriculture and to support biodiversity in the reformed common agricultural policy for the years 2014 to 2020.  All these developments are positive. But, despite the action taken so far, the decline of pollinators has not stopped. The Intergovernmental Science—Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services ‘Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services’ released in May this year provides a grim picture. The global decline of biodiversity at unprecedented rates in human history is, to a large extent, caused by the loss of pollinators which are the very basis of habitats and ecosystems. To conclude, it is clear that we have not done enough and more efforts are needed to halt the decline of pollinators and maintain and restore their habitats. The Council therefore calls for rapid and effective implementation of the existing measures by the EU and the Member States to address the loss of biodiversity. The Council also welcomes the European Green Deal adopted by the Commission last week. We also look forward to the publication of the Commission’s biodiversity strategy for 2030 with ambitious targets for biodiversity, which we will examine with great interest as soon as it’s available.

The decline of wild pollinators in the European Union is, as you have said, dramatic. The functioning of ecosystems, our food security and well-being are at risk. As we all know, this problem has vividly captured public attention. In 2016 the European Parliament called on the Commission and Member States to act urgently on this problem. In 2018 the Commission adopted the first ever European Union initiative on pollinators, building on European research projects and following a broad public consultation. This initiative sets long-term objectives and short-term actions, providing the necessary framework to consolidate efforts across sectors and to provide a more effective response of the European Union and its Member States. The scope is comprehensive: more than 30 actions aimed to strengthen our understanding of the problem, tackle the main drivers and engage actors across the board. Main threats to pollinators are well known. The initiative addresses directly the loss of pollinator habitats and the use of pesticides, particularly in the context of agriculture. It also addresses directly the threat from invasive alien species. The already existing and future European Union actions on research, climate change and pollution will also be critical for the protection of pollinators.  Agriculture is the key sector. It does depend on pollinators but also exerts a strong pressure on them, whether through intensification of agricultural practices or abandonment of high nature value farmland. Our common agricultural policy is essential to turn these challenges into opportunities. The role of Member States is critical. The future common agricultural policy, in particular, offers them a significant opportunity to improve and scale-up their actions on pollinators.  As announced in the European Green Deal, and while we are still waiting for the adoption of the new CAP, the Commission will work with Member States to ensure that strategic plans are assessed according to robust and environmental criteria and lead to more sustainable practices.  These include precision agriculture, organic farming, agroecology, and ensuring that these plans work towards the goal of stopping the loss of pollinators.  The Commission is currently developing a common European Union monitoring scheme for pollinator species in close cooperation with Member States. The scheme will mobilise scientists, citizens and practitioners to generate data necessary to build robust policy indicators on the status and the trends of the pollinator species. This will ensure that we have the necessary knowledge to assess the effects of our policies, including the common agricultural policy, on the diversity and the abundance of pollinators. The responsibility to duly deploy the monitoring scheme on the ground lies with Member States. The Commission will coordinate and provide the necessary support, including through the future Life programme and, of course, Horizon Europe. The European Union pollinators initiative is also developing monitoring processes for pressures on pollinators, including pesticides. This will support research on the causes of pollinator declines and better understanding on how to effectively tackle them.  The initiative aims to reduce the impact of pesticides on pollinators by: strengthening the risk assessment; banning all outdoor uses of the three neonicotinoids restricted in 2013; and supporting Member States to ensure the sustainable use of pesticides, in particular through integrated pest management. In the European Green Deal, the Commission announced an increased level of ambition to tackle the causes of biodiversity loss, including by reducing significantly the use and the risk of chemical pesticides, as well as the use of fertilisers, and restoring damaged ecosystems.  The Commission will identify the measures, including legislative measures, needed to bring about these reductions.  And finally, the biodiversity strategy for 2030 and the Farm to Fork strategy to be delivered in the spring of 2020 will provide strong frameworks for the European Union pollinators’ initiative and help us to reach our goal of stopping the loss of pollinators.

I think there is no disagreement on what both of you have said to the House here. We have a very serious problem. I’m sadly old enough to remember a time when I would go out as a child into the fields and be able to collect bees, all sorts of varieties of bees, look at them in a jar and release them. And I think there are many children today who just wouldn’t know that that ever happened and would not be aware of the biodiversity that existed. So we do have a serious problem and I’m happy that this resolution takes hold of this issue and points a way forward.  So rather than repeat all the reasons why we have a problem, let me just talk about two issues which have been raised here. One is the new Farm to Fork Strategy. This is a new element and a very important one, and maybe you will be surprised when I throw in competition law with biodiversity, but there is a link here and we need to understand how competition law is impacting in a negative way on biodiversity, and I ask you to do that.  The second issue I raise is about trade deals. We have to ensure that what we practice internally, where we restrict the use of risky pesticides and those that are damaging, is practiced outside of the European Union on food that we import. We haven’t done that in the past and we need to do it now. I want to thank the groups. We’ve worked well and we’ve worked hard on this resolution, because we all have a common aim to not just preserve what we have but to restore nature and to make sure that there is space for nature in all of our places, urban and rural, and gardeners and farmers all have an important role to play.

Did you, you know, that a single bee colony dusts 300 million flowers in a single day? Do you know, did you know that bees and pollinators give us one in three bites of food we eat, because 90 percent of food crops and wild plants breed by pollinating insects? And do you know that, as far as agricultural activities in the European Union are concerned, 84% of crop species and 76% of European food production depend on pollination by insects, which is around EUR 15 billion, which we owe them? And did you know, you know, that since 1970, half of all insects have died out because of the destruction of nature and the use of pesticides, and 40 percent of the one million identified insect species are threatened with extinction? Now, dear colleagues, when you are asked at home by the children or journalists at home why you are dealing with such issues in the European Union, you say these things, tell them. This is why it is important, for example, to identify the causes of pollinators' demise because of climate change, diseases, the spread of parasites, chemicals used by large-scale agriculture, or even the expansion and lifestyle of large cities, and find solutions together. Hungary is particularly exciting from the point of view of the european union, because we Hungarians, for example, imported the most honey from the EU Member States last year. Here, too, the issue is relevant. This is what the European Green Agreement is all about for me, for example, and that is what this resolution is all about for me, and please support it.

These few words are those of Agnes Beulens, who is a beekeeper in the Walloon Brabant and of whom 60% of the hives did not survive the winter. Calls like this, Commissioner, we receive dozens of them. We receive dozens of emails, petitions are raining down, and even a European Citizens' Initiative, which has just been registered by your Commission. It's a disaster, a real catastrophe looming. The extinction rate of pollinators today is between 100 and 1,000 times higher than normal; these are the UN figures. Four out of five plant species depend on this pollination, with fruits and vegetables in mind - we haven't talked about it yet. So it is our diet that we watch disappear with our bees, our butterflies, our beetles. The European initiative for pollinators, which you are presenting to us and which was initiated by your predecessor, Commissioner Vella, is a positive signal. I've been one of those who's been asking for it since 2016, but more needs to be done. The causes of this decline, they are known. So we have to act on each of them and right away. The disappearance of habitats, first, the habitats of pollinators: create obligations of nectar corridors between crops, for example. Pesticides: ban neonicotinoids, set obligations to reduce other most harmful substances and develop safer, non-chemical, of course, chemical alternatives for farmers.

That will not work. We need to change this common agricultural policy. We need more diversity in the field, we need to do more for organic farming, we need to use fewer pesticides, but also less nitrogen. All this is necessary, and that is why it annoys me that the Green Deal has disappeared a clear target for the reduction or restriction of pesticides.  And that is why I find it incomprehensible why several neonicotinoids are still allowed, why we are now getting a new discussion on glyphosate. None of this is part of agricultural practice any more. These are things from yesterday that we cannot work with in the future if we really want to achieve something.  I am also annoyed that, on the one hand, we are banning neonicotinoids and making Member States exceptional, as Belgium announced yesterday to allow neonicotinoids in sugar beet. We will not be able to afford that in the future either. We must also reflect on the fact that we have a stricter authorisation regime for pesticides.

It is therefore worrying that their survival is threatened. On 11 October 2019, the International Union for Conservation of Nature issued an urgent call for action and I believe it must be listened to. The European Union must step up its participation in this pollinator rescue mission. Of course, the EU has already decided in April 2018 to ban the field use of neonicotinoids, which are the most harmful pesticides. But too many exemptions have been allowed, as the European Food Safety Authority has revealed. It needs to be addressed. More generally, the development of the new Common Agricultural Policy should be used to encourage states to safeguard pollinators as part of their strategic plans. This is also in the economic interest of farmers, as 76% of European food production depends on insect pollination, which represents an estimated value of EUR 15 billion.

Viable bees and pollinators are vital for us humans, for our food production and for our ecosystems. We know that these little animals play by far the most crucial role on our planet. It's really quite simple: without pollinators, no food. Three quarters of what is produced and ends up on our plates depends on viable pollinators. Taste it, for real, and feel! Three-quarters!

We will do everything we can: it is time we started the transition towards a non-toxic society, and it is important to be clear about that.

We need to change, so that it is both sustainable and non-toxic. In fact, we have rules in Europe – you know that, Commissioner – that are to counteract this trend. But they are not followed.

This affects both adults and larvae. And then we really have to ban waivers.

Additionally, the Commission has taken decisive action to ban and restrict the use of neonicotinoids. Two are no longer approved, one cannot be used outdoors, and the Commission will be proposing not to renew the approval of a fourth one. And it is supporting the use of low-risk and non-chemical pesticides. Now, concerning – I think there was a question on emergency authorisations – we have increased scrutiny of these, including proposing decisions preventing two countries from granting contested authorisations. Furthermore, the Commission will continue supporting Member States to ensure the sustainable use of pesticides, and the Commission will be presenting the findings of the refit evaluation of the Pesticides Regulation and the second reports on the implementation of the Sustainable Use Directive early in 2020. And finally, I agree that having an ambitious strategy plan on the CAP is very important in order to deliver on our own ambitions. Now let me be absolutely clear: the Commission is determined to coordinate and steer a decisive European Union action to stop and reverse pollinator decline. However, the success of this initiative will, critically, depend on the strong engagement of all stakeholders in its implementation. Member States will have an indispensable role in the deployment of effective actions and monitoring systems on the ground, and we look forward to the European Parliament’s strong endorsement of this initiative and the crucial role of Member States in its implementation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 308, "date": "2019-12-17.json", "name": "Tytti Tuppurainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, honourable Members, echoing what you and the Commission have said, let me also conclude by recalling the importance of pollinators for biodiversity, for our food systems and for our well-being.

I’m sure that we all agree that everything must be done to avoid a similar tragic accident happening again.  Animal welfare remains a serious concern for European citizens; 82% of respondents to a Eurobarometer survey on this issue said that improvements are badly needed in farm-animal welfare, and most of them considered that the EU should do more to promote greater awareness of animal welfare, including at international level.  The Council regularly discusses matters related to animal welfare. Over the last six months, the Finnish Presidency has worked very actively on the preparation of Council conclusions on animal welfare. And ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to confirm that the conclusions were adopted by the Council yesterday.  In these conclusions, the Council emphasises the importance of good animal welfare as an integral part of sustainable animal production, and notes the improvements already achieved in the EU. At the same time, the Council acknowledges the need to continue improving the welfare of animals, including during transport over long distances.  On the issue of transport, as a first step, the Council encourages the Commission and the Member States to continue their work on the effective enforcement of the existing legislation, in particular through improved exchange of information between the competent authorities of the Member States, and more active cooperation between different competent authorities in Member States and third countries.  As a further step, the Council invites the Commission to review and update the existing transport legislation to take into account current practical problems and experience of Member States in its enforcement, as well as more recent scientific knowledge and technical developments.  Dear friends, we are all aware that various sensitive issues such as the transport time or the sustainability of trade in live animals may need to be discussed in this context. These are very important questions which certainly deserve thorough consideration in different fora with the contribution of all stakeholders involved.  Finally, regarding international aspects, the Council reaffirms the importance of promoting the welfare of animals globally, given the competition that EU farmers are facing in global trade.  Discussions with our trade partners, and in particular negotiations on free-trade agreements with third countries, offer indeed an excellent opportunity for this. Naturally, this goes hand in hand with our continued efforts at multilateral level to develop standards, guidelines and other activities aimed at achieving good animal welfare practices worldwide, including during long-distance transport, for instance through the World Organisation for Animal Health. Thank you very much, Mr President, for your attention and for this very timely debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 314, "date": "2019-12-17.json", "name": "Stella Kyriakides", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, like you, I was terribly shocked by the news on 24 November that almost 15 000 sheep had drowned when the ship transporting them capsized in the Black Sea port of Midia. It is, after all, our responsibility to ensure that animals are safe and protected during transport. Animal welfare must remain an overriding consideration in our work.  The information provided by the Romanian veterinary authorities who approved the vessel for livestock transport and supervised the dispatch of the animals, was that available space requirements set out in the EU law were fully respected; but, of course, this is of little comfort as we reflect on the losses sustained on that day. The transporters clearly failed in their primary responsibility to protect the animals in their charge throughout the journey. This is a requirement specifically set out in EU legislation and which must be respected. They failed to take adequate precautions to prevent this loss and to protect the animals from the pain and the distress that they suffered before they perished.  This is about the ethical values of our Union. The Commission is working with Member States to improve the conditions of animals during transport. In recent years, we have taken action to improve the situation, particularly at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey, a well-known hotspot for animal welfare issues. Since 2017, we have dedicated staff and resources to tackle this particular problem. Although more can, and must, be done, the results are encouraging. By working closely with veterinary authorities in exporting Members States and Turkey, and with the cooperation of NGOs, we have dramatically reduced the number of consignments that cross the borders during hot periods. Last summer there wasn’t a single incident reported at the border linked to the road transport of animals.  This does not mean that all issues have been resolved. It is nonetheless a signal that we are at least on the right track. We need to maintain a constant dialogue with Member States and stakeholders through the network of animal welfare contact points and the animal welfare platform, and we need to ensure that this dialogue leads to concrete results and actions. Actions on sea transport have also been taken. In the last two years we audited official control arrangements for sea transport of livestock in four Member States, including Romania. For these audits, we saw that the situation is quite worrying. Many arrangements seem to fall well below the standards established by EU law. Our auditors found particular shortcomings concerning the approval of vessels by the authorities. I am well aware that the supervision and approval of vessels for animal transport are indeed challenging tasks. Specific and extensive training is needed to adequately perform them – specialised training that differs from that provided to most veterinarians. The recent incident makes it abundantly clear that even ensuring that facilities are suitable to accommodate animals is no guarantee that the vessel itself is seaworthy, or that its crew is properly trained.  There are also currently no arrangements to inform veterinarian authorities of problems detected by inspectors in other EU countries, and this is something that we are actively working on with the European Maritime Safety Agency to allow for better sharing of information regarding livestock vessels. We have also worked with Member States to improve their checks on livestock vessels, and this process has brought out some improvement in the inspection systems for these vessels.  A further initiative that we have taken is to engage with the countries receiving live animals in order to get information on each consignment. This will provide valuable feedback on the conditions of the animals on arrival, and promote continuous improvement, and of course, as is usual, we have issued recommendations following our audits. We will closely monitor how these are addressed by Member States.  This is a matter that I will follow closely and I will raise with ministers on every occasion. They all need to take action to prevent incidents like the one that happened in Romania from happening again, and I can assure you that I will work with the same focus to improve the conditions of animals transported by sea, as we did to improve the conditions of animals transported by road under the previous Commission.  I can also assure you that I will look at animal welfare as an important part of the Farm to Fork Strategy that I will be presenting in spring 2020 as part of the European Green Deal, and this includes a critical look at the existing rules, including animal transport.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 315, "date": "2019-12-17.json", "name": "Herbert Dorfmann", "mepid": "96787", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the The demise of Queen Hind and the loss of thousands of animals is undoubtedly more than regrettable. But I also expect to hear from the Romanian authorities: what actually happened? Why did this ship go under? Was this ship suitable to transport so many animals? Was it overloaded? Have current animal welfare rules been broken? After all, it does not help if we are constantly calling for new rules on animal welfare and the transport of animals, but on the other hand – and I am very right about this, Commissioner – if we still have situations where the existing law is not sufficiently implemented. I believe that we must call on the Member States to ensure that the right that exists today, which is sharp in Europe, is implemented. The transport of live animals cannot always be prevented. For example, we have to transport farm animals, there are animals that go to the final mast and they have to be transported alive there. But there are already situations in Europe where animals are carved through half of Europe in search of the even cheaper slaughterhouse, and then the carcasses are transported back. Such nonsense, I believe, should be looked at.  I believe that we should transport carcasses wherever possible and non-live animals. We should also do this where special slaughter, in this case slaughter, is demanded by customers. There, too, we must contact the states that then buy these animals, so that we can deliver carcasses that are not live animals, but effectively slaughtered carcasses.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 316, "date": "2019-12-17.json", "name": "Paolo De Castro", "mepid": "96891", "text": "  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although European animal health and welfare standards are among the most advanced globally, we are still discussing accidents that are no longer acceptable when transporting animals.

We need, Commissioner, a careful analysis of what action is needed for the full and uniform application of our animal welfare standards in all Member States. As the Committee on Agriculture, we have already decided to go down this road, not only to reduce the distorting impacts of the possibility that producers within the Union can translate non-application of the rules into competitive advantages. Our farmers, in complying with European standards, incur much higher production costs than their competitors outside the Eu ropean Union, finding themselves victims of unfair competition.

Unnecessary stress and incidents are fixable by legislation and a general change in attitude, if there is a will to do so. There are ways of finding ways, from education to legislation, and the commitment of the Member States is of paramount importance here. Improper handling of animals, such as long journeys, cramping and heat, can be avoided if the animals are in the hands of responsible operators.  Transport to third countries must be under particular surveillance. The starting point must always be that transporting a live animal would be the last option. Sick and injured animals are, of course, a special chapter of their own, and it is transport fitness that is one of the measures of animal welfare. Quality is more important than quantity, as even two hours of poor transport can be harder than double the amount of transport in good conditions.  That is why the density of the slaughterhouse network must also be an issue that is considered, especially in countries with long distances. Animal welfare must be made the main objective of transport, it must be promoted more strongly in finland, and therefore the same standards must also be respected from the slaughterhouse, regardless of the country of origin. We in the EU therefore have every opportunity to make responsible transport a strong competitive advantage in the world food market as well.  In legislation, we must pay attention to two things. Firstly, the existing rules on the transport of animals must be fully implemented in each Member State.

Furthermore, reports from various non-governmental organisations show that there are no animal welfare conditions on board these vessels, such as plant health guarantees which, in the countries receiving these animals, mostly in the Middle East, are often non-existent. In sum, trade around the brutal and inhuman exploitation of these animals can only be regarded as an attack on any so-called \"developed\" society, so there is no other way but to end the export of live animals outside the European Union.

Religious slaughter, therefore, is the reason why animals are transported alive for thousands of kilometres. As we know, these countries require living animals to be able to slaughter them according to a specific religious ritual according to which the animal must be conscious, not dizzy. These long journeys of several days, with endless queues at border crossings outside the European Union, there are inevitably many breaches of the most basic needs of these animals: the inability of animals to drink, lack of food, overloaded trucks and faulty ventilation during heavy heat, litter stained with feces, sick animals that are dying and dying of exhaustion, dehydration and stress , all without any veterinary control from one Member State to another and from one country to another. During transport by boat, sick or dead animals are thrown into the sea once their identification loops are removed, so that there are no traces if the carcass of the animal runs aground on a beach. I would remind you that the current conditions for transporting live animals from the European Union to third countries take place in total illegality, in complete violation of the European regulation, which nevertheless provides for very specific rules in this area.

Most of the measures in Regulation No 17 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation 1/2005 are already implemented and Romania will introduce additional standards to this Regulation, such as increasing the area per animal by 20%, the presence of a veterinarian on board the vessel, limits and daily monitoring of the temperature on the vessel. Today, the Regulation provides only temperature limits for transport only for road transport, not for shipping.  Currently, in Romania there are two legislative proposals in the Romanian Parliament, carried out together with NGOs and international transport experts, which will very strictly regulate the authorisation of shipping vessels.

I also carefully listened to your concerns on the transportation of live animals, and I promise to speak with my colleague, Commissioner Wojciechowski, on this – on how to create better conditions under the CAP.

We, the people of 21st century Europe, are convinced that they certainly have the right to human responsibility for their fate. This conviction commands us to treat them humanely.  The EU prioritises animal welfare, recognising the difficulty of applying its requirements outside the Community. Rules on the transport of animals outside the Union are the competence of national institutions. Millions of animals are transported over long distances between Member States and to third countries each year. Just stop at the border to see the animals crammed there, waiting for hours for their turn to inspect documents and vehicles, in the sun, thirsty for water, rafting each other. Sick, injured and dead animals are found after a few days in the destination countries.  It is justified to take legislative action that will lead to bilateral agreements or a ban on the transport of animals if the standards of the country concerned do not comply with Union law.

We want a more digital Europe and it is crucial that digitisation also passes through the area of health. We need to encourage the use and development of digital media in different approaches to health care and have an integrated vision for improving health care and outcomes in the different Member States and across the European Union. In view of this, the ENVI committee raises some questions, because of their relevance and importance, which should be examined by the Commission, in particular, what does the Commission intend to do to ensure that healthcare professionals have the appropriate digital skills and qualifications? And how does the Commission intend to assist Member States and their regions in disseminating the necessary knowledge and skills by citizens and patients using digital resources in the field of health? How does the Commission intend to ensure patient confidentiality at each stage of the process, and how will it ensure the safety and independence of eHealth and mHealth software? Does the Commission agree that people \"should be at the heart of the health system\" in the course of the changes generated by the digital revolution? And what measures does the Commission intend to take to ensure that citizens have safe access to their data in the decision-making process of healthcare professionals on therapeutic choices and care?  Ensuring the quality of health care and access to health for European citizens is of utmost importance for the European Parliament and, in particular, for the ENVI committee. Health systems currently face major challenges, such as an ageing population, the increased need for health care and the reduction of available resources. Digitisation is thus an ally in responding to these challenges. In the motion for a resolution on the digital transformation of health services and care services, 23 commitments were agreed between the different political groups in close cooperation work. Therefore, we warn against ensuring interoperability, systems must communicate with each other for an improvement in information, time and the guarantee of the support of health professionals and citizens themselves. Currently we have solutions that do not communicate with each other and that reduce the efficiency of the health system.  Cybersecurity is an essential pillar. With the potential of scanning, important security, privacy and data protection issues are raised. Health data are sensitive data and, in this sense, we consider essential a strong focus on the protection, security and privacy of the data and the confidentiality of the data, where the informed consent of citizens is ensured.  In this sense, we consider that anonymization and pseudoanonimization are crucial for the use of health data. We have the opportunity to optimize scientific research, which will allow us to develop policies based on scientific evidence and a better response to the health care provided. It will also contribute to the early detection of threats to public health, resulting in more timely and efficient responses.  But none of this is done without investment. We need investment in better equipment, better networks, better infrastructure, that meet digital needs. It is important to support Member States in the process of digital transformation and modernisation. We need an effective focus on digital solutions, solutions that should meet the real needs of citizens and health professionals, contributing to the accessibility and quality of health care in urban and rural areas. In addition, training should be guaranteed to the different links of the health system, from citizens, patients, caregivers and health professionals, providing easily understood information without leaving anyone behind. I conclude, Madam President and Commissioner, recalling that, for the success of health digitisation, a political commitment is needed at all levels, local, regional, national and European.

We need to have the right means to keep our citizens healthy. Digitalisation can be a game changer in this respect, because it can bring concrete benefits to patients and to healthcare professionals. It has the potential to provide cost—effective, high—quality healthcare and to reduce inequalities. All of us here are committed to fostering the digital transformation of health and care in a way that is inclusive and places the patient at its centre. Health data and how it can be securely shared, in full respect of EU protection standards, is critically important to achieve this transformation. For the patients, we need to ensure that Europe has a framework that supports them and their health providers directly, ensures that citizens have control over their personal data, facilitates research and supports the development of digital medical services, diagnostics and services. You can all rest assured that the creation of a European health data space to promote data exchange and support research will be an important part of my health agenda. To this extent, I will be working closely with the Commissioner for the Internal Market, Thierry Breton, as well as Executive Vice—President Margrethe Vestager and Vice—President Schinas to move forward in this endeavour. The Commission’s vision was first set out in the 2018 communication ‘Enabling the digital transformation of health and care in the Digital Single Market’. The aim is to encourage Member State action on e—health, while ensuring that citizens have secure access to their comprehensive electronic health data everywhere in the EU. Since then, important progress has been made. Earlier this year, for the first time, five Member States began exchanging e—prescriptions and patient summaries through the eHealth Digital Service Infrastructure, supported by the Connecting Europe Facility. Over 5000 e—prescriptions have been dispensed so far, and this clearly shows that we can have continuity of care across boundaries.  The Commission also adopted the Recommendation on a European Electronic Health Record exchange format to improve the ability to share data between systems and enable citizens access to their own electronic health records. These actions will continue as we move ahead with the creation of the EU health data space, supported by the proposed digital Europe programme. Whilst data is a key enabler for digital systems’ transformation, we also need to be aware that it does present a number of challenges. It is essential that data protection and cybersecurity considerations are built in from the design phase, in order to protect patient confidentiality, enable them access to their data safely, and protect the integrity of systems. The Commission has taken a number of important steps on this.  Firstly, patient data is protected and secured through the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation. Secondly, health is one of the key sectors covered in the EU’s first cybersecurity legislation: the Directive on security of network and information systems. Earlier this year, we recommended that Member States develop national digital health networks to bring cybersecurity and the relevant expertise into their digital health systems. Thirdly, we encourage Member States to put in place secure electronic identification or authentication approaches for the health sector. Collectively, these measures will help build trust—based systems. The Commission proposes to underpin them with major investments, and EUR 2 million is foreseen for developing cybersecurity in the EU – including the health sector – as part of the Digital Europe.  Another major challenge that you have mentioned is skills development. Digitisation must reduce inequalities and not create a digital divide. Under the next Multiannual Financial Framework, the Commission is proposing EUR 700 million under Digital Europe for developing advanced digital skills. This will support training for healthcare professionals and help citizens develop digital literacy. The European Social Fund and research programmes will include important projects and programmes to support this. So empowering citizens to manage our own health is a key priority of the digital transformation agenda, and over the next five years, I hope to be working with Member States to ensure that Europe makes real progress on digital health. Finally, our progress on digital health and data exchange and research under the European Health Data Space will be important for the successful delivery of our other health priorities, such as our Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan. I hope that you will be here with us, because we will be launching this plan together on 4 February 2020 with you in the European Parliament. We are therefore fully committed to supporting this transition and making the most of the potential of e-health. I really look forward to working closely with you on this important issue.

I agree with you, if we allow the digital transformation of health and care in the digital single market, then we will take the quality of healthcare and also the availability of health services in the European Union to a higher level.  Of course, there are a number of related issues to be remembered when it comes to privacy, security and data protection. I consider the idea of creating a European health data area to facilitate the transfer of health data and to support research into prevention, treatments, medicines and shared outcomes to be very beneficial. We want to support patients more effectively, provide them with better information and help them to better orient themselves in the health system, their rights and also in the health services provided. In this respect, an appropriate way of ensuring access to and sharing of personal health data should be found, facilitating communication between health service providers and other organisations in each Member State. Commissioner, it is important that the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and the relevant regional authorities, also focuss on educating citizens on the use of digital healthcare.

Club – Dear Chairman, there is consensus that digital technologies have the potential to significantly improve European health. Nevertheless, health institutions find it difficult to decide on changes in procedures and business. Furthermore, many healthcare professionals view digital technologies with suspicion, fearing that they will increase their workload or lead them to misdiagnoses.  On the other hand, patients show far more enthusiasm for new technologies, but this does not apply to all demographic groups. IT literacy is an indomitable barrier for a large part of the elderly population. Statistics show that 14% of adult Europeans did not use the internet in 2016, while a third of adults said they did not know how to access the internet via mobile phone.  Despite the progress and wealth of the European Union, a significant part of the population is not IT literate, which certainly contributes to skepticism towards digital solutions in health care. Furthermore, this also opens up the possibility of misuse of data and other unintended consequences. As a doctor, I had a case where a patient fainted with shock and fear because a misplaced digital blood pressure gauter showed her blood pressure was 0.  In conclusion, I believe that raising IT literacy among healthcare professionals and users is key to the successful digitisation of European health.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 361, "date": "2019-12-17.json", "name": "Véronique Trillet-Lenoir", "mepid": "197593", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew Group. Madam President, Commissioner, you are right to point out that it is crucial for the European Union to have a strategy to support digital transformation in the health field. The digitalization of health systems allows considerable progress in many areas: the field of prevention, with connected objects; the field of care, with telemedicine; public health, I am thinking, for example, of the management of shortages, and the problem of research, particularly in the area of cancer. Our group wishes to stress, in the field of digitalisation, three essential points: data privacy, data sharing and interoperability between the different Member States and, of course, the ethical dimension. However, these three ambitions are not necessarily very easy to combine. For example, we need to find the balance between the anonymization of data, on the one hand, and their sharing by different health actors, on the other. The balance must be struck between data protection and the absolute need for scientific research to dispose of big data. A very sad illustration of this was given by the sale of medical data to GAFAM from poorly secured sites. Commissioner, we expect a lot from the European health data area to help us solve this problem. The balance must be struck between decision-making algorithms and the need to preserve the human dimension of medicine. We have to find the balance between a certain empowerment of patients, you mentioned, but also the weakening of patients vis-à-vis infox. Finally, and above all, as the previous speaker pointed out, it is necessary to ensure that what is technological progress for some does not become a pitfall for others, because they are too old, too isolated or have too poor a level of education.

Health issues are part of the national policy of each Member State, of course, but if we want the systems to be interoperable between Member States, it is necessary for a single European format of computer data exchange to be developed. This includes patient records, electronic prescriptions, laboratory results, medical imaging, hospital discharge reports. In order to make this Europe of health, we must first of all provide financial assistance to Member States which do not yet have sufficient digital development, set a timetable and concrete objectives, and improve the information of the European patient on the price of medicines in the European Union. This is all the more important for patients with rare diseases who need treatment in a Member State other than their own.

Digital transformation is a huge opportunity to improve the quality of services provided, to focus response systems on users' needs and to provide more universal access to health services and, in particular, to more advanced technological and scientifically advanced responses. It is a priority to develop inclusion networks that form and endit users with the knowledge and tools necessary for universal and informed participation.  Access systems must therefore be easy to use, interoperable and protected through mechanisms and tools provided or regulated by public entities. Another priority is to promote data sharing securely in the cross-border context. More data allows better responses for more people. The progressive digitisation of many health response processes and systems is also an opportunity to improve the effectiveness of partnerships between the various actors in the system, including between private actors and public actors. The European Union should launch the ambitious generalised training programme, crossing accessibility to high definition networks with skills for their use. It is a priority to ensure a model for capturing and making data available in a safe manner for research, ensuring a fair distribution of the gains made from this process.
