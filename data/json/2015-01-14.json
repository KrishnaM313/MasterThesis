Dear Vice Presidents, Dear Commissioners, I am honoured to be here in Strasbourg today and to present the priorities of the Latvian Presidency to the Council of the European Union. Today is 25 years since Latvia regained its independence by getting rid of the Soviet totalitarian regime. Ten years have passed since Latvia joined the European Union and a year since membership of the euro zone. To take up the presidency in the Council of the European Union is not only a great honour, but also a great responsibility. How much this responsibility is, we felt particularly clearly on 7 January, which shook us all to the very foundations. I would therefore like to begin by expressing my solidarity and deepest condolences to France and to the French people. The attack in France is another attack on freedom of expression and European values. On Sunday I took part in a march in Paris. People of all nationalities, religions and cultures took to the streets in France and in the vast world to affirm aloud: we stand for values in a democratic world, for free self-expression of man, for the coexistence of peaceful cultures and religions. That is why I am using this Forum for representation of the peoples of Europe to call on each of us and every citizen to have even greater respect for another culture and for a new level of trust between peoples. At this time of tension, when terrorism would like to impose ever more escalation, growing clashes between religions, pushing us into violence, we need to be even more human. We must continue to be interested in other cultures so that our minds cannot be blurred by demagogy or a crooked interpretation of the facts. The European Union must be prepared to defend itself, its citizens and its values. All of us, all the Institutions of the European Union and all The Member States must join forces to ensure an adequate response from the European Union to the challenge that has been thrown at the european model of living together and, consequently, to all of us. From 2 to 4 May, a large forum dedicated to World Press Freedom Day will be held in Riga, where a wide exchange of views on the issues that are currently in place will be possible. We must have all the mechanisms at the disposal of the European Union in place for the fight against terrorism. Particular attention should be paid to the forthcoming European internal security strategy. For our range of instruments to be complete, it is important for all of us to ensure an effective exchange of information between the services involved. It is highly appreciated that the discussion on passenger name record (PNR) has been renewed. It is both site and time correct. We are talking here about a limited amount of data that would allow better tracking of certain movements of individuals. I am aware that this is an unequivocal issue. I would therefore like to assure you that, despite progress in the discussions on the creation of a passenger name record, the Latvian Presidency will continue to promote the Data Protection Pack as one of the key elements in the context of the digital priority. I am convinced that the European Parliament will be a close cooperation partner for the Council and the Commission, because only together will we be able to deliver a strong European Union response. I trust that Europe will be able to show unity and overcome these threats. I believe that we will not fall into the trap and allow terrorism to destroy our faith in each other, let us not allow people of different origins or religions to be put against each other in European society. Together, we will be able to safeguard European values. The future of Europe depends on this. Honourable Members, i would like to thank the Rapporteur for his excellent work. Latvia is holding the Presidency in a difficult and challenging time. The start of the Latvian Presidency coincides with the successful completion of the institutional transition into the European Union. We appreciate the work done by the Italian Presidency and the European Parliament and will continue to work to improve cooperation between all the institutions of the European Union. The impact of the financial crisis is still being felt in the European Union. The Member States and the Institutions of the European Union have worked hard to restore confidence in the financial markets. Member States are still continuing structural reforms. Europe is slowly but gradually returning to economic growth. This year, economic growth is forecasting in all Member States of the European Union. The European Union remains the world's largest economy with strong high-tech positions. The overall deficit level of the euro area countries continues to decline. However, this is also a good time to create a system that is resilient to potential challenges in the future. The euro area is expanding with new Member States. I would like to congratulate our neighbour Lithuania on joining the euro area by becoming its 19th member. The citizens of the European Union enjoy a level of freedom and prosperity that is denied to citizens in many other countries of the world. I am convinced that through targeted action, a belief in European values and a willingness to work together, the European Union is able to face up to the challenges, overcome the challenges and move forward. In these turbulent times for the European continent, it is important to remember that the European Union has brought peace and confidence to its people. All too often, we take it for granted. Honourable Members, i would like to thank the Rapporteur for his excellent work. The citizens of the European Union are interested in concrete results that improve their daily lives. We can only achieve this by working together : the Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission. A great deal of work was done over the past year to formulate its priorities for the new institutional cycle for the European Institutions. We want to work on their implementation, while paying attention to the new challenges. The Latvian Presidency has outlined three clear lines of priorities: a competitive European Union, a digital European Union, an involved European Union at global level. Honourable Members, i would like to thank the Rapporteur for his excellent work. Firstly, we want to strengthen the competitiveness of the European Union and promote economic growth. Structural reforms, fiscal responsibility and investment are the 'three whales' on which the European Union's growth must be built in the coming years. Growth that provides new jobs instead of imposing new debts on future generations. We welcome the Investment Plan proposed by the President of the European Commission. We are ready to work actively for the European Fund for Strategic Investments to start operations in June. Yesterday, the Commission's proposal came out. We look forward to good cooperation with the Member States and the European Parliament to ensure a smooth legislative process. Creating an attractive environment for investment is our common responsibility. For a long time, there has been a need for an energy union in Europe. We need an energy policy based on solidarity, trust and security, better integrated energy infrastructure and more efficient governance. The creation of an Energy Union will be one of the priority issues during the Latvian Presidency. We will also continue to work on the completion of the single market, ensure coordination of the European semester processes within the Council. During the Latvian Presidency, we will review the Europe 2020 strategy, promote work on industrial competitiveness, work on strengthening Economic and Monetary Union. Let us pay particular attention to better regulation. Secondly, we want to make Europe more digitised. We want to make full use of Europe's digital potential and work on the creation of an effective digital single market. Online consumers should have equal access to goods and services at the best price, whether they live in Brussels or Bratislava, Riga or Rome. The security and reliability of the digital environment should also be promoted. This will help create jobs and boost growth, and transform Europe into the world's leading knowledge-based economy. We intend to work on a Digital Single Market strategy and we are expecting a concrete Commission proposal shortly. The Digital Programme Assembly in Riga will be a great opportunity to meet policymakers and business. The main elements of the Digital Single Market are data protection and balanced reforms in the telecommunications market. We will also focus on cybersecurity and consumer rights. Thirdly, we want to see the European Union more involved and accountable at international level. We will support the High Representative and the European External Action Service by strengthening the unity of the European Union and promoting regional stability and peace. Europe's neighbours will be a priority for our Presidency. We will support the work on the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy. It is only natural that our main focus is on the East, but we will also work equally seriously on issues that are important to our neighbours in the South. The challenges of migration will be on our agenda. We will not be able to avoid negotiations on unprecedented events in our eastern neighbourhood. Russia's aggression against Ukraine is a threat to the foundations of European peace and the rule of law. It is completely excluded that the European Union will recognise the strongest rights that violate the territorial integrity of states. The strength of the European Union lies in the unity of action. In this context, I would like to thank the Member States and the Institutions of the European Union for their ability to remain united when decisions had to be taken on the European Union's response to events in Ukraine and Russian aggression. For many in the world, this is a surprise. The Latvian Presidency will actively work to keep this unity of the European Union unchanged. The Eastern Partnership summit will be held in Riga in May this year. The Riga Summit will make it possible to assess progress since the Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius. This must serve as a clear signal that the European Union supports the countries of the Eastern Partnership. We also need to look more broadly at the Central Asia region, where the presence and involvement of the European Union does not reach its full potential. We will be actively working to review the European Union's Central Asia Strategy. Strengthening the European Union's international role includes and global aspects. We will help to facilitate trade agreements with the United States, Canada and Japan. The ambitious transatlantic trade and investment partnership would not only bring more than €100 billion in benefits and stimulate the European Union's economy, but would also bring geopolitical benefits. 2015 is the European Year of Development. We will focus on the European Union's contribution to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Targets for 2015. The Latvian Presidency will work on shaping the common security and defence policy in line with global challenges.  Honourable Members, i would like to thank the Rapporteur for his excellent work. The aim of the Latvian Presidency is to build a competitive, digital and more internationally stronger Europe. Our aim is to safeguard the area of European values, freedom, security, justice and mutual tolerance that characterises Europe in the world. It is important for us to work in close cooperation with you. This is the main reason for my visit today: to strengthen our cooperation and to build a coherent agenda for the Council and the European Parliament. The Latvian Presidency is pragmatic and determined. The sparkstone that we have chosen as the logo of our Presidency was once an essential element of innovation. This brought about a major change for households across Europe. For me, the sparkstone means prosperity, stability and energy. I would like the Latvian Presidency to be associated with these values. We want to strengthen the European Union's progress towards development, strengthen faith in the European idea and inspire us to growth wise and far-sighted, to people close to Europe.

Mr President, Madam Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached a crucial moment in the recent history of the European Union. This is Latvia, which was not foreseeable, taking over the Presidency of the European Union. And already, as we quickly forget, we find this quite normal, obvious and natural, when it is a small miracle. Thirty years ago, no one in this Chamber or anywhere else could have imagined that Latvia would be responsible for presiding over the destiny of the European Union. As I said yesterday, this is a great moment in European history, since the Latvian Presidency perfectly symbolizes the reconciliation between European history and geography, thus putting an end to this disastrous post-war decree which called for Europe to be divided into two parts for the rest of history. The Latvians escaped the diktat of history and dictated the way forward to history. Therefore, the whole of Europe, the whole continent is indebted to Latvia, which is a great people and a great nation.  A week ago, we started the Latvian journey to Riga as the Commission travelled there to discuss with the Latvian Prime Minister and Ministers the work programme of the Latvian Presidency. This programme of the Latvian Presidency has all the support of the Commission, if only for the reason that the Latvian Presidency programme and the European Commission's work programme are strictly identical. This proves how good will and noble inspiration can be combined in Europe to ensure that Europe can move forward.  To enable the Latvian Presidency to work in good conditions, the Commission yesterday agreed on legislation and regulations in relation to the establishment of the European Fund for Strategic Investments. It is a piece of legislation that is characterized by the fact that it has to be part of special circumstances, because we have no time to waste. I would therefore call, as I did two weeks ago, our Latvian friends, as well as your Parliament, to speed up the work to enable the Strategic Fund to find its place in the arsenal of combating the crisis so that it can be operational by 1 July 2015.  In the aftermath, the Commission yesterday decided on a communication on the flexibility of and in the Stability and Growth Pact. I have just read the first articles in the international press and it gives me the opportunity to say that the Stability and Growth Pact remains the Stability and Growth Pact. We have not changed the rules. We have not made the Stability and Growth Pact a flexibility pact. It is not a flexibility pact, it is a stability and growth pact based on what I have described as a virtuous triangle of structural reforms, fiscal consolidation, which remains vital, and the revival of investment in Europe, so that we can have a growth situation in Europe that allows us to stimulate employment. Like the Latvian Presidency, the Commission attaches great importance to digital Europe. During the current semester, we will make the first proposals in this direction and I am planning to discuss digital Europe at the college meeting on 25 February.  We do not remain inactive with regard to the Energy Union. Rather, it is the Energy Union that will enrich the agenda of 25 February, with digital Europe scheduled for June. We were asked by the European Council in October to deepen economic and monetary union. Under the leadership of the President of the Commission, there will be a report by the four Presidents, the Eurogroup, the European Central Bank, the Commission and the European Council. We will present the first ideas in February, to deepen them until June. Parliament is obviously involved in the work of the four Presidents, since the Presidency of Parliament, which represents one of the main institutions of the Union, has its full role to play. Here, Madam President, Mr President, are a few remarks inspired by the Latvian Prime Minister's brief presentation. I am convinced that the Latvian Presidency and the Commission will be able to work closely together if not in complete complicity. Good luck!", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2015-01-14.json", "name": "Manfred Weber", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Prime Minister Straujuma, I would like to thank the President of the Commission for his work on the A warm welcome to the European Parliament and thank you for joining us, for presenting the latvian Presidency's programme. Latvia is a role model, a young country that has had to fight hard for its freedom and democracy, a country that knows the value of freedom of expression and freedom of the press and that this is not self-evident, and a country whose history reflects the core of the European Union, namely the pursuit of freedom, peace and shared prosperity. Especially at a time – as you pointed out – when we are being asked new questions in Paris, this reminder of the fundamental character of your country and of the fundamental character of our European Union is important. That is why there is hope that Latvia will take over the presidency. A second idea that suits the country and our current situation in Europe, namely that your country knows difficult times. In 2009, Latvia's economy collapsed with a 14 percent decline in economic power, and an economic tsunami swept across your country. Today, Latvia is back on a growth path. Gross domestic product has increased in recent years, in the next few years it looks even better in the forecast for your country's growth data, and unemployment is falling in Latvia. In this context, in difficult economic times, Latvia is also a glimmer of hope for the European Union as to how to get it right, how to build a real future. I would like to thank you for the objectivity with which you, Prime Minister Straujuma, have also presented the programme. The objectivity of working on the topics is the way to convince people that we are going to work. We in Europe, too, are now, after the phase of constitution – after we have put the Commission into office, the elections have been completed – now, in 2015, we are on our way back to the normal working process. The Latvian Presidency has an important role to play in this. You have mentioned security in creating a Europe of security. As the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we support you on the way to tackling the PNR issue. I would also ask you once again to take a close look at what we have already decided and also to promote, at the European Council meetings as a whole, that the existing measures should also be implemented and implemented. You mentioned the investment package. We are linking this to the reform agenda that is needed in the Member States. You referred to the Digital Agenda, a mega-theme of our time. I would like to thank you for saying clearly that you want to focus on the data protection regulation, that the data protection regulation, which is already on the table, which we are already legising, where we in the European Parliament have found a large majority for the data protection regulation, for the joint decision, is also moving in the Council and that we will soon really get fruitful discussions. , that is a matter of great concern to us. I would also like to combine the ambition of us Europeans that the European voice is heard in the global debate on how we deal with big data, how we deal with digitalisation. The European voice must be that not only freedom applies on the Internet, but that we want to set rules on the net, to protect our citizens on the net. You have mentioned competition, the internal market. I would like to take this up again, including the clear statement on TTIP, support for TTIP, in so far as we also have a discussion in Europe about social Europe, about the social cushioning of our citizens. For my group, it is important that we have the social debate. However, I would also like to say that the most important thing to create social security in Europe is to guarantee our citizens jobs. It is social to create work. This is the most important principle for creating social justice. That is why all the measures that strengthen the economy are also social policy. The last thought I want to raise is the Neighbourhood Policy, Russia – you mentioned it. Thank you for the clarity. Europe must stand together and continue on a common path together. The start is good, the Presidency has started well, the priorities are set correctly. Putting the citizens first, as you do, is the right accent these days.

If, faced with the threat of terrorism, we choose to perch, then fear will prevail, if we choose to associate security and freedom, if we do not agree to distort our open society, based on integration, then we will make hope prevail. Europe is the land of human rights and fundamental freedoms if Europe abandons these values and betrays itself, so we want to respond to the demand for the protection of our citizens by remaining true to ourselves.  We need a new approach to security, europe's security is not just played out within our national borders – as you said very well. When war, for the first time since the 1970s, faces the borders of Europe, one cannot think of remaining with one's hands in one's hands! Your Presidency must push to overcome the resistance of the Member States and build a regional strategy that will wipe out terrorist forces in Syria, Iraq and Libya. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is also a breeding ground for radicalism. We ask you to support the efforts made by Vice-President Federica Mogherini to make Europe really play a mediating role.  We must also make better use of the data provided by the Schengen system in order to be able to identify foreign fighters. Let me be quite clear on this point: Schengen is not touched! There is no need to modify it, but only to apply it well! If you touch Schengen, you touch on the principle of freedom of movement within the European Union, which is a pillar of Europe.  On PNR, here too with the utmost clarity: we do not have negative ideological prevention, but our polar stars, which should be everyone's, remain valid, the protection of fundamental freedoms and human rights. If we do not want to give in to fear, we must also return to talk – as Mr Weber did – about social justice, five years of austerity have depressed our societies: yesterday was a good day for Europe, for the first time with the decisions of the European Union – I thank Mr Juncker, because he was once again speaking! – the conditions have been created for a change in economic policy.

Man tiešām ir liels saviļņojums runāt latviešu valodā tik svarīgā jautājumā šodien. Pirms 25 gadiem, pirms vienas paaudzes, daudzi no mums nevarētu iedomāties, ka šāds notikums varētu būt šodien šeit, Strasbūrā. Tādēļ es novēlu Latvijas prezidentūrai sekmes — esmu pārliecināts, ka tā būs — gan tajos jautājumos, kas jau ir ilgi plānoti, gan saistībā ar reakciju uz tādiem notikumiem kā notikumi Parīzē. Es domāju, ka prezidentūra būs ļoti veiksmīga. Dažām lietām, kas man liekas ļoti akcentējamas, es gribētu šodien arī pieskarties daudz dziļāk. Mr President, in this House we all care about growth and prosperity and the development of our economies. When we ask ourselves what could be the strongest instrument in, say, making transparent progress on TTIP – which is important not only from a geopolitical point of view and for the development of western values, but also for economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic, and of course in Europe – it will, I think, create more sustainable growth in Europe, if it is a successful process, than the Strategic Investment Plan – perhaps necessary but a bit ad hoc – which was approved yesterday by the Commission. I would like to point out that the Presidency has to work on this plan for six months to turn it into a reality. I do not want to go into too many details, but there are still a lot of questions about this investment plan. One of my main worries is that profitability-driven investment can create more disparities in the European Union than there are now and may perhaps cause a younger generation of Europeans to move to the most developed Member States in the future. We have to be very careful about such outcomes. The second issue, of course, is Russia and Ukraine. There have been some comments from responsible persons saying that we cannot impose more and more sanctions on Russia and that the only way to stop the madness is via negotiations. But when we talk about how we can help in dealing with negotiations in a situation of madness, the only way is to tell the mad ones what they want to hear and make promises that work on it, not in our favour. We can ask European citizens if this is what they expect from our behaviour as politicians in Europe or we can ask the Ukrainians if they are happy with European partners who just want to implement the Minsk Agreement and then quickly remove all the sanctions. But what about the rule of law, and behaviour which is not compatible with the 21st century; what about compliance with international treaties, and what about Crimea in that case? I believe there is an alternative option. An ʽengaged Europeʼ, which is also a priority of the Latvian Presidency, means that we will show solidarity with the Ukrainian nation and government. A stable, democratic and free Ukraine is a very good example for other Eastern Partnership countries to show that European values are real values. Eastern Partnership countries can choose this way – the western way – rather than its opposite, the Eurasian Union way, and it is I think very important that we understand this. Let us be under no illusions: the weaker the EU’s actions, the stronger the Eurasian Union will become. Coming back to values, the millions who marched in Paris in solidarity against terror last weekend, on Sunday, showed that European values are values for citizens and that we have to hold on to them very proudly and very strongly in the case of the situation in Ukraine too and in other Eastern Partnership member countries, and in our relationship with Russia.

ALDE fully shares all of these objectives. But how serious are priorities if there is such a huge backlog in the Council, so many legislative proposals still pending and so many blocked for many, many years? The Council is a bit like the Bermuda triangle. We send in a legislative proposal and it disappears, never to be heard of any more. We do not want any more grand designs for the future; we need action. Do not talk about an investment plan but put your money where your mouth is, quite literally. Do not talk about the digital economy: just adopt the telecoms package and the data protection package. No lip service to security and law enforcement: just adopt the Europol Regulation. Do not talk about democracy: just adopt the Transparency Regulation. Let us stop talking and deliver. The Council is a legislator, so legislate. If no agreement can be found on a proposal then the Council should simply decide to reject it and not keep it pending for ever. ALDE welcomes the special summit on the security package next month, and we consider that sharing information must be the first priority. It must be stepped up drastically. It should never happen again that attacks take place and we realise afterwards that the killers were known to the intelligence services. That is unacceptable. We build a huge haystack of personal data but information is not being shared and information that is not being shared is useless information. ALDE wants real security for citizens, not fake security and politics of symbolism. On the particular issue of PNR, the facts are that PNR data are being collected and shared in Europe today. They are available to law enforcement and security authorities, so I can reassure those who are worried about that. But there is no proper legislative framework with all the required legal safeguards. A vote was taken in Parliament in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposals of the Commission and they were deemed inadequate, so now the ball is firmly in the court of the Commission and the Council. They should present a revised proposal and adopt the Data Protection Directive as quickly as possible and not just ask Parliament to vote again and again on identical proposals until they get the outcome that is to their liking. We should not make the same mistake as in 2005 when we adopted the Data Retention Directive under great pressure and it was subsequently scrapped by the courts last year, as we know. We cannot afford to be sloppy again, in particular when it is about our security. What irritates me, President Juncker, is that in the meantime, in the absence of an agreement on PNR, the Commission is simply pushing ahead, funding the creation of an EU PNR with EU money and creating a fait accompli. I wonder if this is the Commission’s idea of better law-making. I would call it legislation by stealth. Finally, I would call on the Latvian Presidency to make the adoption of the horizontal Anti-Discrimination Directive an absolute priority, Madam Prime Minister. Finally adopting a European law on equal treatment after so many years would really be the best possible answer to the homophobic and derogatory remarks of the President of Latvia on LGBTI people and the EuroPride event in June this year in Riga.

Madam Prime Minister, I listened carefully to your speech on the objectives of the Latvian Presidency. I have not heard you mention the word 'cohesion' once. I didn't hear you say a word about the risk of deflation. You have not once spoken of the alarming increase in unemployment and poverty within the European Union and in the euro area.  A day after the Commission's decision on some flexibility in the implementation of the Stability Pact – which, Mr Pittella, does not make it 'smart', just might make it less 'stupid', as Mr Pronti said – I did not hear you, Prime Minister, take a position. Do you think that investment should be excluded from the calculation of the Member States' deficit in order to boost growth? The theory that with harsh one-sided austerity, with cuts in wages, pensions and the social state will come investment is being tested for six years and has been disproved. Investment in the euro area is 15% less than it was in 2009. How will this development come about? On the Juncker package, you said, in general, that we support it. I have repeatedly said, on behalf of our group, that we consider it insufficient and we also consider the 1-to-15 leverage on which it is based to be unrealistic. But you, here, represent the Council. You have to tell us how you support it. Will the Council ask the Member States to pay extra resources, fresh money? How much and by what criteria? Where will the Investments of the Juncker Package go? Will they go to the countries facing the biggest problems of recession, unemployment, de-investment? Or \"business as usual\"?  I come to foreign policy for a moment. I listened with concern to a statement by the Latvian Foreign Minister that you would \"break\" the stereotypes in relations with Russia. What's that supposed to mean? The European Union needs to provide solutions where there are tensions along the path of politics and diplomacy. We have an interest in defuse this tension. To build peaceful relations based on the values and rules of democracy.  With regard to TTIP, apart from the fact that you strongly support it, what do you respond to objections to opacity and to those who disagree and say that the way they are preparing it will abolish pillars of European law for the benefit of multinationals?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Prime Minister, welcome to this House. I have listened to you carefully and I have heard a language that I hear here every day. In the five years that I have been a Member of this Parliament, I have heard about budgetary responsibility, structural reforms and investment. With regard to investment, it is clear that this Commission has taken a serious look at it. But the rest - fiscal responsibility and structural reforms - is a common language and the objective of all these measures is the same: growth.  I would like to look at this growth for two minutes. If we look at 1985-2008, the 25 years before the financial crisis, what do we see? We have had an average annual growth rate of 2% in Europe and the OECD tells us that, over the past quarter of a century, we have seen a concomitant increase in inequality in Europe. But since the crisis, there is at least one European country, the one that has provided us with the current President of the European Council, which has a somewhat exceptional growth performance. This is Poland, with an average annual growth of 2.7% since the financial crisis. However, in Poland, the employment rate has not increased - 2.7% annual growth and no increase in the employment rate.  So let's see what happens in the United States, which grew by 5% last year. What do we see? 5% growth and a decrease in unemployment. However, the US Bureau of Statistics tells us: \"Unemployment is falling not because the unemployed find work, but because they leave the statistics because they have given up looking for work\". In other words, the employment rate is not increasing in the United States. And what about wages? Will they increase? Not at all, wages are falling!  With the recipes you are advocating, what do we see? That the problem is not solved and that inequality and poverty are increasing - 25% poverty and social exclusion in Europe. So I wonder when you say we have to go back to growth. I am glad to hear that this is the case in Europe, but - I have been wearing glasses for some time and they may not be good - I am not watching it, or it is a growth behind the comma.

Because, in most cases, the interests of the small Presidency are completely different from those of the major States of the Union, and we pretend that this is not the case. Because that small state is still a player in the big area of interest, which also formulates the agenda according to foreign fashions. And most importantly, the agendas of the Presidency of the European Union as a whole have one feature: they are extremely bureaucratic, they are extremely formal, and their decisions are never implemented.  Colleagues, we should recognise that the European Security Strategy, based solely on stability at the eastern borders of the European Union, is obsolete, and today we need a new strategy for living and surviving in the world of escalating conflicts. A strategy that is much more effective, inclusive and conciliating. Consensus, not a counter-evoked strategy. A strategy of peace and trust. Colleagues, jobs and growth need to be created. However, first of all, we should focus on creating a single energy market in the European Union as soon as possible, because it is a guarantee not only in the case of natural or economic, but also in the case of military or terrorist cataclysms. With regard to neighbourhood policy, I believe that we should focus not only on individual countries, but we should focus on neighbourly relations. It is the consensus with the state, its politician, every person, regardless of language, nationality or place of residence, the color of his skin or the religion he professes, that is the guarantee of our continued peaceful coexistence.

It is precisely strengthening cooperation links with these countries that will contribute to economic growth and job creation, not only within the European Union, but also in the region concerned. Our help is urgent to be able to meet the challenges of terrorism, border security and drug smuggling in the regions. Transport projects, energy and proactive European Union action in the search for new common lines of action are also crucial. Already today, this region has earned the attention of the world's major powers. China successfully develops trade links, becoming the most strategically important outlet for natural resources. Following the departure of NATO forces from Central Asia, Russia has increased its military presence in the region. America's interest in the region in the name of its stability and security is very high.  Therefore, in order to promote and expand cooperation with this region so important for Europe, we must be able to offer an individual cooperation mechanism to each of our partners. We must be able to seize every opportunity to strengthen and increase the reputation and reputation of the European Union in the region. We need to strengthen mutual trust.

Of course, these are jobs, and that is also security. The question is, how can we achieve these objectives? Much has been said by Mrs Straujuma in the context of the objectives of the Latvian Presidency. I would like to emphasise one other point.  On competitiveness. Of course, Europe must increase its competitiveness. But how to do it? The simple key is to break down the existing barriers. We know that in the digital market, including in the markets for goods and services, we have a shake-up, we have all sorts of restrictions. By breaking down these barriers, we will increase Europe's competitiveness. Secondly, we need to encourage investment. That is what we must do, of course. How to do it? In my opinion, the Juncker Commission's plan to free up private capital so that it flows back into our economy is the best proposal I have ever heard in a long time. The latvian Presidency's task is to bring this plan from the level of the idea to reality in order to free up private capital for investment. This will create jobs for us. And what about security? In safety, we have two aspects that are very important. One thing the Paris events remind us very well is internal security, security against terrorism. And here it is important for Member States to stick together, exchange information and work together to address these potential threats to our citizens. But there is also external security, where perhaps the biggest factor at the moment is energy security. This European Energy Union must be created.

The Council is amending legislation and negotiating, and none of that is assessed. There is no impact assessment.

You speak for a country – I think, with deserved pride – that has shown that you can overcome difficulties yourself, even if you make an effort, that you can get the sound financing of the budget, that you can get growth back, even if you are in trouble.

There are two roles in which the Presidency can position itself in this process. One of them is to become a simple moderator who accepts and entertains guests, organizes events. Well, this role is not bad, but I think that the Presidency must still have its vision for the future. It must show initiative, make efforts to bring this vision to life. There are many problems that Latvia could pay close attention to. In my opinion, combating unemployment, social exclusion and inequality could be at the heart of this Presidency. There are currently 24.6 million people in the EU who do not have a job. 25% of Europeans are at risk of poverty. And, for example, in my country, Latvia, 35% of the population lives in poverty. It would therefore be logical for Latvia to take on an additional engine role in solving this common problem by using the role of the Presidency. And a few more words about the Europe 2020 strategy. An ambitious target of 20 million people living in poverty was set at 20 million over a decade. Almost half of the time has passed to realise the strategy's objectives, but unfortunately the results still do not give rise to optimism.

We are talking about unemployment and development, we prefer to talk about development and not about growth: the great investment plan presented by Juncker is hailed by the Italian Presidency as a victory is, in fact, a bluff! Few resources, by the way, distracted by other chapters of expenditure and no concrete idea of development.  If we want to give Europe a future and really combat unemployment, we must give the territories the opportunity to invest. However, the long-awaited document on flexibility has not solved anything: the regions are unable to spend the money because of the noose of the Stability Pact which, let us say, has not been taken away. That is why we are asking you for a strong commitment, at least the cofinancing of the funds is being decomputed from the Stability Pact.  There is also a great deal to be done in the environmental field: the European Union has decided to curb the reduction of gas emissions and the construction of a greener and more resource-efficient economy. With what credibility are we going to Paris? With what credibility we can ask other countries, especially developing countries, to do more to combat global warming. I am also thinking of what is happening in the Mediterranean, where the oil race is divided, on drilling, the European Union is leaving the Member States carte blanche, and that is a great hypocrisy. So much is done for sustainable fishing, but if it is the drilling rigs that pollute and destroy the Mediterranean, what is Europe doing? Turn the other way! This hypocrisy also jeopardises important strategies, such as the strategy of the Adriatic-Ionian region.  Policies like this are important, yet in the Adriatic Croatia does?

And the series of measures that we have managed to take with the EU's interior ministers to increase the security of all of us and to ensure good cooperation between the judicial authorities. I've read your program and I can see how complex it is. As you said, they have made a huge commitment and this is very commendable. I would like this commitment to be fully discharged. I would like to highlight one point from this: the digital market. This rapid adaptation, which you mentioned, is very important in the digital market. The digital market is a huge reserve for the European Union. According to one study, €520 billion could be added to the GDP of the 28 countries, a tighter internal market, a better functioning internal market. It's a huge reserve right now. Not exploiting this opportunity is a mistake. I think that the programme of the presidency of the semester should be focused, and many others, of course, on exploiting this potential. During this period, all countries need this explicitly. I urge the Prime Minister to take the necessary steps and make suggestions. \\*(The speaker agrees to answer a 'Blue Card' question (Article 162(8) of the Rules of Procedure).)", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 54, "date": "2015-01-14.json", "name": "Krisztina Morvai (NI)", "mepid": "96661", "text": "  Blue card question. - Dear Fellow Member, He praised the significant achievements of Latvia, who joined the European Union at the same time as our Hungary, as a common country.

Your predecessor, Mr Dombrovskis, has proven that this is doable, and that austerity and growth are not exclusive but are actually complementary. Your task is to resist attempts to transform the Stability Pact into a sort of flexibility pact. It is crucial for Latvia to keep the EU united in relations with Ukraine and Russia, because our unity and consistency are the only means to enhance the EU’s political impact and moral credibility. Even limited sanctions have had a greater effect than expected. Now there is a temptation to relax them, even before the Minsk Agreements have been fully implemented. I think this is, above all, a battle of nerves, and I trust that Latvians have got strong nerves. One of the Latvian priorities should be to overcome the fragmentation of the digital single market. The EU needs an ambitious strategy on clearing the main bottlenecks like data protection, authors’ rights, applying common European sales law, achieving agreements on the telecom single market, and the rest. Finally, I hope that the Riga Summit in May will send our Eastern partners – which have successfully done their homework, of course – a clear message on that EU perspective, and that the visa-free regime with Georgia could also be agreed to.

The Commission fully shares the trust in the Latvian Presidency. We know from experience that there is only one way Europe moves forward, and that is if the three institutions responsible for moving Europe forward work together, hand in hand, with a joint programme and with joint ideas about the future. I want to come back to an issue which was raised by one of the honourable Members about the ability of Latvia to play its part, in the context of its history and its difficult paths in the last couple of years. Exactly 24 years ago I was in Riga when the oppressor, the Soviet Union, tried to prevent Latvia from fulfilling its destiny of being a free country again, and violence was used on the streets of Riga. I was there, I witnessed it, and it is a moment of great pride and joy for me to be standing here today, 24 years later, seeing in this institution the Latvian Presidency with its ambitions, its talent and its ability to take the European Union ahead with our ambitions and with everything we need to do in the next six months. If you had told me in that cold January in 1991 that this was going to happen in January 2015, I would have probably called medical services to have you committed – but here is what has been achieved, thanks to the ambitions of the Latvian people to be free. They did not choose to become members of the European Union because they wanted somebody in the European Commission, because they wanted somebody in the European Parliament or because they wanted to be part of institutions. They wanted to be members of the European Union because they shared the values upon which the European Union is based. That was the European family they wanted to belong to, and they have made these ambitions come true. Today those values are being challenged from the outside as well as from the inside of the Union, and the ambition of the Latvian Presidency, mirrored by the ambition I hear today in Parliament and by the ambition of the Commission, is to face the challenges and give an answer to them: to make sure that more people get jobs in Europe, that our rule of law is strengthened in Europe, that we are stronger in order to face outside threats, and that we use the potential of the energy union, of the digital single market and of all the things that will create a stronger European economy. I want to conclude by saying that the Commission has full trust in the excellence of the Latvian Presidency and its ability actually to deliver what all of us here today want for the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 86, "date": "2015-01-14.json", "name": "Laimdota Straujuma", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  President-in-Office of the Council. - Dear Members, Panelists! First of all, I would like to thank you very much for your interest, opinions and questions. And I would like to thank Mr Frans Timmermans for reminding him of what happened on the exactly days of January in Riga. Because it's a certain emotional moment. I will try to answer your questions, but first of all I would like to say that it is very important that the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council work together. And only together will we be able to achieve what some Members of Parliament have said, namely that we will work for our people, the people of Europe. I will group my answers to the comments and questions of the political groups and Members in three parts: first, security, then, involving or in a global Europe and, thirdly, growth. For safety. It is the responsibility of all of us to respond to security challenges, and in this respect I believe that the Schengen system and the free movement of persons are an undeniable fundamental principle of the European Union. I cannot agree with the Members who are calling for the suspension of Schengen. By stopping Schengen, we will demonstrate our weakness and show those who are attacking our values that they can prevail and achieve their own. I can only repeat what Mr Gianni Pitella said about Schengen by name. With regard to the details of the much mentioned passenger register, I call for a look at these issues once again. We understand that issues are politically sensitive elements; we can discuss modalities, but we need to act. For a Europe involved. I absolutely agree that we must pay equal attention to our neighbours, both in the south and in the east. I would like to emphasise once again what I have already mentioned in my speech, namely that Russia's aggression in Ukraine is not only a bilateral issue between Russia and Ukraine, but also a question of European and global security. The best way to deal with this crisis on the part of the European Union is to maintain the unity of the European Union on this issue. For Europe, the European Union must continue to defend its principles, both in words and in deeds. We believe that we need to work in three directions. First of all, practical and political support should be given to Ukraine and other Eastern Partnership countries. Of course, we also expect the reforms that are taking place in these countries. Secondly, relations with Russia must be addressed by continuing diplomatic dialogue and pressure, in compliance with international law and the Minsk Agreement. Thirdly, it is necessary to strengthen our internal and external security. During the Presidency, we will strive to shape the political process and achieve, seek a peaceful and sustainable solution to the conflict in Ukraine, respecting the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the states. It is important for all of us – and I believe that russia also has an important role – a strong and stable Ukraine. Therefore ( and here I thank the Commission, which has already done so this year) support the Ukrainian economy. Next, in response to a question from Dimitrios Papadimoulis, Member for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), we believe that TTIP should be a win-win agreement. We must have equal partners on both sides: the European Union and the United States. In view of the growing public interest in TTIP, we will actively cooperate so that the negotiations to be conducted by the Commission are also linked and reflected in the public. It is very important to inform the public and ensure much greater transparency in these negotiations. If we are talking about growth, then, as some of my colleagues have said – and this is supported by the Commission – the European Union's growth in the coming years must be based on structural reforms, fiscal responsibility and investment. And investment and the social dimension are interlinked. If there is no growth, it is difficult for every government to be social. I therefore believe that we need to be able to think about both dimensions. We have talked for a long time about investment in theory, and today I would like to congratulate the Commission and Mr Jean-Claude Juncker that the Commission has proposed investment for the European Union, and that is the mission of the Latvian Presidency, the Commission, and I have also asked Parliament to consider it as its mission, so that the solutions for this investment programme are available to our entrepreneurs as early as next semester. I have heard many words about overcoming the Latvian crisis. Thank you for the assessment, and I also accept the criticism, but it is clear that Latvia has overcome the crisis and latvia's growth continues, and we are proud of it. For every country in crisis, I cannot say that Latvia will be an example to all countries of how to act. Each country is unique, and each country chooses its own path to deal with the crisis. We have chosen our own path and it has been successful. And I would like to say that not only was austerity at the heart of the latvian crisis management path. It was also investment, it was a successful use of cohesion funds, it was structural reforms, it was a whole set of measures. And here, Mr Manfred Weber left, but, as I said, I would also like to agree with what Mr Weber and several other colleagues have said that growth is only possible if we find this right balance between fiscal discipline, structural reforms and investment in the economy. This is not only a challenge for Latvia, but for all of us. Next, Dimitrios Papadimoulis, MEP for cohesion. As I said earlier, cohesion is very important to us. We understand this, we use it, and we see very well in Latvia how both cohesion and the Structural Funds contribute to the growth of our economy. About 315 billion investment plans. I would like to reiterate that the Latvian Presidency will work on the basis of what was decided by the December European Council to facilitate a timely agreement. At the same time, I would like to agree with Robert Zīle and Matt Carthy that we need to look for ways to encourage investment in every Member State of the European Union. And, of course, I also agree with Mr Jean Arthuis on the organisation of the investment environment. And it is clear that, in order for us to implement this investment plan, we need, I will mention again, we will need triparty cooperation. And not just a tripartial Council. This means all 28 countries. Several Members touched on the issue of Greece. I would like to say that we are closely following developments in Greece. We must take into account and respect the choices made by the Greek people on 25 January. We assume that, after the elections, Greece will implement what the agreement provides and will continue the reform programme agreed with international leaders or heads of state. Changes to the program can be made, but only with the consent of all parties. After the Greek elections, it will be necessary to find a mutually acceptable solution for Greece and the European Union. I believe that we are all interested in Greece remaining in the euro zone and continuing the promises it has made as it moves towards economic recovery. Next, a number of colleagues addressed us with questions about the Energy Union. I would like to thank everyone who supported this priority, which is one of the conditions for competitiveness, and the Latvian Presidency will continue to work on the creation of an energy union. We are pleased that its creation will begin as part of the Riga process. In the new Energy Union, solidarity between Member States, a functioning, well-connected internal energy market, strong energy diplomacy, competitive energy and energy independence must be the most important elements, and, as some have already said, governance issues. In response to the question by Ms Sophia in 't Veld and Pilar del Castillo Vera on the single market for telecommunications, the Presidency will continue to work on the proposal and will work towards a compromise in the Council. I understand that this is not easy, but the work to be further focused on those elements of the proposal that will bring added value, namely roaming and net neutrality. We want a high-quality solution that will bring benefits. We must avoid the increase in mobile costs within the Member States. In response to the question of data protection by Ms Sophia in 't Veld, the priority of our Presidency is to work actively on the data regulation with a view to achieving universal access to the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers. We believe that, in the digital age, a single data protection framework will strengthen data protection in Europe. At the same time, Latvia is fully aware of the complexity of the discussions on the remaining issues and the overall implementation of this project. MeP Pavel Telička spoke about better legislation. I fully support the work of First Vice-President Frans Timmermans, so that we really get to better legislation, that we have always considered the most appropriate solution and that the policies that we adopt are the most effective. I would also like to take this opportunity to call on the European Parliament to renew its work on the European Passenger Name Record. I call and trust that the European Parliament will be a close cooperation partner for the Council and the Commission.  Dear Members, Dear Commission, I would like to say thank you once again to everyone for your interest, for the questions asked. This will inspire the Latvian Presidency to work further.

In fact, the total public debt of the 18 euro area Member States has increased sharply in the years of the crisis, from 83% of their GDP in 2010 to 95% in 2014, far from the Maastricht Treaty target of public debt below 60% of GDP.

In particular with the strengthening of Europol, cooperation mechanisms between police officers or the development of the new Schengen Information System. In addition to the various proposals already under discussion, the Latvian Presidency has prioritised the review of the European internal security strategy, which will identify the challenges, principles and guidelines within the European Union. I hope that the Presidency will maintain a balanced approach and not question, in the name of security, the value it seeks to protect: Freedom.

In January 2013, producers in my country were unfairly involved in the scandal of mislabelling horsemeat products. It is unfair for honest producers to suffer from the mistakes or ill-will sins of rogue commercial agents. Regulations and procedures should be designed in such a way that the perpetrators are identified as quickly as possible, without any collateral damage.

In a broader sense TTIP must not curtail the ability of the Scottish Parliament to bring public services back into the public domain if that is the democratic will of the Scottish people, and to manage them in the way the Scottish people see fit.

Some were faster than me. Permettez-moi de commencer en français avec une pensée sur les actes terribles qui ont eu lieu la semaine dernière à Paris. Nous avons vu la douleur, le deuil et la solidarité avec les victimes, leurs familles, leurs collègues et leurs amis. Nous avons vu la réaction des Français, tout d'abord, mais aussi des institutions françaises et européennes, des Européens et du monde entier. Ce fut une réaction d'unité, d'équilibre et de force, surtout de force. Aujourd'hui, de même que demain et dans les semaines et les mois qui viennent, le moment est venu de s'en inspirer et de tirer les leçons du passé.  It is not the first time that out of a tragedy we are able to build positive things. Actually the European Union was born out of the ruins of the Second World War, and out of our main tragedy our founding fathers, one of whom resigned today as President of the Italian Republic, were brave and wise enough to be able to build the most successful experience of regional integration in history. That experience was recognised with the Nobel Peace Prize. If you do not want our Europe to become history and be confined to the past, I think we have to be as brave and as wise as our founding fathers were able to be. From the tragedy that happened, if I am not wrong, exactly one week ago in Paris, we have a duty to rebuild our European Union, stating our unity, our strength and our solidarity, and starting from our strength, our unity and our solidarity – starting somehow from ourselves. You might think this has nothing to do with our debate today, but I believe it does. I believe that what happened last week has shown all European Union citizens, and many outside our borders, the first lesson we have to learn, which is that you need to be more united, really united, not only in words, not only on paper, but in practice. We need to trust each other when it comes to sharing information, to foreign policy, defence, and security. We have to understand that what we share is far greater than what divides us and that it is in our interest – our citizens’ interest – when it comes to security, economic prosperity, freedom and rights, to really work closely together and become cooperative and not competitive – as I think was shown yesterday, and again today very well. We are trying to work in a cooperative and non-competitive way among the European institutions here: Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The second lesson that I think we have to learn is that there is no real border between external and internal events, and so there must be no real border between our external and internal action. That is the reason why we are trying to coordinate – and I am personally trying to coordinate – our work within the Commission and within the Council. I have started doing that already in these first two months, and I am planning to do it even more, in a broader sense, when it comes to foreign, security and defence policy, but also security internally – counter-terrorism – and also justice and other challenges that we have before us, be they migration, energy, climate, transport, trade, the economy, or even culture and education. Again, some of you might wonder what this has to do with our foreign and security policy. This is the core, I think, of our security policy: to understand that security is not purely a security or securitarian issue; it is also a security issue and a defence issue, but it is also a human security issue. This has to take into consideration all aspects of everybody’s life. In general, I think we have to look at all the main challenges with a coordinated approach, and this is going to be one of the challenges of our foreign and security policy in the months ahead. We preach policy coherence when it comes to development and cooperation, for instance, but then we rarely do it when it comes to ourselves. I think we should take a slogan from a famous brand – ‘Just do it’ – and try to be coherent and consistent ourselves. The third lesson I think we need to work on in the coming months on foreign and security policy is that there is no simple answer to complex problems. If we look around us, whether close by or far away, we see complexity as the first element. That is evident in the Middle East, and let me take this opportunity to thank this Parliament for its excellent work over the months of November and December on the resolution on the Middle East peace process, the very fruitful debate we had, and the resolution that was passed and which I think was very helpful. But there is no single problem around us that is a black and white issue. This means that we need, on one hand, as I said, a mix of measures and instruments and to make sure that all the things we do go into a coherent approach. But this also requires a deeper understanding of what is happening inside the European Union, around the European Union and also far away from the European Union. To do that we probably need to develop some cultural instruments inside our borders. We tend to use categories of thoughts that are still the ones we had in the last century. This has nothing to do with east and west, but with our identity, our models of life in society and our relations with other countries. When it comes to diplomacy, we do indeed have the usual instruments of diplomacy and the new instruments of diplomacy – digital diplomacy and so on – but I think we are still sometimes using the old categories in terms of how we relate to other countries, other organisations and other regions of the world, and old ways of projecting our image of the European Union, which probably no longer corresponds to the reality of history. That is really crucial for following up the tragic events in Paris. Other points. We need to develop a mix of immediate actions and long-term strategies. We tend to react to whatever comes in immediate terms. Then how effective we are in delivering on the immediate terms is another story, and I think this also calls for deep thinking about the functioning of our institutions. This is not for today. But then sometimes – or often – we lack long-term strategies and long-term visions. I think we need to engage seriously on that in the coming months with our partners around us, starting – we have just discussed this in the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) in a restricted format – by engaging with countries that have a knowledge that is deeper than ours but which maybe do not have the same instruments that we have to tackle the issues to which their knowledge applies, whether this is to the east of our borders or to the south or in the Gulf. But most of all I think that we ourselves have to make a cultural change. What surprised me on Sunday in Paris – and I am sorry if I take it personally, but I think that is also part of our political and institutional life – was the image of hundreds of thousands of citizens in Paris clapping the leaders as the leaders showed unity, solidarity and physical presence together. This image of the citizens of a country that had been attacked only a few days before, with the sense of tension and difficulties in sight, clapping what was somehow a picture of Europe is something that I think we have to keep in our minds and in our hearts, because this poses questions for us here. We tend to have debates – I cannot say very much about this Chamber, but I have been listening quite a lot in recent months – but we tend to have an image of Europe as something that is little, limited, very partial and very weak. That might be the case, but that image of French citizens clapping the image of Europeans, standing strong and together, has to give us the responsibility to work on our own perception of our power. And I will use the word ʽpowerʼ, which is not a usual European word. Normally we tend to be humble, and this is good. One can be a power, one can be even a superpower, using that with a sense of being humble and facilitating dialogue and mediation – and yes, we are a superpower. We are a superpower that won the Noble Peace Prize, and I think that the major responsibility and lesson we have to draw from what has happened in recent weeks is that we have to be the major superpower for action for peace, for action for human rights, dialogue and respect – knowing, as only Europeans know, that peace is not only the absence of war; peace is also respect and the promotion of human rights, security and equality. I do not know if that answers the question of what kind of foreign policy challenges we have in front of us. If you want, I have a long list – 23 pages actually – of single issues and single countries and our concrete commitment on each and every one of these issues and these countries and regions. I would tend not to go through that list but just say that there is not one single global issue or region of the world, or country in the world, where we can afford as Europeans not to increase our presence, our role as actors for peace. I would, obviously, be ready to go through that list – taking a selective approach probably, because 23 pages would make us stay here even longer than midnight, which is the time scheduled at the moment – but afterwards, after your interventions, to be more specific in my reply on many of the issues that we have been debating very precisely in these months – these two-and-a-half months in which I think I have met you in different formats some 15 or 16 times probably, and again yesterday on Libya and today on many other of the issues which are the top priority issues of today for the European Union. We will also have another three chances, I think, to have a strategic, complete discussion in the coming months here in this Chamber. One is when we will discuss the Brok report quite soon, and that will be a very good opportunity to go through a strategic debate and review on that, and we have already started to do that with the national parliaments as well. The second will be the preparation for the June European Council, where I will have the responsibility of presenting an assessment of global security, and let me also share with you the fact that (third element) I believe that that will also be the opportunity for starting a process to have a new security strategy for the European Union. Let me also add that, rather than having this security strategy, I would suggest that we have a foreign policy and security strategy, as we will need to have that coherent and broad approach when we debate our own strategies for the future too. Let me conclude by just saying that I know some of you might have expected me to go through that 23-page list and to remind you again that I am ready to discuss with you – be it on our engagement with Latin America, where I will be in a couple of weeks’ time to prepare the EU CELAC Summit, or on climate change, where we will have on Monday an action plan for diplomacy to prepare for the Paris Summit in December, or counter-terrorism again, where we will work in coordination with the interior and justice ministers – but also, I think, have an intercultural and inter-religious exercise to be developed over the next months, more on the internal side but also involving players in the region; or, obviously, a discussion on Ukraine and Russia, which we will have just after this discussion today; or our relations with Asia or Africa, where again I will be participating in the African Union Summit in less than two weeks. Or our relations with the United States. That is normally automatically associated with the negotiations for TTIP, which is something we can discuss, obviously. But we also have to be aware of the fact that a lot of the strategies and challenges that we have before us will need to be developed together with a partner that is probably going through difficult times as much as we are. Finally, most of all let me say that what is also crucial today for me is listening to you. I know this is mainly a chance for you to put questions, but let me say that for me, the most precious time here in this Chamber is taking notes on what you say.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 109, "date": "2015-01-14.json", "name": "Elmar Brok", "mepid": "1263", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which she has Madam Vice-President, put the 23 pages on the record. I would be interested to read them. That would be an easy option. However, I thought it was good that the Vice-President did not come here with detailed questions, but that we are – and the events in Paris have clearly shown us – in a situation where we can no longer distinguish neatly between foreign policy and domestic policy. This is closely related. And we must also give a coherent response to this – for security reasons, for reasons of value, for many reasons. I believe that we must see here that we are also under a deadly threat and blackmailing in domestic policy by terrorists. And we need to see that cyber-attacks are being used. The case of Sony and North Korea in the United States is one such case.  In other words, we have instruments for achieving foreign policy objectives by making domestic threats, paralyzing computer networks, killing people – blind, no matter who – and democratic politics must respond to that. I believe that we do not yet have sufficient intellectual answers as to how this new modern vulnerability can be managed by modern democracies. For this reason, of course, this can only be done if we act more on the basis of values, and we see the link between values, namely the rule of law and democracy, that is, a crucial vehicle for internal and external credibility, but also the link between security and the economy. We have to see that only if you have an economic strength do you have a foreign policy role to play.  You are absolutely right to say that it is a situation that we are a superpower. We are still the world's strongest economic force – trade, gross domestic product, etc. However, we are not in a position to translate this into external political language like others. That is why your clustering is right, but this can only be a first step, and that is why we can also move forward in the area of the summit, which is to be postponed, and in the area of security and defence policy, in order to better coordinate the European Union's defence capabilities and to achieve greater credibility here.

Ms Mogherini is right to look for concrete action, right to say how essential it is for our internal and external responses to be integrated, and especially right when she says we must de-link the words ‘Islam’ and ‘terrorism’. For me it is not wrong to share in an emotional response to this attack. The magazine and its journalists, which meant to make us laugh, have suffered an attack which can only make us cry. But reason must prevail in our response: the reason that tells us the open societies we enjoy will always be vulnerable, but that terrorism succeeds if we allow that openness and freedom to be prejudiced. We can best support the human right of freedom of expression by refraining from passing anti-terrorism laws which themselves infringe human rights. So we must consider the problem of foreign fighters; but my own country is wrong to consider actions which themselves might breach the Conventions on Statelessness. I am dismayed that a representative of a party which includes the proud name of my own country stained the memorial in this Chamber by seeking to use it to blame immigration. They should remember that the Charlie Hebdo attackers were all French citizens, just as the London bombers were all British. And those who resist Europe’s role for our mutual security should see, too, that a suspect who is on a British watch list but not on a French one exposes a justifiable need for better intelligence sharing in Europe. Foreign policy did not cause these or other terrorist attacks. There is no legitimate cause for the fighters, but there are causes as to why they fight. Conflict in Syria, Yemen, Libya and Iraq has allowed the threat to grow, and it will be reduced only if we work to end those conflicts. Europe must intensify its work with partners in the wider region to stop support for conflict and recognise that Western support for authoritarianism in some of those countries, now and in the past, has fuelled grievance.

Yet after every crisis, we hear the same mantra from the European Union: that the simple answer is more Europe. I am afraid that is not the answer, and I do not think the French people were applauding Europe on the march there – they were applauding national leaders on the march. I do not think King Abdullah, Mr Netanyahu or indeed Mahmoud Abbas would regard themselves as European leaders. Today you are speaking about the main aspects and basic choices for CFSP and CSDP. It seems to me that the choice is very simple: you can continue on the path of ever more expansion of structures and tasks just to promote the visibility of the European Union as a global actor in its own right, or you can focus on a very limited set of tasks where the EU might do something useful and add value instead of merely competing with other organisations or seeking to displace the position of our Member States. Speaking here yesterday, European Council President Donald Tusk said that the European Union was, and I quote, ʽa political organisation – a tool, not a destinationʼ. However, most worryingly, some still cling to the idea of a state called Europe as the EU destination, and I would suggest that the way in which the European External Action Service has developed is precisely part of that drive in the wrong direction towards an integrated European state. Instead, the demand that we hear from many of our citizens and from the British Prime Minister is for a new direction, for an end to ever-closer union. My concerns about the European External Action Service are repeated in regard to CSDP, another supreme example of the EU quest for image and visibility in the most vital and sensitive area of national responsibility.

Those who really want peace and stability are finally starting to fight poverty effectively, which is the breeding ground for violence and terrorism, and do not continue to abuse development funds for security and military training.

One of the major lessons from these crises so far, in my estimation and in our group’s estimation, is that none of the Member States is capable of dealing with crises on its own or even in some sort of combination. These crises, put together, are bigger than any combination of former or present great powers within the European Union. We need a comprehensive, coordinated strategy.

Of course, if there is a state which has a security strategy that has been in place for ten years, that might mean two things: firstly, that is highly successful and there is no need to change it, and secondly, that it is rather slow in reviewing it. I am afraid that we are more in the second position than in the first, so, although I fully understand that this is basically the Council’s responsibility, I would like to ask you what we, the European Parliament, could do to help you in that exercise. As a last point, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we have a responsibility for the coherence of all our external policies, not just our foreign and security policy. Let us make sure of that as well.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 117, "date": "2015-01-14.json", "name": "James Carver", "mepid": "124971", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Madam President, the EU’s blinkered desire for harmonisation and ever-closer union ignores the diverse international interests and sometimes very different priorities that each of the 28 Member States have. What about the serious question of further economic and diplomatic burdens that have been placed on some Member States, not least because of the EU expansion eastwards? One response by Russia has been the conclusion of a food-for-long-range bombers deal with Argentina, thus forcing the British Government to review her defence requirements in the South Atlantic. This is just one obvious example, merely from a British perspective, of international interests which conflict with increasingly overt expansion of EU neo-imperialism. This will only be exacerbated by a common foreign and security policy and a common security and defence policy. What does this short-sighted approach to the EU expansion and the desire to foster the notion, as we have just heard, of a perceived superpower mean for the traditional neutrality of Ireland and Austria, particularly given the self-amending nature of the Lisbon Treaty? I grew up in the 1980s, and the undiplomatic approach to this most sensitive of subjects reminds me of a song by a British band from Coventry in the region that I represent.

These events underline that the European Union's security policy is a moral necessity as well as a political requirement. Our priority must be to strengthen and better coordinate at European level national actions on intelligence, data exchange and internet monitoring, and we can act very concretely here.

Beyond that, we must note that today the European Union, no more than any of the Individual Member States, has the means to be on the front line in this crisis management. We need legal and strategic instruments and financial resources. So, Mrs Mogherini, I have three questions for you. Firstly, at what level of European GNP do you consider the necessary financial resources?  Secondly, how do you intend to get each Member State to contribute to the common effort in a fair way?

The European Union must take a leading place in these global responses to these challenges, which are also global. I suppose, Madam High Representative, that these basic ideas will be present in the exercise of strategic reflection being carried out by the European External Action Service. It seems to me that neighbourhood policy must take a privileged place in that exercise. We can't cover everything. Our neighbourhood, where challenges and conflicts in its southern and eastern dimensions, must be a priority. I am thinking of Libya, the generally disappointing results of the so-called 'Arab Spring' and the serious crisis in Ukraine over Russian intervention. I would like to underline one last point, as other speakers have already done: the need for further deepening in the areas of security and defence. Certainly, at the moment, the economic crisis and the necessary fiscal consolidation do not allow large defence spending.

Therefore, I believe that in parallel with a more active role in world crises, a better security policy must go on our soil. I believe, first of all, that cooperation between competent national authorities and security forces should be raised to the highest possible level in order to detect and address the potential threat more quickly and efficiently.

I would like you to focus among other things on cyber-defence capabilities. I expect the Commission to urge Member States to develop their respective cyber-defence strategies and to coordinate them in doing so, using the European Defence Agency to create joint EU cyber-defence potential. However, the fundamental issue for any practical progress on security and defence methods is the economic basis. The first victims of the economic crisis were defence budgets, and while Russia has been modernising its army and has increased military expenditure to 4.5% of GDP – and the same is true for China – the figure in most EU Member States has plummeted far below 2%. There is no way to avoid or postpone systematic recovery of the EU’s defence capability. One problem that the European Council in June this year needs to address is the practical application of Treaty Article 42(7) – the mutual defence clause – especially in the new security situation.

In my opinion, we have a tercet of values in which conformity and equality matter of fundamental value. This is why I am of the opinion that there is a need to build a single system covering the whole of Europe for the control of the movement of air passengers. Let us remember that by extending the guarantees of citizens' security, we strengthen and make their citizens' rights real. Secondly, my assessment of the NATO Summit in Wales is ambivalent. On the one hand, it seemed that the preparations would end in poor results, on the other hand, as a result of the Ukrainian crisis there was a mobilization, and there was undoubtedly no disaster. Today, however, the most important thing is that political arrangements are translated efficiently into purely military language and decisions. I have the impression that political will, determination and full consent are simply lacking in this matter. I regard the personal chairmanship of the High Representative of the Defence Committee as a good sign of these possible successes.

For example, if we were not an economic superpower, countries such as Ireland, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus would have trouble meeting their financing needs to avoid bankruptcy after 2008.

There is this difference of opinion on the Ukraine issue, but I think that Russia, after the fall in the international oil price, which has caused, among other things, the fall in its national currency, the ruble, and the passage of its economy into recession, will at some point want to stop funding a policy that puts it at odds with us.

Among many positive and very nice things said, which I appreciate as the encouragement is always useful, I have heard some of you saying that there is little clarity in our foreign security and defence policy and that we should learn from some of criticism of the past. I understand that this is a debate also on the report on choices that have been made since the last Parliamentary debate on this, which was actually before this formation of Parliament and, if I am not wrong, that debate was in April last year. It is clear that I cannot – and indeed it would not be fair for me to – make an assessment or evaluation on a report on choices that were taken before I became High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission. (Here again I would invite the European Parliament to refer to me using the term that is mentioned in the Treaties. I am sorry if I mention this from time to time, but I think we have to respect the Treaties in these little things). This does not mean that I do not have an opinion on previous choices or previous policies: the ones that were done and the ones that were not done or not taken. This only means that I am in the first two months of my mandate and concentrating on the things that need to be done for the future, obviously starting from an assessment of what were our weak points or what needs to be completed. In this respect your opinion counts; your opinion, the opinion of Ministers on the Council side and the opinion of the Commission on the other. But from my side it would not be fair to pretend that in two months I can make an assessment of things that were done in the previous months or years or plan for the next five years in a complete and exhaustive way. But what I can do here is say what I intend to do over the coming months and make sure that we check that regularly with common discussions like this one, and also identify some of the basic lines – as I am trying to do. Starting from one basic point: Mr Brok, the Chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, mentioned the fact that dealing with the foreign security and defence policy is not only a matter of security but also a matter of values and of economic interest and interests at large. I would start from there. I think that anyone who is dealing with national foreign policy knows that you start from the analysis of the national interest, and I think we need to take this European interest as our starting point for developing our strategy. However, the exercise of developing a fully-fledged strategy is not something we can do in a couple of hours in this Parliament, even if this Parliament has a lot of knowledge about that. We need to take our time. I will reach out to the external community and also involve not only the European Parliament but also national parliaments and national foreign and security dimensions. That is why, to those of you that asked me: ‘what is the role of the European Parliament going to be in defining what I intend to launch as a foreign security policy strategy?’ I can say that I intend to launch a wide, deep and open process – not writing a document or drafting documents together but having a common reflection together. If we have to define our European interest as the basis of our common strategy, we need to have a broad and comprehensive debate. Therefore, be sure that we will be coming back to this issue so often in the months and probably years to come that we might even be bored of it. But I personally will never be. A point was raised by a Member of Parliament – who is not here anymore – mentioning the picture which is going round the social media these days of the leaders, not only of Europe but also leaders of the world, in Paris, which does not show the people behind them. I have seen that picture as well. I would never stand here saying that the European Union or European Union institutions or leaderships are perfect; neither is this Parliament. But our job is to fill the gap between the thousands of people that were in the streets and that picture. That was the big strength of not only Europe, but Europe and the European capacity to reach out to alliances in the world. The power of that picture was not the number of people behind the first row; it was the complexity, the mix of the people in the front row. There were Europeans, big countries, small countries, different countries, people that are used to fighting each other on different issues in different fights, African leaders, Arab leaders, international organisations, regional organisations: the mix. The power of that picture was the sense of an alliance of civilisations, and that was what I think the people in Paris, the European people were applauding: the capacity of the European Union and of France to take an approach which was an alliance and not a clash of civilisations. I think that this is giving us the responsibility to build on this promise of going in that direction. As regards a point that was mentioned by many of you: others’ stability, security, democracy and respect of human rights is also our stability, security, democracy and respect of human rights. We are so much interlinked; we discussed that on Libya yesterday. Some were saying that we should just stay out. No way; we are interlinked so much. There is no other way of assuring our own security, stability and prosperity if we do not work also on the security, stability and prosperity of our common region and also of people that are far away from us. But I will return to that. I would start, for sure, with the neighbourhood. Engage and work together, whether in the south or Tunisia – but also in Iraq. I take the point raised that there is no structured EU presence in Erbil, and let me tell this Chamber that I am going to propose that we do have an organised permanent presence as the European Union in Erbil. I think we have to be present; it is not a matter of flags – although it sometimes can be a matter of flags – but it is a matter of being able to do the job in the most effective way. We have to be in all parts of the neighbourhood where our work and our investment is needed – not only in the interest of our neighbours, but also in our own interest. That is true as regards the south; it is also very true as regards the east. Like some of you, I was also a bit surprised by the fact that the conflict in the east of Ukraine was not as high on the agenda of the discussion that we had today as I would have expected it to be. I think it is probably because we have another point later in the afternoon specifically on that. I would refer to that more in depth during that discussion, but let me say here as regards the conflict in Ukraine and the support that we have to build for Ukraine and for Ukrainian internal reforms and success, that I believe it is going to be a crucial part of the success or failure of our foreign and security policy, and that the Riga Summit – that some of you asked about – is going to be one of the crucial elements next month for redefining our relations with the Eastern partners on a tailor-made approach. We are going through a revision of our European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), and you can be sure that we will have an exchange with the European Parliament, together with Commissioner Hahn, on the ways in which we are reviewing the policy as such. Let me also mention, while we are talking about the neighbourhood, that yes, I completely share what some of you said about the Western Balkans. This is one of the areas where the added value of the European Union cannot be substituted by any other actor in the world. Therefore, Bosnia and Herzegovina and also other countries of the Western Balkans are going to be one of the key priorities, I would say the starting point. My generation grew up thinking that it would be impossible to have peace in the Western Balkans. Now we almost forget to mention the Weston Balkans because it is so quiet – everything is relative. But this is also a positive encouraging sign; if we work, day by day and consistently, with all our means on a mediation and stabilisation process and on the prospect of European integration, we will be successful in stabilising societies and institutions. Some invited me to choose – the Member is not here any more, sorry about that – between continuing to work on visibility everywhere, maybe in competition with Member States or other organisations, and selecting only a few priorities where we do really bring added value. Obviously we have a number one task, which is to do our job in our part of the world because, like the Western Balkans, this is the place where we are not replaceable. But on the other hand, I think it would be a strategic mistake if we thought that this is an alternative compared to being also present in other parts of the world. Latin America was mentioned; I would mention Africa. India and Asia in general were mentioned; China, I think, also was mentioned. We cannot choose, because on the one hand we have to pay maximum attention to the places where we bring added value – and that is to me clearly our neighbourhood. At the same time, we also have to be present and invest in our relations with the rest of the world, whether Latin America, the African Union – I am going to be there in a couple of weeks – or Africa in general and some key places in Africa. This also relates very much to our security. Now we look at the Arab World, but do not forget that a lot of our security is linked to the security in the Horn of Africa and in the sub-Sahel region. And if we consider that the economy is also part of our foreign policy strategy, how could we forget Asia? Human rights are also a basic part of our foreign policy strategy, so how could we forget some big countries in Asia or elsewhere in the world? I think we do not have the luxury of choosing. We have to do all. Someone said – and he is still here in the room, thank you – that we are surrounded by a set of crises and the clear thing today, hopefully to everybody, is that none of them can possibly be solved by one Member State alone, or by a group of Member States. I fully subscribe to this, and I think that now the awareness is there. The point is, also from my side, to develop a capacity of not looking at the two things as contradictory. I completely agree with one of you in this Chamber who said that the European Union’s beauty is its diversity. I fully agree, but we should never fall into the trap of thinking that diversity contradicts unity, because our strength is being united in our diversity. There are ways of coordinating our common foreign and security policy without overlapping with national interests, because so much of the national interest today coincides with the European interest. This is what I think we need to understand. I have been a national government minister myself, and I know that national priorities in most cases can only be reached through European coordination and European means. This is true on both foreign policy and defence. I thank those who raised it. The French in particular will excuse me if I say so, but I think we understand each other in this room. We somehow have to take the opportunity presented to us by the shock of what happened in Paris last week to understand that we have to move and to wake up as regards sharing and increasing our common work in two areas: intelligence and defence. If we do not do it now, it means that we do not understand what is happening in the world. Sharing intelligence is something on which I will ask this Parliament to support me in asking Member States to do more generously; not because it is in the interests of the European Union, but because it is in the interests of their own citizens to share intelligence and to invest and share on defence. Many questions were asked regarding the June European Council. We have started to work with the European Defence Agency. I agree with those who mentioned that we need to have concrete deliverables on many issues, starting from industrial ones and the four major projects that were decided to be followed-up on at the June European Council – the air-to-air refuelling, drones, cyber security and satellite communication – but also in general on innovation, dual-use research and fiscal and financial incentives for defence cooperation. This is something about which the European Defence Agency has already started to put concrete proposals on the table for the Ministers. There are also other important things like ‘train and equip’ projects to support partners’ capacity in crisis management. We need to have some extremely concrete and precise deliverables in the June European Council. That is important not only for our security but also for our economy and for our industries. We also have other things to do at the level of defence. You asked about the defence budget. This is a sensible debate, which in the European Union as such has not taken place. We had that debate in NATO and different organisations, with which I am starting to coordinate very closely, because I believe that we are different; we have a different mission, we have a different identity and a different membership. But we need to work together on security in a complementary way: we have our differences, but still we have to work very closely together. But this issue of national defence budgets has not been an issue in itself for a European agenda, and I believe that it should be an issue for the June European Council debate. The target set at the NATO Summit was 2%. I would say that an additional reflection on the defence budget is not only the amount of money, it is also – and mainly, I would say – the way in which the money is spent, and in this regard European common defence projects can be very helpful, because the output in defence counts more than the input, because what we really are looking for is projects that work. But I think that we will have to look at that also at the European Council in June. When I mentioned a superpower, I did not expect such a reaction to it. First of all it is not a dream. Somebody said: ‘instead of dreaming of being a superpower’. You know we already are one. Do not necessarily link superpower only to the military; I believe that we can also be a hard-power superpower. But take soft power or take other fields of foreign policy: we are the first donor in the world. In development we are already a superpower. In many other things; in climate change we are leading. We are a superpower. On diplomacy, we Europeans have the largest network of diplomatic presence in the world. On many other things – on presence on the ground – in many places, if you put together the European Union and the Member States, we are certainly the superpower in the world. But a giant that is not aware of being a giant is not a giant but a dwarf. This is the exercise that we have to do – to realise what instruments and power we have and to use them, because having a superpower and not using it is a waste. In this world really we cannot waste any of the opportunities that we have. I think I will finish here by mentioning one element: the white paper on defence. I am concentrating more on defence, because I realise that was an aspect on which I talked less in the beginning, so I am trying to catch up. I think the main point today is to develop the security and foreign policy strategy. It has taken more than ten years, and someone said either we were very successful or we were late. I guess we are late. Not only has the region changed, but Europe has changed. After 11 years we have instruments, and we are ourselves completely different from 2003. I think we need to do this exercise first, also because first you define the scenario, the work, your objectives and your European interest, and then you go to the instruments. But this could also lead to a white paper on defence – why not? It could be. But I think that now we have to engage first in an exercise of defining. I said that by June I would present the assessment of the global security challenges that are facing us, and then I think together – together with the European Parliament but also with national parliaments and with the foreign and security community in the European Union at large, including the Member States – we will need to define our foreign policy and security strategy. But I do not exclude that this could also lead to working on a white paper on defence at a later stage.

Surely, if the EU is committed to actively promoting the widest participation in the ICC, we should be backing the right of the Palestinian people to seek justice through accession to treaties and international organisations, and not discouraging them from doing so.

At the same time, a thorough consideration is needed. We have democracy, values and principles that take care of the well-being of all Europeans. Security is one of the key conditions for development, education, economic growth, jobs and investment.

However, this needs to be done in a thoughtful and coordinated manner, with the definition of a strategy for the future. However, care must be taken not to fall into the trap. This trap means that, in the name of greater security, we would increase the power of control over the movement and travel of citizens. We cannot provide for greater security by restricting human rights and freedoms.

We are now talking about an internal threat that requires extremely close, coherent and effective cooperation between all 28 states. With Romania having the largest external border of the EU in Eastern Europe, Schengen membership, postponed for political and in no way technical reasons, becomes crucial.

I would like to thank you for having this debate today: I think it is crucial that, as well as discussing our own security threats, we do not lose sight of what is happening in relation to major terrorist threats in other parts of the world. This is also very much part of our counter-terrorist communication strategy. In the last few months alone, hundreds of innocent civilians have been killed, more kidnapped and thousands displaced. The attack on the border town of Baga last week is only the latest in a long series of attacks and bombings, and increasingly frequent attacks into Cameroon demonstrate that the threat is regional and is becoming even more so. The objective is increasingly to spread terror and gain territorial control, with the indiscriminate targeting of everybody – Christians, Muslims, traditional and religious leaders, teachers, students, farmers, market traders, villagers, women and children. But I would highlight in particular the attack on Christians and the attack on girls, especially girls studying, who are a strong symbol of change in their own societies. The numbers are frightening: around 13 000 killed since 2009 – more than half of this number in the course of 2014. There are 1.5 million internally-displaced people in Nigeria, 155 000 refugees in Niger, 37 000 in Cameroon and 11 000 in Chad, putting stress on local communities and potentially creating further conflicts. The breakdown of administration and law and order in wide areas of north-east Nigeria will also make the holding of elections in these three states increasingly difficult. The EU is committed – and will probably need to be even more committed – to supporting these countries in the struggle against Boko Haram. The question is: what can we effectively do in the short term and in the long term? Whatever we do, we need to do it in close cooperation with the countries affected. In the short term there must be an effective military and humanitarian response to the crisis. The countries of the region have undertaken to create a Multinational Joint Task Force, which has not yet been mobilised. The EU is willing to help support the coordination of this force and is already providing EUR 10 million in counter-terrorism assistance to the Office of the Nigerian National Security Advisor. The EU Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO) is also providing what humanitarian help it can to the refugees and displaced. In the medium term, it is crucial that the people of these states also have the prospect of development and jobs and a government that can protect them and respond to their needs. To win this war, the ‘hearts and minds’ of the populations affected have to be won, otherwise our efforts, including at security level, will not achieve their target. And rules of engagement have to be respected by the security forces. This is the message we conveyed at the last Ministerial Dialogue with Nigeria in November, when we invited Nigeria to speed up the implementation of the planned actions and to reinforce respect for human rights so that the European Union and its Member States can join forces with local initiatives in a more concrete and effective way.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 194, "date": "2015-01-14.json", "name": "Davor Ivo Stier", "mepid": "119435", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Club. – Mr. President, High Representative, while the attention of our European and world public focused primarily on the barbaric attack in Paris, in Nigeria Boko Haram literally razed the place baga. That is why I would like to repeat the words of Nigerian Catholic Archbishop Ignatius Kaiga here and quote: \"I see a very positive response from the French Government after the killing of French citizens. It is necessary for such a spirit to spread further, not only when it comes to attacks in Europe, but when it happens in Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon or other poorer countries. We need to mobilise international resources to stand up to those who have caused so much pain to so many families.\" Colleagues, it is normal for us to react more strongly when something is happening in our continent. We can and must be proud of the solidarity of the people and citizens of all Europe with the victims in Paris. But our values are universal and therefore we must show active solidarity towards the victims of Islamic radicalism in Nigeria. Two thousand people were massacred by Boko Haram in the town of Baga. It's time to say Je suis Baga aussi. Because the attack on Baga is also an attack on our values, Boko Haram establishes a caliphate in the north of Nigeria and becomes a global threat such as jihadists in Syria, Iraq or Libya.  Finally, one of my observations as a member of the Development Committee: we must adapt our development cooperation to the new priorities of counterterrorism and radicalism, because let's not kid ourselves, Boko Haram is making so much progress among other things because on the other hand the weak institutions of the Nigerian state and endemic corruption. Therefore, building effective institutions and fighting corruption are a key goal that we must achieve through European development aid policy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 195, "date": "2015-01-14.json", "name": "Norbert Neuser", "mepid": "96844", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group.

It is essential that we demand the political elites in these countries, and especially in Nigeria. Member States have helped to train security forces in Nigeria, but to no avail. On the contrary! The security forces operate partly without democratic legitimacy, without control, without pressure for justification. This, too, is part of the truth when we look at the causes of the emergence of Boko Haram and other terrorist groups. We need to see how we fight corruption in Nigeria in particular. In the last ten years alone, EUR 80 million has disappeared in the gas and oil industry – money that this country desperately needs to establish fair conditions. We have a political leadership elite that enriches itself – just like the military, as well as businessmen – while at the same time absolute, extreme poverty.

Open diverse societies threaten the misguided dogma of violent Islamism. Therefore, we must be even more resilient in defending that openness. Not only do these extremists select symbols of freedom of expression – a universal human right – but in Nigeria, girls’ education or any education at all is the prime target of Boco Haram, which literally means ‘forbidden book’ or ‘Western education is forbidden’. Forcing people to adhere to one’s ideology with such extreme violence is the clearest sign of weakness imaginable. Back in 2011, when I was an observer to the presidential elections in Nigeria, volunteers of the Youth Service Corps were killed in terrorist attacks. The Youth Service Corps actively volunteered to help run the elections, and as such the attack marked an attack on all sons and daughters of Nigeria. This week, by using a child as a suicide bomber, new levels of barbarism and a lack of humanity have been shown. We condemn these attacks in the strongest possible terms and send our condolences to the families of the victims. It is important in Europe that we are fully aware of the global nature of the jihadist terror, in which perpetrators and victims come from all corners of the world. It is also important to recognise that in Nigeria the impact of terrorism has become the rule rather than the exception.

The atrocities that were committed by Boko Haram in Baga are utterly deplorable and, in fact, border on the unimaginable. More than 2 000 people were murdered over the course of a number of days, and the government and state security forces were simply unfit to intervene to save them. It has to be noted – as has already been said – that the Nigerian state is not exempt from responsibility for the recent escalations through a series of deplorable human rights abuses. Amnesty International, for example, believes that at least 950 suspected members of Boko Haram died as a result of overcrowding, starvation, brutality and extrajudicial executions while in state custody in Nigeria in the first half of 2013 alone. Having said that, nothing could possible excuse the actions of Boko Haram. To strap a bomb to a child and detonate it is a vile, indefensible act that has shocked probably even the most seasoned of conflict observers. So there is now a moral responsibility on us all to show the same outrage and invest the same resources in addressing the causes and consequences of these atrocities as we would if they were happening anywhere else in the world. In a week when this House rightly defended media freedom of speech, we must also state that international media organisations have a moral duty to bring the situation in Nigeria to prominent public attention in Europe and across the world, because only then will we force governments to contribute positively and in a measured manner to the quest for stability and justice in the region.

Let me point out that the Nigerian army fled when this attack happened. Nigeria is a rich country but, of course, we need to support their fight against terrorism. One means of doing that is by supporting the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the cooperation organisation of West African countries which has reiterated its commitment to work with the government of Nigeria, the ECOWAS Member States and all stakeholders so that terrorist attacks of this kind come to an end.

Reliable information can be difficult to obtain out of Nigeria at the moment, but the latest suggestions are that up to 2 000 people have been killed in the latest campaign of terror, during which over 1.5 million people have had to flee the fighting. Then, of course, there is the fact that these same extremist Islamists kidnapped 276 schoolgirls in April last year, and most are still missing. It has been reported that a number have been sold on as slaves and have been forced to convert to Islam. In October, it was reported that two girls escaped captivity and made it back to their families. They said they had been held in a camp in Cameroon and raped every day. It is barbaric! Resolving this crisis will be difficult, and there are no easy answers or quick-fix solutions. What I think we can be sure of is that the European Union or the West is unlikely to be any more successful in Nigeria than we have been elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa.

Thank you very much for this chance because on Sunday, while we were marching in Paris, I was also thinking, exactly as many of you here, that it was not only hypocritical but also counterproductive not to say or do anything about what was happening – apparently many kilometres from Paris but really very close to Paris – because, as almost all of you said, these two things and many other things are so closely interlinked that we cannot be under any illusion that we can solve one problem without also tackling the others. That is why I know we do not solve the problems of the world with statements. I have to say that I have a certain negative reaction whenever I am asked to make a statement on everything. But in some cases a statement is symbolic; and I decided that a statement on that day had to be my statement, and not a spokesperson’s statement, because we have to speak and act with the same strength and with the same coherence, whether in Paris or in Nigeria. At the same time I agree very much with what many of you have said about the fact that we need to act on different levels. It is not only, obviously, the first reaction, the point about the security of the people in Nigeria and the rights of the people, starting with girls in Nigeria. It is also a matter of creating an environment which makes it less probable or possible for this phenomenon to arise, so that the people of Nigeria and the surrounding countries have a proper future and a proper present in their countries and in their lives. I believe that this is something that, for sure, we have to do. I said at the beginning what we are already doing, whether on the security side or on the humanitarian side or on the development side. I welcome your invitation to do more. You can be certain that I will come with something more, probably more with the foreign ministers than in other formats, especially when it comes to the security aspect. But let me underline what many of you said about the need to do this in a framework which is not an EU framework only. We need to work very much with the region, with the African Union, with the UN framework. We need to work in a coordinated way.

It is known that Boko Haram is an extremist Islamist group that believes education and books should be banned, killing more than 10,000 people last year alone. Nigeria's president, Goodluck Jonathan, who expressed his opinion on the Paris attacks, did not comment on the atrocities in his own country. Even if Nigeria prepares for next month's presidential and parliamentary elections, I think it is unimaginable to want to maintain your image, to the detriment of peace and security, and the fight against terrorism becomes virtually impossible. I believe it necessary for European states with economic interests in the area to have a constructive and effective dialogue with the Nigerian authorities in order to fight terrorism and to respect the fundamental rights of citizens.

I welcome the address of this issue at the next Regional Security Conference in Niamey on 20 January.

I was wondering whether there were any moments that were not particularly important in relation to the situation in Ukraine in the last 11, 12 or 13 months, and there were probably not. But this gives me the chance to report to you in plenary about the work that is going on at my level and also about my recent visit to Ukraine. I visited Kiev on 16 and 17 December 2014, almost one month ago. My messages there, which I also had the chance to share with the European Council on my way back, were about the European Union’s full support for the full and swift implementation of the Minsk Protocol and Memorandum, the need for a credible process of reforms to deliver on public expectations for an improved way of governance, and the EU’s readiness to support and assist this process. A year back, you would probably not have expected that Ukraine would now have a new president, a new parliament and a new government. This is to say that we have to give credit for the positive developments that the Ukrainians have managed in these difficult months. I will come back, obviously, to the situation in the east of the country, but let me concentrate first – as the Ukrainian leadership that I met in December did – on the internal situation of Ukraine. We now have a relatively new leadership in place: a new government, parliament and president fully committed not only to a process to resolve the situation in the east but also to the core, necessary reforms in the country. The Ukrainian reforms are crucial, first of all, in terms of responding to the high expectations and aspirations of the Ukrainian people, who expressed those aspirations very clearly in the last two elections. Meeting especially with civil society organisations and NGOs and activists in Kiev, I found it interesting to listen to how their focus was very much on delivering internal changes. There are systemic issues that need to be addressed, including corruption, constitutional reform and decentralisation. Here, apart from the work that the European Union can do, there is a lot that the Council of Europe and the Venice Commission can do to assist in judicial reform, energy sector reform, electoral reform and reform of the business climate. Again, meeting with our 28 Member States’ Ambassadors to Ukraine, I was impressed by the common indication from all 28 Ambassadors in Kiev that, on the one hand, they supported financial assistance but, on the other, that they recognised the need to create a business environment that enables private investment to continue, or to return to Ukraine, in an effective way. The list of reforms is long and obviously very difficult, but Ukraine will find – and is already finding – support for these reforms on our side. Last week the Commission proposed a third macro-financial assistance programme for EUR 1.8 billion. This is an additional sign of the EU’s solidarity with Ukraine and also part of a bigger international effort based, of course, on conditionality principles. In the light of the very difficult financial situation that Ukraine is facing – and I remind you that this programme is not a blank check and will be strictly conditioned – I count on the European Parliament’s support to finalise this assistance. However, it is very difficult to reform while facing a conflict on your own territory, and I think that here we have two main responsibilities. The first, as I have said, is to support the internal, difficult, challenging but needed reform process inside Ukraine. The second is to work on the dramatic humanitarian impact of the conflict. This is an issue that I know is crucial for some of you, and I think that the international community, starting with the European Union, needs to do more. Support for those who have left and those who have stayed is crucial. We have been discussing this with the Ukrainian authorities because the support has to come not only from the international community but also from the authorities in Kiev, and they are willing to give it. The problem of access for humanitarian aid has to be solved. Access needs to be ensured. So far, the Union has committed EUR 32 million in humanitarian and recovery aid, and it will continue helping if our support is increased. But then there is the security situation on the ground and the political process for talks and a solution to the conflict. Let me state here again our committed and united position on the conflict, and let me also quote the Latvian Prime Minister, who said, when presenting the priorities for the Presidency this morning, that our strength is unity. It has been unity and it has to continue to be unity. I will keep this in mind not only during the debate today but also in relation to the work that we have to carry out in the coming months. Our common, agreed and shared position in the European Union is precious, and that is the need to work for a solution to the conflict in the east of the country – a sustainable solution that respects sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Ukraine. We are doing all that we can to make this process work. On 9 December 2014, President Poroshenko declared a ‘Day of Silence’, and since then, until yesterday, I have to say – and the Ukrainian authorities confirm – that the situation had been improving significantly. Yesterday, again, there were 12 victims. Let me use this opportunity to say that this must not become a trend. What happened was a dramatic, terrible event, and I hope that we can go back to the previous situation which, from the Day of Silence on 9 December until some of the breaches of the ceasefire, was relatively calmer than it had been. Commitment to the ceasefire is a necessary prerequisite for any resolution of the crisis. In recent weeks, as you know, there has been a re-intensification of the talks in different formats. On the one hand, in the Normandy format, this has created some elements of hope, but the conditions were not created for a meeting in Astana to be convened at this time. At the same time, efforts were undertaken by the Latvian Presidency. We discussed this with the Latvian Foreign Minister last week in Riga, and he paid a visit to Kiev and then to Moscow on Monday. I know that many of you will ask what the European Union’s role is here – some of you had the chance to ask me that question already in a different meeting – so let me reassure you from the beginning that what we are trying to do is to make sure that, with the Presidency format and the Normandy format, this is taking place in a framework of European Union efforts. This means that the channels of communication are not only for information but also for coordination, so that the steps which need to be taken are taken together at different levels. The Latvian Foreign Minister and the French and German Foreign Ministers are going to report back to the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday. Obviously we have been in more than close contact over these weeks – not days, but weeks. At the same time, as I said in my hearing before the European Parliament before taking office, it is time for the Union to reflect on a less reactive, and a more proactive, approach in our relations with Russia. This is why the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday will start a strategic discussion on EU-Russia relations. The question is not about going back to ‘business as usual’. It is very clear to all of us – and here again there is unity – that there is no going back to anything. On the other hand, however, we need first of all to share positions and considerations and not leave matters of political or technical dialogue to individual national considerations. We need to work in a coordinated way, and not only in relation to the instruments we have for engaging Russia on implementation of the Minsk Agreement. We have used the OSCE, we can use the Normandy format and we can use the Latvian Presidency, in a common European Union framework, and we have been engaged in discussions here, always in coordination with President Tusk and President Juncker. At the same time, we need to assess together – all 28 Member States and the Commission – all the instruments that we have for engaging Russia with positive leverage. That does not mean that we are offering something: it means that we have to be aware of all the different channels that were open, were closed, were frozen or suspended. We need to be aware of what stage we are at, on different tracks, for example with regard to foreign policy – because we do discuss with Russia issues such as the Iranian talks, Syria and the Middle East process, processes that are within the UN Security Council framework. The Americans do this, as do individual Member States, and we need a common framework for doing that in a more transparent and coherent way. When it comes to other forms of dialogue, for example at technical level – think of the efforts the European Union has made on facilitating an energy agreement between the Russian Federation and Ukraine – or in relation to other elements, we need to review where we are, at what stage we are on different aspects, and what can be used in positive or negative terms to try to influence, in the best possible way, a change in Russian behaviour on Ukraine.

Firstly, why are the European Union and you, as Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, absent from the Ukrainian talks? Why is your chair empty? Why do we not have the Geneva rather than the Normandy format? The Latvian Presidency is not a substitute. It should be you there, as our Foreign Minister.

We are doing for Ukraine, with our CSDP instruments, less than we are doing – with all due respect – for Somalia, military training being an example. Thirdly, why is there no major and visible EU-branded humanitarian aid to Ukraine? The sum of EUR 32 million is ridiculously small, and it is not ‘EU’ aid – it comes through intermediaries. Fourthly, why is there no information campaign to counter the Russian information war? To recall your words in the previous debate, we are not a superpower in relation to Ukraine. We are a dwarf. We are a payer, not a player. We are punching below our weight, we are having less impact than we could, and your policy on that is too timid. The EU does a lot but not enough.

Solidarity is demonstrated not by our speeches here in Parliament, but by action. The International Red Cross would be a quick solution, and aid must be quick, because they need it now, not in the summer. In order to really improve the situation, we are repeating today that the withdrawal of russian soldiers and mercenaries must now take place, not at some point. We call on all parties to implement the Minsk Protocol agreements without delay. I know it is not an easy time for the government in Ukraine and it has already done a lot. The elections are a positive example. And yet it is now important to advance and implement reforms independently of the conflict: among other things, to consolidate the functioning rule of law, to obtain independent justice, to carry out constitutional reform, including the necessary decentralisation, and, above all, to fight corruption.  Then the people of Ukraine will feel the difference – the difference for which they once moved to the Majdan.

It is a very good document. I can say I subscribe to every word there is in it. But let me make three general points. First, Ukraine faces two major challenges: it has to reform itself, and it has to defend itself at the same time. It does not require a genius to know that it is extremely difficult, and without outside help it cannot succeed. Second, Russia’s behaviour is largely predictable. Whatever the effect of sanctions and oil prices, it will be following the same course in the foreseeable future. History teaches us that change in Russian politics has always resulted from the internal reshuffling of power. Third, Europe’s policy towards Russia. The problem is that we simply do not know who is running the show. Is it Mrs Merkel? Is it you, Ms Mogherini? Is it Mr Hollande, Mr Steinmeier, the Prime Minister of Latvia?

What has happened since Minsk? Did Russia really try to show good will? Did Russia really try to help broker peace in East Ukraine? Did Russia really try to monitor its border and prevent irregular troops and others from entering eastern Ukraine? No, that has not happened. Has there been any positive sign from Putin concerning the Crimea? None. Nothing has led to a positive outcome up till now. There will be no Astana Conference because Minsk did not produce anything substantial. I think that the sanctions should do the work, and the sanctions are working – together with the low oil prices – so the Russian economy is in trouble. I am not happy because of that, but I hope that it will hurt Putin enough to be sensible and indeed go to the negotiating table, wherever that table is, whether it is in public or in private, and produce results. Only if there are results on the ground – and that means the recognition that Ukraine is an independent nation with internationally-recognised borders – can we go further. That is what we should do now. We can try to help the people in the Donbass, and for that we can try to help Ukraine to reform. That is essential, because otherwise there will be a kind of Ukraine fatigue where people say ‘Ukraine again?’ So we should help them.

Ladies and gentlemen, if we are not only to speak out verbally for an immediate peace in Ukraine and its territorial integrity, we must finally put ritualised rhetoric behind us and assess processes in real terms. There will be no military solution in eastern Ukraine, and at the latest both sides, the political and military leaders in Kiev and Donbass, will have to make their contribution to peace. Whether they do that and, if not, why not, would be discussed in concrete terms. It would be a matter of debate whether Mr Yatsenyuk is really the EU's natural ally, despite his electoral legitimacy. His political credo, which he presented in Berlin these days, is: there is always only the other guilt, politically uncomfortable and his own actions are talked about beautifully in the mainstream lexic. What his government has done to date is massively frozen social benefits, mass redundancies, drastic price increases, it is a privatization program that is completely unregulated even after ukrainian media, which once again only makes oligarchs like Firtash richer and more influential. These are drastically increased military expenditures, of which 30 percent have disappeared in corrupt channels.

There would be no reason at all to discuss a humanitarian emergency in eastern Ukraine if Russian strategists – I do not know exactly when – had decided that they were not prepared to accept Ukraine's territorial integrity. It may not suit you, but the problem has started with the annexation of Crimea, and it has continued with the systematic destabilisation, supported by Russia, in eastern Ukraine. Unfortunately, the causes of the war in eastern Ukraine must now be sought in the Russian Government. No one, especially no German, would dare to claim today that Belgium had started shooting.  All I really ask is that you stick to the causes of the problem in the analysis of this conflict.  (Applause) Minsk, Minsk is an agreement that has been reached because the Europeans have put pressure on the Ukrainian government and on the Russian government to negotiate. The Minsk agreement is a compromise, very much in favour of those responsible for terror in eastern Ukraine.

It is the case that Russia invaded and annexed a foreign country, and that the Minsk agreement is an attempt to ensure that this is managed.

The best way out of this situation will be to adopt or set clear goals that will unite us. Compliance with the Minsk provisions has proved problematic for the Russian side from the outset. The ceasefire, the unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine, the halting of the armaments of armed groups or mercenaries, the exchange of all – I repeat all – prisoners and the restoration of Ukrainian control of the territory of the whole country seem to be obvious conditions here. It is important to emphasise here the restoration of control over the territory of the whole country, because I have the impression that we are already forgetting Crimea, and yet it all began.  The warming of Moscow's image, even if it is visible, is only illusory.

This is what many analysts and experts, such as Alex Motyl and Anders Åslund, are saying. Even George Soros is saying this.

I would like to highlight two points which are essential for the imminent management of the conflict: the European Union must strengthen its efforts to ensure that humanitarian aid to eastern Ukraine is carried out in full compliance with international humanitarian law, in neutrality and in close coordination with the Ukrainian Government, the UN and the Central Committee of the Red Cross; Russia's respect for these same principles would remove doubts about the cargoes of humanitarian convoys, as an alibi for illegal trafficking in military equipment.

Unfortunately, the situation has not changed much. We appreciate that there is a new government in Ukraine after democratic elections. She has the will to reform, but she has problems because her country is devastated. Ukraine needs our help, not only moral, political, but especially material, which is why I also welcome the financial support so far and the current increase in the loan. However, support for Ukraine in terms of expertise and expertise in a number of areas that must undergo reform is equally important. I would like to be more specific, because I was in Ukraine in mid-November and I have repeatedly dealt with Members and school representatives and I am still in contact with them. I know that it is in the field of education that they are preparing a fundamental reform and they expect our help.

And the context is that in the east of Ukraine there is a regular war, a war with tanks, with daily shelling of people, with the death of soldiers and civilians. And from the perspective of Brussels or Strasbourg, it seems that Donetsk, Luhansk is somewhere far away, but from warsaw's perspective it is very close and not coincidentally today the Polish delegation is very in agreement and in assessing the situation, and in proposing solutions. There is no doubt that the resolution of the case in the East, the resolution of the Ukrainian case, is a question of the security of the European Union, the security of all of us, one of the most urgent, most important issues to be resolved.  And here the role of Russia is crucial, because it is the Russian troops that support the separatists, the Russian media are engaged in anti-European and anti-democratic propaganda on a huge scale. The European Union cannot be divided in the face of these events, it cannot be hesitant. We must be consistent and consistent in showing disagreement with the integrity of borders established in international agreements.

Perhaps I can make a suggestion for organising our calendar in a wiser way, because I think it is a pity that we face such an important discussion at this late hour in the evening. We still have three debates to go, and I think it is a pity that so many Members of Parliament have left. So this is just an invitation to the Presidency to think, perhaps, of a better way of organising our work. Let me restate what many of you said tonight: that unity is our strength. We need to keep this unity; we need to keep this strength. I know very well what my responsibility is: it is to work on the unity of the European Union, be it in the Council, be it in the Commission – and be assured that the unity of our efforts and our objectives is there, on the Commission side and on the Council side – or be it at the European Council, where we had a strategic discussion on this question in December with the Heads of State and Government, or at the level of the Council of Foreign Ministers, which will meet again on Monday for the second time in two-and-a-half months. I have been in office now for two-and-a-half months, and the majority of my time has been dedicated to this unity on the message and on the proposals, be it on the support for Ukraine internally, or be it on the strategy that we need towards Russia. Let me quote Mr Brok and others in saying that our role, and my role, is to support any form and any format of dialogue that can make us, and can make the Ukrainians, first of all, together with the Russians, move towards positive results on our common objective, which is a resolution to the conflict based on respect for, and the restoration of, Ukrainian sovereignty and Ukrainian integrity and on respect for international principles and basic laws – which means no change of borders by force. Maybe I did not underline that point well enough at the beginning. I took it for granted: we have been saying it for such a long time that I expected the Chamber to share this position, which is natural to me. I understand from the debate that this is not the case, and I would invite you, too, to exercise your personal, individual, political and institutional responsibility to work on signs of unity coming from this Chamber, because this is also the European Union voice. And let me say that I am quite worried by the level of the debate tonight. Let me also say something that I did not mention before, on a question which was asked during the debate. I am going to underline it clearly: it has not only been stated by me several times but it is also in all our official positions. There is not going to be any change in our policy on the non-recognition of the annexation of Crimea. That is clear; that is to be taken for granted; that is not going to be changed. You do not change borders by force: not in this continent, not in this century, not in this millennium. You do not do it, and we will never accept anything like that. Not only will we never accept something like that, but we will always keep our non-recognition policy. Now, when it comes to my role, my job, you are right: I lead the European Union’s foreign policy and security policy. But my role is more complicated than worrying about what and where my chair is, or perhaps what table I should be at, because my real point is to have a table that works: one that yields results. I am sorry to say that very bluntly, but my main preoccupation day and night is not where I am sitting. My main preoccupation is to create the conditions for negotiations to be successful. If we manage to move forward on resolving the conflict in the east of Ukraine that will be my result. It will not be to get a picture at a negotiation table. Whatever I can do to facilitate that – whatever I can do with other European ministers, or the prime ministers or presidents, or the Members of the European Parliament or of other regional organisations – I will do. My objective is to contribute to resolving the crisis: playing in full the European Union role but also, if possible, being smart and intelligent in playing that role. And we have to understand what is the best that we can do, at what times and in what format. As many of you have said, we have to support, in a cooperative and intelligent way, anything that we see can work, starting with the full implementation of the Minsk Agreement. Now, what are we united on? There were some basic elements in the debate tonight, and, while this is not my role, let me personally invite you to explore the possibilities of having a joint, united message and a joint resolution. I think we are united on the support for Ukraine at different levels. On the political level, first of all, on 15 December 2014 we had the first European Union / Ukraine Association Council meeting following the Association Agreement, and there we defined, together with the Ukrainian Government, the ways in which the Union will support the reform programme in Ukraine, including through technical assistance. Secondly, on security – and if this went unnoticed by some of you, we will definitely need to improve our communication strategy internally – we started our EU assistance mission on reform of the civil security sector in Ukraine on 1 December 2014. This is a concrete thing that the Union is doing to support Ukraine in the security sector, and I think that you should listen to the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian authorities with regard to the recognition they give to our role in that. Thirdly, the support for Ukraine on a humanitarian level. If you put everything together – what we do on development, what we do on humanitarian assistance and what Member States do – it comes, all in all, to EUR 74 million, which makes the EU the first and most active supporter of the situation in Ukraine on a humanitarian level. Is all of this it enough? I do not think so. Again, we will need to work – including, as one of the last speakers mentioned, with the people of Ukraine, civil society organisations, young people and those who a year ago were in the Maidan. Not all of them were in the Maidan, but many of them were. We have work to do on the role and empowerment of civil society in Ukraine. Civil society can play a major role in monitoring and supporting the reform process in the country, and this is key. I was surprised when I was there last time, on 17 December 2014, at how high on the agenda the issue of reforms was for all the actors that I met, whether in government, other institutions, civil society or parliament. In some cases, reform was higher on the agenda than the security issue. This is a message coming from Ukraine that we must not underestimate. We need to work very hard on this issue, and to work at their side. A second element that I think unites us, or at least the majority of us here – and it certainly unites the Council and the Commission unanimously – is the need to keep up the pressure on Russia. Again, maybe I was not clear enough in my opening remarks. I took it for granted that we start not always from zero but from where we left off last time we met, and we do not always have to repeat and reiterate our common positions. But that is clear. Sanctions on Russia are in place and, yes, they have worked economically. Have they worked politically? Maybe they are starting to. But it is clear –and again it has been expressed repeatedly, not only by me but also by President Tusk recently – that we are going to continue working on this, as we have been working in these months, hand-in-hand, because this is not only foreign policy, it is also internal policy. Any decisions on sanctions would be based on concrete developments on the ground. This is, I think, something that no one has talked about. The real point is the third element. Many of you have insisted on the need to have a dialogue. That is the point – probably the missing point on our side. I alluded to it when I said we have to be less reactive and more proactive, when I said we need to be more strategic and to develop a comprehensive approach – a comprehensive European Union approach – towards Russia. That is what we need to do, making it clear that the sanctions are based on the situation on the ground. Evaluation of that is going to mean taking stock of the situation on the ground and of developments, negative or positive, or the fact of no development. On the other hand, it does not mean that we do not have to talk: first of all because it is difficult to negotiate if you do not talk to the people you have to negotiate with, and secondly because the Ukrainians and the Russians are talking to each other, and we need to support that dialogue. So, talking about opening channels of dialogue with Russia from the EU side – as the Latvian Presidency did at the very beginning, as some of the Member States are doing and as I have been doing by having a bilateral meeting with Foreign Minister Lavrov in December – I think this is my duty. It is the only way in which we can play our role.

I believe that radical measures are needed to achieve change: the elimination of corruption and double standards, the capitalization of the economy, the full respect of human and civil rights for both the majority and the minority.

Secondly, EU has to be adamant in maintaining non-recognition policy towards Crimea.

The EU has been engaged in development cooperation since 1957. It has long been the largest donor of official development assistance in the world and aspires to continue to remain the largest donor for the years to come. This is something we can be proud of, but it is also something which is unknown to many of our own citizens, however supportive they are of development cooperation. Hence we need to communicate more and better on what we do. The European Year for Development will highlight the results that the EU, acting together with its Member States, has achieved and will continue to strive for in the future. We will work to foster direct involvement and critical thinking on the part of EU citizens and stakeholders in development cooperation. We want to show that EU development cooperation is good not only for EU partner countries but also for EU citizens. In a changing and increasingly interdependent world in which major shifts have taken place in the global economic and political balance, we should spare no effort to stimulate a sense of shared responsibility and solidarity among citizens in Europe and in partner countries. The 2014 Eurobarometer paints a clear picture. More than 85% of EU citizens say that the EU should continue development cooperation efforts, and 67% think that the EU should actually be giving more aid. This is despite the current economic difficulties. At the same time, EU citizens also demand that we use public funds effectively and efficiently to achieve concrete results in terms of reducing poverty and building a more stable, peaceful, prosperous and equitable world. In 2015, the international community will have to agree on a new post-2015 development agenda. We will have the third Financing for Development Conference in July in Addis Ababa, the UN post-2015 Summit in September, and the global climate agreement at COP 21 in Paris in December. The European Year for Development will enrich the debate on the challenges we face in shaping future EU development policies. The twelve thematic months will put a strong focus on some of the most important topics related to development: education, gender, food security, demography, immigration, human rights and governance, to name but a few. The EU institutions and Member States, but also local authorities, NGOs social partners and the private sector, will be closely involved. The European Year for Development was launched in Riga on 9 January this year with the presence of Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, Ms Federica Mogherini, the Prime Minister of Latvia, Ms Laimdota Straujuma and the Chair of the Committee on Development of the European Parliament, Ms Linda McAvan. The Riga event focused on good governance as a key priority for the EU both at home and in the post-2015 process. Several Member States will officially launch their own programmes in the coming days: Belgium, Austria, Ireland and France are some examples. The Member States will organise a large number of events and activities at all levels throughout the year. In addition to the Riga event last week, in March the Latvian Presidency will hold a high-level conference in Riga on gender, women’s economic empowerment and sustainable development in the post-2015 agenda. Apart from high-visibility events in Latvia, we have centralised the activities to make the year as close to the citizens as possible. It will be implemented by all relevant stakeholders, NGOs, private sector representatives, academia, line ministries and local authorities. In May, Expo Milan will open its doors to thousands of visitors, involving them and inviting them to reflect on the theme of ‘Feeding the planet, energy for life’. This will be another unique opportunity for the EU to showcase the achievements of its development policy. I would like to underline how well the European Parliament, the Council, the Member States and the Commission have worked together in preparing the European Year for Development. The European Parliament played a key role, and Mr Charles Goerens has been a very dedicated and enthusiastic rapporteur. The discussions and exchanges between the European Parliament and the Council have always been constructive. The programme of activities prepared by the European Parliament will make a significant contribution to that success. I have no doubt that we will all continue to demonstrate the shared sense of commitment and implementation throughout 2015. I can assure you that the Presidency will do its utmost to ensure the success of this important endeavour.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 319, "date": "2015-01-14.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Madam President, I would like to thank the Latvian Presidency very much for the launch of the year that they organised last Friday in Riga. I was personally very happy to be present, together with the Prime Minister, the Presidents of the Commission, the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee, and Linda McAvan. It allowed us to highlight the important role of the European Parliament in the process and also that of many NGOs and young people. I think that one of the things that we will need to work on very much – and I really appreciate the Latvian Presidency’s focus on that – is to make this year a European Year, a Year of the European People, and not only an institutional year. We have to use, in particular, the links through NGOs, civil society organisations, schools, universities, and young people. You have also presented a couple of exciting competitions for normal people. I think this is really going to be a very unique opportunity – a unique opportunity in a unique year somehow. The year 2015 is the year in which the Millennium Development Goals come to an end. Some of them will have results, some of them will not. It is also the year in which the whole global community is going to be working on the final decisions on the post-2015 agenda. This will give us Europeans, in particular, the chance to work on our own internal responsibilities, as most likely the post-2015 agenda will also ask us to meet some goals internally – we tend to forget that we also have problems of inequality, poverty, lack of access to basic fundamental rights – and to work seriously on policy coherence internally, as I said, but also externally. I think this is going to be a great chance for us together, without partners in the rest of the world, to work on the root causes of not meeting Millennium Development Goals this year – and also on those that were met – on ways of improving results. I would only say that tonight I also speak on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Mimica, who unfortunately, due to the time could not be present, and on behalf of Commissioner Vella. They were both present at the launch of the year in Riga last week, and together with them we stand ready to work together with the Presidency, the Council, the European Parliament and all the stakeholders, starting from the international ones and the NGOs, to make this year a success.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 320, "date": "2015-01-14.json", "name": "President. -", "mepid": "28115", "text": "   Thank you, Ms Mogherini, for what has been a long day for you here in the Chamber, but this is an important debate so we appreciate your presence.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 321, "date": "2015-01-14.json", "name": "Davor Ivo Stier", "mepid": "119435", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Club. - Madam Presidents, Europe's security and prosperity are more than ever linked to events on other continents in poorly developed countries that are often covered by armed conflicts or epidemics that they cannot control on their own and which then become global threats.  Therefore, for moral, humanistic reasons, but also for security-political reasons, Europe has a strong policy of development cooperation, and as we heard from President Juncker at the opening of the European Year of Development in Riga, and now from the High Representative, the European Union intends to maintain a leadership position in development cooperation, strengthen its global role, continue to be a force for good in the world, and thus ensure peace , safety, health and prosperity to European citizens. However, it is essential that this message reaches European citizens. To include them more than ever in defining priorities in development cooperation. This should also be the main purpose of the European year of development, especially at a time when a new development framework is being negotiated on the international stage to replace the Millennium Goals. In November, we adopted a resolution setting out the priorities the European Parliament wants to highlight in a new, global development framework, which must be transformative and focus not only on symptoms, but also on the causes of poverty and inequality in the world. These priorities are the promotion of the rule of law, the building of effective institutions, the fight against corruption. This was not the focus of the Millennium Goals, but it must now become part of a new development framework, because without it we will neither eradicate poverty nor reduce inequalities.  I would like to end the last seconds I have to congratulate the leadership shown by the Latvian presidency and let me also express our appreciation to the High Representative - not only for being during this very long afternoon, almost evening, here with us, but also for the leadership that she is showing in these particular development issues. I think it is very important, we really appreciate it and we look forward to working with you in the future. Thank you.

I know she is coordinating across many departments now to lead on this issue in the next few months, and that is crucial for Parliament. We now have to build on our words tonight and the warm words in Riga to make the year a year of action. We will have the first chance in New York in September, when we will get together to replace the MDGs by the sustainable development goals (SDGs). My lesson from the last 15 years of MDGs is that development policy works. Millions of people have been lifted out of poverty, millions of people now have access to water and sanitation and millions of children are now going to school. So we need to see that same kind of commitment now to the SDGs, so that after the end of this year we have laid the foundations for a real legacy of the European Year for Development. Linked to the debate on the SDGs is, of course, the climate change agenda, and we will have the climate talks in Paris in December. It is the poorest in the world who are already paying the price of climate change, and we have to link climate change and development, which is why it is very important that we have the kind of coordination that I know you, Mrs Mogherini, are leading in the Commission. I hope we will also see support in 2015 from the Commission and the Council on an updated gender action plan for the European Union. In too many countries, progress and our rights as women are being undermined and women are being subjected to violent attacks in conflict situations: by Boko Haram, in the DRC and in Syria. We want action on that. Finally, we want to work with NGOs, which are vital to our work in this European Year of Development. It was great that the Latvians got behind this idea.

Our world, our dignity, our future. An unbeatable motto for a year that is also for the balance and evaluation of the Millennium Development Goals. In these fifteen years we have achieved some very important achievements on these eight objectives, such as halving the extreme poverty rate, stabilizing HIV and advancing the fight against malaria and tuberculosis. But it's also time to take on our mistakes, limitations and failures.  In 2015 we will not get all children to access and finish primary education; nor eliminate gender inequality. We have not improved enough in infant mortality or universal access to reproductive health. Drinking water supply remains a challenge in many parts of the world and the digital divide is actually an abyss. We can't be satisfied. That is why we must renew the commitment of the future that we entered into in 2000, of a future that belongs to children. The year 2014, the 25th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, has been a dreadous year for them. Unicef reminds us that 230 million children live in conflict zones. Some, protracted crises, forgotten or barely news of a day by horrific episodes, such as Boko Haram's brutal actions or the Taliban massacre of Peshawar. Terrifying numbers of displaced children, mutilated, executed, abducted, tortured, recruited, raped and even sold into slavery. There is no development without education. There is no education without freedom and equality. There is no freedom and equality without respect for human rights. There is therefore no development without respect for human rights. So, that's the marker of our actions. The European Year of Development will be that of children or not. The Millennium Development Goals will be children or not.

This goes into three steps: good coordination within the European Commission, improved coordination between the European institutions and good coordination among the EU Member States responsible for the implementation of development cooperation in the Council. In addition to the European Union, some countries, such as Denmark and Finland, regularly submit a coherence report to their national parliaments. It would be a great success of the European Year of Development if all the European nations followed suit.  We should also use the development theme year to link further national initiatives with the European level. In the Federal Republic of Germany, for example, there is a Bundestag motion \"Good work worldwide\", which appeals to the worldwide implementation of the ILO labour standards. In addition, there is an initiative by the Federal Development Minister in Germany for a textile alliance, but this has reached its limits.  The initiative should improve working conditions in the countries of origin by tracing the retail chains in the textile industry. However, because fair trade is so complex, such initiatives are successful not at national level, but at EU level.  I therefore call on our Commissioner for Development and the High Representative to take the lead on these initiatives from the European Commission. It would also be desirable for the Commission to be able to provide further information materials on the European Year of Development that are suitable for young people. This makes it even easier to become a European Year of Citizens.

This is because climate change threatens to undermine decades of development and puts future development trajectories at risk. Many of the main drivers behind poverty in developing countries are intertwined with climate change. Increased drought, for example, leads to crop failure and food insecurity, reduces opportunities and boosts inequality around the world. When dealing with the issue of development, we should strongly promote environmental initiatives, energy efficiency, exchange of technologies and best practices, investment in public education and in disaster risk reduction and, more generally, emphasise low carbon emission development.

The European Union cannot lead if, on the pretext of budgetary constraints, it wants to go backwards in its financial commitments or to steal from concrete commitments, so what I ask the Commissioner is whether, even before the Addis Ababa Conference, the European Union will be in a position to reaffirm its commitment to 0.7% of gross national income for development aid.

So, let's also use this opportunity to explain what's in the world, how you live, what needs a lot of the world's population is bringing today, and we make sure, through initiatives, conferences and actions in schools, that you understand the value of cooperation, its function, to say that a fairer world is not only a fairer world but it's also a safer world. , is perhaps a better world also in our interest, that these are not resources taken from us but are resources to make world reality fairer for all.

We must also be careful that policies intended to help do not end up hurting people in those countries. I refer, for example, to fishing agreements under which EU vessels are able to exploit the natural resources of other countries, and to the Pesticides Directive, which does not help in terms of the mosquito population or, therefore, the fight against malaria.

One is the fact that, yes, the European Union is the first donor and this is not charity. This is an investment. It is an investment on the one hand in our own stability and security – and in our prosperity as well, because those of you who may have been in this room at the beginning of the session at 3 p.m. will have heard a long debate about the fact that there are no divisions, no limits and no borders between internal and external threats, and if we do not invest in reaching the objectives we have for development – for sustainable development – and for equality in the world, the threats to our security and also the limits to our economic development will just grow and grow. So this is an investment in our own future, not just in the future of the people in the rest of the world. And yes, it is one of the most effective tools for preventing conflicts and for foreign policy, and also for following up conflicts, not to mention what was said before regarding the effects this has on other elements of global challenges and policies, starting with migration and asylum-seeker flows. So I see no contradiction between improving the living conditions of European Union citizens and improving the living conditions of other countries’ citizens. Actually I see a certain complementarity in that. I think that making it possible to keep the European Union as the foremost donor in the world is our common challenge and job. This requires a lot of work, not only on communication but also on explaining the fact that, no, this is not charity that we give when we can afford it, but rather it is a strategic investment in our own security and prosperity. Secondly, someone said, and I agree with this, that it is not just a matter of help, and this is indeed so. It is a matter of policy coherence, and that goes for the challenges we have in front of us this year, when we know that we will be called again to be coherent in all our choices, be this in internal policies or external policies. That means that we need to work hand in hand with many other chapters. I would like to thank Linda McAvan for reminding us of the role I am trying to play in coordinating the different Commissioners and also the different Councils – but in particular the different Commissioners – because here we have first to make sure that what we do, for instance, on trade does not contradict what we do in development or that what we do on humanitarian issues goes hand in hand with what we do in development, and that we intervene with the right tool at the right moment and in the right place, and that what we do on certain policies does not influence in negative terms what we do with other instruments that we use. So the concrete effects of this coordination will probably take a little time to emerge, but I think that this is the key issue for post-2105 – the real policy coherence of our policies. I will try to answer two issues. One is about the commitment to the 0.7%. This was precisely one of the issues we discussed in the last meeting of the Commissioners group. We will have a discussion about this, not only with the development ministers but also probably with the finance ministers and finally with the European Council. Obviously we will discuss that with the Latvian Presidency, but there is a need for Member State ownership in this because it is not only a matter of spending money, but also of setting priorities politically. Yes, we do believe that we should keep this target, but we need to develop a strategy to get there. The second point on which we will need very close coordination, not only within the Commission but also with the Council, is in managing the mix, the balance, between financing for sustainable development and financing for the climate. This year will be crucial in this regard, and we will need to play this carefully – first of all in the Commission, but I think that we will need coordinated work on this. Let me say a final word on Expo, because I commented when you introduced the debate that this is the first time that I am not the one talking about Expo because, when I started the Presidency as a Minister, that was one of my main issues. But some of your comments allow me to say that, yes, we will indeed be present, as the European Union, at Expo, and the reason for that is that, as was just mentioned, we need to put the content on our development policy, on feeding the planet, at the centre of the event. So count on the European Union to be part of that effort, together with the UN Agencies based in Rome, which I know are also going to be major players in focusing on the content of the Development Year, and to make sure that Milan Expo will also be a crucial event politically for the European Year for Development.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 344, "date": "2015-01-14.json", "name": "Zanda Kalniņa-Lukaševica", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, this has been a really fruitful exchange of views, which I think shows once again our common strong engagement for the European Year for Development.

The year 2015 will be a crucial year, with the Financing for Development Conference in July in Addis Ababa and the UN post-2015 summit in September in New York. I think the common event of this year will be COP 21 in Paris in December. We have a unique opportunity to address the global challenges of poverty, education and sustainable development. We must agree on an ambitious and transformative package in September 2015. The Latvian Presidency will work towards reaching a common European position. We anticipate complex negotiations around means of implementation on how the post-2015 framework will be implemented and by whom.

Now we would like to see the mission recommendations taken on board, particularly in view of the upcoming parliamentary elections. Difficulties, however, remain, and I have decided not to send a fully-fledged observation mission this time but, instead, to deploy a smaller Expert Mission (EEM). The purpose of the mission is closely to assess and report on the electoral process, including on the political environment and electoral campaign. The list of recommendations to be drawn up by this mission will facilitate constructive engagement with the authorities on much-needed reform efforts. But democracy goes beyond elections, and we all know that very well here. A parliament is key to having a legitimate legislator in place to tackle the many tasks of urgent legislative reform – including the law on NGOs and the controversial protest law – and to ensure compliance with the new constitution, which will need to be implemented. The parliamentary elections are also an important step towards providing a broad base for political engagement that can ensure fundamental rights and freedoms, security and economic reform accepted by the whole of society. Open political engagement and discussion will reduce the risk of radicalisation. Another challenge is clearly that of the deteriorating security situation spreading beyond the Sinai. We have always affirmed that the European Union stands by Egypt in fighting terrorism. There is no place for violence. The Special Coordinator for Counterterrorism travelled to Egypt in December 2014, and we are looking now into possibilities of holding a dialogue on counterterrorism and security. Let me add that this is not only in Egypt’s interest but also in our own European Union interest. Seeing the fragility, to say the least, of the situation in the whole region, we welcome and have welcomed Egypt’s re-emergence as an important regional player. In particular, the role that the country played over the summer in reaching a ceasefire in Gaza, facilitating the Israeli-Palestinian talks, and then more recently with the conference for reconstruction in Gaza that was held in Cairo in the autumn, was very important. Furthermore, Egypt is re-emerging as an important foreign policy player in the League of Arab States, in the African Union and in Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular over the Nile water issues with Ethiopia and in national dialogue efforts with Sudan. While still in political transition and facing security threats, Egypt also urgently needs to tackle an economic situation that is particularly difficult. Steps taken by the new authorities go in the right direction, with subsidy cuts and large-scale infrastructure projects such as the new lane in the Suez Canal. The EU will continue to support Egypt in addressing its socio-economic reforms. We will participate in the international investment conference planned for March. We will continue to focus our support in the socio-economic field, to help improve living conditions for the most vulnerable among Egypt’s population. These challenges and the ongoing political transition cannot allow any compromise on human rights. Egypt needs to address its human rights situation, including the lack of political space for dissenting opinion and shrinking space for freedoms of assembly and expression. Too many of the issues that you mentioned in your resolution on freedom of expression and assembly in Egypt last July have not yet been addressed. Only last December we saw another decision by a court to pass preliminary death sentences on 188 defendants. We keep calling on the judicial authorities to respect due process and ensure fair trial. A truly professional and independent judiciary is a key element for functioning and trusted state institutions. Another concern – a deep concern, as we have said in statements – is the lack of accountability and the continued crackdown not only on the Muslim Brotherhood and affiliates but also on political opponents and liberal activists, illustrated by often disproportionate sentencing. There are too many civilians tried by military courts, and too often, laws such as the new draft anti-terrorism law and the existing NGO law, which does not comply with the new constitution, give too ample a degree of discretion to the executive. We keep addressing these issues when we meet with our Egyptian counterparts. In particular, I have to thank the Special Representative for Human Rights, Stavros Lambrinidis, a former colleague of some of you, who repeatedly raised these issues with the Egyptian authorities on the occasion of both of his visits to Egypt during 2014. The question for the EU is not whether we should support Egypt – there is no other option but to stay engaged with Egypt – but how best to support its transition. Therefore Egypt, like all our southern and eastern partners, will be closely involved in the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). The outdated Action Plan with Egypt will need to be re-negotiated, taking into account the ENP review and to better reflect the reality on the ground. We will monitor the parliamentary elections with our experts, as I said, and we will monitor the further implementation of the constitution and, with a view to the upcoming parliamentary elections, the freedom of the press and media. But we will also help Egypt with its economic reform efforts and its fight against security threats. We will work with Egypt too in the context of our own efforts and our own fight against our own security threats.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 357, "date": "2015-01-14.json", "name": "Cristian Dan Preda", "mepid": "96838", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group.

I would like to make, first of all, a few points about the position of the PPE Group in relation to the joint resolution that we negotiated with the other political groups, and I would like to say that we have a very detailed, very long text - that is because we wanted to introduce in this text everything that has happened since July, July 2014, when we last adopted a resolution on Egypt. This makes text difficult to follow; sometimes the figures are not very reliable, because we have quoted various sources and that is why I would like to place the resolution in a context that is described by several key facts.  And, first of all, I would call our relationship with this country in the fight against terrorism - Egypt is an essential partner and I do not think we can neglect this, as Egypt plays an extremely important geopolitical role in the Near East peace process. The second important coordinate is obviously the transition to democracy, which we want, which we support in Egypt, respect for the principles of the rule of law, respect for human rights - all this must become a reality because that is what the citizens of Egypt want. Thirdly, I believe that we must consider the implementation of the Constitution that was adopted, which came into force almost a year ago. It is a better Constitution than before, but it is essential that it becomes a fact from the perspective of fundamental rights, first of all, especially since we have these elections that Mrs Mogherini mentioned. I subscribe to what has been said about the need to implement the recommendations made by the last Observation Mission, led by our colleague Mario David.

Egypt is a key country, an extremely important country for the European Union - this has been said before - and we must underline its contribution to the ceasefire effort following the Gaza conflict. We must underline Egypt's contribution to the fight against Daesh and regional and global threats of this nature. From this perspective, the European Parliament is so interested in the evolution of the process of modernisation and democratisation of the friendly country, and that is why we must help Egypt to progress. We are, of course, concerned about the current situation with regard to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. We fully understand the complex situation created after the Revolution, as well as the seriousness of the terrorist threat facing Egypt. We now understand it even more after the recent attacks in Paris. We welcome President Sisi's call for the modernisation of Islamic thought, we believe that this is a courageous attempt, which must be supported and supported by all those who want a calmer world, a world less threatened by terrorism.

Following the removal of President Morsi in response to genuine public revolt against his rule and the direction in which he was taking his country, we are now beginning to see stability once again return to that great country. Since then, we have seen the adoption of a new Constitution by referendum, the election of President al-Sisi and, most recently, the announcement of parliamentary elections. These achievements are all to be welcomed. However, this is just the start of the journey rather than the end. Many internal issues need to be addressed if Egypt is to become the pluralistic Arab democracy that its people wish for and deserve. Whilst my Group welcomes the improvements to the lives of Coptic Christians, in particular, and other minorities, it is crucial that this level of tolerance be exercised in other areas too. Freedom of speech, freedom of expression, the right to peaceful protest and the rule of law are all key tenets of democracy which should also be respected. The large number of citizens who have been charged to date, and who have been detained and sentenced in Egypt for non-violently exercising these rights is a grave cause for concern. Reports that, since July 2013, more than 40 000 people have been detained and an estimated 1 400 protestors killed are extremely worrying. I am also concerned by the crackdown on media freedom and the fact that one of my own London constituents, Sue Turton from al-Jazeera television, a journalist, has been tried in absentia and is now prevented from resuming her job anywhere in the region. In broader terms, we must not forget Egypt’s role as a leader of the Arab world, and a regional power and actor, and its ability to play a part in finding solutions to the current situation in neighbouring Libya, for example, or in the fight against Islamist terrorism in the wider Middle East and North Africa.

I would recall what Charles Tannock said, that Egypt will play a vital position in the Arab world – and so it should. After the presidential elections we will see parliamentary elections and it would be of great benefit if they were free and fair because this is another milestone in the process leading to real democracy.

We must know that the future of Egypt necessarily passes through the hands and decisions of the Egyptian people. In this transition process, obviously the European Union can support and support, it can support as an intermediary, as an intermediary if the parties so choose, an intermediary to try to promote the establishment of social peace.  I understand that holding parliamentary elections is a positive step, but we have to take into account that this organisation is primarily up to the Egyptians.

Four years ago, the Egyptians liberated themselves from dictator Mubarak, at least that is what they were trying to do. This was welcomed in this House, without the question being asked as to how Mubarak remained in power for so long. Then they elected Morsi. These were elections that were more or less reasonable, not great and not to our liking in terms of results. Because there is no European who says, \"We were so happy with President Morsi.\" But it was there. Then Morsi gave himself extra rights. We were not happy about that at all, because we had made agreements with him about the construction of his country. Morsi gave himself extra rights and the response was a military coup. This House didn't really want to see that. Some people said, \"It's very, very good that there has been a military coup.\" And now we have that military regime.  I'm not saying it was good in the past. I am not saying that we should go back to Mubarak, nor that we should go back to Morsi. But I hear a changing tone in this debate between six months ago and now. Now we are talking about Egypt as a geopolitical partner, Egypt playing its part in the Mediterranean and Egypt being able to protect itself from terrorists, especially in the light of what has happened in Paris. I find that last comparison really shocking. It cannot be the case that, because we are afraid - and we are rightly afraid - we say: 'The freedom of the Egyptian must give way again, because it was actually easy for Mr Mubarak to keep his people a little quiet.'

We are well known that enumeration of rights and principles is not enough. We need concrete action, not just election promises. But how do we ensure that the Egyptian authorities actually respect the constitution? Second, freedom of the press and expression. Neither stability nor security rhymes with a jailed press. On the contrary, media freedom will enable the emergence of an inclusive and democratic pluralistic society, as it is one of the instruments of dialogue within society. It is this dialogue that will overcome the polarization of Egyptian society.  Thirdly, it seems to me that interfaith dialogue could go a long way to reducing tensions and fostering pluralism. I encourage the Egyptian government and the European Union to support initiatives that promote mutual understanding and religious tolerance.  Fourth, the role of women. Without women's participation, the democratic transition can only be partial. Their rights must be guaranteed, violence against women must be combated and their participation in political decision-making must be encouraged. Again, we need concrete initiatives with results, with the participation of men and with the participation of the Union. Finally, the fight against human trafficking.

The point is not that we oppose or agree with the previous President, but that we absolutely disagree – and always will do – with death sentences. All unwarranted detentions are wrong, but Egypt should understand that the damage to its international reputation comes with the continued detention of the three al-Jazeera journalists. No one outside the country believes them to be anything other than bonafide journalists. After the highest court of law overturned their conviction on procedural grounds, they should, frankly, be released and not retried.

The life of the Copts is still a very difficult one. Legal and living protections are clearly divergent, and attacks on Coptic churches and their members remain on the agenda.  The situation is particularly dramatic in the Assiut region, where Copts are constantly kidnapped and, unfortunately, murdered without paying a ransom. In other areas, the Copts are massively disadvantaged. According to recent studies, Christians are continuously discriminated against in many areas such as jurisprudence, education, social services and care. So it is no surprise that Egypt is sadly still in the top 25 in the World Tracking Index in 2014. It is therefore the European Union's duty to take a serious look at minorities, especially Christian minorities, in the Middle East and to demand from Egypt the real and not only the legal protection of Christians and to make this a condition for further cooperation.

It means a more or less blunt continuation of the repressive policy that existed until the Arab Spring.  Civil society activities, whether they come from the secular sector or the circles of the Muslim Brotherhood, are suppressed by authoritarian means. The legal basis is a law of December 2013, which euphemistically calls itself the right to public gatherings, parades and peaceful demonstrations. In addition, there is the practice of putting civilians before military courts more and more frequently. All the measures that are put in place on this basis contribute to the spread of dissatisfaction and thus to achieve exactly the opposite of what one actually wants to achieve: stability is becoming increasingly faltering. Egypt should also be reminded that, in its referendum-adopted constitution, it has explicitly committed itself to complying with all international human rights conventions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 375, "date": "2015-01-14.json", "name": "Dawid Bohdan Jackiewicz (ECR). -", "mepid": "124882", "text": "   Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking I would like to draw your attention to a particular issue, the situation of copts, Egyptian Christians, who make up 10% of egypt's population and are the largest Christian minority in the Middle East.

Religious discrimination continues to be m.in. lack of access to senior positions in the administration, the military, blocking the construction of churches, but also marking Coptic shops with a black \"x\" to distinguish them from Muslim shops. Members of the clergy, as well as Coptic activists, unsuccessfully asked the Egyptian authorities to protect them.  Moreover, in September 2013, it was the security services who attacked the village of Jabal Al-Deir, ransacked it and the inhabitants were beaten. I would point out in this example that it was not the Muslim Brotherhood that was responsible for this attack, but the state officials. This is undoubtedly the result of the Islamisation of the country under Mursi, which has even led to a constitutional change and the establishment of an Islamic state in Egypt. Today, state officials, whose duty it is to protect all citizens, persecute them for religious beliefs other than Islam.

I have to say at the ninth hour that I really think you need to review the working procedures of this plenary – not for me but for you.  For me it is not just a duty; I do not know what you are used to but for me it is normal to be in the room when there is a debate concerning my issues. It is also often very interesting and a pleasure to listen to the debate because I think this feeds into my work most usefully. Let me also say that I will be here tomorrow morning too so we will meet each other again, those of you who are here, and that means that when I said during my hearing that I will work with Parliament, I meant it, and I find it also normal.  So no need to compliment me on that. That is just my duty and that is just normal. But, I really encourage the Presidency to work on a more rational way of holding parliamentary work, for the sake of the parliamentary work itself. Having said that, I believe that the discussion on Egypt tonight – obviously this is the only one I have attended out of the three you have had over the last year – has been a good sign of the balance between two different things. On the one hand, there is the regional role that Egypt can play – and has played – when you talk about the Middle East crisis, and can play even more on many different issues that are also core issues for our regional and foreign policy. On the other hand, there is Egypt’s internal transition, which is something that we need to support and encourage – and encourage to move in a certain direction, the direction that you mentioned of full respect for their own commitment and their own Constitution. And it is a transition. I would not agree with those of you who said that the Arab Spring has turned into an Islamic winter. First of all, the Islamic winter would not exactly be the case in Egypt. We might discuss whether that were an Islamic autumn or a non-Islamic winter but when we apply these categories to Arab countries we are being a little bit ungenerous.  It took many decades, if not centuries, for Europeans to go through transitions, and our transitions were also painful, non-linear, contradictory, sometimes difficult, and history is like that. So it is difficult to imagine now what the outcome will be but I would not declare closed after just a few years a season that was encouraging and full of hope in the Arab world. And among the Arab Spring experiences we have certainly some – and I would say many – success stories, whether the institutional transitions that were positive ones, as in the case of Tunisia and others, or the rising up of civil society movements that are really of value for the countries and societies concerned. So I think we need to develop a more complex reading of the situation there. I shall not respond to all the questions that you have raised – partly because that would probably take another nine hours and that would definitely be too much – but I want to mention two things. The first concerns a specific case raised by a Member who has now left the room, but I still want to mention it because I discussed this case just the day before yesterday in Dublin with the Irish Foreign Minister, and that is the case of Ibrahim Halawa, an Irish citizen who is in detention in Egypt. We are following the case and I wanted to inform you that I am following it closely, not only with the services and the delegation there, but also with the Irish authorities, and we discussed it just the day before yesterday.

The European Union has followed the case of the two Italian navy riflemen, Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, who have been in constant contact with the Italian government and indian authorities since their detention in India began in February 2012.  We note with satisfaction today the decision taken by the Indian Supreme Court to extend the sickness permit for Massimiliano Latorre, which rightly takes into account the humanitarian reasons and the serious state of health of the military man who has imposed serious and urgent medical treatment in Italy. We are counting on this decision to mark the beginning of a path to finally find a quick, definitive, fair and shared solution to the case of both Italian soldiers, Massimiliano, but also Salvatore.  At the same time, unfortunately, we must point out that up to now, despite numerous attempts, there has been no progress whatsoe worth of progress. Therefore, we understand and share the concerns expressed by many Members of the European Parliament about a dispute concerning two European citizens. This case has been dragging on for three years now, an unacceptable period of time during which the two Italian soldiers have been and are still unjustly subject to measures having been restrictive of personal freedom, in the absence of the wording of a charge. This situation of unlawful detention violates the fundamental human rights recognised and protected by numerous international conventions.  It is useful to recall how the two Italian marò were on board the oil tanker Enrica Lexie which crossed into international waters to take part in an official mission under international legislation on combating piracy and protecting national ships. Because of their commitment to the mission, Latorre and Girone enjoyed the functional immunity of a state body in the performance of its duties. This means, in accordance with the principles of general international law, that military personnel engaged in official missions are functionally immune from the exercise of the criminal and international jurisdiction of foreign states.  It is no coincidence that the European Union has systematically called on India to find a rapid and positive solution to the dispute, in full accordance with international law and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS, according to the jurisdiction over incidents taking place in international waters, it is up to the authorities of the flag State of the vessel, in this case therefore Italian. Presidents Van Rompuy, Barroso and Schultz, as well as High Representative Ashton, have raised this issue with their Indian interlocutors on several occasions in the past, underlining the European Union's concerns. Personally, I am constantly following – as you will imagine – in my new function and with particular attention to this case, and I intend to use every opportunity to continue to raise it until we finally find a solution that is acceptable and definitive to all parties.  It is important to draw everyone's attention to the fact that cases such as this risk having important repercussions on the global fight against piracy, in which the European Union has been seriously committed for a long time and it is good that it continues to be so. The Indian Navy has often been the target of criminal acts off the coast of Somalia and many hostages have been freed as a result of Operation Atalanta. International cooperation has been essential to limit the threat of piracy and to respond to attacks. The European Union and India therefore share a common interest in protecting freedom of navigation, but the principles of cooperation and mutual trust must be respected.  More generally, we share strategic values and interests with India and we want to work together on the world stage, but it is good that everyone is fully aware of how much and how the unresolved dispute over two Italian naval officers can have an impact on relations between the European Union and India, which it puts to the test. The European Union intends to honour its commitment to full and concrete protection of the fundamental rights of its citizens, of every European citizen detained in every part of the world, by promoting the peaceful resolution of international disputes and respect for human rights and international law.  Finally, let me point out that in this matter, however, there are not only legal or political considerations; this is also – for some it is first and foremost – a humanly very painful affair, for the families of the two dead Indian fishermen, to whom we are close, for the two marò and their families who have lived for three long years in complete uncertainty. A situation that is increasingly untenable from every point of view but above all I have to say for the families of the two marò to whom goes my affectionate thought humanly having had the opportunity to be by their side for many months, not only from an institutional point of view but also from a human point of view. Therefore, as the European Union, we will continue not only to follow the case closely, but also, and above all, to press ly, in close contact with the Italian Government, for a rapid, positive, shared and definitive solution to the case.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 402, "date": "2015-01-14.json", "name": "Lara Comi", "mepid": "96775", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, we must not Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Vice-President, three years have now passed and the fate of our marò is still uncertain, as you have mentioned. Today we learn that Latorre, who is in Italy for treatment, has received a three-month extension of leave – it is a step forward – while Girone – alas – still remains in India. You see dear Vice-President, I believe that we have these three months to bring our marò home for good, before Latorre is forced to return to India. He doesn't have to go back to India and Girone has to go back to Italy.  Italy has not been able in these three years to bring the two marò home, it has never officially asked Europe for help, Barroso, Ashton and Schultz have intervened, as you have mentioned, but there has never been a request. Prime Minister Renzi himself said yesterday that Italy does not come to Europe for help and instead, Vice-President, I ask, together with my colleagues, for Europe's help because our marò are both Italian and European.  First comes the defence of human rights and then business and economic interests in India. Let them return home as soon as possible and there is a fair and rapid process that takes place in Italy or with international arbitration. That is why, tomorrow, we are voting for the first time on a resolution which will enable you to facilitate the resolution of this matter with the support, for the first time, of the European Parliament.

I mean, it is not and does not want to be a hostile resolution towards India and the Indian people to whom our feeling of friendship goes. Instead, it is a resolution which calls for a balanced solution to this affair, which has been dragging on for far too long. In the meantime, I too welcome the decision of the Indian Court, which granted Sergeant Latorre an extension of his stay in Italy for medical reasons.  We therefore want to work – and this is our objective – to resolve the problem by following certain guidelines that we consider reasonable in order to overcome the accumulated delays and the way in which the case has been handlinged so far. There is a need, in accordance with the rule of law, to work to open an international arbitration procedure that serves to decide on the conflict of jurisdiction and on which authority is entitled to judge the case, favoring the return to Italy of the two marò; We call, within the framework of our relations with India, for your office to be able to identify the actions necessary to achieve these objectives.

I respect the Indian legal system and have the deepest sympathy for the families of the fishermen that were killed, but as a former military officer I have sympathy for the plight of the marines. Military personnel often have to make life-or-death judgments in very difficult circumstances and sometimes they get it wrong. These marines were part of an on-board armed protection team to counter piracy. It is such teams that have been the decisive factor in the major reduction in piracy in the high-risk areas of the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Of course I cannot make any judgments about the circumstances and legalities of this particular tragic incidence; nor can anyone else in this Chamber. This is not a court of law and we do not know the answers to a whole range of legal questions and technicalities. It is certainly most distressing that this case has lingered on for three years now. This is unacceptable and every diplomatic effort should be made to bring the case to a rapid and fair conclusion.

An unfortunate day for the families of the indian fishermen who died, but also an unhappy day for the suspected Italian Marines.  Regarding the events that took place on the high seas, today it is quite clear to everyone that neither the poor Indian fishermen were pirates nor did the suspects think there were fishermen on that small boat. The Italian Marines fought for Italy's interests, for the interests of the Italian economy, for Europe, and were convinced that they were doing something to protect and protect the vessel, that is, the ship they were on, and the property they were carrying. A process that takes so long, or rather a process that is not there, is something that we really have to say today that the negligeny that happened is the fact that there is no process and protocol.  We should definitely request the return of the Marines to Italy, the possibility for a court in Italy or an international court to deal with the case. I strongly believe that this is a good path, and what has been done so far by the Italian government and what our resolution does in relation to India and Indian citizens, is an approach by which we show our great solidarity with this great state.

Mr President, it has been three years since two Italian sailors have been awaiting legal proceedings after they killed two Indian fishermen. Three years! Three years without the slightest announcement of a trial.  This is contrary to the European view of human rights.  It is legitimate for the European Union to defend the case of these two European citizens. Its mission is clear and our resolution clearly affirms it. Our two Italian citizens must be repatriated to European soil and tried in Italy by their national courts. But all this shows something else.  The European Union, if it is to be credible, must act in a coherent manner with all its partners. Yes, India is a major player and a key trading partner, but that is where the European Union can weigh in. The free trade agreements concluded by the Union are conditional on our trading partners respecting some of our values. I therefore invite you, Madam High Representative, to remind you of this in your forth future exchanges with the Indian government. The lives of these Italian sailors must not be sacrificed on the altar of free trade.  Finally, Mrs Mogherini, this House is asking you to intervene without waiting for consultation by the Council, as is usually the case. And that is what is new about this European Parliament.

We are talking here – as Van Orden said well before – not about being a judge or the lawyers or supporters of one side or the other, it is not the policy that has to judge whether the marò are guilty or not, it is a question of applying basic international conventions such as that on civil and political rights and it cannot be accepted in any way that European citizens are left in India without charge. , without a trial being started for three years, this is something that cannot be accepted under any rule of law and I believe that we are all aware of this.

Despite that, they are prevented from leaving India and have their documents and belongings returned pending an appeal by the Indian police. The health of several men had seriously deteriorated. Their families are deprived of any income. Given the fact that these crew members have not been involved in any criminal offences, the indefinite detention in India amounts to gross violation of their human rights.

At the heart of this case is the fundamental question about how we treat our partners. While the EU has a duty to stand up for its citizens, it is hard to understand why the lives of two Indian fishermen should be valued lower than the liberty of two EU citizens. That is the message that could be construed from our actions, and I not think that we can drown out Indian calls for accountability. It is important that we remember that at the basis of this there is a legal dispute about jurisdiction, which needs to be addressed if we are to make headway.

Therefore, there can be no comparison with ordinary criminals or any delinquents or with men to whom one must turn one's back or make comparisons between family pain or the pain of other families.

I therefore believe that in this respect this Europe must move in the direction in which the various groups have today wished to represent their argument and motivation, but I also believe that, as I know President Mogherini, there will be the opportunity to make a strong, rigorous, effective change and finally achieve a result that is not equal, that is to say, to bring the marò back to Italy. , so that they can be judged in Italy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 418, "date": "2015-01-14.json", "name": "Marju Lauristin (S&amp;D). -", "mepid": "124698", "text": "   Mr President, first I would like to thank the High Representative for this long day and for expressing the very strong feeling of solidarity and cooperation which we have witnessed throughout the whole of today. The case we are discussing now, almost up to midnight, is in some sense symbolic because it is not about some abstract matter, but about the fate of human beings – individuals and co-citizens – and is why we, two Estonians, have joined this effort, because it is not a national issue. It is an issue of human rights and of trust in the EU among people – among citizens and every individual – and we really want to emphasise that the EU has to safeguard the security and fundamental rights of every EU citizen, no matter which Member State they belong to and in which third country this kind of thing may happen. It is also important that we have high respect for the Indian nation. We hope that in relations between India and the EU this spirit of solidarity and human rights will also be respected. Regarding the separate case involving 14 Estonian marine mercenaries – and also six British – this has also been pending for more than a year. Your predecessor was informed about it, including by letter, and we see that the EU is not very effective in helping citizens in this situation. So we hope very much that, under your management, the European External Action Service will be much more effective in helping to solve cases of this kind. It is with this hope that we are here, we raise this issue and we support our Italian colleagues, and hope that our Italian and all our other colleagues from all the other countries of the EU will support the Estonian marine mercenaries. By the way it was again, in this case, because they were fighting piracy that they happened to be in that tragic situation, so that is another problem – how people who sacrifice their security for the security of other people are not protected in such circumstances.

No diplomatic or political solution has succeeded in having an outcome to this affair, in an endless political and diplomatic swing, and our frustration and that of all Italian and European citizens has grown over the years.  The continued referrals of india's Supreme Court have demonstrated the inefficiency of India's justice system, which is incapable of deciding. This unacceptable situation is a serious and serious violation of human rights. I am addressing this meeting, once again, as I have done in previous years, in this Very Parliament, to remind you that the two marò are not two terrorists, they are not two criminals: they are two European soldiers who have embarked to defend our freedom and trade, and that is why we must all react and make our voice heard.  Here I join the High Representative Federica Mogherini, and I congratulate her on the work she has done today, but above all on the commitment that I am sure she will put in place for this problem, which grieves us as Italians but as European citizens all. I would therefore like to express my special thanks to the High Representative, because a few weeks ago you reproached New Delhi for too many postponements to resolve this case, saying that this could affect EU and Indian relations. So for the first time since this 15 February 2012, a member of the EU government has made his voice heard by threatening retaliation. So, I ask myself: how much longer will we have to wait to see these trade sanctions implemented, when we can review our two riflemen at home, when this agony comes to an end? And I wanted to thank once again our foreign colleagues, our Estonian colleagues and all those who are taking part in this debate because they remind us that this is not an Italian battle, this is a battle to bring two citizens, two European soldiers, home to Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 420, "date": "2015-01-14.json", "name": "Salvatore Domenico Pogliese (PPE). -", "mepid": "124853", "text": "    Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think there is little to add to what Lara Comi and other Members have said brilliantly. The affair of the two marò is truly paradoxical! It would be tragicomic if the lives and dignity of two Italian soldiers, arrested three years ago, were not at stake in the performance of their duties in international waters during an anti-piracy operation. They were certainly not there, engaged in a simulated softkey war. They were engaged in an operation that allowed Italian and European merchant ships not to be subjected to the constant onslaught of piracy.  India is behaving completely irresponsibly, trampling underfoot the most basic principles of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Europe can no longer allow this and must bring the two marò back to Italy, suspending – as has been stated on several sides – the negotiations for the free trade agreement with India, where expressly provided that Europe cannot sign treaties or agreements with countries that do not respect human rights.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 421, "date": "2015-01-14.json", "name": "Daniele Viotti (S&amp;D). -", "mepid": "124791", "text": "    Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my voice will be out of the chorus: I believe that patriotic rhetoric has been built around the affair involving the two navy riflemen Latorre and Girone, which is not only not in my ropes but also, I believe, of little use in solvinging. This is, of course, a very complex issue and it is a sad case of the case and certainly not a question of human rights.  It is right - and I think it is almost incredible to say so - that Mr President, i.e. that we should not be able to do something about it. Borghezio: this is a huge national issue. It is certainly not about the European Union, it is certainly not about this Parliament and it is certainly not about the very hard work that the High Representative is doing, whom I too thank for the day he has spent with us, for the things he is doing.

I agree with what Mrs Gill said: the life of the two Indian sailors is worth no less than the life and honour of the Italian riflemen. Even less do I believe that we parliamentarians can judge here whether the marò have acted well or badly and what their function was. For this reason, I have many doubts about the resolution, because the text does not clearly link the release of riflemen to the need for a process, international or national.

Of course, we are relieved at the recent decision of the Indian Supreme Court to grant for health reasons to extend La Torre's stay in Italy by three months, but the persistence of such a condition in violation of international law, referred to by many colleagues, with continuous postponements of a solution, is truly unacceptable. We, as Italian citizens, welcomed the initiative which, with international arbitration, had already taken the then Foreign Minister Mogherini and which today, in her capacity as High Representative for Foreign Policy – together with the Commission and the Council I hope – gives her the strength to take all the initiatives to protect the two riflemen and certainly guarantee - I say this to Mrs Spinelli - international arbitration.  Protection means this: protecting the rights that we have in a certain process and also – I believe – threatening to suspend the European Union's trade negotiations with India and bearing in mind, as some Estonian colleagues have reminded us, this is also an important issue concerning the fight against piracy, which is an international issue and which I think should also have very strong pronouncements in the international agreements that are taking place.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 424, "date": "2015-01-14.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  VPC/HR. - (IT) Mr President, as you rightly pointed out, but I too would like to remind Mr De Clercq of this.

However, I would like to thank the European Parliament for this debate, For this reason, and also for having shown that this issue is not just an Italian issue, but an issue that concerns several European citizens – some Estonian and British citizens have been mentioned – and it is generally a problem that concerns the protection of the human rights of European citizens, whatever their nationality, respect for the principles of international law, the protection of soldiers engaged in anti-piracy missions and therefore the very credibility of our anti-piracy actions.  It is therefore a matter for the European Union, and in this respect I am taking responsibility for it – although, of course, the decisions on the legal management of the case remain fully, and rightly so, in the hands of the Italian Government, with which I believe I must continue to link very closely.
