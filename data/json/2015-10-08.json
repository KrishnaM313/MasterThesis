Although we did not always have the same view of the matter, I felt that we were united by the desire to improve the position of women in the labour market.  Three years ago, this House adopted our colleague Edit Bauer's report on the principle of equal pay for men and women for work of equal value. This report contained a list of specific recommendations to the Commission to improve the position of women in employment. But three years have passed and almost nothing has changed. That is why, in my report, I focused on four things that seem crucial to me. Firstly, to introduce a clear definition of work of equal value in all Member States. Secondly, to improve women's access to justice. Thirdly, the motivation of employers. Fourthly, the call on the Commission to take all these requirements into account in the proposal for a new directive, which would replace the existing one and place higher demands on the Member States. The concept of equal work or work of equal value has so far only been introduced in 12 of the 28 Member States. In most of them, it takes into account skill, effort, responsibility and working conditions. Since the voluntary implementation of this concept has not produced the expected results, I propose that it be compulsory in all Member States, which will also contribute to deepening the freedom of movement of labour in the European Union. These are in particular paragraphs 8, 9, 10 and 11. The definition of work of equal value is complemented by the obligation for employers to define jobs neutrally, i.e. so that they do not overfer both men and women as candidates. Such a requirement may require greater sensitivity, but it certainly does not represent an additional administrative burden. As regards women's access to justice, I propose strengthening anti-discrimination offices or trade unions in the Member States and extending their competences, even so that they can offer women not only legal advice, but also representation before the courts in discriminatory disputes. It is precisely the lack of legal awareness and the financial situation that prevents many women from doing justice. When I talk about the motivation of employers, I am thinking, in particular, of the recommendation in paragraph 37 that companies that fail to fulfil their obligations in the field of equality between men and women should be excluded from public procurement of goods and services financed from the European Union budget. I would like to stress that this is not a sanction, but an incentive. Those who want to apply for European contracts must create a level playing field for both the men and women they employ. Ladies and gentlemen, the duty of equal treatment has been enshrined in the Treaties of the European Union for almost sixty years and it is our responsibility for every employer in the European Union to respect it. We have seen stagnation in recent years. It is time we finally overcame it and moved on.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2015-10-08.json", "name": "Christos Stylianides", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, on behalf of my colleague Commissioner Věra Jourová, I am here for this debate. Thank you for this important report and in particular my thanks to Ms Záborská.  Tackling pay discrimination – tackling the gender pay gap – is an important commitment for the Commission. It is a real priority and it has been for a very long time. But, as your report reminds us, we still have work to do. Let me highlight at the outset that this is not only about fairness: it is also an economic issue. Reduction of the gender pay gap is an investment in the future of the Union. There needs to be better use of women’s skills to allow them to contribute more to the economy as a whole. There are clear benefits to this: improved recruitment and retention; reduction of skills mismatches; an increase in motivation and productivity; improvement in a company’s image; and an increased female employment rate.  The gender pay gap has numerous complex causes. Occupational and vertical segregation, and lower rates of female participation in the labour market are all relevant factors. It is also key to encourage a more balanced sharing of family responsibilities between women and men so as to reduce the persistent gender pay and pension gaps. Equal pay legislation is an important part of the solution but the broader mix of law and policy is equally relevant, at both national and EU level. Closing the gender pay gap therefore needs a comprehensive approach with both legislative and non-legislative action. It requires the efforts and commitment of all players – decision makers at EU and national level, as well as stakeholders.  Effective application of the existing EU legal framework on equal pay is crucial for tackling pay inequality. I fully agree with you that this remains one of the biggest challenges. The Commission is therefore monitoring constantly whether EU law on equal pay is being correctly applied, and it supports Member States and other stakeholders with the proper enforcement of the existing rules. Two years ago, the Commission published a report reviewing the application of the Gender Equality Directive (Recast). This demonstrates to stakeholders what is required for more effective application of the existing legislation, with practical guidance on gender-neutral job classification systems so as to assist Member States and employers in bridging the gender pay gap.  Moreover, last year the Commission adopted a Recommendation on Pay Transparency. This provides Member States and stakeholders with a toolkit of concrete measures to tackle pay inequality and the gender pay gap.  Pay transparency and gender-neutral job evaluation, and evaluation systems in companies, are crucial because they reveal gender bias or discrimination in the pay structures of a company or industry. They support employers and social partners in taking concrete action to ensure the effective implementation of the equal pay principle.  By the end of this year, Member States should notify to the Commission the national measures they have taken in accordance with the Recommendation. We will closely assess the situation and we will prepare a report on progress made in implementing the Recommendation. On that basis, we will assess the potential need for additional measures. We will look specifically at measures to tackle pay discrimination, to ensure equality in occupational pension schemes and to strengthen the implementation and enforcement of the legislation. The core task of national equality bodies is to promote equal treatment, and to provide independent assistance to victims of discrimination. Strengthening their role would improve enforcement in general, in particular in relation to equal pay. Effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions are crucial to provide a strong incentive for compliance with equal pay rules and to guarantee enforcement. Let us look at the bigger picture. We have also recently announced our plans for a new initiative in the area of work-life balance. We intend to support working parents and carers across the EU – to strike a better work-life balance, and to encourage more equal sharing of care responsibilities between women and men. This initiative will help women to remain and advance in the labour market and thereby to tackle, over the longer term, the gender pay and pension gaps.  As well as legislation, the Commission is also undertaking a number of policy and awareness-raising actions to address the gender pay gap. We are currently funding eight multi-national projects, worth around EUR 2.5 million, which tackle different aspects of the gender pay gap in a concrete and targeted manner.  The Commission will mark European Equal Pay Day on 2 November this year, to make the gender pay gap plain and explicit for all Europeans and to draw attention to the fact that a pay gap still exists between men and women. This is the day when women symbolically stop earning and work for free for the rest of the year.  Honourable Members, again, thank you for this report. The progress we are making is clearly not fast enough. We need to work together to ensure that everyone steps up their efforts on this issue.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2015-10-08.json", "name": "Vilija Blinkevičiūtė", "mepid": "96681", "text": "   draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. – First of all, I would like to stress that the Directive on equal opportunities for women and men at work and on the labour market is indeed difficult to implement in the Member States. Therefore, this directive should be reviewed urgently, because we really must tackle the long-standing problem of unequal pay for women and men for the same work. Because this is the greatest violation and non-compliance with the principle of gender equality. As rapporteur for the opinion in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I therefore call on the Member States to implement the Commission recommendation on strengthening the principle of equal pay for men and women by increasing transparency as effectively and actively as possible. Secondly, I would like to remind you that there is a continuous sectoral breakdown of jobs in the labour market. And women usually work in sectors with lower salaries, illegal jobs, precarious jobs, such as domestic work, nannying, care for sick people. These are very difficult jobs, but are still undervalued and low-paid.

Mr President, it is clear that, despite the efforts made - and the European legislative arsenal on gender equality, in particular equal pay, there has been a good deal in recent years that the reduction of wage inequalities and the fight against wage discrimination against women in the labour market have stagnated. So we can't remain inert. We need to look at being more effective, more credible in order to achieve results. That is what our citizens expect.  I welcome the work of our colleague, Anna Zuborsk, who, in a very honest, precise and comprehensive way, takes stock of the application of the 2006 directive, points to the shortcomings and shortcomings and, above all, proposes concrete and operational action. Again, we need to be precise and come up with concrete solutions. She sketches several tracks.  We must not refrain from thinking about sanctions to make the imperative of reducing wage inequality truly credible in our European companies. We must consider, very seriously, with certainly in-depth studies, to be able to distinguish between, on the one hand, the real cases of discrimination against women, which are absolutely intolerable, unjustifiable and incomprehensible, given the mess that this represents and the female potential which is thus flouted and set aside, and, on the other hand, the too many obstacles, glass ceilings and other obstacles to the progression of women.

I think it is unacceptable that there is still more than 15% of the gender pay gap in Europe today, which shows that equal pay for the same work is not a reality in our democracies today. That is why we agree and fully support the need to promote – and to do so, I look at the Commissioner and the Commission – non-sexist systems for assessing and classifying jobs, so that through these systems and wage transparency we can develop job assessment methodologies to avoid gender biases that make this pay gap systematized. We are also calling for and supporting the obligation for companies to develop and implement annual strategic plans on gender equality, as well as the right, for both women and men, to the reconciliation of working life with family life, which is also so difficult today.  Finally, it is essential for us that compulsory wage audits are proposed in relation to companies listed on a stock exchange in the Member States, except, of course, small and medium-sized enterprises. We also need for women that the social partners and, in particular, trade unions be supported by all these demands, and we certainly need a radical approach in the next text of the Commission. There are good practices, the Commissioner has told us, in all areas, including at the international level, but, in our view, there is still a gap of more than 15% between the salaries of men and women that is totally unacceptable in our democracy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2015-10-08.json", "name": "Jadwiga Wiśniewska", "mepid": "124877", "text": "  On behalf of the ECR Group. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by The report on updating the Gender Equality Directive in the workplace is most often mentioned by the fact that the rapporteur herself, Mrs Záborská, has to make a separate statement to her. This document, which should be a pragmatic attempt to tackle wage inequality and unequal treatment in the workplace, is full of ideological, subsidiarity-intrusive about the need to include gender issues in vocational education and training or the need for legal recognition of gender reassignment, excessive administrative burdens in the form of audits.  It is bizarre that the report replaces all references to objective biological sex with socio-cultural gender. Motherhood is a social role that is only appropriate for women and it is not surprising that it also affects their careers. Of course, action must be taken to compensate for the pay gap. However, the way to do this is not to impose further information obligations on employers. These key competences are important in the labour market and the european Union's action should not suggest that women are less competent.

Despite this long-standing commitment to equality, progress remains far too slow. The gender pay gap and gender pension gap still show significant differences. It is gender that we are talking about, not biological sex. Women are in effect punished because of society’s expectations that they will bear children, regardless of whether they have them or not. Single women without children earn less than their male colleagues. Marriage and children are irrelevant to women’s earning potential. Women earn less whether they have husbands or children or not. As the gender pay gap stands, on average European women work 60 days without pay compared to European men. Employers might think this is good value, but it is shocking that it still happens. The best way to tackle wage inequality is to improve wage transparency but, despite years of various instruments, the problem persists. The time has now come for stronger action. We need mandatory wage transparency and committed action from governments and businesses alike. Large companies listed on the stock exchanges in Member States should be obliged to publish their data so that employees can see for themselves whether they are getting a fair deal. They already have to publish other financial data, so this requirement is not too onerous. On a related point, we have to protect the independence and funding of national equality bodies, which assist in cases of unfair treatment, and we must likewise protect them from political interference. I am also delighted to see language in this report ensuring that trans people are protected under equality legislation. A recent study found that one third of trans people reported discrimination when seeking employment at work. Trans women earn 20% less than their other female colleagues and they are punished doubly for being a woman and for being trans.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how many times are we going to have reports and questions about equality in this Parliament, when we have Member States that lack courage? The first observation is dramatic. That is the most glaring, of course, it is the question of wages. On this issue, today, when we look at the figures and the latest data, the salary received by women in EU countries is still on average 16.4% lower in 2013. In 2008, it was 17.3%. At this rate, we'll have to wait 71 years - 71 years! - so that equality between men and women on the issue of wages is put in place. While the very principle in the European Union is equal pay for the same work. That is the basic principle.  As a result, after years of inaction, it is high time that this changed because the issue of salary is just a great symbol, but behind it, there are all the questions concerning retirement, when we know that women receive on average a pension 39% lower than that of men and that the directive adopted in 2013 which asks, among other things, companies to have at least 40% women on boards, is still not applied...

What emerges from this is a worrying, not to say alarming, picture.  As far as gender inequality between workers is concerned, the percentage of posting in Europe averages around 10%, with peaks, for example, in Italy, my own country, where this disparity reaches as much as 20% in the 30-40 age group. This means that not enough has been done in recent years either for employment policies or for family welfare systems and for early childhood. It is only by means of more effective funding that this percentage, which is still shamefully high, will be lowered.  As far as gender pay inequality is concerned, we have a guilty 16% difference across the Eu ropean Union. This is where a more cultural discourse comes into play, because it is based on discriminatory practices in all the Member States of the Union and that the 2006 directive, to which the Záborská report refers, aims to combat it.  We therefore welcome the basic content of this dossier, while pointing out our opposition to the introduction of excessively onerous sanctions and bureaucratic practices, which make the administrative burden on companies even greater.

To have a job and economic independence are key for women’s equality and, in particular now, for the integration of migrant women in our society. We need to create the conditions for all women to access the labour market without discrimination. The selection criteria should be based on competence and skills. It should be easier for women to start a business and to be entrepreneurs.

Women and men should also have the same opportunity to combine family and career. Mothers are not the only parents responsible for taking care of children. Member States should promote shared parental responsibility. Equality at work is also about removing stereotypes and changing mentality. Too many women are still victims of sexual harassment at work. As long as women are considered more for how they look than for how they perform at work, inequality will not be achieved. Our fight for equal treatment should not be ideological and it should not involve imposing a model. It is about women’s individual choice and dignity.

The labour market situation remains unsustainable, with disastrous differences in equal pay and pensions paid. At the same time, inequality is not exclusive to the labour market, nor is it something that should be talked about in purely economic terms. Inequality in society is based on how we look at and think about women – a usually stale view of women. This view allows company boards to cover only men. It would like women to do unpaid housework, and perhaps above all that it is the role of women. When Záborská and other right-wing politicians talk about this, one of the few solutions seems to be that the work in the household should be in a higher position.

Because if we do not make progress on this, we will continue to analyse the situation of women in different areas every year, but we will remain in the same situation.

We have a situation where a great deal has been done in recent decades in terms of equality and equality in the European Union. But, of course, there is still room for improvement and improvement, particularly on the issue of the wage gap, the pay gap. What do we have to do to get to grips with this problem? I think first of all, analyse the causes: why is there this large pay gap? This is primarily due to the fact that women naturally have a great many breaks in employment and that reconciling work and family life is still difficult to achieve in some countries. Women also tend to choose occupations that are less well paid. These are all the causes. We must ensure that it is possible to stay in the profession and also facilitate re-entry. This is where the parties to the collective bargaining agreement are called upon to do so. I do not think we can do much in this, legislatively.

Enforcement action is needed to address the problem. The choice of 2 November, Commissioner, is symbolic because it means that after 2 November, women work for free. We're at 85% of the year. November 2 is the day of the dead. Also, I hope it will not be conducive to burying this file.  The fight against stereotypes seems to me to be something fundamental. Gender stereotypes, which reproduce inequalities at the time of entry into the workforce, must be combated. Therefore, it is from the world of education and training that action must also be taken to avoid this scourge of gender stereotypes.

The Member States must therefore be more involved not only in eduing this work, but also in creating the conditions to promote the creation of jobs for mothers who want to work at least partially, but are rejected by employers in view of children's health problems.

Let's ask ourselves why. Why do women have a lower level of productivity? Do they have less knowledge and expertise? Do they do less in the workplace? It would be really strange to support some of these arguments. So, if there are no real irrational reasons, the gender pay gap is a gap that needs to be fixed right away. Equal treatment has been in the European legal system since 1957, but the data tell us that we are still totally far from its full implementation.

We keep saying that citizens want to shop on the Internet and cannot do so for a variety of reasons – because they have the wrong IP address, have the wrong credit card, have the wrong nationality, live in the wrong country – and therefore cannot make that purchase. The law in the European Union is actually clear: discrimination on grounds of nationality is not allowed, is not okay. That is why it is an aberration that this large internal market that we have, which brings a very great profit for businesses, this large bee market for people, for consumers and for women consumers still does not exist today and that many obstacles arise. That is why it is very important that we take action against this here too.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. Today's oral question to the Commission gives us the opportunity to make clear once again what we, on the one hand, and the Consumer Rights Directive, on the other, have made clear. Disadvantages or different treatment of consumers on the basis of their nationality or location are only permissible if there are compelling legal grounds for doing so. In the European Parliament, we are working hard and hard to ensure that the legal conditions for this are created and that, in future, different treatment is no longer permitted. We are aware that, of course, we also need a number of standardisations for this, so that businesses, on the one hand, and consumers, on the other, actually find a uniform regulatory environment. However, what we have seen with some suppliers – I am mentioning the Disneyland case from the summer – is that, although conditions in these areas are harmonised, there is still some abuse of attempts to impose different pricing models in Europe. And that is simply unacceptable. I call on the European Commission to take action here with all the possibilities it has at its disposal. I say this particularly because we know, of course, how difficult it is to achieve uniform conditions. We also have a constant debate about how much uniformity we can afford. There are many Member States that do not want to have harmonisation of certain areas of legal conditions. But if, even in the conditions where we have been brought to unification, at the end of the day, the consumer, the consumer, gets the impression that businesses can, in a sense, snatch the good part of the internal market for themselves, then this meets with our firm resistance.

The issue raised by the honourable Members touches at the heart of what EU citizens can expect of the single market. When shopping cross-border, our consumers are still being discriminated against on the basis of their nationality or place of residence. This is not acceptable. We keep on receiving complaints from citizens against alleged discriminatory practices, through various channels. First, direct complaints; second, complaints to European Consumer Centres; third, information requests to Your Europe Advice; and, fourth and most importantly, parliamentary questions. As democratically elected representatives, you act as a major interface between citizens and EU institutions. I cannot encourage you strongly enough to keep on sending us feedback from your constituents. With the rise of the internet, e-commerce is getting increasingly important, but many questions also concern transactions taking place on commercial premises. Online geo-blocking is one of the most visible and the most often described types of discrimination, with consumers being barred from completing transactions, or being redirected to another website offering the same service but at a higher price. Discrimination also takes place on a daily basis for millions of Europeans travelling abroad as tourists, buying a second home in another country, or just crossing the border. This must stop – and action has been announced in the digital single market strategy. The need for action will be expanded on in the internal market strategy for goods and services, to be adopted at the end of the month. On 24 September 2015, the Commission also launched a public consultation. The consultation will help the Commission prepare a legislative initiative in 2016. We all know examples of discriminatory practices. Last year, we initiated an action with the main car rental companies in Europe, after noticing very substantial price differences for exactly the same service, just depending on the place of residence of the customer. This year, you will have heard of press reports concerning a major amusement park in France, for which some special offers were limited to French residents. We also have examples of people being denied access to car-sharing with a non-national driving licence, or for the need to have a national registration number to buy a service. The current legal framework has not created enough certainty for businesses and consumers. It has not enabled national authorities to enforce the non-discrimination obligation in daily practice. This is what we are planning to address. Contractual freedom is an important principle, which must be preserved, but we must also tackle the voluntary segmentation of the single market by companies, and we must safeguard the rights of consumers. The interests of SMEs must also be protected. We want to encourage companies and consumers to use the single market, not force them to do so if it would be too burdensome or uncertain for them. My colleagues Elżbieta Bieńkowska and Günther Öttinger will be more than happy to discuss those challenges further in order to find solutions that open up the single market for companies and consumers alike.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 66, "date": "2015-10-08.json", "name": "Olga Sehnalová", "mepid": "96718", "text": "  On the basis of the S&amp;D Group.

It is also important to strengthen the cooperation of supervisory authorities so that they can pay close and coordinated attention to all possible forms of discrimination and make full use of the powers of the Consumer Protection Cooperation Network.  However, let us bear in mind that the elimination of so-called geoblocking is not only one of the biggest challenges in the creation of the digital internal market, but consumers also face discrimination in the offline environment.

The ALDE Group is looking forward to addressing this in a geo-blocking regulation complementing the services and e-commerce directives. Consumers across Europe face two huge barriers when trying to shop across borders: either they are denied delivery completely or delivery costs are so high that there can be no justifiable reason for them other than to prevent sales. If goods and content cannot cross borders, Europeans will not shop across borders. They will forever be locked within their national markets and subject to higher prices due to a lack of full and honest competition. Commissioner, when combined with different prices based on location, there can be no doubt that this is a case of discrimination by companies, based if not on nationality then on place of residence – discrimination if not because I am Czech then because I live in Prague. Some small businesses have said that it is not discrimination, but that they simply cannot handle the problems associated with language and returns. Maybe they are right and we need to do more on those problems, as is provided for in the strategy. But, Commissioner, on what grounds can a giant company justify this denial of service? Normally I am against overregulating businesses.

The recent VAT Mini One-Stop Shop (VAT MOSS) measure is a case in point: SMEs have to pay this tax on e-commerce sales in every single member country that they sell to, and the result has been a mass withdrawal of micro-businesses from export markets and a consequent narrowing of consumer choice.

This is an issue on which we can all agree that the current situation is not acceptable, when we look at the potential we are promising to our citizens and consumers in the internal market. In the current situation, we are supposed to have access to online and cross-border purchases, yet we cannot be fully guaranteed that because the offer is not available to another country, or because we cannot be sure of getting fair treatment compared to another consumer. The internal market is about offering everyone the chance to access – everywhere on EU territory – the services he or she needs, even from another EU country. I want to be clear: freedoms always have to be balanced against one another and there is not any which is more important than the other. So we need to balance contractual freedom with the right of consumers not to be unfairly discriminated against because of their place of residence. But we also need to recognise that there is no ‘obligation to sell’ or to unify prices throughout the single market. Where this balance lies will depend on the outcome of the consultation and the discussions with the stakeholders and Member States.

An example is arbitrary and so-called security detention, in 2014 a human rights organization lists 300 people who have been thrown into it.

Thailand is an important partner, including in our relations with the whole region. Thailand is an ancient and proud nation which is admired and loved for its nature, its culture and, most of all, for its people. Our main concern is the lack of progress in solving what seems to be a cycle of political conflict – at times violent political conflict – and military takeovers. Thailand needs to bridge divides in society as in politics. The bridges are not being built yet. Respecting human rights is essential for solving Thailand’s crisis. Human rights violations are an offence to human dignity and also a major obstacle to long-term stability and prosperity. Freedom of expression, not censorship; freedom of assembly, not restrictions or ‘attitude adjustments’; due process of law, not judging civilians in military courts: all these are prerequisites for an inclusive and peaceful process which should lead, without further delay, to the establishment of full democracy. It is against this background that we welcome the focus on Thailand’s situation and today’s debate, and I would stress the importance of Parliament’s calls for respect for human rights and for Thailand’s early return to democratic governance.  The European Union has done much already and will continue its policy of critical engagement taking a value-based approach. Our approach was first established with the Council conclusions of 23 June 2014, which called for the urgent restoration of the legitimate democratic process as well as respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It has since been followed with public statements and work for positive change. We have stepped up our work in many different ways, such as diplomatic monitoring of key court cases and meetings with those fighting for democracy and human rights. Allow me to raise one last important problem which pre-dates the military takeover and which a number of MEPs are very concerned about: forced labour in the Thai seafood industry. We are fully aware of this dramatic problem, and we will continue to take it up with our Thai counterparts. On the positive side, the Thai authorities have publicly declared that they will address it, and have already taken some initial constructive steps, but much still needs to be done. No person should be working in slave-like conditions in the 21st century.  European consumers and European buyers are increasingly aware of how the goods they consume are produced, and demand transparency and socially responsible supply chains. The day before yesterday, Parliament strongly supported the swift ratification within the EU of the International Labour Organisation protocol against forced labour. I hope Thailand follows your example very soon. To conclude, the European Union is not just a fair-weather friend. The debate here today and Parliament’s commitment are proof of our solidarity and continued friendship with the people of Thailand. We will remain engaged with the Government of Thailand, and we call for the early return to democratic governance in the country, as was stated in the Council conclusions of June 2014. Lastly, regarding Mr Andrew Hall, a labour rights activist, I congratulate our colleagues on raising this issue. The European Union has been following the situation of Mr Hall closely for quite some time. The delegation there will arrange observation of his trial on 19 October 2015.

In the last few months alone, Boko Haram has killed some 1,600 civilians. Hundreds of thousands are on the run, including many children.

Thank you for your comments. It was a very rich discussion. I was there two or three months ago. I visited areas very close to the areas controlled by Boko Haram and it is very clear that the violence perpetrated by Boko Haram is still most worrying, with, unfortunately, no predictable perspective for improvement yet. Some progress in engaging against Boko Haram has been achieved by the new authorities in Nigeria, together with its neighbouring countries, but the terrorists continue to perpetrate attacks on an almost daily basis. This is not only extending insecurity and human suffering, we also see that children are increasingly used as weapons to carry out suicide attacks. This situation is unacceptable and calls for our continued commitment. The crisis caused by Boko Haram is one of the worst humanitarian crises worldwide. The number of internally displaced people (IDPs) in the north—east of Nigeria has increased to over two million. In the whole Lake Chad region, about 700 000 children have been forced from their homes. The majority of them are staying with host communities, and not in official camps, and their needs in terms of food, education and health are most often not met. Their vulnerability makes them easy targets for bad treatment and exploitation. We are following the situation closely, together with the UN and humanitarian actors on the ground. We help Nigeria with several instruments. Firstly, through humanitarian aid, the European Union is providing assistance in the areas of healthcare, food security and nutrition, shelter, protection, water and sanitation, with a special focus on children. The Commission has been the leading humanitarian donor in Nigeria since the beginning of the Boko Haram crisis, with a mobilisation of EUR 20.5 million in the current year and EUR 42.5 million for the whole Lake Chad region. We are currently preparing to provide support to the Multinational Joint Taskforce that is being set up by the countries concerned. A significant amount has been set aside, around EUR 50 million, but not all requirements are yet met to commit these funds. The coming weeks will bring more clarity.  The European Union also funds a specific counter-terrorism project that supports counter-radicalisation and de-radicalisation measures, observance of human rights in military operations, the establishment of communication systems and Nigeria’s criminal justice response to terrorism.  EU development assistance under the European Development Fund (EDF) focuses on tackling the root causes of radicalisation and violence, and is targeted in part at children – in particular with projects on child protection and juvenile justice administration, child health, psychosocial support for boys and girls who are victims of armed conflict, and involving girls in peacebuilding efforts in north-east Nigeria. Nigeria is also a priority country for the EU in the Children in Armed Conflict initiative, following the listing of the country in the UN report on children and armed conflict. In mobilising this support, we are doing our best to address the situation of children suffering the consequences of Boko Haram violence. But, of course, much of the responsibility lies with national governments. We will stay committed to supporting them, and will continue to work with the United Nations, civil society and our humanitarian partners on the ground.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 140, "date": "2015-10-08.json", "name": "Elnök asszony. –", "mepid": "102886", "text": "   The debate is over.

Eight months after we adopted an emergency resolution on the case of Raif Badawi, whose freedom we are asking for today today, this Parliament is once again raising its voice in favour of Ali Mohamed al-Nimr; we're not going to shut up.

As we all know, Saudi Arabia is an important partner for the European Union but, like many in Europe, we are concerned by the death sentence imposed on Mr al-Nimr by a Saudi court earlier this year. Mr al-Nimr was a juvenile when he was arrested in 2012 on charge of, inter alia, joining a criminal group and attacking police forces after he took part in demonstrations in the Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province. We have been closely following developments related to his case, as well as the overall human rights situation in Saudi Arabia. The basis and conditions of Mr al-Nimr’s sentence, as well as the nature of the punishment handed down to him, are matters of grave concern for the European Union. In addition, the sentence appears manifestly disproportionate. We have therefore been engaging the Saudi authorities, in close coordination with EU Member States represented in Riyadh. Our Delegation in Riyadh has been tasked to convey to the Saudi authorities our strong view that the sentence is disproportionate and the proposed modalities of the execution particularly degrading, and to call on them to review Mr al-Nimr’s sentence. This is, of course, also an opportunity to reiterate, once more, our principled EU position on the death penalty, as well as to stress the worrying increase in the use of the death penalty in Saudi Arabia. We also constantly reiterate the need to respect the UN minimum standards, especially concerning the issue of execution of minors and renew our offer to engage in a more constructive human rights dialogue with Saudi Arabia. The pace of executions in Saudi Arabia is reaching unprecedented levels, with capital punishment being increasingly imposed for non-lethal crimes, such as drug offences.  Obviously, we will continue to call on our Saudi partners to suspend the sentence and to review the court ruling. Let me once again assure you that we will continue to remain engaged with the case of Mr al-Nimr and to voice the EU’s concern through appropriate channels.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 159, "date": "2015-10-08.json", "name": "Elnök asszony. –", "mepid": "102886", "text": "   The debate is over.

Mr President, on 14 February 2012 Mohammed al-Nimr, who took part in a demonstration against the Government of Saudi Arabia, was arrested at the age of 17. He was subsequently sentenced to execution by decapitation and public crucifixion. According to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, each country is prohibited from imposing the death penalty and life imprisonment on persons under the age of 17. However, Saudi Arabia has not only violated this UN Convention by imposing the death penalty on Mohammed al-Nimr, but has declared it illegal to participate in a protest against the government, which also violates the right to free expression. In the face of this violation of basic human rights, the EU is called upon to make its opposition to the sentencing decision of Mohammed al-Nimr immediately clear, to demand that the sentence not be carried out and to ask for a pardon.

It underlines the need for the EU to provide sufficient human and financial resources to meet its commitments in this area. The resolution recommends the inclusion in the Second Gender Action Plan of very concrete measures. Among others: the call to guarantee the protection of the rights of different groups of women (young people, migrants, HIV-infected, LGBTI and disabled people); recognition of the importance of universal access to sexual and reproductive health care and rights; recognition of the premism of removing social and legal barriers.

We are the ones who make the most sacrifices when it comes to raising babies and looking after elderly family members.
