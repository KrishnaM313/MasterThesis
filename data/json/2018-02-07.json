In times when democracy as a system is called into question by some, elections are the most important expression of citizens’ democratic will. The European Parliament directly represents its citizens in the European Union, so we as Members of Parliament form the direct link between citizens and the Union, and it is the prerogative of the European Parliament to propose its composition to the European Council and to have a final say on the European Council decision for each legislative period. A distribution of Parliament’s seats that is fair, that follows subjective principles and that respects the EU Treaties was the objective that we as co-rapporteurs set ourselves when we were entrusted with this task. We listened to the concerns of our colleagues in the House and the Member States and proposed a composition that fully respects the principle of digressive proportionality, as required by the Treaty. This principle ensures a fair and balanced representation of citizens by Member State. Observance of this principle, in combination with the distribution of some of the UK’s vacated seats, allows us to address the under-representation of some Member States in the House. Brexit has undoubtedly created a new situation for the Union that affects the composition of our House. One of the most populous Member States is leaving the Union, and we believe that this should be reflected in the future distribution of seats. We have the opportunity here not only to address the problem of under-representation of some Member States but also to leave a number of seats available for future enlargements and, depending on the creation of the proper legal basis, for the creation of transnational lists for European elections. By reducing the size of Parliament from 751 to 705 Members, we would also allow for savings, thereby freeing up resources that can be used for other purposes. I think these are the right signals to send to our citizens. Brexit has also made our task more challenging due to legal uncertainties as to the precise date and terms on which the EU acquis will cease to apply to the UK. That is why we have also envisaged a fall-back option in case the UK has not formally withdrawn from the Union by the time of the next elections. In conclusion, I would like to highlight that this report garnered 80% support in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. I hope that we will manage to achieve a large majority in today’s vote in plenary as well, in order to ensure fair representation of our citizens. I call, in this regard, on the European Council to take heed of the European Parliament’s position with regard to its composition.

This seems simple, but it's never been done. Whenever it was necessary in the past to adjust the composition of Parliament, some had to lose so that others could win. And we know why it is different now: we have discussed the recomposition of Parliament in the context of Brexit and therefore have the opportunity to distribute at least some of the seats in the United Kingdom. Naturally, in the past tensions between winners and losers have always prevented deviations from the status quo and led to pragmatic solutions in which possible political commitments have always fallen short of fairer representation. None of that happens now in this proposal, because we have the fantastic opportunity to finally have a fairer Parliament that represents more faithfully the population of the Member States and at the same time ensuring that no Member State loses seats in Parliament. This is indeed possible now and we must not miss this opportunity. Of course, the redistribution of seats in the United Kingdom must be limited because citizens would not understand if a large country should leave the European Union and the size of Parliament should not be reduced. But some distribution is necessary if we do not want to miss this opportunity. Therefore, after listening carefully to the experts, after listening to this Parliament, starting with the shadow rapporteurs, the proposal that I and my colleague Danuta Hübner are putting forward is this: firstly, that all countries keep the number of Members they have now. It's, I'd say, the basic principle, no one loses seats. Second, that in addition, 27 of the 73 seats in the United Kingdom, which will be left vacant, are distributed to those States that are underrepresented today. It is a fair, balanced, politically viable proposal, which has already been approved by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and which I hope will also be adopted by this House today. Our distribution key is not the application of any of the many mathematical formulas that have been discussed and which have achieved neither political nor technical consensus. But it is also not a simple pragmatic solution like the one that has been in force until now. What we are proposing is a solution based on principles, the principle of degressive proportionality and the principle that no state loses seats. By redistributing only 27 out of 73 posts, we are of course also proposing a reduction in Parliament and leaving a margin of 46 seats available for future enlargements or for the possible creation of transnational lists. And let me say just two words to you about transnational lists. And the first is to undo a misunderstanding. This report is about the composition of Parliament, it is not about transnational lists. Through this report, Parliament, as it did in 2015, recognises that it is up to the Council, in the context of reform of electoral legislation, to decide unanimously on the creation of a possible common European constituency. That is why the report says that this Council decision is a precondition. This is what is at stake and not more than this. I hope that no one-off disagreement will prevent this Parliament from sending a clear message to the Council and proposing a parliament...

I think they have done an excellent job on a very difficult file. I, for my part, want to focus on the transnational list. I have made no secret of my view that, as far as I am concerned, the transnational list is a bad idea. Here are my reasons. There are several. First, the transnational list (TNL) is based on an idea that out there somewhere there is a European demos just waiting to be represented, and that the TNL will do just this. This is an error. There is no European demos and to claim the contrary is an illusion. Have European citizens ever been asked if they want to be represented by a transnational list? Again, the answer is no. So, in real terms, what we are looking at is a top—down, elite—driven project, presumably starting from the belief that, if the transnational list comes into being, so will the European demos. Why on earth should it? It is a fatal assumption that the TNL will generate a supranational European consciousness. If anything, those putatively elected on the TNL will be remote from the electorate, and that will not do the reputation of this Parliament any good. It’s magical thinking that the transnational list will somehow produce the European demos. If the transnational list does happen, then this Parliament will have 27 free—floating MEPs answerable to none. They will have power without an electorate, they will have power without accountability and power without responsibility. So where are the checks and balances? I shouldn’t have to say that power without responsibility is the high road to arbitrariness. That, if you ask me, is about as undemocratic as it gets.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2018-02-07.json", "name": "Mercedes Bresso", "mepid": "28346", "text": " on behalf of the S&D Group. — (IT) (IT) (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, meanwhile, I too want to thank the rapporteurs and I hope that this more balanced organisation of Parliament can also be approved by the Council. I also hope that the part of transnational lists can be approved by the Council, which I also hope will be approved by Parliament as it was approved in committee. To my colleague Schöplin and the many who have spoken out against transnational lists these days, I remember that we already represent all European citizens today. So I am very far away when I am in Brussels from a Greek voter who I also represent, as I am far from my constituents I represent, but I am not just representing the electors of my college. Having a transnational list with candidates, if possible, from all European countries — and the amendment would allow — led by the candidates Presidents of the Commission, would in effect create an area of European political debate. It is pointless for us to continue to say that we are talking only about national issues in the European elections. We say it continually. The way to talk about European elections is to have real European candidates, who somehow lead the debate at European level. It is not true that there is no European demos, today it is all full of movements — Pulse of Europe, Stand Up for Europe, Wake Up Europe, Civic Europe — that are independently moving to create this space European debate politician. So does Parliament want to do it, too? Do you want to hear the voice of the citizens of Europe who are asking to be able to speak about Europe with their own Members, including those who represent them and not just among themselves? I think this is the time. I do not understand how Mr Schöplin, who has so much been involved in the initiative of European citizens, does not understand that this is another instrument to give space and voice to those who want, on occasion of the European elections, talking about Europe and not their own national problems.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2018-02-07.json", "name": "Kazimierz Michał Ujazdowski", "mepid": "23791", "text": " on behalf of the ECR Group. — Mr President! I respect the rapporteurs, but I cannot support this report as it stands. First, I think we may have thought through not distributing places after the British. This would be a chance for Parliament to be more efficient, frugal and I think it would be met with a very good reception from the people. And the other issue is a special transnational constituency. Also here the ECR has a critical stance. There is an argument raised by Mr Schöpflin about properly forcible building of a political entity. Yesterday, Prime Minister Plenković rightly pointed out that, in such a constituency, an election campaign would be a sham. Once again, the idea of the Federalists, and actually the Federalists in a dogmatic variant, will be counterproductive. Instead of increasing the bond between MPs and citizens, it will weaken it and will, as a result, foster populism and Euroscepticism. Members of the European Parliament should be elected in Member States, they should be closer to citizens.

You may remember the former president of the European People’s Party who was my predecessor as Prime Minister of Belgium and who was, I can say quite easily, a very dedicated European, Wilfried Martens. Wilfried Martens was a true believer in and defender of transnational lists and he understood what was at stake: he understood that without a strong link between the citizens and Europe, eurosceptics and populists would in the end always win the game. And he understood that transnational lists will not alienate the citizen: quite the contrary. Why? Because, in the proposal that you have before you, people will have two votes. One vote is for a national candidate, for a national list, to keep the link between the citizen and his or her MEP; and a second vote is for transnational candidates, to strengthen the link between the citizen and the European Union. In my view, this is the only way to create what I call a European demos – which cannot arrive by accident, or spontaneously of itself – and I think it is also needed to make the Spitzenkandidaten process really democratic. Today the Spitzenkandidaten process is still undemocratic and non-transparent, a backroom deal within political parties or between political parties. What Spitzenkandidaten alone will not deliver, and what transnational lists will deliver because they complement the Spitzenkandidaten process, it is that it becomes a democratic process. It will be the people, the citizens, who will decide on the Spitzenkandidaten and the President of the Commission. I have not heard any serious arguments against it. People say federal states don’t have it: wrong! Federal states want it. My country, Belgium, is a federal state and many want a federal constituency. It is separatists who make war against it. A second example is the United States of America: a federal state. It’s because there is no single constituency that it is Mr Trump who is President and not Hilary Clinton, who received three million votes more than Donald Trump. Secondly, another argument I hear is that transnational lists are good for populists. I have to tell you that is also wrong. You could argue that democracy is only good for populists, so let’s abolish democracy and let’s abolish elections. I can tell you one thing: that’s nonsense. You have to beat the populists, not to fear them, and to do that you need transnational lists. The third argument, that transnational lists are only good for big Member States, is also wrong. No political party can afford to participate in elections without putting all the countries on the transnational list. What counts is not size, Mr Rangel, what counts is the vision, the passion, the commitment of all of us. That is what counts. And let us be honest about big Member States. Our colleagues from Spain, Poland, France, Italy and Germany today need at least double the number of votes received by us representatives of small and medium-sized Member States, but I nevertheless tabled, together with Pascal, an amendment to ensure that small and medium-sized Member States will be represented on the list. I am concluding. I know you’re a very tough President, Mr Wieland. Let’s not waste this historic opportunity. Brexit will never come back. Never again will we see half of the Member States in favour of this European constituency. And finally, Mr President, Altiero Spinelli, the father of this European Parliament, would turn in his grave if we missed this unique opportunity.

On Monday, the Group of the European People's Party informed the press that the agreement it negotiated to reduce parliamentary seats after 2019 was a priority this week. This is called fake news. In reality, as is well known, the power of the disputed EPP was only enough to prevent the permanent system that was urgently needed for future seat distribution. This report also does not follow the widespread squint of Brexit's savings potential, but focuses on correcting the ongoing breach of law in the distribution of seats. I think that is right, and here I would also like to thank the two co-rapporteurs. Equity of distribution among Member States, transnational lists of political parties and movements, and future enlargement are the political keywords for which the potentially vacant British seats are to be used or parked, but not returned. That's right for me. For us as GUE/NGL, however, it was clear that the report had to take Brexit legally seriously, but the political process should be kept open. History is open, including to the people of the UK, including respect for the Good Friday Agreement. The compromise reached is pragmatic and politically sensible. But let us be honest: there would also have been an urgent need for a debate on the need to strengthen the democratic support of European policy, that is, on the possibility of how populations can make their voice heard with their interests and needs, and perhaps also on how the European Parliament — for example strengthened by the right of initiative — as an institution directly elected by citizens — can take over the organisation of its daily lives.

Yet each of us is elected in our national or even regional constituency, which may lead us to prioritize national or regional interests over that general interest. To take a concrete example, our common currency, the euro, in order to be viable, needs strong financial solidarity mechanisms between states, which obviously cannot go without responsible management of public affairs and expenditure. It is very easy today for a German candidate to defend responsibility in the German constituency as it is very easy for a Greek candidate to defend solidarity in the Greek constituency. The opposite is much more difficult, but that is what candidates running at European level will have to do. They will have to formulate and defend a project that can speak and convince not only in one country of the Union, but throughout the Union. This is the condition for a genuine democratic debate in Europe. The departure of British elected officials is an opportunity to give the debate this truly European dimension without abolishing seats at the national level, with transnational seats being added to and not substitute for national seats. Ladies and gentlemen, five years ago we also innovated by referring to the idea of “leading figures” candidates, the Spitzenkandidaten.

So let's talk about the direct representation of the latter. Britain's exit will leave 73 seats vacant within Parliament and my fellow rapporteurs, whom I thank, have made a proposal in the report to redistribute some of them, which appears to me fairly balanced judgment. But the great novelty introduced by the report is another. This is the allocation of some seats to a single constituency coinciding with the whole territory of the Union. Candidates divided into transnational lists would compete for these. As a 5 Star Movement we have always had puzzlement that the peoples of Europe are ready for a similar step, but we have decided to accept the challenge. Accept it yes, but provided that both this project and the Spitzenkandidaten make it possible to create true platforms for the aggregation of experiences from movements, including from civil society, and they are not exclusive party pannage. These lists cannot and should not become a parachute available to parties to make elected politicians no longer able to gather acclaim, but on the contrary they must constitute an opportunity for enlarging and strengthening democratic debate and citizens' ties with the European institutions and the integration process.

True proximity to the citizens would have meant saving the 73 seats that will be released after Brexit. That would have really done European citizens.

I am very curious to see how the Council sees the initiative of this House. I find it very difficult to imagine that this will be accepted there.

Today we have a chance to take a major step towards more European democracy. We want to give citizens two votes in the European elections: one for the existing national lists and then — new — a second vote for the transnational European lists. The European elections have a fundamental problem: they are not European elections. They are in prison for national election campaigns, national electoral lists, national electoral laws.

You can only choose it in your own country. The missing link is indeed the European list that the European parties can establish democratically and that citizens throughout the Union can elect their top candidates for the post of President of the Commission. It is astonishing that this Parliament took a decision on the European lists in 1998 — 20 years ago — by a very large majority, including across political families.

This means that German citizens remain the worst represented citizens in the Strasbourg Assembly. This European Parliament is constantly teaching lessons in democracy, but it is clear that it does not meet the demands it places on others. I call on the German Government not to accept the non-deletion of all British seats or the distribution key chosen, and to block both in the Council.

Founding father Jean Monnet said that Europe would be done step by step. And that's how it was. When the European Union was created there was no Parliament, ladies and gentlemen. It was created later. The European Parliament was a step in European construction. Members of the national parliaments came to that Parliament. They were not elected by citizens, but Members of the national parliaments. The next step was indeed elections throughout Europe. A day to elect the European Parliament, European sovereignty. This step we are taking today, ladies and gentlemen, is a step, as Jean Monnet would say, to build Europe. It's so there's a double vote. For citizens to connect with the European idea, and hopefully a Spitzenkandidat will head every political family to elect the President of the Commission. That is building Europe. For me, the step we are taking is an extraordinarily important political signal in favour of this idea that is gradually being built. It's a long story, but it's a beautiful story. It is a wonderful story of building, upon nations, a space of peace and progress.

Congratulations to my fellow rapporteurs! Colleagues, with the UK leaving the European Union, it has become a priority for us to find a fair and representative redistribution of mandates for a European Union of 27 Member States. Therefore, the proposal put forward for the vote today represents a pragmatic compromise, a compromise that can compensate for the imbalances in the current voting system, whereby 14 countries are underrepresented. Speaking now as a Romanian MEP, I think it is natural for Romania to receive an additional mandate. As one of the most important countries in the Eastern European region, Romania deserves a representation in relation to its status, the sixth most important demographically country in the European Union after the exit of Great Britain. Last but not least, this is a repair for the loss suffered in 2014, with the accession of Croatia. Colleagues, if we want this parliamentary term to be remembered by its achievements and achievements, then we must give European citizens a viable solution, which will also bring legal certainty about the conduct of elections. I therefore urge all national delegations to support this new mandate redistribution formula with a positive vote in order to avoid possible bottlenecks or ad hoc solutions ahead of the 2019 elections.

We sit by political affinity and, within our political groups, we also do not sit by national delegation, we sit alphabetically. If each Member has their own nationality, each of us is also the representative of all the citizens of our Union. That is why I defend the transnational lists, which are in the genes of the EPP, to which I belong. I am so that our fellow citizens, during the European elections, can both vote for a national list brought by a national party and, at the same time, vote for a European list carried by a European party on European political guidelines. To give our fellow citizens two ballots is not to take them out of power, it means giving them twice as much. It's more democratic. As for the idea that transnational lists would favour extremes, it reminds me of those doctors who would try to cure the fever by breaking the thermometer.

I believe that the proposal which we put forward is the middle ground between all points of view on the matter, and in the light of all the special – I would say extraordinary – circumstances we are facing this time around, this is the best solution available with regard to the composition of Parliament for the forthcoming term. I would also like to reiterate my request to the European Council to heed Parliament’s wishes in relation to its own composition, and I hope that the report will be approved by the European Council in the version that will, hopefully, pass through Parliament today. I would also like to make it clear to colleagues that the bigger the majority with which we adopt the composition proposal, the more likely it is that the Council will not change it. I am confident that, with this report, Parliament is sending a strong signal to citizens that it will remain efficient, while managing to reduce its size by 46 seats owing to the withdrawal of the UK from the Union. I hope that the European Council will support us in this proposal because it is fair, equitable and in full compliance with Treaty principles.

Firstly, as would be expected, the discussion on transnational lists, but I would like to insist that what this report does is to leave a number of posts available which can be used in future, both for enlargements or in the possible creation of transnational lists. Because, moreover, this report recognises, as Parliament already recognised in 2015, that the creation of transnational lists is the subject of electoral law and therefore depends, as a precondition, on a unanimous decision by the Council. More importantly, this debate has shown a very broad consensus on the rapporteurs' proposal for the distribution of seats and that is very important. I believe that there are good reasons for very broad support for this proposal, not only from those who see their unfair underrepresentation finally corrected, but also from those small or medium states that have left for this debate in fear of losing seats once again and which see three times. guaranteed their representation. Firstly, because the proposal does not reduce seats to any Member State, secondly, because it does not enshrink any mathematical formula that entails loss in the future, and thirdly, because it gives the assurance that even in the event of enlargement and even in the case of transnational lists, this distribution of posts will not be affected.

In my vision of Europe, which combines federalism and realism, I believe that the establishment of these unique constituencies will help to create a stronger link with the European citizen and, in this sense, will foster more European democracy. These transnational lists will indeed make it possible to “export Europe” better, to have more debate and, I hope, to strengthen the sense of European belonging. Finally, they will make it possible to give the European elections a true European character. The problem of European elections — beyond low turnout — is that they are the sum of national electoral laws. Having transnational lists that go beyond geographical divides can give these elections a real European dimension, beyond the borders of the Member States. The establishment of single constituencies must, however, be part of a much broader project and should be followed by other measures that will enable the European project to be revived, which, more than ever, needs a new impetus.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 77, "date": "2018-02-07.json", "name": "Monika Smolková (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "96655", "text": "in writing. - Following the UK's departure from the EU, the EP will have 73 fewer MEPs.

There were opinions among our fellow MEPs to redistribute them all, but there were also those who had the same view as I did, so that we would not share anything, to invest the money saved in development projects for young people or to protect the external borders, or to support less developed regions. Following the accession of new countries to the EU, they would gradually be allocated vacancies. Uniting has not been easy, so it is necessary to thank the rapporteurs for a sensible compromise that redistributes 27 seats and leaves 46 free for future EU members. I am pleased that Slovakia will receive one more mandate with this proposal, which will give us fourteen MEPs after 2019. I have quite a different view of the creation of a transnational electoral list, because I consider it unrealistic for anyone to campaign before the EP elections across the EU so that they can not be held accountable to their constituents for their work.

The current proposals are made in the spirit of a practical compromise and will serve to enhance the democratic functioning of the European institutions and the Union as a whole and strengthen the role of the EP. In particular, I also support a reduction in the number of EP staff and a better application of degressive proportionality in the area of representation per Member State, with no extra seat for my own Member State. However, it is important that the change does not mean a reduction in any Member State, which I believe should be enforced in the event of any future change.

Contrary to skeptical opinions, I believe that they can be introduced at the time of the next parliament's mandate, and the necessary legal basis can be established in time if there is sufficient political will.

If you vote in favour of this report, you will vote for a European government; if you vote against, you will vote for a Commission of the governments of the countries of Europe. They are two very different models. Yesterday, President Juncker warned us that there are voices within the Council that want to eliminate the figure of the candidate for President of the Commission. Let me tell you that, in my opinion, that would be a step backwards for European democracy. I am not saying a step backwards for European construction, which, too, I say that European elections without a candidate for President of the Commission are less democratic elections, almost a failed election. The figure of the candidate for president of the Commission allows citizens to go to the polls knowing what the programme of each party is and what is the candidate of each party. Normal. Because in the European elections not only a Parliament is elected, a European government is also elected, and it would be a democratic abnormality for citizens to not be able to elect that government or even know who the candidates are to lead that government. This European Union is still a democracy under construction and therefore vulnerable. It is enough for Europe's enemies to oppose European democracy. You cannot be a friend of Europe and contrary to European democracy. For nationalpopulists, it is easier to attack a European Union with a democratic deficit than a European Union that is built and supported by the citizens' vote. National populists come to the European institutions to destroy them, disguise themselves as democrats to attack democracy and use the rule of law to end the rule of law. Only real democracy unmasks false democrats. That is why our biggest problem is that every day more and more citizens buy populist discourse because they feel that the Community institutions are far from normal people; because they feel that the Community institutions live in the universe of statistics and big figures rather than in the real world of supermarket prices and because they feel that the European institutions are accountable to the Council but not to the people. This growing disaffection can only end if the possibilities for political participation are increased: that citizens can choose with more European democracy, not with less. When we say only 'we need more Europe' instead of saying 'we need more European democracy', what is understood is that we are looking for more European bureaucracy and not more European politics. If we do not build a democratic Europe, if Europe remains just another historic alliance between European nations, all the effort that the European Democrats have made after World War II and after the Eastern and Southern dictatorships of Europe will have been of no use. That citizens know and be able to vote for candidates for President of the Commission is not a whim, it is not even a democratic demand; knowing the face of the candidate is normal and the rare thing would be for us to insist that a president of the European government can be elected without citizens knowing what face he has or what face he has nationality is not what its name is, not even what is its gender. That is why in my report I propose that the European Parliament be prepared to reject any candidate for President of the Commission proposed by the Council who has not been previously appointed as the main candidate in the European elections. This is not a conflict between the Council and Parliament. This is a conflict between power and democracy.

I believe that we have a strong Code of Conduct, strengthened over the years as we have learned from our mistakes. To paraphrase Alexander Hamilton, if people were angels, we would not need rules. It is in this vein that on 13 September last year we proposed to improve transparency, strengthen democratic legitimacy and enforce our collective high standards through a renewed statute for the funding of political parties and movements. We are doing this in order to close loopholes that are clearly prone to abuse. I believe Parliament and the Council are not that far apart, and I look forward to the swift adoption of that proposal so as to be in time for the next parliamentary elections in 2019. But let me now turn to the Code of Conduct again. The Commission would welcome support for allowing Commissioners to stand in, and campaign for, European elections without having to take leave; and for revising the framework agreements between the European Parliament and the Commission accordingly. Article 10 of the new Code of Conduct makes the safeguards in relation to Commissioners participating in elections very clear. In line with paragraph 4 of this article, Parliament will be informed of the measures taken to ensure respect for the principles of independence, integrity and discretion. Present Juncker has tasked the Commission secretariat-general with preparing guidance on this matter in time for the next European election. Parliament’s reply to the consultation on the new Code of Conduct came in time to allow most of its provisions to enter into force on 1 February this year as planned. At the same time, it is clear that the provisions governing participation in European elections will enter into force only once the amendments to the Framework Agreement have been formally adopted by Parliament. The Commission addresses in the new Code of Conduct as many of the concerns expressed by Parliament as possible. President Tajani has written a letter to President Juncker regarding the areas where Parliament would deem further changes desirable. The Commission has analysed these carefully and I know that President Juncker will respond in a letter which he will send out shortly. You also take the opportunity in your report to restate Parliament’s support for the process of ‘lead candidates’ or Spitzenkandidaten. Yesterday morning President Juncker spoke clearly about the lead candidate system, as well as the question of transnational lists. He noted that both issues, in their own way, generate political debate between EU institutions.

This morning we are discussing the fundamental question of how we can organise democracy on a European level. The EU is not a state, but it’s already a key decision—maker in a lot of important areas in the daily life of citizens. That’s why it’s important to discuss this issue. The Lisbon Treaty was already a big step: today, the European Parliament, now directly elected, is powerful, and we decide together with the Council. People and states are deciding – that is Europe.  Now it’s a question of whether there is a need for another approach at European level to practising democracy. I would say not. There is no need for an innovative approach on this. In my small village, where my home is in Bavaria, when we elect a mayor, we have a candidate and we have a programme. When in October of this year we hold an election in Bavaria for the Prime Minister of Bavaria, we will have candidates from the different parties and each candidate will have a programme, a profile.  When people in France vote in the presidential elections for a President of France, they have a candidate and this candidate has a programme. Sorry, dear friends, but I am fed up of asking for the same procedure, which is established at all other levels, to be allowed at European level, too – to present people, before we go to vote, with a candidate and with a programme. That is democratic and that is what we should also do in 2019. Dear friends, Churchill said once that it is the people who control the government, not the government the people. This sentence is also true for the heads of states and governments around Europe. President Macron, for example, is making a lot of effort to strengthen the European Union, but on the top candidate concept, we need a clear answer from him, too. If Macron wants to stick to a democratic Europe then he has to agree to the lead candidate process. I hope that the President is listening to our debate here today. He can read our lips when we say very clearly that the EPP Group will not accept a candidate for Commission President who was not presented during the campaign as lead candidate of a democratic party and cannot bring together a qualified majority in the newly—elected European Parliament. We need a President of the European Commission who is elected, and not selected behind closed doors. I appeal to the European Council: let’s not now start a power game among the institutions; let’s simply practise democracy. I’m very, very pleased that LeoVaradkar, Andrej Plenković and Sebastian Kurz – who gave his support in an interview on Saturday – and now finally Jean—Claude Juncker, the current Commission President, were absolutely clear that they support the concept. So there is growing support for this idea, even in the Council. Let’s make Europe democratic, let’s fight for the top candidate concept.

In addition, situations could easily occur during the election campaign that undermine precisely the independence which, according to the Treaties, characterizes the Commissioner.

In our view, the only way to address the problems exposed is precisely for members of the Commission to resign once they have decided to participate in the electoral competition.

The Spitzenkandidaten process, launched in 2014, reinforces the political accountability of the Commission and gives a stronger role the European political parties. The political tradition of these parties has always been to stand for a European approach in dealing with the challenges the European Union is facing. We have been through this process once already.

The tone of the report, yesterday's debate with President Juncker, the rapporteur's own expression alert us that there are warning signs. Alarm signs of a turning back in relation to the Spitzenkandidat and other democratic elements.

Mr Pons's report focuses in particular on Parliament's position on the leading candidate procedure, in the political context of preventing any legal basis for such a legal basis in the Council. The report on the future composition of Parliament, which has just been discussed, is an influence on this procedure because it addresses the issue of transnational lists and, consequently, the position of top candidate. We will hopefully learn something about the Council's position this afternoon, and yes, the vote here in the House on the composition of the EP has not yet taken place. This raises another question for me, namely the problem of the participation of Commissioners in the election campaign. In the country from which I come, is political competition in the context of elections constitutionally incompatible with any partial action by state bodies or their officials? Voters should be able to freely form their opinions, and this leads to a neutrality requirement for us. Now the EU is not a state, nor do we have a constitution. But the neutrality requirement should be analogous. This raises the question: when is a Commissioner acting with the authority of the Office and is using the resources associated with it, and when is he only on the move in party politics?

Mr Pons, whatever our positions on glyphosate or CETA are, these debates and mobilizations are no longer only national, but also European.

Then, let me tell you something that is very important. We fully support this idea of the Spitzenkandidaten procedure but if the Council says ‘no we are not going to change our view’, we are not dependent on any regulation of the Council, because this is our interpretation of the Treaties. The Treaty says that the outcome of the elections should be considered and that a vote in Parliament is required. This is sufficient to give a constitutional basis to the Spitzenkandidaten process.

Also be clear: Portugal is a country, not a European region at the behest of Mr Verhofstadt. It is considered normal or acceptable for candidates from small and medium-sized countries to be chosen by leaders of the large countries controlling European parties and who, of course, will benefit from starting their own interests. A European party which is part of more than one party from the same country is allowed to exclude some parties from the lists in favour of others who have more influence in the direction of those parties. They do not even want to make it easier for radical candidates from some countries to spread their message to all other countries where they will also gain votes and influence. I have to say that these radicals have not yet arrived in Portugal and I did not like to see them being voted on there.

Our European-ness is what unites us in our differences; imposing from the top a transnational list instead of making our citizens more European might, on the contrary, drive a wedge between electorates and the people supposed to represent them in the EU. All politics are local, and there is a good reason why. People need to feel that their particular problems are well understood and conveyed. Also, there is no contradiction between favouring national lists and favouring more integration. Integration is stronger if it is rooted in the local, and if it is a natural, bottom-up construction.

In the European Union, some 120 million people are poor; 28 million children live in households that cannot provide for their basic needs – food, health care, education or housing. It is absolutely shameful that the richest continent of the world does not take proper care of its own children. Even though the European economy is on the mend again and unemployment is going down, income and wealth inequality is on the rise, and an alarming 40% of wealth is in the hands of only 1% of the richest Europeans. Clearly the neo-liberal myth of the invisible hand and trickle-down economics is not going to sort out the situation, nor are today’s insufficient policy efforts. The election of Trump, and Brexit, which also stemmed from a growing disappointment with the status quo, must be the wake-up call for the last sleep-walkers. The growing gap between the rich and the poor is undermining the social and democratic fabric of our societies. It is high time to act now. Big challenges require strong political answers. We Socialists and Democrats fight side by side with an alliance of NGOs and social partners for strong policy responses that will work. We will campaign for an equitable and sustainable society of shared prosperity, opportunity and dignity. We call on the Commission to rapidly act and introduce an inequality reduction strategy within the European Semester to achieve income growth, especially for the bottom 40%. We are working for a poverty eradication road map to halve the number of people living in poverty by 2030, and for a directive on decent working conditions. We wish to create a living wage index to help define appropriate minimum wages in each Member State. If we know how devastating the consequences of inequalities are, why do we not use the remaining time in this mandate to improve the lives of the most needy Europeans? Let us introduce a child guarantee that ensures that each and every child in every country is able to access proper health care, good schooling and a healthy diet. Let us introduce a framework directive for decent working conditions that ensures that workers are no longer at risk of exploitation. Let us have protection against poor pay and have proper social rights, regardless of whether people work in industry or in digital platforms. And let us end the rhetoric of free trade that tries to convince people that trade only needs to be free to work for the people, because this neglects the hardship of those without jobs in deprived regions. We know that only with proper environment and sustainability provisions can trade be really progressive. A lot can be done to take this fight to the next level. The social pillar must be properly implemented, we need strong improvements on maternity and paternity leave – parenthood must not mean poverty. We must continue to fight against tax fraud and tax evasion. Digital giants have to pay proper taxes too. I would like to appeal to the whole House. My Group, the Socialists and Democrats, are willing to fight for that today, tomorrow and each and any other day of this mandate.

Today, more than ever, the European Union needs to guarantee the prosperity and well—being of all its citizens, as well as to overcome the socio—economic inequalities in a fast-changing world. According to opinion polls, more and more citizens across Europe feel that they cannot fully profit from the benefits of globalisation. We need to make sure they see that the European Union is the solution to their concerns and that it delivers on their expectations. As a result of the effective policy response to the economic crisis by the European institutions and the Member States, the EU economy is now firmly recovering. Economic growth has returned and unemployment is at its lowest since 2008. Nevertheless, social and economic challenges persist across Europe. In 2017, 23% of our citizens remained at risk of falling into poverty and social exclusion. Young people are still especially vulnerable and we really need to focus our efforts on them as they are the future of Europe, of our economies and our societies. The consequences of leaving a whole generation without prospects would not only be morally irresponsible, but would have long—standing negative economic and political effects in the decades to come. We need to make sure that young people have better opportunities for education and training, mobility and personal development, and improved access to employment. Socio—economic stability and fairness is a pre-condition for social progress and trust in the European Union project. As Parliament rightly stated in its resolution of November 2017 on combating inequalities, the reduction of inequalities must be one of the main priorities at European level, not only in order to tackle poverty or promote convergence but also as a precondition for economic recovery, decent job creation, social cohesion and shared prosperity. The root causes of socio—economic inequalities are related to a wide range of factors. The scission between rich and poor is widening. Labour markets and societies are evolving quickly with new opportunities and new challenges arising from globalisation, the digital revolution, changing work patterns and societal and demographic developments. The industrial revolutions for zero waste and digitalisation are presenting enormous opportunities, but they are also placing extraordinary pressure on skills. In order to overcome existing inequalities based on skills, we need a comprehensive approach. We must fill the digital skills gap and prepare both our citizens and our labour market for change. For this reason, one of our Presidency’s four priorities is the digital economy and skills for the future. Discrimination and gender inequality are two further factors that contribute to inequalities. The average gender pay gap remains above 16%, and in some Member States it is above 20%. Our citizens expect us to take action: they rank unemployment and social inequality as the most important challenges the European Union has to face. This is also a commitment that we have made at national, European and international level. The leaders of 27 Member States recognised in the Rome Declaration that economic and social inequalities were unprecedented challenges for the European Union. They pledged to work towards a social Europe which promotes economic and social progress as well as cohesion and convergence. So the key tools to overcome inequalities are the new provisions for training and for the protection of our workers – vocational training helping the redistributive potential of social protection systems. As the current Presidency, we look forward to the Commission proposal on the new social fairness package expected on 7 March. I would like to express our readiness and willingness to start negotiations on it properly within the Council. We also plan to adopt the recommendation on the Framework for Quality and Effective Apprenticeships at the March Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO). The signature of the proclamation of the European pillar of social rights is an important step towards reinforcing the social dimension of Europe. It provides a compass for action towards better working and living conditions in the European Union, hence renewing the process of increasing social convergence. The Council has already started to work on the implementation of the pillar. The legislative elements of the package, namely the proposals on work—life balance and on transparent and predictable working conditions, are currently being discussed in the preparatory bodies of the Council. As of this year, progress in Member States is monitored in the context of the European Semester through use of the Social Scoreboard, in line with one of the recommendations expressed by Parliament in its resolution on combating inequalities. Furthermore, Employment and Social Affairs Ministers will hold a policy debate on closing the gender pay gap, at the March Council where the future of Social Europe post—2020 will also be discussed. I would also like to focus your attention on the fact that some of the roots of socio-economic inequalities lie in natural demographic or regional disadvantages, in relation to which investment in cohesion has a very positive impact. I will listen to your debate, which is also an opportunity to reflect on the consequences of the challenges in front of us. Thank you once again for inviting me and for your attention.

Over the years, we have gained important insights. We know that rising inequalities act as a brake on growth. Even competitiveness is reinforced by a more equal society. We also know that rising inequalities come with social by-effects – increased crime rates, decreased health, and lower participation in our democracies. And we see every day how the discontent of citizens that feel left behind, or fear being left behind, is fuelling a populist movement. These are the consequences of rising inequalities. And also for these reasons, reducing inequalities is a priority of the Commission. The drivers behind the rise in inequalities are numerous. Therefore, our policy response must be multi-dimensional. At European level our message is clear: we have to redouble efforts along the virtuous triangle of investment, structural reforms and responsible fiscal policies, with a focus firmly on social fairness and more inclusive growth. Inequalities can only be fought through a combination of good jobs, fair tax systems, and adequate social policies. Firstly, it must aim to reduce inequalities in market income, especially by focusing on work. Raising skill levels and preparing our people for the jobs of tomorrow is the first way to address inequality in earnings. Last year we adopted the New Skills Agenda. With the right skills, people are better equipped for good-quality jobs with reliable and adequate incomes. Moreover, we must create jobs. Wherever possible, the Commission takes steps to boost job creation. For example, via the Capital Markets Union and the Digital Single Market, not to forget the European Investment Plan and Fund. We also strongly push for reforms that support growth in Member States through the European Semester. Secondly, we need to look at the tax and benefit systems. Having a job is not enough to be included, we also have to look at the tax and benefit systems. The re-launch of the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base and the initiatives on tax transparency should contribute to ensuring a fair distribution of the products of growth, income and wealth in our Member States. I also want to add the decisions on state aid – I refer to certain tax rulings in certain Member States. Lastly, we must respond to the rise in inequalities by boosting our social policies. That is why we proclaimed the European Pillar of Social Rights. The Pillar’s principles range from wages to social protection systems, from minimum income to gender equality, from childcare to old-age income, and from health care to access to housing. The European Semester will play a key role in implementing the Pillar on a national level. Already in the past, as you know, country-specific recommendations have addressed inequality-related issues. Think of the need to improve the adequacy and coverage of safety nets; or think of recommendations on childcare, on education, and on the provision of supporting services. In the current semester cycle, we build on this approach. To give you a glimpse: the Country Reports will pay special attention to investing in skills and building adequate safety nets and supporting sustainable and inclusive growth. Moreover, they will include the Social Scoreboard that accompanies the European Pillar of Social Rights. The Scoreboard contains an indicator on income inequality, but also on skills, childcare, and the impact of social transfers. This is our method of keeping track of Member States’ performance on the implementation of the principles of the Pillar, making clear that effective social policies are a priority for Europe. But we also have something to do, and for its part the Commission is also implementing the European Pillar of Social Rights. To increase the rights for the most vulnerable workers, we recently presented a proposal for a Directive on Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions. To tackle women’s under-representation in employment, and to create a more balanced distribution of caring responsibilities between women and men, we put forward the Work-Life Balance for Parents and Carers initiative. And we are now working on a Social Fairness Package. The package includes an initiative on improving access to social protection for people employed on non-standard contracts and in various forms of self-employment. This, I believe, is an extremely important step in fighting inequalities. The Package also includes a proposal for a European Labour Authority and a proposal for a European Social Security Number. More details will follow on 7 March. And of course we will continue to use the European Structural and Investment Funds to support the objectives of the Pillar. Tackling inequality is an imperative for the European Union, for economic, social and political reasons. Reducing inequalities is the only way to sustain growth and ensure continued competitiveness. It is the only way to ensure that our welfare systems remain sustainable. At the social level, we cannot leave anyone behind, everyone should participate in labour markets and in our societies. At the political level, rising inequalities drive disillusionment in politics and society. People no longer feel in control. The result is the rise of nationalism, protectionism and populism. We need to put the fight against inequalities at the top of our agenda, you are totally right. With the Pillar we have done that, but now of course it is time and we have to prove that we are able to implement it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 159, "date": "2018-02-07.json", "name": "David Casa", "mepid": "28122", "text": "f'isem il-grupp PPE. — Ilkoll naqblu illi l-economics tal-unjoni Ewropea qiegħda turkupra u tikber b'rata pożittiva, iżda minkejja dan, fuq in-naħa l-oħra tal-ispettru, teżisti realtà oħra; dik tal-inugwaljanza sojoekonomika tać-ittadini Ewropej.

The most shocking thing concerns young people because we have around one third of young people in Europe living in poverty. This is just unacceptable and this is something which is spreading social tension, hindering growth and undermining democracy and trust in the European Union. This is the outcome of the accumulated effects of a wrong economic policy, bringing austerity and social unfairness. We must reverse this. It is possible – just look at the Portuguese case – and now we have a powerful solution, which is to implement the European social pillar. With this pillar we want first of all to address the situation of children in Europe, to end child poverty and to address the situation of young people, paving the way for better jobs and access to skills, making sure that everybody can have a proper, decent labour contract and access to social protection. But how can we deliver all this? We need to have serious work to update social and labour law. We need to promote an economic policy focusing on investment and jobs for the future. We need to have a fiscal policy providing good public services. We need to have a tax policy addressing added value where it is, but most of all we need to make sure that the upcoming European budget will be used to promote this social pillar.

One of the most inspiring parts of my job in London, is meeting or helping the many local community projects tackling poverty in their local neighbourhoods. They are often inspired by local people who want to make a difference, so it is disappointing that when politicians or commentators talk about poverty, they tend to focus on what the state can or cannot do, or whether large NGOs are effective or not, too often neglecting the inspirational local community projects in the hearts of our communities. Though, in some ways, both the Left and the Right have failed the poor. While the Left believe in top-down government, taxing people more to distribute more money to the poor via more public servants, more trade unions, etc., we all know of areas where lots of money has been spent over the years and we still see deprivation in those areas. But many on the Right argue that poverty is best tackled by cutting taxes, creating more jobs with additional wealth trickling down to the poor, but they forget that the welfare state was created since private provision did not reach everyone. So while state welfare and large NGOs do have a role to play, last month the ECR Group held a global poverty summit which brought together local community projects from across the world to tell their inspiring stories of how they tackled poverty at a grass-roots level. So, whether the Left call it cooperative socialism, or the Right call it community conservatism or localist libertarianism, I hope that we can all pay more attention and champion the role of grass-roots anti-poverty projects in all our local communities, rather than top-down state or top-down wealth, and I see the Left laughing and insulting these very many community projects. Allow me on a personal note to end on that equality. I realise I am the first non-white leader of any political group in this Parliament, but I’m still shocked by the lack of racial diversity not only in this House, but across all EU institutions, and if the EU is going to have any credibility on the issues of diversity and equality, it needs to get its own house in order. Let us, across the political spectrum, reach out to young people in all our countries and tell them that whatever your colour, your gender, your religion, your orientation or your background, you should not be afraid to put yourself forward for public office. The EU is often accused of being a rich white man’s club.

Je poursuis in the language of Cervantes. It is already a source of satisfaction, on such a sad day for Europe, that we are finally considering ourselves — and that is why I fought from the beginning in this Parliament — the problem of inequalities and their very serious consequences, which are obvious, and therefore we will give the title of this debate an answer immediately: the consequences on citizens is that the economy is growing less, there is more unemployment because of the lack of cohesion of societies, and policies are evident, as everyone has said: the birth of detachment from political systems, detachment to democracy, detachment from European institutions, using them as turkheads. So what I want to say to the Commissioner is that there are three essential ways to combat this. The first way is to go to structures and change the inequality dynamics in the medium term, and that is why economic policies are essential, but much more than just, of course, taxes, investment is important: investments that favour human capital can be made, which favor infrastructures for the improvement of the society, or not. Trade is too. Also energy policy, to combat energy poverty. Large macroeconomic policies, which we have now managed to get to address the Gini index, are important. The second pillar is what Mrs Thyssen carries: it is social policies, but above all, not those that palate inequalities, poverty, etc. — those are already there, these are indispensable patches — but those which structure a flexible but more egalitarian labour market. Thirdly and lastly — we often forget this — we must combat inequalities with more and better Europe because, without an omnicomprehensible solidarity vision of Europe, financially, we will not fight inequalities well in Europe and in the model we have chosen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 163, "date": "2018-02-07.json", "name": "Rina Ronja Kari", "mepid": "122885", "text": " on behalf of the Gue/NGL Group. — Madam President, First of all, I would like to thank the Socialists for putting this very important issue on the agenda.

There is a lot of unemployment. In addition, too many citizens today are worried about themselves and about the future of their children. But would it not be great if we from the European Parliament could send a positive signal that it is moving forward? Or at least about the fact that we actually take the concerns of citizens seriously? That they're being heard? Dear colleagues! If we're going to look citizens in the eye, we have to be honest. The problems have become stronger and have become more significant because of the EU single market and because of the economic cutting policy, which has been enforced by the fiscal pact.

Imagine, last year, the richest, who represent 1% of the population, siphoned 82% of the wealth created. And this is not a product of chance or I do not know what law of nature, it is the product of political choices. In order to clean up public finances and achieve greater economic efficiency — “efficiency” is fashionable — we need to flexibilize labour markets, put public services and social protection under pressure, soften any legislation that would weaken or impede our businesses, even when it comes to protecting labour markets. health or the environment. We have to go to the pension later, when young people struggle to find a job. Unemployment benefits have to be reduced, whereas in some parts of the European Union you have dozens and dozens of candidates for a job offer. Rest assured, good people, growth is back and employment with it. But the problem is that this job is getting precarious. He is getting less and less well paid, while capital holders capture an ever-increasing portion of the cake. We would like to believe that making the rich richer and multinationals more powerful would benefit everyone. Well, ladies and gentlemen, the economy of runoff exists, and it defies the laws of gravity, because money goes from the poor to the rich. All of this has very concrete consequences of course because, in our rich European Union, a quarter of our fellow citizens, including millions who are working, are at risk of poverty and social exclusion, to the point where some people have to choose between eating or treating themselves, to the point of dying on the streets of our cities. Mrs Thyssen, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that the European pillar of social rights has been born.

I think this debate on rising inequality and the consequences of it is core to what we should do, as politicians, to fight these consequences, to ensure that we have policies that will change this behaviour and ensure that, instead of inequality, we have quality spread out through our societies. It has been said many times that eight men now own the same as half of the world’s population. It is a disgrace and, also, if you look at the years 2008 to 2016, we spent EUR 653 billion to save the banks in Europe, but how much effort do we spend to save young people and the people who are suffering the inequalities that are on the rise. It is economic inequality and inequality in health. It is in education and all aspects of society. I have to say to my good colleague, Mr Kamall, that fighting inequality is more than charity. Actually where we have well—functioning welfare states in Europe, that is the biggest equality machine we can create on this planet. It is proven. Come to the Nordic countries and you see that it works – and listen. What the EU can do is important. The Commissioner alluded to it. We need a strong social pillar. We need to ensure that we support our Member States so they can fight inequality and create opportunity for all of us. We need a strong social contract because our social contract is jeopardised in our societies today, with severe consequences for democracy and for extremism. So we need to rebuild our social contract and I think we also need a social contract that will ensure that the big multinational corporations and the rich individuals pay their fair tax. It is too easy for them to avoid paying their fair tax and it is undermining our welfare state and undermining the fight against inequality.

In such conditions the fight against poverty is also an important security issue. In regions like Ida-Virumaa the fight against poverty must be comprehensive.

There is evidence of temporary, part—time working on a contract basis, flexible labour market and, of course, with automation, robots and globalisation, employment as we know it is changing. So we need to ensure that we have strong and effective protection measures in place for workers. Minimum income is important and tackling zero—hours contracts is very, very important to give some certainty to workers.  But it is not all about inequality in terms of income. It is also about inequality in terms of opportunity, and inequality in terms of outcomes as well. We continually need to focus on skills and education and ensure that our young people, in particular, have the necessary training, the necessary education opportunities, if we are to provide them with the skills that employers are articulating today that they do not have and cannot find on the labour market.

Yet can we stay silent on the consequences of rising social and economic inequalities in Europe? Let us start on a positive note. The European economy is growing, unemployment rates are falling and most economic theorists are telling us the fairytale that people will benefit from growth. But unfortunately not everybody is getting a fair share of the pie. On the one hand, we see companies still focusing on the well—being of their shareholders while the pay gap between the top chiefs and the average worker remains startling, and most multinationals are also still dodging taxes. On the other hand, we see the working-class families in Europe falling behind. Being in work reduces the risk of poverty. That is, at least, the normal theory. How is it possible then in Europe that the number of working poor is still growing and growing? I will repeat what our unexpected allies are saying, namely that a pay rise would be good for business, for jobs, for workers and therefore for the European economy: a pay rise which, in my view, cannot be achieved without strong trade unions and strong collective bargaining.

More and more working families are struggling to make ends meet. Besides its impact on the individual and on social cohesion in general, income inequality raises other concerns as well: it undermines the good functioning of the economy, slows productivity and growth, and hampers innovation. The whole society suffers if we do not have a healthy, well-skilled and well-educated workforce. In my country, the richest 20% of the population have an income over eight times higher than that of the poorest 20%. This is the result not just of unequal access to education, services and the labour market, but also of the toleration of undeclared work and an ineffective tax and social transfer system, as the Commission has underlined in its Country Specific Recommendations. This is why it is so urgent that we search for effective means to reduce inequality.

Conversely, a society with little inequality and much equality is a society where everyone is happy. Everyone is very important. It's not just about the poor. Everyone in society is better off when there is less inequality. What is perhaps important to emphasise is that great and growing inequality is also a danger to our democracy. That actually makes sense. People who all build a society together and all contribute to it in their own way but are rewarded for it quite unfairly feel that it is very unfair. Democracy — we all know — is much more than this Parliament or the rule of law. That is a means of achieving an end. In other words, to ensure that everyone can live together freely and happily, and that can be done in a society with less inequality. That is essential. The Commission has recently — with our full support — been extremely active in the area of the rule of law. Think about what we do in Poland. Think of what we do in Hungary. That's important. That part of democracy is being defended. The question is: will we please defend that other part of democracy with the same amount of fire?

As for the reasons, the aim of maximising short-term profits has led to a corporate model based on price competition and avoidance of obligations, be they social or environmental. In addition, it has led to downward pressures on workers’ and producers’ pay and on labour and environmental standards, and to companies paying as little tax as possible; with ever greater political power in favour of policies preserving and safeguarding the present system. The European Union’s main tool for reducing inequalities between and within Member States is cohesion policy, which we must endow with political power, human resources and financial needs, ensuring it becomes the lead priority in the post-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). This means that European funding for cohesion policy must increase. The new cohesion policy framework needs to support, in particular but not only, the poorest European regions. Priority emphasis must be put on social investment. National co-financing should not be taken into account in deficit calculations as part of the Stability and Growth Pact, and grants ought to remain the standard form of financing.

We too have said in our Annual Growth Survey, in the euro area Council recommendation and in some country—specific recommendations that promoting wage growth under certain conditions would be a good thing. As the economic recovery continues in Europe, it is essential to make sure no one is left behind. Combating inequalities is – and will remain – a priority for the Commission, and we address it through a mix of policy levers: good jobs, fair taxation and adequate social protection. The Commission cannot – and will not – do this alone. This requires a collective effort, first of all at European level, but also at national level and at local level. Indeed, let us cherish and support grassroots social projects as we do with the European Social Fund. We have also to work together with social partners and other stakeholders. Let us not forget that reducing inequality does not happen just like that. But I am confident that we can move further in the right direction.

Worse, these undermined our long-term prospects by striking first and foremost young workers, whose risk of social exclusion increased between 2008 and 2016, as the International Monetary Fund pointed out on 24 January 2018.

There are many causes that lead to too many situations of socio-economic disparities between European citizens and it is therefore necessary to take appropriate measures to remove them.

In the public debate, of course, there are differing opinions on how to fight against overstretched economical-social stratification. From my point of view, 2 phenomena are especially dangerous, and they should be given special attention. The first consequence of inequality is “the transfer of poverty and exclusion from generation to generation. There is a group of young people who don't believe in a better tomorrow for themselves and their children. A closed wheel is formed, which is difficult to interrupt. Another extremely important consequence is the increase in support for populist movements and the growing fear of “alien”. How do you fight these phenomena?

However, social inequality, poverty, is not simply a material issue, but it is synonymous with freedom, lack of opportunities, exclusion, loss of human dignity, fear of the future. It is synonymous with the extreme and fatal splitting of society. We also know that inequalities in today's world cannot simply be remedied by wage increases or social benefits. The main cause of inequality is access to knowledge and the difference in the possibilities of acquiring knowledge. Those who cannot acquire the competences and skills required by today's knowledge-based society, the changed world of work, will necessarily be on the periphery of society. And if social inequalities are growing more and more, it is also a serious threat to democracy. It is for this reason that one cannot continue to think in the usual categories.

Democratic participation is the raison d’être for any parliament. This European Parliament was for the first time elected based on direct universal suffrage in 1979. The legal basis was provided by the Electoral Act of 1976. It was a European Parliament of 410 directly-elected representatives. It was a European Parliament for a European Union of 9 Member States. Today we live in a completely different world. The European Union comprises 28 Member States. The Parliament is composed of 751 Members, its role as co-legislator has skyrocketed, and still the rules governing the conduct of European elections are those established 42 years ago. It is our fundamental duty as the European Parliament to enable participatory democracy to facilitate the building of a bottom-up Europe and connect citizens with Europe. Connecting Europe with citizens starts with the European elections, and we need to update the Electoral Act of 1976. This is what we did in November 2015, by adopting and transmitting to the Council a proposal for amendment of the ʼ76 Electoral Act. According to the Treaty – Article 223 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union – it is not only the duty but also the right of the European Parliament to draw up a proposal to lay down the provisions on its electoral law. Our utmost goal is to enhance the democratic dimension of the European elections, to reinforce Union citizenship, to improve the functioning of the Parliament and the governance of the European Union, to make the work of the Parliament more legitimate and efficient, to enhance effectiveness of the election’s conduct, and to provide for more electoral equality of Union citizens. More than two years have passed, six Council Presidencies have worked, the next European elections of 2019 are around the corner.

The Bulgarian Presidency is now the sixth Presidency to deal with the European Parliament's request of November 2015 — six unsuccessful presidencies. We have had informal contacts, but there is no official position of the Council, and we are approacing huge strides towards the next European elections in May 2019. So, if you can't make it in the Bulgarian Presidency, then this is a lost dossier. As Mrs Hübner has already said, the European elections need improvements. They are firmly in the electoral act of 1976, with some renewals in 2002, but they no longer correspond to the importance of these elections in the EU today. We have made 16 proposals, and I have the impression that every single proposal in the Council is being petty and pushed aside with any arguments. For example, we have proposed that we prepare the European elections more seriously — more democratic and transparent. It cannot be that in some countries candidates only know that they are candidates two weeks before the election. It really takes more time to campaign. We have also proposed that citizens identify which of their national parties belong to European parties in order to have a clearer view of what they are choosing and in which direction Europe is moving. We wanted gender equality on the electoral lists. We have put forward bold proposals to reduce the voting age to 16 years and to examine whether it is also possible to vote electronically in the European elections, whether the millions of citizens who do not live in their country also have the right to vote in the European elections, which is currently ruled out in many Member States; on the other hand, that Citizens do not choose twice. So, a lot of innovations and improvements, and that Dossier is just stuck in the Council.

I welcome this opportunity to update Parliament on the state of play on this important issue.  Let me recall that on 19 November 2015, the two rapporteurs, Ms Hübner and Mr Leinen, presented Parliament’s proposal to the Council at an informal Committee of Permanent Representatives (Coreper) meeting. Since then, discussions took place in the relevant working party and five successive Presidencies conducted intensive technical work on this file.  In November 2016 and December 2017, Coreper was involved and held an in—depth discussion on these very sensitive issues. After these two meetings the Presidencies met with the two co—rapporteurs in order to give them a comprehensive overview and a clear state of play of the discussions. The first meeting took place in January 2017 and the last one in December 2017.  Minister Maasikas for the Estonian Presidency came before the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) where he presented orally to the rapporteurs the general state of play on the discussions, as of November 2017, after a detailed mapping exercise. So contacts have been ongoing. Today I am really happy to have the opportunity to give you some feedback.  Let me first stress that the Member States are very much supportive of the general aim of the proposal to enhance public interest and voter turnout in the European Parliament elections. They also share the view that there is a need for increased transparency and awareness—raising regarding the European character of the European Parliament elections.  But the Member States also stressed the importance of respecting their constitutional and electoral traditions, as well as the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. The proposal has indeed raised some concerns in this regard. Member States have also been pointing to the autonomy of the political parties and the divergences in national systems in this respect. In their view, harmonisation should only be pursued in case of strict necessity and after a rigorous examination of the added value it will bring.  On a more positive note, let me underline that after several months of discussions in the Working Party we were able to identify, in a preliminary way, a package of provisions on which an agreement in the Council would seem currently the most likely. We need to pursue our work on this to explore the possibility of a compromise that might be acceptable for all. I can assure you that our Presidency has put this file high on the agenda. Let me also recall that this file will require unanimity in the Council.  Finally, you should also know that we share the concerns about the deadlines for the approval of the amendments to the electoral law, in accordance with the Member States’ constitutional requirements, and about adopting the necessary domestic measures in time for the 2019 elections.  To sum up: despite these difficulties, we are determined to continue the hard work on this important file in the Council. We are also happy to continue working closely with the European Parliament in a very constructive spirit to try to overcome the difficulties and seek solutions that are acceptable to all.

We, the Greens/EFA, consider that the Parliament’s electoral law resolution has been very shy, without showing a true ambition to update the electoral system according to the new social and political demands for greater participation, accountability and equality. It has been a disappointing text: indeed, not the new electoral law our group desired and expected. We understand the urgency of producing a new law on the important subject of the European elections. However, it is not enough to produce a text. It is essential to produce the best possible text: one that is in line with the needs of the time and brings institutions a bit closer to citizens, to restore confidence and to reinforce the European project.

It reached 18% in the Czech Republic, and so if we make any changes, we should try to increase the interest of citizens in European elections, increase the legitimacy of elections in the eyes of individual citizens of these states.

I would like to elaborate on several important topics and points. First of all, let me assure you that we all share the sense of urgency in view of the forthcoming EP elections in 2019. Any changes to the electoral law would need to be ratified by the national parliaments. The Presidency has consulted with Member States regarding the deadlines for having the changes approved in accordance with their constitutional requirements and for adopting the necessary domestic measures in time for the 2019 European Parliament elections. Secondly, at the same time we need to be aware that the issue at hand goes to the heart of the constitutional electoral traditions and the organisation of the political life in Member States, including the respective electoral laws and freedom of association. Thirdly, as foreseen in the Leaders Agenda, the European Council will have an informal meeting on institutional issues on 23 February. The agenda foresees the EP composition, transnational lists and appointments, including Spitzenkandidaten. This is part of the new method proposed by President Tusk in October 2017, allowing a frank, open and constructive discussion. For this reason, it is very important not to prejudge the forthcoming Leaders discussions. Fourthly, as regards our concrete steps and timetable, the Presidency has considered all available options. The Council has dedicated in-depth attention to the Parliament’s proposal and several successive Presidencies have been engaged, as you have already mentioned. These are not issues on which it is easy to find a compromise, and I recall that the Treaty requires unanimity. While Member States share the objective of increasing the interest of the voters and the European character of the elections, these realities also need to be taken into account. Therefore, we need to consider that we have two options: either focus our efforts on the topic with respect to which agreement seems most likely, or face the risk of not having any result for the forthcoming EP elections. Taking into consideration the willingness to achieve progress, the Presidency intends to continue with discussions focusing on the least controversial provisions. We will reflect on any further next steps as soon as we have a full view of the situation. The Presidency will continue to seek consensus wherever possible. To conclude, let me reaffirm the Council’s commitment to engage with the European Parliament. I totally agree that this is a question of cooperation.

Each Member State must therefore respect, protect and promote them. Let me assure you that the rule of law and the separation of powers have always been at the heart of the Council’s attention. We believe that dialogue and cooperation are necessary to ensure the best standards and conditions for our citizens in all our Member States. The Council addressed the situation in Romania in its conclusions on the cooperation and verification mechanism adopted on 12 December 2017. The Council welcomed the fact that Romania has taken a number of positive steps and encouraged the country to renew momentum on the reforms, in particular those related to the independence of the judiciary and to the fight against corruption at all levels. The Council reiterated the importance for Romania to focus on further consolidating progress and to fully address the concerns and all the recommendations set out by the Commission in its report on progress achieved under the cooperation and verification mechanism. We hope that the ongoing communication between the Romanian authorities and the Commission will continue to prove efficient in assisting Romania to remedy some shortcomings.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 252, "date": "2018-02-07.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the discussion in Romania over the last year about its justice laws has led to concerns being expressed by a wide range of stakeholders, both inside and outside the country, across the EU and beyond. Romanian citizens have taken to the streets to state their opposition to the proposed changes to Romanian law. They are concerned that this may undermine the long—standing efforts in the fight against corruption and the independence of the judiciary. The Commission has made no secret of the fact that it shares these concerns. So too does the Council of Europe’s anti—corruption watchdog, the Group of States against Corruption, which for the first time has decided to launch its own inquiry – with a report due in March.  The independence of the Romanian judiciary and its capacity to fight corruption are directly relevant to the progress made under the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism, which, as you know, was set up in 2007 to assist Romania and Bulgaria in the fields of judicial reform and corruption and (for Bulgaria) the fight against organised crime. After ten years of continued efforts, Romania has one of the best judiciaries in the region.  Back in January 2017, the Commission proposed a limited set of remaining recommendations which, if implemented fully and provided that there is no backtracking, would bring Romania out of the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism. One of the recommendations called on the Romanian leadership to ensure a consensual legislative process, to finalise reforms of the justice laws and the criminal codes, and also to respect judicial independence and court decisions.  On 15 November 2017, in our latest Cooperation and Verification Mechanism report, the Commission voiced concerns on the process and the content of the draft justice laws. As the debate on justice laws was evolving in the course of 2017, the Superior Council of the Magistracy – the constitutional guarantor of the independence of the judiciary – continued to voice concerns and issued a negative opinion citing detrimental impacts on judicial independence and on the effective functioning of the judicial system. These concerns need to be taken seriously in the legislative process. Therefore the question we put to the Romanian authorities in the November report remains valid, namely whether the process would take into account the legitimate interests of the judiciary and respect judicial independence. Unfortunately, we have continued to see open criticism of the judiciary and defiance of judicial decisions or integrity rules, which do not inspire a feeling of confidence in the process. Events since have done nothing to address these concerns.  On 21 December 2017, the parliament adopted amendments to the justice laws in a fast—track procedure and the laws were immediately challenged in the Constitutional Court through three referrals. The Constitutional Court proceedings are ongoing but, in its first hearings, it declared the unconstitutionality of some of the provisions. These are issues to be looked at carefully in relation to judicial independence and on which there are European standards.  The Council of Europe’s principle is that you cannot reform the judicial system against the judiciary. This common sense advice underpins the Commission’s recommendation to the Romanian authorities that they consult the Venice Commission before the justice laws are promulgated. The Commission considers that it is still possible for the justice laws to be improved and become good laws which will strengthen the independence and professionalisation of the Romanian judicial system to serve all Romanian citizens. This is a crucial moment, given that the first two draft laws are back in the Romanian Parliament following the rulings of the Constitutional Court. The debate on how to address the concerns expressed by the Constitutional Court should be used as an opportunity to have a good, frank dialogue and build a better shared understanding and trust among all parties concerned.  Therefore, I reiterate the call made by President Juncker and First Vice—President Timmermans to the Romanian Parliament to rethink the course of actions proposed, to open up debate in line with the Commission’s recommendations, to build consensus on the way forward, to safeguard the independence of the judicial system and further step up the fight against corruption. The President of Romania also has a key role in the process and, from his meeting with the College last week, I know he takes that very seriously. The Commission stands ready to continue its ongoing dialogue with the Romanian authorities and will contribute as best it can to help ensure that this process is taken forward constructively and in a way that builds trust.  We will look thoroughly at the final amendments to the justice law, the criminal codes and laws on conflicts of interest and corruption. As always, when dealing with these and similar matters, the Commission will remain objective, facts—based and law—based, politically colour—blind and clinical in our approach. Romania and Romanians have been running a marathon. The finish line is in sight. To step backwards now would be a major disappointment to Romania’s many friends, but most of all to Romanian citizens. The speed with which Romania will reach the finish line is up to Romania, but the Commission stands by to help Romania get there.

We have seen attempts by the Government there to suppress the judiciary, to water down anticorruption legislation and to use its electoral majority as an excuse to do as it pleases. I know some people claim and will claim that the European Parliament and the Commission should not get involved, or try to spin the idea that this is somehow politically motivated. It is a justification that we are seeing used by unscrupulous politicians across the European Union who try to excuse the inexcusable. But they are wrong. The EU cannot look away and, for sure, the European People’s Party will not do so, because Romanians are not any less European than the rest of us. They deserve – as we all do – a country where the rule of law is respected, where corruption is fought, where the courts are protected and where laws are not changed on a whim to suit only those in power. Romanians have been on the street for more than a year: as temperatures plummeted and the snow fell, they stood up. They flew European Union flags because they believed in Europe – a Europe that is not only an economic bloc but also a guarantee of common values and shared promises. They believe still. This is not only about Romania. This is about all of us. Every Member State must understand that what happens in Bucharest affects people in Paris, just as what happens in Valetta affects people in Stockholm. We are distinct as nations but we are intertwined all the same, and if the rule of law is at stake in any one state, then every single other state is endangered, and that is why the Commission is right to act, as it must do everywhere there is a threat. I met with some of the people who are out on the streets in Romania: they are teachers and poets and students and pensioners. They are not politicians. They just want a country and a Union where justice is blind, where everyone is treated equally before the law, where corruption is eradicated and where winning an election does not mean you are entitled to divide up the country like your personal spoils of war.

I can also remember the first time that we welcomed colleagues from Bulgaria and Romania in this Chamber, and I was very, very moved. I don’t cry very often, I can tell you, but there were tears running down my cheeks. For me, this was reuniting the family. But in a family we also talk about things that aren’t going well. Next year, Romania will be holding the Presidency of the European Union, and we’ll all be looking at the image that Romania presents. I know that Romania has a long and proud tradition of liberal democracy and civic engagement, and I hope that that is the past that Romania will choose because, unlike the previous speaker, I do think that values are a matter for the European Union. This is what we have laid down in the Treaties. Romania has made a great deal of effort, achieved a lot and made very good progress in recent years, but now it seems to be waivering. I would really encourage the Romanian Government to follow the recommendations of the European Commission and to invite the Venice Commission to judge the reform package – not just refer loosely to some recommendations but invite the Venice Commission. I also think it would be a good idea for a delegation from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) to travel to Romania and talk to people and actually find out and understand what’s going on. On the reform of the judiciary, concerns have been expressed all around, and I really hope that the Romanian Government is going to take heed. Finally, I would like to refer briefly to the new legislation on civil society. I find it very worrying. This is happening not just in Romania or Hungary and Poland, but also in some other EU countries, and tonight we will be talking about the shrinking space for civil society. Civil society may be a pain in the neck, but it is essential for a robust and healthy democracy. A democracy organises its own critics. That’s what democracy is all about. So please reconsider.

But the important thing is to recognise that and to work against it, tirelessly and relentlessly, because corruption actually undermines the very fabric of society. It makes people lose trust in state and a democracy; it also leads to big losses of public money – money that is urgently needed elsewhere. And in Romania, tens of thousands of people are on the streets, against a corrupt political elite – an elite which sees itself as running a state as a sort of self-service system and which misuses its power to protect itself from justice. And after significant progress that had been made by Romania leading up to EU accession and in the years afterwards, now what we actually see is steps backwards. The progress is being reversed, and this is bad for the Romanian Government, for the Romanian citizens, but also for the whole of the European Union – and Romanian citizens are EU citizens. With the new laws, prosecutors are deprived of indispensable instruments for investigation, courts are put under more political control, and corruption is even partly decriminalised. The new laws clearly have one objective: to weaken the legal system and to make it harder to prosecute high-level corruption. We expect the Romanian Government and the Romanian Parliament to follow the court ruling and to make the laws compatible with EU standards and EU rules. Corruption has a direct effect on citizens in Romania. We see this in the bad condition in many schools. We see this in hospitals, where you risk actually getting more infections. We see coal power plants that run without a permit for years and with the full knowledge of the authorities. And as Greens, we also came to Romania to speak with the authorities; we came to speak with the citizens on the street; we wrote to the European Commission; and we also asked for this debate to happen. I want to stress what I said before: Romanian citizens are European citizens. They have the same rights as every other European citizen. That’s why we as Greens cannot accept that Romanians are still being deprived of one of the most basic and fundamental freedoms of Europeans: that is, to be a member of the Schengen zone and to travel freely within the Union.

That is why I read the first two articles of the Romanian Constitution. Article 1: 'Romania is a national, sovereign and independent, unitary and indivisible state. (...) Romania is a rule of law, democratic and social, in which human dignity, rights and freedoms of citizens, free development of human personality, justice and political pluralism represent supreme values, in the spirit of the democratic traditions of the Romanian people and ideals Revolution of December 1989 and are guaranteed.” Article 2: “National sovereignty belongs to the Romanian people, who exercise it through their representative bodies, constituted by free, regular and fair elections, as well as by referendum. No group or person may exercise sovereignty on their own behalf.” Today we are witnessing the worrying politicisation of a political group of a debate that should have the reverse aim of eliminating the political factor and encouraging fact-based considerations. Today's debate has an example value. The rule of law is not a divine and inalterable creation, but a human construct that must be maintained and renovated permanently, not only in Romania, but throughout the European Union. But there is also a “but”. Discussions at the European Union cannot and must not be substituted for solutions. It was also said by President Juncker and President Iohannis: we, Romanians, must find solutions in Romania. Romania wants to comply with constitutional and European standards, but through a viable institutional dialogue. But the European Union must understand that Romania is not a second-rate country, with citizens of the Republic of Moldova two. There are still unresolved issues, but, nevertheless, Romania has shown political and civic responsibility, addressing these issues in an open and comprehensive way. We've run away from the Soviet Union too long to accept having anyone on top of us.

Let's recap: PSD won the election after promising money, prosperity, plus the sea with salt. But the first decision of the government was to amend the laws on crimes from the PSD leaders' files. Abuse of service has been erased, and the threshold from which embezzlement begins has been increased. Changes made by the PSD to the justice laws make investigative prosecutors at the hands of the chiefs and subject investigations to a new control body. The PSD changed two governments in one year because they were unable to exempt PSD leaders from the law. PSD lawmakers rejected prosecutors' requests for inquiry when they were concerned with PSD leaders. Now, criminal investigations are members of the Government. Asked why the PSD appoints people with file in the government, a leader of the party replied: “Because we can!”.

I mean, you get a complaint, you call X, and you say, “I got a corruption complaint.” Can you still do it blatantly? Can you still investigate? No, it's over.

About ten years ago, the laws of justice were amended, without any public debate, by taking responsibility, and gave the President the prerogative of discretionary rejecting the appointment of magistrates to leadership positions, that is exactly what Poland is reproached today. Romania has now become the state with the most convictions at the ECHR for abuses against its citizens and no one is responsible. So, the rule of law has problems in Romania. In these years, more and more listening warrants have been issued in Romania. I'm just giving an example: in 2015, 16 times more listening and tracking warrants were required than the FBI. Thousands of citizens were heard during the elections, the last parliamentary elections, on the grounds of national security — to translate more simply: terrorism. These were businessmen, officials, politicians, some even candidates. It's as if, exactly at elections, about a thousand terrorists appeared in Romania and disappeared afterwards just as suddenly, in a country where there is no terrorist and no act of terrorism, and after the elections, as I tell you, they disappeared. So, the rule of law has problems in Romania. According to our Constitution, it is Parliament that can fix these problems, in my opinion as a citizen, and it must not seek approval from anyone and can only be censored by the Constitutional Court, which works. I don't think there's anything else to talk about.

This debate is not about the Commission or the Parliament; it is about justice for Romanians who have legitimate expectations that there would be independent and efficient justice for them in Romania.  However, some of you mentioned or questioned the role of the Commission. Let me reiterate that the role of the Commission is to fulfil the obligation of the guardian of the Treaty. It is our duty to assess the situation of the rule of law in each Member State and to raise concerns when we see systemic problems.  The justice system is a sophisticated and complex structure, calibrated on the basis of legal traditions and fulfilling the principle of the balance of powers in the state. Such a system is built over decades and can be destroyed in a week or overnight. That is why we are so vigilant and that is why we have raised the concerns at this moment.  We are assessing objectively the Romanian system on the basis of evidence and facts. We are offering dialogue and support. This is what we do. What we do not do, because we must not do that, is interfere in individual cases – just to respond to the question of Ms Nicolai. The independence of Romania’s judicial system and its capacity to fight corruption effectively are essential cornerstones of a strong Romania in the European Union. After ten years of hard work, Romania has a professional judiciary and the population of Romania has been clear in its support for the fight against corruption. I am confident that all the Romanian authorities fully realise this and will do what is necessary to bring the draft laws into line with the constitution and send a strong signal that will help rebuild trust.

This mechanism belongs to the European Commission, whose President, Jean-Claude Juncker, expressed his appreciation for the progress of the recent years of the Romanian judicial system, but also the fear of the irreversibility of the mistake that members of the Romanian Parliament are about to make.

And just as we criticize that inaction, I think it is also fair to acknowledge that the European External Investment Plan, which the European Commission presented in June 2016, responds to some of those needs we have been pointing out. In July 2017, this plenary session already gave the green light to one of the components of that Plan, which was the European Fund for Sustainable Development, and today we are discussing another of its components, which is the modification of the EIB's external lending mandate, whose activities are guaranteed by the Union budget. After eight months of hard negotiations with the Maltese Presidency first and with the Estonian Presidency thereafter, we have succeeded in closing an agreement which I believe will substantially improve the current external lending mandate. I would like to begin by recalling that all the countries of the Union, and the Commission also, signed the Sustainable Development Goals and that all our actions must therefore be aimed at their implementation. By amending this Regulation, we will quantitatively and qualitatively improve the European Union's action through the EIB abroad and, above all, in the South and East neighbourhood countries. We improved quantitatively because we increase investment capacity to EUR 32.3 billion by 2020, with a very special effort in the countries of the Mediterranean and in the Balkans. As for the qualitative improvement of our investments, we have worked on a number of aspects. The first, and probably the most important one, is that we have added a new priority and cross-cutting objective so that all initiatives funded through this programme contribute to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals and thus eradicate the causes why people should leave their homes. Within this new objective, we have not wanted to forget the countries in our environment which, in a clear demonstration of solidarity, host millions of refugees and whose public services and infrastructure are completely overflowed. In addition, in order to comply with the Paris Agreements and our commitment to assist developing countries, we have increased the share to be spent on climate change-related investments from 25 to 35 per cent. Another area in which we have also worked and improved the Decision has been support for local private sector development, improving SMEs access to finance, encouraging the transition from an informal economy to the formal sector and by seeking special support to investment projects in rural areas, especially for the drinking water treatment, sanitation and renewable energies. Finally, as a qualitative improvement, I would like to highlight the inclusion of a gender perspective in all operations financed by the EIB. We adopt paragraphs 8a and b, and with this approval we ensure that the commitments of the equality strategy and its action plan are fulfilled, and we will also promote respect for the principles of pay transparency and equal remuneration. And, in conclusion, I would like to highlight two very important aspects of this legislation. On the one hand, we have introduced a whole new chapter that has to do with the evaluation of the programme; we have established a set of parameters and their corresponding indicators in order to assess the results of investments from a social, environmental and economic point of view. On the other hand, we have introduced much more restrictive legislation in the prevention of money-laundering, combating the financing of terrorism, taxation and non-cooperating territories. In this regard, the EIB will have to submit to us every year a report on the implementation of this policy, including a country-by-country report and a list of intermediaries with which it collaborates. As I said at the beginning of my speech, I believe that this agreement substantially improves the EIB's investment mandate and I hope that tomorrow it will be broadly supported by this House and that the EIB will be able to implement it as soon as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 303, "date": "2018-02-07.json", "name": "Nirj Deva", "mepid": "4556", "text": "   rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development. – Mr President, a year ago the House backed my proposal to establish stronger ties with the private sector, marking a revolution in EU development financing, a new way of mobilising private capital, key to wealth creation and the fight against global poverty. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development on this proposal, I supported the overall increase in the EU guarantee from EUR 27 billion to EUR 32.2 billion in order to address the root causes of migration. As part of the external investment plan, together with the EIB, this Marshall Plan for Africa is of paramount importance in implementing the shift from global grants to loans, promoting investment rather than handouts.  International development is not just about eliminating poverty, it is also about delivering security, stability and economic opportunities to poor and fragile communities, thereby preventing citizens from having to flee their home country in search of a better life.

Following fruitful cooperation among the three EU institutions, I believe we have finally agreed an excellent compromise. The Commission welcomes the agreement on the compromise package, which was approved successfully by the Committee of the Permanent Representatives (Coreper) on 1 December and by the Committee on Budgets on 4 December by a large majority. This compromise will allow the European Investment Bank to continue rapidly implementing its economic resilience initiative in support of the southern neighbourhood and the Western Balkans and to continue supporting EU external policy objectives in eligible countries. As soon as adopted, the text will enable the EIB to contribute rapidly to the new objectives by providing up to EUR 2.3 billion of additional financing to private sector beneficiaries. The increase of EUR 5.3 billion in the size of the EU Guarantee Fund over the period 2014-2020 will also reinforce substantially the EIB’s capacity to grant loans in the neighbourhood, as well as in Asia and Latin America. It will allow the EIB to act effectively in line with EU external policy priorities. The compromise will increase the flexibility for the EIB to switch amounts under the regional ceiling allocations from the current 10% between regions to 20%, but only in the direction of high priority regions for the Union, in particular, Ukraine and migration-response-related regions or any forthcoming challenges within the remaining part of the mandate 2014-2020. The climate-change dimension of the mandate is also reinforced. It includes an increase of the target from 25% to 35% of total EIB financing operations outside the EU by the year 2020. On taxation and non-cooperative jurisdictions, the compromise text will align with provisions agreed for the EFSI 2.0 and the European Fund for Sustainable Development legislative files. The outcome is very welcome and reflects successful negotiations. As regards asset management, following negotiations in Council and Parliament, a cross-file compromise was agreed. The EIB will continue to undertake the asset management of the Guarantee Fund while the Commission will do the asset management of the new European Fund for Sustainable Development Guarantee Fund.

I will take the opportunity to thank the members of the Committee on Budgets, in particular the rapporteur, Madam Gardiazabal, and Commission Vice-President Katainen for their excellent cooperation on this difficult matter. The mid-term review of the ELM began in 2016 and I’m pleased to say it once again recognised the ELM as a highly efficient instrument that allows the EIB to deliver external and development action with real impact on the ground and at a minimal cost to the EU budget. The increase in both scope and size of the revised mandate is, I hope, a sign that you as co-legislators believe in our ability to deliver EU foreign-policy goals under this mandate. I thank you for this endorsement and for your support in ensuring the ELM was adapted in such a way as to allow the bank to deliver in supporting new and continuing priorities outside the EU up until 2020. Some key changes have been made to the ELM to allow us to address better the latest EU external priorities. We have been called upon to give particular support to countries outside the Union affected by migration, whether host countries, countries of transit or countries of origin. Significantly, the scope of the guarantee has been extended to allow coverage for private-sector lending operations under our new Economic Resilience Initiative, allowing the bank to take more risk in this area. This is fundamental to the success of the Resilience Initiative in the southern neighbourhood and the Western Balkans. The overall increase in the ELM ceiling from EUR 27 billion to EUR 32.3 billion will also help us meet our objectives under the Economic Resilience Initiative while at the same time ensuring that we continue to meet ambitious lending levels across all regions covered by the mandate. We have demonstrated our ability to react to evolving EU priorities, not only with the Resilience Initiative but also when we increased our lending to Ukraine to EUR 3 billion over three years as part of the Union’s special support package to Ukraine. And we have stepped up considerably our support for climate action. Having committed to providing a minimum of 25% climate action financing (and, by the way, we did 27-point-something in 2017), at 33% for external lending we are already almost reaching the objective of getting to 35% by 2020. So we are on a very good track in this respect. We’ve also supported additional requirements for the bank in terms of transparency and accountability, and I know how important this is to the Members of the European Parliament. This is particularly the case in the fields of tax avoidance, fraud and evasion, non-compliant jurisdictions, the prevention of money laundering and the fight against terrorism. I want to assure you that we take these requirements seriously and I will speak more about them later in the debate on the EIB’s annual report.  No sooner have we finalised the revision of the ELM that will take us to the end of the current Multiannual Financial Framework than we now have to prepare the landscape for EU spending post 2020. I look forward to exchanges with you on this in the coming months. I can already say with confidence that, given the success of the ELM to date and its ability to leverage investments to an order of 30-40 times the budget provisioning required, I’ve no doubt that it will continue to be a key tool for the EU post 2020.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 306, "date": "2018-02-07.json", "name": "Eduard Kukan", "mepid": "96651", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. – Mr President, my congratulations to Ms Gardiazabal for finalising this report.

I hope that the European Investment Bank will be a strong partner in executing our policy objectives. The EU is not immune to instability behind our borders.

We have always said from the beginning that we were going to review the External Lending Mandate based on the needs on the ground; we have seen that since the beginning of the External Lending Mandate.  Politically, we have decided to take a more active role in the eastern neighbourhood of the Union to support countries which have embarked on a pro-European path there and also to engage more actively in the southern neighbourhood of the Union to help tackle, of course, the migration and refugee crises.  What we have done with these changes to the External Lending Mandate was to use the flexibility to increase and enlarge it where possible, and also to make use of the reduced exposure in Turkey due to the fact that less financeable projects could be found there; to make use of all of this flexibility to enable us to put resources where they are needed and to respect the political commitments which we have made.  We are of course as a Parliament disappointed that the Council, the Member States, did not agree to increase the overall level of ceilings. It would have meant only increasing the burden on the budget of the Union in a very small manner – by EUR 34 million – and it would have enabled even more predictability in terms of the EIB’s engagement in the long term.

It is a long term work that is bearing fruit today, and I would like to congratulate him on it. These reports represent major progress towards transparency and the course ahead for the future of the European Union. They will be intended to inspire future Union policies and already inspire Parliament's proposals for the next multiannual financial framework. In the first place, of course, there is the fight against fraud and tax evasion. It is unacceptable that public money can contribute to tax evasion structures and aggressive tax planning. They are not only profound injustices, but also contribute to the destabilization of States and are obstacles in our fight against crime and terrorism. With these relations, the European Investment Bank will be preserved from any relationship with countries that do not cooperate with the Union in tax matters. Today's reports will serve as examples in this area. These texts also provide an opportunity to set a new course, a new horizon for the overall external development strategy of the European Union. With the Paris agreement, with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the European Union and the Member States have made historic and major climate and civilization commitments. We are now guarantors of these commitments and that these commitments do not turn into pious vows, announcements or false pretenses. They must quickly translate into concrete and tangible developments, as these reports have succeeded in putting these commitments into the objectives of the external policy of the Union. But we need to look further, ensure that these objectives are compasses to European policies and, first and foremost, to the future multiannual financial framework. Finally, let us be careful — and these reports succeed — not to fall into a trap of instrumentalising development policy for the benefit of other objectives. No, it is not a policy of border control, nor the management of migration flows or readmission agreements. No, it's not a blackmail tool to fund corrupt regimes. On the contrary, development is a long-term policy towards our neighbours, our partners.

Clearly, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the migratory pressure on the countries of the Union is a major challenge for our future. Everyone is aware of the tensions that this already entails between the countries of the Union and the political risks to the future of our democracies, which are already emerging here and there during the elections. The management of migration flows is therefore a political priority, and for the construction of Europe itself and for the health of our democracy. It is from this main point of view that I want to lend my support and that of my group to the proposal for a decision which aims to enable the EIB to expand quantitatively and qualitatively its external lending mandate. In concrete terms, this means several advances that I want to welcome. First, a fourth broad horizontal objective of addressing the root causes of migration is integrated into the EIB's external lending mandate. Secondly, the maximum ceiling for financing operations is increased to $32.3 billion on the understanding that $1.4 billion could be allocated to public-sector projects aimed at refugees and host communities and that $2.3 billion under a private sector lending mandate could be allocated to projects addressing the root causes of migration. Of course, these amounts are modest, even if they are part of the broader framework of an external investment strategy. But at a time when demography explodes in Africa, at a time when the effects of global warming are being felt, at a time when China is grabbing for its benefit part of Africa's wealth, we cannot resign ourselves to the fact that the left behind in this continent do not have no choice other than that of European exile.

Both the foreign shares guarantee fund and the foreign operations loss fund are both the financial arms to make cooperation policy a migration retention policy and a private business. And someone has to say it, Mr. Hoyer. The European Investment Bank is today a criminal organisation. The EIB promotes financial benefits and crimes against human rights and the environment. Yesterday you approved EUR 1.5 billion for the TAP, a gas pipeline without a climate impact report and which is obvious to human rights violations in Azerbaijan, Turkey and repression in southern Italy. In the Canary Islands, 125 million for gas infrastructure rather than renewable. You give large sums to destructive projects, such as eucalyptus monoculture in Brazil and Uruguay or mining in Madagascar, which displaces the population and pollutes water.

To obfuscate the case, the European Union repays the bank tens of billions of euros in wholesale a year, calling the account a guarantee fund. The bank covers from this fund its losses. To work in a bank like this is a wonderful thing. Today, the European Commission recognised that it too has its people. They also have to live off something and she wants to manage that fund herself. That's the few dozen lucrative salaries closest to those nonrefundable loans. What does the European Parliament say? Nothing.

Many of us here recognise the European Investment Bank as the main institution supporting public and private investment in the Union. Many of us also appreciate the important role it plays outside the European Union through its external lending activities. However, the European Union's international influence and its concrete commitment to development cooperation outside its borders cannot make it forgotten that its ability to influence should also lie in the affirmation of its universal values of solidarity, respect for human and social rights and the exercise of the democracy. Reducing global poverty, promoting economic, social and environmental development, promoting democracy, the rule of law, good governance and respect for human rights, yes, of course. But these priorities cannot be solely dependent on private financial commitments, the objective of which remains return and return on investment. I have long been arguing that the Union should go beyond the mere guarantee of investment financing but be able to put fresh money to start projects. What is valid within the European Union is also true for its external interventions in countries such as Africa, which are also accompanied by larger powers that are more generous than the European Union. I believe that we must give full confidence to the European Investment Bank, but we need to support it more.

I will have to come back to many of you because I cannot respond to each and every question right now because of time limitations. Let me concentrate on just a very few points.  Number one: the migration crisis has opened the eyes, hearts and minds of many people in Europe with regard to development policies. I think many had closed their eyes vis-à-vis the real problems in developing countries. Now we need to address the root causes of that migration, which finally opens up the possibility to really talk about migration. There is a paradigm change going on in development policy: we are moving from donor-recipient thinking to partnership thinking and development. That’s huge progress and it goes hand in hand with the second big paradigm change in budget policies. It was a hugely courageous move by President Juncker to go in the direction of reserving budgetary funds – very limited ones, by the way – EUR 60 billion – from subsidies and grants to guarantees and loans. This is a paradigm change in the use of the budget. Ms Georgieva would have said ‘better spending’, and that’s exactly what we need in the field of development, too, because if we want to achieve the sustainable development and climate goals, we will need to crowd-in the private sector. We need to broaden the financial base, and the crowding-in institution of the European Union is the EU bank, the EIB. Second remark – the Juncker plan: one day we will write the history of the European Union in this decade, and I’m pretty sure that the Juncker plan will be one of the outstanding events of this decade when it comes to the history of the European Union and the further development of our instruments. There have been words about the loss of money and lack of control. Ladies and gentlemen, we are the leanest bank among the multilateral banks in general and also among commercial banks. With 3 500 people, we produce a volume of roughly EUR 80 billion per year. Go to the World Bank, they do roughly half of what we’re doing with 18 000 people, and that is the reason why we are not in each and every place in the world with boots on the ground, that’s why we need the partnership of other institutions when we are in developing countries, too. We only have 100 people out of 3 500 not residing in Luxembourg. Finally, the loss of assets. Ladies and gentlemen, we have never lost more than 0.4% of non-performing loans. This is the lowest figure you’ll find for any big bank, at least in Europe, probably in the world. I don’t comment on the world of the criminal organisation, I don’t chair any criminal organisation, and I’m very proud to chair a very decent institution which delivers success. We are the EU bank, we are the only institution that’s owned and controlled only by the EU and the EU Member States, and that means the objectives are set by the Treaty and by the European Council in connection with Parliament and the Council and the Commission. That means we are bound to the values of the European Union, whether that’s on human rights, the social dimension, the environmental dimension, on procurement law, whatsoever, and this means that you can expect us to deliver on this promise of sticking to the values of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 334, "date": "2018-02-07.json", "name": "Jyrki Katainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, thank you very much for a mostly very constructive, forward-looking discussion.

The support on the ground of countries such as Jordan and Lebanon and the countries in the Western Balkans creates opportunities for their security and stability. The European Investment Bank and its guarantees for local entrepreneurs play a key role in supporting investment in these countries.

The report we are discussing now goes far beyond a specific programme and what we aim is to give an overview of the EIB's activities both within the Union and outside and, above all, to mark the way that Parliament believes it must follow in the coming years for its actions to be in line with the decisions of the European Union. the Union. The EIB has proved to be a key player in the mobilisation of public and private investment in the service of European policies, strengthening Member States' competitiveness, supporting the real economy, job creation, or, for example, by financing innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises. In this regard, for example, this Parliament supported and worked to extend the European investment plan as an instrument to strengthen investment within the European Union, making a number of amendments to solve the problems we identified in its first version. Because, of course, if we want to successfully achieve the objectives that we have set ourselves as a Union, we must also look at economic sustainability other criteria when assessing projects, such as social, environmental criteria or territorial cohesion criteria. In fact, this year the EIB is planning to undertake a review of its energy lending criteria. And we believe that this is a great opportunity to adapt them to the new commitments that we as a European Union have made through the Paris Agreement. So, from this Parliament, we encourage you to focus your energy policy towards energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. Within these criteria they should assess we believe that gender equality and women's empowerment are also found, which need to be more relevant in evaluating projects. In this regard, we also appreciate positively not only the existence of a strategy on gender equality within the EIB Group, but the newly adopted equality action plan. I hope that this action plan will begin to bear fruit quickly and that this will be reflected in the Bank's activity. In keeping with the criteria that have to guide the EIB's actions, I think it is essential to highlight the social aspect of investment. We must not forget that the three institutions have just signed the agreement on the social pillar and that the EIB must therefore make every effort to get that agreement from paper to reality. In recent years, in this Parliament — and we have seen it in the previous debate as well — we have made the fight against tax fraud, evasion and money laundering one of our top priorities. In this regard, we have called for an ambitious policy on non-cooperating jurisdictions. We recognise the EIB's progress in this area and believe that it is in a privileged position to lead a strict and exemplary policy on taxation issues. Another issue that Parliament always attaches particular importance to is all that has to do with transparency, accountability and access to information. Given the EIB's turnover and its growing presence in the development of European Union policies and, above all, that the Community budget supports a large part of these operations, it is essential that genuine public control of its activities, the selection of projects and funding priorities. Transparency in the implementation of public policies is essential, since, on the one hand, it favors credibility of the bank and the institutions and, on the other hand, it also facilitates control of the investment mobilised, financial intermediaries, final beneficiaries and, above all, the effectiveness and sustainability of the financed projects. President Hoyer, you are perfectly aware of the challenges we face in the European Union and I am convinced that our cooperation will depend on whether we achieve our successes and that the results will be what citizens are waiting for.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 341, "date": "2018-02-07.json", "name": "Luděk Niedermayer", "mepid": "124701", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. – Mr President, let me start by saying that the European Investment Bank (EIB) is the institution that helped us overcome post—crisis problems and it has for sure a firm place in our future. In doing so, there are two issues that I want to highlight from the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON). First of all, all public support – even from the development bank – is not free of risk. Here, especially, I am talking about the risk of crowding—out private financing. We, as well as the EIB, must be fully aware of this risk and try to minimise it. Secondly, the EIB is a bank. Banking is about money and risks; about finding the right balance. Too low a risk means limited impact. Too high a risk can lead to losses in capital. Too narrow a focus means that we will be missing some targets. Too many mandates at the same time can lead to fragmentation and to high costs. We should keep finding the right balance and finding the trade—offs, to be focused and efficient in the work and the EIB. This is the way to ensure that the EIB will serve good purposes for the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 342, "date": "2018-02-07.json", "name": "Werner Hoyer", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the European Investment Bank. – Mr President, it is a great pleasure to be back today for the second time and to thank again the rapporteur and the co-rapporteur for their excellent work and cooperation. I notably appreciate the explicit support you give to the European Investment Bank in its role as a catalyst for investments to support growth and jobs, both within and outside the European Union. In 1958, the European Union was already in full swing – or the European Economic Community was in full swing – when the bank was founded and began its work on the basis of the Treaty of Rome, and I can tell you that we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the bank with pride and with thanks and appreciation for the support received from this House. In the past 60 years we’ve operated in 160 countries, we have engaged in close to 12 000 operations globally and dispersed over EUR 1.1 trillion. And this has mobilised up to EUR 3 trillion of investment, a very efficient use of EU resources. A good deal by the way! After all, only around EUR 14 billion was ever paid in, in cash, by the Member States, a little more than 1% of the total investment this bank has contributed to generating. So it has been a good 60 years – and I believe that if we are the ‘good news’ institution of the European Union we should tell the good stories. The largest share of EIB group financing, close of EUR 30 billion, last year went to small and medium-sized and mid-cap enterprises, the backbone of the European economy and jobs. We estimate that this financing sustained 3.9 million jobs in more than 285 000 firms.  One area where Europe is lagging behind in terms of investment is the innovation sector, so I am particularly proud of the fact that in 2017 we managed to increase lending for innovation to close to EUR 14 billion –that is at the heart of competitiveness and ultimately of sustained and sustainable growth. Moreover, in 2017 we financed close to EUR 7 billion in environmental projects and EUR 18 billion in infrastructure. The EIB once again met its target for climate action, with approximately EUR 19 billion of financing, representing over 27% of total EIB financing in 2017. But what I really want to draw your attention to is this. In 2017 we approved more projects than ever – 901, roughly a 15% increase from the previous year – but the average size of the projects we financed is considerable smaller than previously. This means that we are enabling more and more firms and public entities to invest, and we are also getting better at assessing our impact on GDP and jobs. As the report from the Commission’s institute in Seville points out, EIB-Group-supported investments in 2015 and 2016 alone are expected to create 2.25 million extra jobs and to generate a 2.3% increase in the EU GDP by 2020. A big part of why we are able to do this is the investment plan for Europe, the Juncker plan, which, as you know very well, is backed by a guarantee from the EU budget and the EIB’s own resources to finance riskier investments. I have already talked about this plan and we are very grateful that, with Parliament’s decision in December, it has been extended to the end of 2020 with an increased goal of mobilising EUR 500 billion. By the end of 2017 we had approved 717 European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) transactions, mobilising EUR 257 billion, or 82% of the original EUR 315 billion target. That means we are well on track to reach the goal in the coming months. The EFSI is working, and it’s working well. Additionality is key. Three out of four EFSI clients are new to the bank and this clearly demonstrates how much the EFSI has changed the EIB Group. It has changed our DNA! Most EFSI operations are higher risk, so-called special activities. The EFSI is a great example of what the EIB, the EU bank, can do to help scarce human resources achieve more. It is a spectacular endorsement of the fact that the paradigm shift from grants and subsidies to loans and guarantees is a very strong tool in Europe’s public policy toolkit, and we should now think about the lessons to be learned from the EFSI plan, inside the European Union, in relation to our activities outside the European Union. And we already discussed the Sustainable Development Goals and the climate goals in the previous debate. For this reason, we are engaged in extensive dialogue with the Member States, the Commission and this House to make financial instruments more effective in the Union’s Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) post 2020. The report also stresses how important it is that EIB continues to be a financial institution of good practice, leading by example. I can assure you that we are continually in contact with other international financial institutions, international organisations and relevant authorities to ensure that we apply best banking and accountability principles. In preparation for this plenary debate we provided you with the state of play on the recommendations tabled through the previous report. I am open to discussing how future arrangements could work even better, and we will, of course, continue to inform you regularly on our activities and their impact on the ground. Thank you very much for your attention. I’m looking forward to the debate. And again, thank you for your support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 343, "date": "2018-02-07.json", "name": "Jyrki Katainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, first of all let me highlight our excellent partnership with the European Investment Bank (EIB) – the EU bank, as President Hoyer rightly likes to call it – on the financial implementation of our political priorities. The EIB is an indispensable partner in financing infrastructure, supporting SMEs, boosting employment and delivering on climate action, sustainable transport and external policies. The Commission welcomes the report and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur again on a good job. Allow me to restrict myself to three issues of particular relevance to the Commission. First, on compliance, which features prominently in your report: the Commission has taken action to prevent the use of EU funds in support of projects that contribute to tax avoidance or tax evasion. Let me stress that there was already, in the Financial Regulation, a prohibition on support for projects leading to tax evasion but the Commission has proposed to extend it to include tax avoidance in its scope. Rules have already been adopted to this effect in respect of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) and European Fund for Sustainable Development regulations and the External Lending Mandate decision. A similar approach is expected to be included in a new Financial Regulation still under discussion by the legislators. Therefore, the Commission welcomes the calls to enhance compliance on tax matters.  We are currently preparing guidelines that will provide clarity on the new legal provisions linked to non-cooperative tax jurisdictions. In that regard the Commission expects that the EIB will improve its internal policies to reflect the new legal environment.  The second point is on geographical balance and cohesion. The size of the national economies, by definition, influences the volume of EIB activities. In relative terms, however, smaller Member States benefit more than it appears at first glance. With the EFSI, for instance, the top five beneficiaries in terms of GDP are Estonia, Greece, Bulgaria, Portugal and Spain. But the Commission takes concerns about coverage and geographical balance very seriously. Efforts are ongoing to place more emphasis on using local knowledge and cooperating with local and regional actors. The Commission and the EIB are working very closely with national and regional promotional banks, which have local expertise and understand the local financing needs. The revision to the Financial Regulation will make it easier to combine financial instruments and EFSI financing with other sources of EU funding such as the structural funds. This should lead to more projects in the regions less covered so far. Furthermore, under the EFSI, the European Investment Advisory Hub provides more targeted technical assistance at local level and the Commission encourages the EIB to extend its local outreach.  Finally, in relation to the number and types of financial instruments under the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF): as you know, the Commission is currently working intensively on the next MFF. We share Parliament’s concern about the multiplication of financial instruments and especially the complexity of the rules that apply them. We want to continue providing support to all sectors that are in need of EU support, but we need to do so more efficiently under a single rule. The partnership with the EIB will remain a central pillar in delivering these financial instruments. It will be shaped by our successful common history and also by constructive criticism from Parliament and other stakeholders. Today’s report forms an essential part of that input.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 344, "date": "2018-02-07.json", "name": "Ivana Maletić", "mepid": "119436", "text": "rapporteur for the opinion of the REGI Committee. — Mr. President, what is important to emphasize is that indeed the role of the EIB is very important in the development of the entire European economy. The EIB needs to ensure the strengthening of the single market, as well as the financing of projects for modernisation and development of new activities, but also what is further specifically underlined in the Treaty on European Union, which is to support the development of underdeveloped regions. This is a very important role for the EIB in implementing the cohesion policy itself. Thus, the EIB finances with its instruments advisory services in the preparation and implementation of cohesion policy projects. It also provides funding for national co-financing, capacity building. However, we cannot know how successful it is because there is not enough clear data related to these activities. That's why we call for transparency. And it is important to emphasize that when we analyzed in which countries the most funds are spent, ie, for which countries are given the most loans, these are France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.

I would say to EIB President Hoyer and Commission Vice-President Katainen that good investments are, of course, crucial for Europe in this ever-changing global economic landscape, and 2016, the year that the report refers to, was a very good year for the European Investment Bank. EIB investment amounted to EUR 83 billion and helped to mobilise investment of EUR 280 billion. This is emphasised in our report, in which we place particular emphasis on three aspects. Firstly, delivering on the Juncker plan: through the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), we entrusted the EIB to put money to work in Europe by making loans and ‘crowding in’ private capital. However, the investment gap is still an issue for many European countries. It is important, President Hoyer, that the EIB should continue to provide much-needed technical assistance and advisory support to reduce the existing regional discrepancies, especially in regions with low investment capacity. This can be achieved, of course, by cooperating with national promotional banks. Secondly, on addressing the migration challenge: we have been, with Parliament’s Committee on Budgets, in Tunisia last year, and two years ago in Jordan and Lebanon, countries which are seeing hundreds of thousands of refugees coming from various countries in the region. We have seen that we have to do more for infrastructure in those countries – healthcare, education, electricity and waste infrastructure – and in terms of helping the host communities, making sure that SMEs, not only in capitals but also in regions, have access to credit. This is also something on which Parliament’s rapporteurs, led here by Eider Gardiazabal Rubial, have focused. Thirdly, on the External Lending Mandate, which we had a chance to debate an hour ago: the important message is that, with the changes we have made, the EIB will be capable of fulfilling the needs on the ground. Lastly, of course, I would mention SMEs, which are so important for the European economy.  I would like to conclude by thanking all the colleagues involved and the rapporteur, who has worked tirelessly on this report. We adopted it with a large majority in the Budgets Committee. I am confident that we will be able to adopt it with a large majority here in plenary as well.

The first, the previous speaker just mentioned, is how you assess your support for projects from the point of view of the Paris conference commitments. Too often, however, we still see a commitment, EIB financing which ultimately finances fossil energy rather than renewables. I wonder if you should not commit to this House to have a more explicit reporting strategy based on sustainable financing criteria, in the spirit of the report that the high-level experts have just issued, and to check with you how you intend to implement them in your institution. Secondly, with regard to taxation, you said your availability. But again, I believe that we need more precise commitments, because mere cooperation with international organisations, and in particular the OECD, which is a largely blocked institution by the US authorities, is not, I think, a sufficient thread for the authorities responsible for a European institution.

It is this instrument, rather than — in my opinion reckless — the ECB's money dodprint, that already has tangible effects. We also agree with the rapporteur's basic diagnosis, which indicates a still existing regional variation in access to EIB financial instruments.

It has a broad scope, describing the Bank’s activities in the areas of the main policies: accountability, financial operations and communication. The macroeconomic impact of the Bank’s activities is visible when assessed at its cumulative investments; in 2015 in 2016 we were up to 2.3% EU GDP growth and 2.25 million jobs by 2020. In order to speed up the economic recovery in the Union and to help certain economic sectors and geographical areas to catch up, the report welcomed the development of extended European Fund for Strategic Investment and calls for further efforts to avoid geographical imbalances. The results at the end of 2017 show that the total investment related to EFSI approvals have reached the level of EUR 257 billion. While the implementation of the investment plan for the time being is intact, we expect better results from EFSI too, with its EUR 500 billion.  At the same time, we are concerned that the five biggest economies in the EU received 54% of the total loans granted in 2016. While the information in the form of investment per unit of GDP could be misleading, we insist on further territorial distribution of funds, including as regards the EFSI.  The EIB’s impact in the implementation of key public policy areas can be monitored through the results of investment in the key areas, for which purpose the EIB should continue to define its monitoring indicators. The EIB needs to further develop its risk culture in order to improve the effectiveness of its interventions with regard to the contribution to EU policies.

However, the EIB has not done as well as we would expect on climate action, even though it has just met its 25% target. For instance, in 16 EU Member States, EIB support for climate action did not reach even the level of 20%. Climate action investment in 2016 was predominantly located in the EU’s stronger economies, and this seems to be the rule rather than the exception. Seventy per cent of EFSI support for renewable energy was concentrated in just one country, Belgium, while 80% of energy efficiency within the EFSI was allocated to France, Finland and Germany. These aren’t the countries that need the sort of support from this investment bank, and we need to spread the renewable investment wider and to the other economies in Europe. To ensure sustainability of investment in coordination with the Commission, the EIB needs to evaluate their national and collective public investment to ensure that the EU is on track to meet its climate change goals as agreed in Paris within the next five years.

It is crucial though that there is even democratic control over all this volume of money. So it is important that you respect the recommendations made by the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control, where I am rapporteur for the EIB report, for ensure transparency and ensure that there is always proper compliance by the assessment made by the European Investment Bank. A particular point should be raised on issues related to projects which must have an ex ante and ex post independent evaluation, precisely to assess whether there is actually an additionality or added value in all the projects you financed, especially on major infrastructure works. On this there is a fundamental problem that is raised in Italy and concerns the project of the Trans Adriatic Pipeline, which is a project strongly wanted by politics, on which there are strong doubts that compliance has been respected, also because it is a work that passes through high-corruption territories where in subcontracting and procurement you could create big problems. In more there are the problems of the territories that precisely undergo these very invasive works; therefore the territories should be respected and policy should act and compliance should be precisely respected. So, net of these considerations of mine, I am convinced that the European Investment Bank is doing a good job in some cases, but where policy influences projects you risk after fall too often into what are useless works, still related to fossil sources, and therefore that the goals it has This Parliament and which has the European Union are not respected in terms of combating CO2 emissions and in terms precisely linked to what are the Europe 2020 targets.

The EIB is one of the most powerful instruments to support the economy that the European Union has and is the public bank that delivers the most credit to the world. We are talking about more than EUR 80 billion of loans paid out each year. Looking at the state in which the European Union is pouring and into which the economies of the European Union are pouring, I think much more can be done in terms of supporting the European Investment Bank for the economy real. A first issue that I care about is that of the destination of investment and the countries of which the EIB's investments and credits are intended. Today the topic of Turkey is back topical. Turkey is a country that has benefited and continues to benefit from a large amount of credit from the EIB, but unfortunately — and the European institutions are also noticing — the Turkish regime is not compatible with those which define the values of democracy, transparency and respect that are the European Union's own. Turkey's numbers should make people think. Since 2000, the EIB has provided around EUR 30 billion in claims to this country, and this country remains one of the largest beneficiaries of EIB money and loans, far above some countries belonging to the EIB to the European Union. So, a key first point is to redirect credit towards problem countries and to the internal market. The role of the EIB must be to support, especially at a time of crisis, domestic demand that has collapsed and inward investment. Another very important theme is that of the so-called innovative tools we have seen in these last two years. I am talking about EFSI and the European Fund sustainable development. Here too, we need more transparency, we need better work on the concept and criterion of additionality, and these tools need to be more realistic in the support they give. Senseless multipliers may be nice to declare to newspapers, but the impact in terms of investment and work unfortunately is much less.

A European Investment Bank that has supported projects in the areas we consider strategic and which has also evolved with EFSI, with the Juncker Plan, the European Fund for Strategic Investments, for which I was co-rapporteur.

It demonstrates well the value of an investment bank driven not solely by the need for commercial return but also by the urgent need for investment in the parts that commercially driven investment banking cannot reach. There are always areas in which the market will fail and there will always be projects that cannot be delivered by the market alone, and that is where the contribution of the European Investment Bank (EIB) will remain essential. The priority areas for the EIB’s operations – innovation and skills, SMEs, climate and the environment and our infrastructure – encompass some of the most important priorities of the European Union budget. The low-carbon economy and the shift from the internal combustion engine will require substantial investment across the Union in power network infrastructure. The completion of a digital single market that enables rural as well as urban communities to engage will require substantially different forms of infrastructure investment, which will represent the changing face of cohesion policy. These real needs will require a European Investment Bank that is agile as well as forward-thinking. Unfortunately, the United Kingdom, which has a 16% stake in the EIB’s capitalisation is intending to leave the European Union but, however long it may take to refund the UK’s stake, it is worth remembering that the UK has received more than EUR 30 billion in investment from the EIB.

Although it is one of the largest shareholders since Article 50 has been triggered, the European Investment Bank only guaranteed three loans worth GBP 285 million to British projects. Over the same period, the EIB gave more than 700 loans to other EU Member States. This funding was worth more than GBP 40 billion.

Firstly, a worrying lack of transparency, and it is good to remember here that the EIB does not always guarantee full access to data on projects financed. Secondly, the EIB's decision to finance infrastructure facilities with high environmental impact and dubious additionality, such as the TAP, violates a precautionary principle, among others, a which we care very much.

It has also involved itself in offshore vehicles and some rather unsavoury, always interesting the word unsavoury, counterparties inside and outside of Europe. Small wonder then, that well over 100 cases, on public record I would remind you, of alleged fraud involving EIB funds are opened every year. Now for decades the EU has disguised the true size of its budget via funding from the European Investment Bank. The EIB is supposedly mandated to only lend to projects which were in line with the objectives of the EU. Yet its portfolio has ballooned to well over EUR 500 billion and this doesn't include the 500 billion the EIB manages on behalf of the Juncker fund.

In relation to environmental policies, I believe that the EIB has increased use of Green Bond, a financial instrument that has been in use for a few years that has been booming in 2016 and which could be one of the keys to solving many problems, such as those in areas with high environmental pressure, such as the Land of Fires, which would need investment in reclamation of contaminated areas, just as has already been done with polluted soils in Belgium and Holland.

Just a few comments. Many Members said that the EIB should be more transparent. Just to look at this issue from one perspective. If somebody is interested in EFSI projects just go to the EIB’s website and you can find every single project that has been signed. Unfortunately this opportunity is not taken up very often and many MEPs could spread the good word about what EFSI can do in your region or in your country if you could see what the others have already done, how money is being used. The second point. EFSI and the EIB more generally speaking is a demand-driven bank. So EFSI or the EIB generally speaking doesn’t send money according to its own decisions. You have to ask. You have to negotiate and then if preconditions are met the company or the public authority can get financing. This is why, for instance, if you look at the difference between Bulgaria and Romania it is so big. Whereas Bulgaria is the second biggest beneficiary of EFSI funding, Romania is one the one of the countries which have barely used EFSI opportunities. But you cannot push on a rope, even though we try. The EIB is offering technical assistance through the technical investment advisory hub and this is one of the tools we want to use even more in order to make sure that all countries and regions can benefit from EFSI financing. Many Members were worried about climate-related investments and many Members said that the EIB should finance more climate-related investments. The EIB is already now – and correct me, Mr Hoyer, if I am wrong – but according to my knowledge, the EIB is the biggest climate financer when looking at these kind of banks. Also EFSI 2.0 has already decided to dedicate some 40% of overall investment capacity to address climate change. Finally, to our British friends, concerning Britain and British businesses: the British business sector is one of the most active users of EFSI and the EIB has a significant portfolio in Britain. British businesses and the public sector have deliberately sought to use EFSI and the EIB because it had created added value to the British economy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 372, "date": "2018-02-07.json", "name": "Werner Hoyer", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the European Investment Bank. – Mr President, there are so many – sometimes colourful – questions, as the Commissioner has said, that I cannot respond individually to each and every one, but I promise you that my people have written everything down, so we will approach you individually in order to answer your questions. Let me concentrate on a very few points. Number one: the geographical balance of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) and the lending of the Bank in general. If somebody writes big articles in newspapers, comparing the investment volume in the United Kingdom with the investment volume in Malta, you will be surprised that the UK has more than Malta. There’s a little bit in relation to GDP and a little bit in relation to the overall investment activity in a country that has to be observed in that context. So you have to see the figures by GDP or the figures as a percentage of overall investment activity. There, I think we are very good now. Secondly, the Juncker plan consists of three equally important strands: EFSI, advisory services and the institutional and regulatory improvements that the European Union needs. The Commission, the Parliament and the Council are working on all three of them, and this is why we take advisory services so seriously, and we cooperate closely on the advisory hub, together with the European Commission. For some countries this is, for the time being, the only way to be able to participate in EFSI, and where more can be done, we are ready. In some cases where the percentage of investments via EFSI or via the EIB in general is extremely low, we see also that the overall investment activity – private investment activity – in that country is extremely low. There must be a reason for that and we must address it together. On the third issue, we should remind ourselves of the status of the Bank, which emanates from the Treaty of Rome. There it says that the objective of the Bank is to contribute to the forming of an internal market – that was sensational in the year 1957 – and to the levelling-out of regional differences. Neither job has been done yet. Too much of our GDP in the Member States of the European Union still follows the rule of the national, local or regional legislation, and not European legislation. So the internal market is not perfect yet, and in addition to that, we still have huge regional differences. This is why cohesion policies are of such importance for us. The accountability / compliance question is extremely serious. We know that we have to continually improve on that, but I think that, in comparison to our peers in the multilateral development institutions and financing institutions, we are second to none. There was a word on crowding-out in the remarks by Mr Niedermayer and I take that very seriously, because it is my firm conviction that there is no role for a public bank to finance something if that can be financed by private institutions. But let’s be honest: in very many cases it is our engineers (because we are the engineering bank in the world) who check a project, come to a positive conclusion, say it is good project and give the stamp of approval to the project and then, all of a sudden, private investors think it is a good project and say, ‘let’s participate and let us ourselves be crowded-in’. So sometimes the opposite of crowding-out is true: we crowd in. Basically, the EU Bank is the crowding-in institution in the world. We sell our bonds (EUR 70 to 80 billion per year) on the international capital markets, with which we finance all these activities. In addition to that, we never finance more than one third, so this brings you to the level of roughly EUR 80 billion of activities, producing EUR 272 billion of overall additional investment in Europe. We can talk forever about energy lending. The energy policy of the European Union, unfortunately, is not set by me, or it would look a little bit different. We finance activities that are in line with the energy objectives of the European Union. We are going a little bit beyond that. There is no doubt about that, because our energy lending is energy-source neutral, but still I cannot promise you that some day I will have stopped financing fossil-fuel energy projects. This would not be honest, because the Member States of the European Union who own us will say that they do not follow that way. On the question of the Paris Agreement, I must say that we are extremely proud that we were the driving force behind the role of the multilateral development banks in the Paris Accord, and we still believe that we should continue that role. As a matter of fact, when it comes to green bonds, which were just mentioned, we were the inventors of the green bonds (climate awareness bonds). We are still the largest issuer of climate awareness bonds and we are the ones who are now trying to find ways of expanding the idea of these – let’s say social responsibility bonds – to other areas in order to help finance sustainable development goals and other goals – in particular, for instance, right now when it comes to the Ocean Conference which is just ahead, where we have to bring a big European contribution to cleaning up the oceans. One final word on Brexit. Brexit can break my heart, but I think that, whether we like it or not, we have to accept the decision, although sometimes one wonders what had been done in order to give the British people the real picture of what will happen when Brexit takes place. It probably will take place, but let’s look at the figures. The United Kingdom has paid EUR 3.5 billion into the Bank over the last 40 years. They will get that back, but the overall volume of indebtedness of the European Investment Bank is EUR 243 billion. With that, the Member States of the European Union guarantee our projects, which consist of a number of assets of, all in all, close to EUR 600 billion. That means that if something goes wrong, the Member States have liability here. The United Kingdom has a contingent liability of EUR 36 billion (or EUR 35 point something billion), and that will remain. It is not so that we pay out to the United Kingdom – they have never paid in, and if something goes wrong, they have a contingent liability. So these are the facts.

We share the view of the European Parliament on this topic, that a healthy democracy requires an active and well—developed civil society. The active engagement of citizens is the cornerstone of our open and free societies. Only recently, in October 2017, in its conclusions on the application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in 2016, the Council stated that civil society organisations serve as a watchdog and play an important role in promoting and implementing fundamental rights on the ground. They are irreplaceable in raising awareness of fundamental rights among rights-holders and in supporting their efforts to exercise and defend their rights. To fulfil their task civil society organisations must be enabled to carry out their work. As for external relations, the Council reaffirmed that civil society organisations are both actors of governance and development actors in their own right. As such, they are key partners for the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the EU Global Strategy. There are many examples of policy fields where civil society is regularly consulted and integrated by the Union in the decision—making process. This is, for example, the case in the work of the European Union High Level Group on combating racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance, the EU Forum on the rights of the child, the EU Forum on migration and integration, and many others. Capacity-building of civil society’s national human rights bodies is supported through EU funding in areas such as anti—racism, anti—discrimination, access to justice, rights of the child, women’s rights, the elderly, disability, etc. As for the Council’s work, for several years already there has been a tradition of regular contact and dialogue between the presidencies and civil society. In the programme of the Bulgarian Presidency we have committed to realising a presidency which is open to citizens. Both in the process of preparation and conducting the Presidency, we strongly rely on cooperation with civil society and the non-governmental sector, as their intellectual imagination, expert contribution and creative, innovative approach have a very important added value for us. As recently as December 2017, Council working parties discussed how to ensure and enhance coherence and possible synergies between the internal and external aspects of civil society policies. The Fundamental Rights Agency participated in that debate. The agency is closely cooperating with civil society and has initiated work on a better understanding of the challenges and positive experiences of civil society organisations in the European Union. This work was recently concluded with a report. It stresses that the decision makers need to ensure that the important work of civil society is not undermined through policy and legal changes and funding cuts. The report also contains good practices that are being used to address these challenges. I would like to conclude by stressing that civil society brings forward citizens’ concerns. It represents and supports democracy, human rights, the rule of law, social justice and pluralism. It contributes to the effective and inclusive policies and engages in initiatives to further social inclusion, participatory democracy and governance, both in the European Union and also in third countries. Therefore it is our legal and political responsibility to guarantee good conditions for a strong civil society in our countries and in the Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 378, "date": "2018-02-07.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I cannot stress enough the importance the Commission attaches to the existence of a vibrant civil society, and to a regular and transparent engagement with civil society actors – both as allies and as critical minds. As we can see in several States, elections are not the only sufficient proof of a democracy. A strong civil society is heavily needed. The importance of preserving and protecting the civil society space has become more evident in our time, where fundamental rights and values are under high pressure. Indeed, civil society is unfortunately facing pressures in many parts of the EU.  I am aware and deeply concerned by these worrying trends, or – as this debate is called – the shrinking space for civil society. It includes funding cuts, stringent regulatory frameworks, lack of involvement in policymaking, or smear campaigns affecting public perceptions of the credibility and legitimacy of civil society organisations and those that fund them.  We are monitoring such developments at national level, touching upon the role and functions of civil society organisations. We take very seriously actions by public institutions aimed at deliberately shrinking the capacity and position of action of civil society organisations or attempting to control, delegitimise or stigmatise their work.  We will not hesitate to take action when measures are taken in violation of Member States’ obligations under the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as we have already done in the case of Hungary. In December 2017, the Commission referred Hungary to the Court of Justice concerning its law on foreign-funded NGOs.  We also continue to provide concrete support, including capacity-building and funding, to raise awareness, encourage advocacy and foster the enforcement of fundamental rights, and we are currently mapping gaps and needs to identify how to further empower civil society and other independent human rights actors, such as national human rights institutions. This takes up a specific request from the European Parliament, on the basis of which we are about to launch a feasibility study.  This is also a timely moment for the new ideas to feed ongoing reflections on the future EU Multiannual Financial Framework.

In real democracy, people are encouraged and invited to participate in decision-making. A healthy, self-confident society welcomes people to have a say. In a fake democracy, people are invited once every four years to come and cast their vote, to elect, and to be silent in between. This is the real threat to democracy, and I think that it is our role to – fight against it is maybe too activist – but to be very vigilant, to monitor the situation and to give support where it is needed, because silencing and shrinking civil society is one of the parameters of populism. Populists hate civil society because they love a strong state and, unfortunately, in part of our society there is now the demand for an ever-stronger state, because there are people who promise they will do everything to facilitate things for you, to guarantee you a happy life. They want everything but critical thinking from the people. Unfortunately, online and digital development is not helping. We should analyse this phenomenon more, and what it means, because when I speak to the courageous people of the NGOs, they say hate speech online is something which is censoring and silencing them. It is not only journalists, but also a large number of people working for NGOs, publicly-known people, who are affected by hatred online. It is a factor which we should think about and maybe do something about. There is also the factor of societal changes, which we see in relation to the development of the digital area. I have nothing against digital development. There are many positive things in this respect, but what we see is that the populists like this sphere because they have an easily manipulated crowd. Again, this is something which goes directly against civil society, and I think that we should analyse the reasons for shrinking space for civil society, react appropriately and find remedies. I do not think that the only possible remedy we have in hand is infringement against a state where we see that the law is deviating from how the legislation should look. Of course, we are monitoring the situation in Hungary and in Poland. Today we discussed Romania. We are monitoring some other Member States where there are worrying developments – not only in the east of the EU; I must make this clear. Maybe the approach of the Commission might be seen as pretty legalistic, that we wait for a bad law to be enacted before we act, but we have to be very careful here and maybe trust more the people in Europe that there are enough democrats who will not be silenced so easily. We have to be careful and we have to support civil society by means other than infringements directed against the laws in some Member States. How can we do it? The fund – I am very much for creating such a fund. We are now launching a feasibility study where we want to map the various funding instruments in the Member States, to fill the gap and not to duplicate or do something which would not be systemic and transparent enough. I also have an expert meeting, and I invite those who are interested in this issue to participate in this debate, because I think that it should be our common work. Let me conclude by speaking about big money, which is also now in debates such as the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) after 2020. Here we have a great chance to open better and easier possibilities for the NGOs to get funding. I am not so sure about opening the special chapter in MFF which was, I think, the proposal of Mr Boni. I think that we should deliberately and thoroughly analyse the possibility of opening the space for NGOs, who in many cases substitute the tasks of the state while being miserably paid. We have to change this situation. We see one year of financing, so the NGOs invest 90% of their initiatives in collecting or seeking money, instead of doing the core thing. We also have to look into the rules for financing. We will hear more and more about the need to simplify the rules for the new MFF. Whenever I hear politicians, including myself, speaking about simplification, I start to fear we will complicate it more. Now we have to manage to simplify the rules, especially for the small-scale projects, not to allow again a system where you have to invest as much effort into getting EUR 100 000 as EUR 5 million. The system and the rules must be proportionate. EU funding is my hobby. I could continue, but I will spare you.

Secondly, I would like also to conclude by saying that an empowered and resilient civil society in all its diversity is a crucial component and voice, as mentioned by some of you, of any democracy.

Their position and legitimacy to engage in human rights is disputed. The importance of their work, their positions, and their themselves are diminishes. They are attacked not only verbally, but physically. Even members of their families and their children are being attacked. Their activities are seen as being aimed at family and in religion. Sometimes they are accused of spying for the benefit of the West. Despite their officially held positions, human rights defenders experience a lack of confidence, including from representatives of state authorities. They can't always count on police protection, protection from the state. On the contrary — because their activities are perceived as anti-system, and therefore hostile to the state, even on this side may come an attack. We should see the difficult role of human rights defenders and understand the scale and type of difficulty they face in soliciting human rights, including women's rights, and understand that part of these difficulties arise from the fact that they are women. Supporting human rights defenders has long been an element, one of the priorities, of the European Union's external policy. This is especially needed today when, as we have presented in many reports and just in the debate, the space in which civil society can operate, the space of freedom and pluralism, professed values and religions. I would like to ask, what mechanisms and practices do the European Commission apply to support the human rights defender, and what role do the European Union delegation play in this?

Women who are dedicated to defending others face increased problems. There are activists who have been illegally detained, activists who are raped, defamed, even attacked with acid, women of causes who see their children, family members and friends threatened. The European Union has a policy on gender equality and the defence of human rights in its external relations. Its delegations carry out activities and we finance programmes for this purpose.

I would now like to focus precisely on these sore spots, on many human rights activists around the world who stand for and are persecuted for the fundamental right of religious freedom: missionaries, nuns and religious, women of priests, believers.

The Commission, the European External Action Service and the States have an obligation under the Treaties, Commissioner. That obligation must lead the European Union to strengthen its role as a promoter of human rights around the world, protecting human rights defenders, especially women, but not at any cost. Financing human rights defenders does not mean using these funds as another tool to overthrow governments that are not aligned with the Union's commercial interests. We have also seen it here in many resolutions against countries that were imposed sanctions while others have been ignored and left out of the political agenda.

And the situation is even more worrying when we talk about women human rights defenders, because they must also face multiple risks added by being women: they must face rape, sexual violence, defamation and slander campaigns, acid attacks, threats and harm to their families. Lolita Chavez, a finalist for the Sakharov Prize in this Parliament, has been facing this discrimination and violence for years. Last week we received news about the possible issuance of a warrant for the arrest of Lolita by the Guatemalan prosecutor's office. I think today is a day to call for the European institutions to stand firm with Guatemala about the need to protect and defend Lolita. I would also like to remember, for example, fighters like Berta Cáceres, murdered in the early hours of March 3, 2016. I think that a case like Berta makes clear the limitations of existing strategies for protecting activists and their organisations and the urgency of rethinking our approach as European institutions for better protection from the risks and violence faced by thousands of women working for justice and equality . I would therefore like to point out that the European Union's guidelines in this area recognize the importance of applying the gender perspective in this issue, but, however, we do not have data on how the specific challenges faced by women defenders are taken into account when implementing, for example, programming of the different funds available.

And in this case, they are those of Lolita Chávez, threatened with death in Guatemala, persecuted and with a new arrest warrant, prosecuted for defending indigenous communities and their natural environment in Guatemala. Founder of the K'iche' Peoples' Council, she welcomed a programme for the temporary protection of human rights defenders of the Basque Government, and became, during the eight months she resided in the Basque Country, a reference and inspiration, in the end of being a finalist of the Sakharov Prize. A few weeks ago, he received the Ignacio Ellacuría Award for cooperation in the Basque Country.

When, moreover, they are women, when they overcome stereotypes and cultural patterns to come to the fore and become leaders of a community, we have a triple obligation because they are more at risk, because they are more difficult and because in many countries women are the great hope. That is the point of the questions we are presenting today, Commissioner. What would we be able to do if we coordinate all available wills and resources, if we add them, if we are able to generate synergy that makes today's efforts much more effective?

Human rights defenders, both men and women, are our natural and indispensable allies in the promotion of human rights and democracy. We know that many of them are constantly risking their life and their freedom, but women defenders are suffering very specific threats and obstacles on account of their gender as much as their fight for human rights. Yet women defenders play an increasingly prominent role in many partner countries. They are, of course, particularly active in advocating for progress on gender equality. However, it is important to recall that women defenders are not working exclusively on gender equality. They also make an essential contribution in promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. Women defenders are targeted, in particular, when they challenge traditional patterns and perceptions of gender roles and other social stereotypes. We have seen attacks against women defenders working on sexual and reproductive health and rights, promoting gender equality in schools or advocating for the rights of women victims of sexual and gender-based violence, including domestic violence, and the most harmful practices. Our external action has always focused strongly on the protection of women’s rights and of women defenders. Let me just mention, inter alia, the Foreign Affairs Council conclusions of June 2014. They clearly identify women defenders of human rights as a priority and confirm the EU’s commitment to improving its support. The commitment is turning into practice on a daily basis and, in recent times, we have stepped up our engagement in order to react to growing threats against women defenders. I would like to mention, in particular, our mechanism to protect defenders. This is a unique mechanism that can be used to provide targeted assistance to human rights defenders. In 2017, more than 200 women defenders were supported by this mechanism. Our support measures include not only funding to cover attorney fees and physical protection but also, in the most serious cases, temporary relocation to a safer destination. Another example of such targeted financial support is the Emergency Grants Fund for human rights defenders at risk, provided by the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. Our contacts with human rights defenders on the ground have also become more constant. The embassies of EU Member States and EU delegations are at the forefront of this work. Staff in EU delegations around the world regularly meet with women defenders and consult with them both on human rights and on the conditions of their daily work. Furthermore, our bilateral dialogues with partner countries are a powerful tool for raising women’s rights issues and for exchanges on individual cases involving women defenders of human rights. The EU strongly encourages governments to engage with women defenders and ensure their active, free and meaningful participation. Gender equality and women’s empowerment, including support for women defenders, are identified among the main priorities in the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy. The plan recognises and supports the critical role of human rights defenders and women’s organisations in relation to achieving fair and inclusive societies. When women, including young women, are empowered the benefits are perceived by their entire community. When they have access to good education and good jobs, social and economic inequality is easier to overcome. When women are recognised as full and equal citizens the whole society is more stable and democracies get stronger. Our work for women and women defenders is for them and it is for all of us, women and men alike.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 413, "date": "2018-02-07.json", "name": "Michaela Šojdrová", "mepid": "124710", "text": " for the PPE Group. — Mr President, Commissioner, when it comes to human rights advocates, men and women deserve our support.

Not coincidentally do we know Pakistan's first Nobel laureate, who was young Malala in 2014, who nearly lost her life defending, at the age of 15, girls' right to education. In education, she saw the possibility of defending against radical ideas. In 2013, it was the European Parliament that awarded her the Sakharov Prize. Although we don't need to look for women activists and human rights campaigners only in third countries, after all, it is much more serious problems that women outside the EU solve. I would cite Saudi Arabia as a successful example of their struggle. Thanks to the efforts of women here, there is a softening of laws, such as in guardianship. Women, when they go to see a doctor, no longer need to ask for their husband's entourage and male consent. Even from this June, women will be able to drive themselves. They fought it out on their own. I see the challenge towards civil society as essential. The latter may also be instrumental in monitoring and supporting specific examples of human rights advocates.

Often these women are victims of real disparaging campaigns, such as in Salvador where reproductive rights activists have been accused in the press of being traitors unpatriotic who throw discredit on the country. It is therefore necessary that the European Commission, in the context of the review of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, invest efforts and resources to support women fighting for defence of human rights all over the world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 423, "date": "2018-02-07.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, this has been a very useful exchange, and I thank the honourable Members for their interventions. From this debate, I conclude that we all recognise the vital importance of women human rights defenders and share common commitments to help protect them and promote their work.  We are living in extremely difficult times for civil society and human rights defenders all around the world. We are collectively facing a situation where the space for civil society is shrinking. However, let me be clear that the European Union will never leave human rights defenders alone, and we will continue to work together with you and civil society to defend human rights defenders around the world.

One of these countries is Belarus, located in the neighbourhood of Lithuania and the EU, where socially and politically active women, contributing to the creation of a democratic society in Belarus, are experiencing persecution or repression. Moreover, the Belarusian authorities apply different repressive measures to women who defend human rights than men. Men who defend human rights are usually punished by a fine or imprisoned. Meanwhile, women who defend human rights can face a whole variety of repressive measures, including closure to mental health care facilities, deprivation of maternity rights, dismissal, humiliation of dignity, forced divorce or seizure of property. They experience a wide variety of forms of persecution, all of which aim to humiliate women and destroy their personalities. Thus, the situation is very difficult and I support the call on the Commission to start taking into account the gender dimension of working with human rights defenders in the world, because, as we see from specific examples of a particular country, support must be targeted and protection must be provided for particularly risky groups. such as women.

Women’s rights defenders not only face violence from state actors, but also from within their own movements, their communities and members of their own families. This is because women defenders are defying what it means to be a woman in society, simply by stepping into the public space. Even though, in theory, the EU guidelines on this issue refer to gender perspectives, it is deeply disappointing that the European Commission is still not providing any information as to whether it consults women human rights defenders, and therefore whether they take into account the gender factors to any great extent and whether they are addressing any gender specific needs. At the moment, the majority of funding programmes put in place to support human rights defenders are not aimed specifically at supporting women human rights defenders.

When I walk into Parliament to vote, I realise that I can exercise my democratic right here thanks to Aletta Jacobs, Emmeline Pankhurst and others. Thanks to their struggle, I'm standing here. This week, the UK has 100 years of women's suffrage; next year it will be the turn of the Netherlands. Women's suffrage wasn't about one night of ice. For example, married Dutch women became legal only in 1956 and the EU brought the Equal Treatment Act to the Netherlands in 1980. In this Parliament, only one third of parliamentarians are women. The battle continues unabated! Think of the women of the Womens March. Think of She Decides, a campaign initiated by my party colleague Ploumen for safe abortions, education and maternity care in poor countries. Think of all the women who get up every day and shout: “I'm proud of myself, I can handle the whole world!” To them I say, “you're on top of your game! Keep fighting!” We must express our support for the fight for women's rights within the EU. This is partly why I call on women in the Netherlands to vote on 21 March.

We enjoy a wide range of legally guaranteed freedoms, which also applies to women (by the way, I must point out that Poland, also for alleged violations of women's rights, was considered the sixth safest country for women in the latest New World Wealth study. world). Unfortunately in many places, women's situation is much worse; their rights are denied, they are considered second-category persons. Even today, the European Parliament strongly condemns one of the manifestations of such an approach, which is female genital circumcision. However, even in those countries where women's situation is bad, there are always brave defenders of women's rights, which they are often themselves. Their fate is not enviable — they struggle with hurtful stereotypes, incomprehension from authorities and large parts of the population, and are often outright intimidated, beaten and belittled. They themselves and their families are often threatened with physical danger, including the threat of life. It is good that the European Union is working to sensitize its diplomacy to the needs of those brave women who need our support.
