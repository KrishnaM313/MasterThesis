Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. The European Commission thanks Parliament for allowing this debate to take place, and we welcome it.  Talking about Srebrenica and your request to have the resolution on the table is an important, common and signative activity of the European institutions. On the 20th anniversary of this terrible event, our thoughts are with the families of the families who lost their closest relatives in this tragedy.  We remember the victims and we must also acknowledge that Europe and the world – including us – failed to do everything possible to protect the victims. The Srebrenica genocide exactly twenty years ago left wounds and traces not only in south-eastern Europe, but throughout Europe. He has suffered deep wounds in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and he continues to place a moral obligation on us not to forget this. It calls on all of us, including the elected politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the whole region, to take responsibility for preserving the memory – which we are doing here today – that the judiciary be supported in punishing war crimes and, finally, that steps are taken towards reconciliation – for reconciliation throughout the region in the interests of present and future generations. In order to alleviate the pain of the relatives, it is essential to bring the perpetrators to justice and to find out the truth and fate of the many people still missing. This is also a necessary conditio for gradually achieving lasting reconciliation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the whole region between the various peoples, the people.  For those responsible on the part of the European Union, one of the most important lessons of the Balkan wars was not just to commit to reconstruction. Furthermore, we have clearly advocated a future for the countries of the Western Balkans in the European Union. They are candidate countries and we, for our part, should continue to make a credible offer. It is now a question of working to restore trust between the people and ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the whole region. I would like to express the Commission's wish that the commemoration of Srebrenica, which is primarily intended to honour the victims of the genocide, must also provide the impetus for a comprehensive reconciliation. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, as in all countries in the region, the Commission expects the authorities and societies to work resolutely towards the European Union. This is the best way to get over the tragedies of the past – not to forget them, but to get away – and to ensure that crimes like this genocide twenty years ago in Srebrenica can never happen again. We thank the European Parliament for today's resolution. The Commission regrets that, at the same time, a similar resolution proposed by the United Kingdom had not been possible in the UN Security Council by a veto by the Russian Federation. We believe that such tragic events, which lie in the history of our continent, should not be used for current political measures.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2015-07-09.json", "name": "Cristian Dan Preda", "mepid": "96838", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Madam President, today's discussion and the text we are going to vote on are very important, especially in a context where the UN Security Council failed yesterday to adopt a resolution. We have a duty to commemorate the victims of these heinous crimes, which took place twenty years ago, during the fall of Srebrenica. Our thoughts are with the victims and their families today. It is a duty of remembrance for us Europeans, as well as the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region. Without this work of memory, there can be no reconciliation, just as there can be no reconciliation without the restoration of the truth, however painful it may be. The truth is that 20 years ago a genocide occurred in Srebrenica. We strongly condemn it, just as we reject any desire to put it into perspective or to deny it. Not only does it damage the memory of the victims, but it also undermines the reconciliation process. That is why I appeal to the political leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina and those in the region to lead by example and help society to recognize and accept this difficult past so that their country can move forward. As for us, we must do everything we can to ensure that such events do not happen again and show our support for the integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Western Balkans into the Union.

Poverty and the burning of war have laid the foundations of today's European Union, united in peace, equality, solidarity, democracy, tolerance, respect for human rights. (Short interruption, repetition of speech from the beginning.) Reconciliation must begin where it hurts the most. I believe that the painful memory of the genocide, the massacre of more than 8,000 Bošnjaks 20 years ago in Srebrenica, is that persecution and agony are an opportunity for reconciliation. On the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, former German Chancellor Schroeder said: \"The temptation to forget is extraordinary, but we will not succumb to this temptation.\" Together, we must pay tribute to all the victims of the Srebrenica massacre and the wars on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. There will be no freedom, justice and human dignity if we forget or turn a blind eye to crimes. Srebrenica must serve as a reminder that such horrific crimes must not happen again. More than 1,000 people are still missing today. On Saturday, we will pay our respects in Srebrenica in their memory. I welcome the joint resolution in which we will vote in this House today. Regional cooperation and the convergence of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Union is the best way of reconciliation and overcoming hatred and division. I regret that the resolution was not adopted yesterday by the United Nations Security Council. In discussions about history, we must go beyond political boundaries.

We are focused on the sacrifices and suffering of their families, but I would like us to take advantage of this sad anniversary and to remind us of the no less sad role of the international community in this terrible bloodshed.  For almost four years, they shared two of the biggest tragedies that marked the war in the former Yugoslavia: Vukovar and Srebrenica. But unfortunately, that time was not enough for images to the ground of ruined Vukovar and information about the mass liquidations of civilians and disarmed Croatian defenders and the existence of camps for Croats on Serbian soil that opened their eyes to the free world about the true character of Serbian aggression against neighbouring states. As a result of the inertia of the international community, the worst that could have happened happened – Srebrenica.

The motive for the crime is that someone is a member of another nation or other faith. That is why we must be grateful to European fathers for living in values that unite us in diversity. Politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina should also accept this. It is time to stop the divisions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is time to understand that Europe wants you in its arms, and therefore it is time for everyone to bow down in Bosnia and Herzegovina. To bow to the victims and to bow to all those who perished and to the families who are still suffering today. All sides in Bosnia and Herzegovina committed war crimes, committing atrocities. Unfortunately, so are members of my people. That's why we need to tell the truth, and we should be brave enough to accept such a truth.  Srebrenica remains a symbol of the suffering and tragedies of all the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and that is why I believe we should mark this day permanently. This should be the anniversary when all those sufferings that took place in the former Yugoslavia and elsewhere in the world will be truly commemorated. Each of us has to question ourselves whether he could have done something, if he could have prevented anything. That is why, unfortunately, I must note that the international community completely failed to do what we all expected at the time, which is to prevent the massacre that took place in Srebrenica. We have to punish the criminals to the end, and that's why I expect The Hague tribunal to do its job to the end. I'm sorry the United Nations didn't have the courage to pass a resolution because we expected it to pass a resolution. That is why it is good that we have a common resolution here today, but it is also good that Vucic decided to go to Srebrenica.

A businessman from Tuzla who was released in The Hague in 2006 because witnesses were either murdered or disappeared or did not have the courage to speak. So he was released for lack of evidence.

Madam President, days of remembrance such as srebrenica are intended to remind and teach younger generations the extent of human atrocities that feed mainly on extremism, to exemplify and act as a deterrent. Unfortunately, however, such heinous crimes are now being committed by the jihadist killers of Al Qaeda, Boko Haram and the Islamic State.  But Srebrenica was not a random event. It was the result of the blunt intervention of the Americans and Germans, who wanted the dissolution of the united Yugoslavia for geopolitical self-interest. It was a criminal attack on a sovereign state made up of Slavic ethnic groups.  The bad results of this policy are seen to date: in Bosnia and Herzegovina the three different ethnicities that hate each other, in Kosovo, where there has been violent displacement of Serbs and illegal settlement by Albanians, in FYLOM, a state of a patchwork of ethnicities with dreams of stealing the Greek name of Macedonia.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I am taking the place today of my colleague Herranz García, who cannot be here and whom I would like to thank, of course, for her work on this dossier. The report concerns the European Commission's proposal to recast 3 regulations: No 3954 of 1987, which sets maximum permissible levels of contamination for foodstuffs and feedingstuffs following a nuclear accident or in any other case of radiological emergency; Regulation No 944 of 1989 setting maximum permissible levels of contamination of secondary foodstuffs following a nuclear or other emergency accident and Regulation No 770 of 1990, which also lays down the maximum levels permitted in food for animals contaminated as a result of nuclear accidents or in the event of a radiation emergency. We believe it is important for the European Union to have up-to-date legal instruments, which contain decision-making procedures that are agile and adapted to all circumstances, in order to deal with situations such as those experienced after the Chernobyl accident or the Fukushima accident. The legal basis of the 2010 proposal only required consultation of the European Parliament. In its explanatory statement, the Commission acknowledges that, taking into account the development of primary Community law on food safety and the need to ensure the consistency of all legislative measures concerning the conditions for imports of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs from third countries affected by a nuclear accident or radiological emergency, the measures which have been drawn up in the post-Chernobyl context will have to be brought into line with the system of implementing powers and procedures defined in the in this Regulation. This could also lead, if necessary, to a change in the legal basis. The rapporteur, Mrs Herranz, therefore proposes an amendment to the legal basis of the regulation, which gives Parliament the power of codecision. Food safety is the ultimate objective of the European Commission's proposal and the regulation must reflect the evolution of Community law, all the more so after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. The proposal sets out in its annexes the maximum permissible levels in the event of an accident or radioactive emergency, which were confirmed in 2012 by a group of experts set up under the Commission's Euratom Treaty. In the event of an accident or radiological emergency, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act to make the maximum permitted levels of radioactive waste in food applicable. The Commission will therefore have great flexibility to adapt, if necessary, the values set out in the annexes if circumstances so require. According to the new comitology, for the first time the Commission will have to be assisted by the section of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed, toxicological safety of the food chain dealing with radioactive contamination. The author of the draft report considers that the use of implementing acts to deal with critical situations arising from a nuclear accident is the most appropriate way of acting quickly. Where the immediacy of the action is essential to ensure consumer safety, the Commission shall provide for a specific emergency procedure. With regard to implementing acts adopted in the event of an accident, the draft report provides for the possibility that they may be reviewed as often as necessary to reflect the development of contamination. The text proposed by the Commission must be supplemented by the introduction of certain procedures for general principles of food law in order to introduce, among other things, an early warning system that allows for an agile exchange of information. In the light of this, I naturally ask you to support Mrs Herranz García's report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 27, "date": "2015-07-09.json", "name": "Günther Oettinger", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Mr. The Commission. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. I am today representing my colleague and friend, Commissioner Arias Caete, who, for compelling reasons – the annual ACER conference is taking place in Ljubljana – cannot be in Strasbourg. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Esther Herranz Garcia, and your colleague Giovanni La Via for a positive, comprehensive, knowledgeable and balanced report. Today's proposal aims to update or adapt the current regulation establishing maximum levels of radioactivity in food and feed in the event of a nuclear accident or radiological emergency. Serious accidents such as those at Chernobyl or Fukushima cannot be completely ruled out in any technical effort to improve the safety of nuclear installations as much as possible.  It is therefore important that clear and efficient procedures are put in place at EU level and that further development is developed in order to set maximum levels of radioactivity in food and feed for the European market in the event of a nuclear accident.  Procedures must be in line with the new rules governing the exercise of implementing powers by the Commission. However, they must also allow the Commission to react quickly if it is informed that the maximum levels in food and feed could or are even exceeded.  The Council has already set these maximum levels after the Chernobyl accident. In the meantime, however, they have been reviewed several times by scientific experts. In the interests of the highest level of protection of the EU population, the Commission has proposed a recast of the existing legislation, firstly, to consolidate the existing regulations, secondly, to adopt the new system of comitology procedures in order to ensure that the maximum levels are set in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon and, thirdly, to introduce more flexible procedures that allow targeted responses to all nuclear accidents or radiological emergencies. The Mranz Garcia report lists constructive changes aimed at greater flexibility if, in the interests of targeted responses to nuclear accidents, lower than those set out in the annexed regulation must be applied.  In the light of the experience gained in connection with the Fukushima accident, this aspect was raised and discussed during the negotiations in the Council. Apart from that, the Commission also believes that the proposal must clarify the relationship between the proposed Euratom Regulation and the existing food safety legislation on the basis of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Commission can support some aspects, but not all, of the amendments. Firstly, we cannot support the change in the legal basis proposed here. The Commission's proposal is based on the Euratom Treaty as a Lex specialis. The Euratom Treaty is the legal basis for all acts to be repealed by the proposed regulation. The Court of Justice of the European Union recently delivered its judgment on the Drinking Water Directive and confirmed our legal view that Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty is the correct and only legal basis. Another legal basis – in particular the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Treaty basis there – instead of the Euratom Treaty, is not acceptable to us. The request that there be a report to the European Parliament on the review of the maximum levels of radioactivity in order to take due account of the current scientific progress achieved worldwide must be answered as follows: this review of the basic standards is indeed a common practice. Once the international panel of scientific experts – the International Commission on Radiation Protection ICRP – has presented a new list of dose coefficients for ingestion, in three to five years, for example, the Commission will ask the expert group for its opinion on the validity of the current maximum levels and, on the basis of this opinion, will decide whether to revise the Regulation. We are happy to come back to that. With regard to the proposal to include tritium and C14 in the list of radionuclides, the expert group has already stated that the maximum values for this nuclide may be ten times higher than for cesium 137, for example. Furthermore, taking into account such a type of contamination does not normally make any practical sense. However, if an event were to occur, for example with tritium in a fusion reactor, it would set maximum values by the Commission on an ad hoc basis by implementing regulation in accordance with the comitology procedure. We will also pay attention to this. Your report says that the maximum levels should be set in such a way as to protect the most vulnerable groups of the population – children, people working in agriculture.  I would like to point out that the Commission's proposal specifically provides for maximum values for children. However, we believe that the maximum levels of radioactivity for the population in the EU as a whole should be set.  It would make little sense to regulate the food market in the EU on the basis of the situation of a minority of people who, for example, farm subsistence farming. For these categories of people, the Commission may, on the basis of current legislation, adopt specific recommendations addressed to the Member States concerned, as has already been done after the Chernobyl accident – at that time for people who wished to eat large quantities of wild mushrooms and berries or game in certain regions particularly affected by persistent contamination with radioactive cesium.  Overall, we thank you for your expert report. He supports our work and we are happy to continue with the appropriate steps.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 28, "date": "2015-07-09.json", "name": "Giovanni La Via", "mepid": "96816", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, we must not Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, we have heard from your speech a firm defence of the Commission's position and proposal on the legal basis.

However, the prevailing position has been that, as the European Commission has also envisaged in its texts, a possible revision of the legal basis, a new legal basis that takes account of the fact that, with codecision, food issues, such as the one we are talking about, are obviously the subject of the ordinary legislative procedure and therefore subject to codecision with the full involvement of Parliament. Without prejudice, therefore, to the diversity of position, which will then be the subject of negotiations in the future and after the vote, regardless of the outcome of the vote in this House today, I wanted to return to the issue of the level of radioactivity provided for in the annexes. This too has been the subject of extensive discussion between the political groups, with different positions on certain issues, but I particularly wanted to point out that the final vote in the ENVI Committee was based on a sound precautionary principle, because, as provided for in the values indicated by the FAO, as provided for in the values of the World Health Organisation, we have adhered to values that are one tenth of the maximum values tolerated.

We believe that the Commission proposal is correctly based on the legal basis of Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty.

Among the shadows during the discussions, I heard nothing to convince me that the safety of citizens would be improved by the involvement of Parliament in detailed scrutiny, substance by substance. Indeed, during much of the debate and particularly in the detail of many of the recitals which were decided upon, it became absolutely clear to me that many of my colleagues were motivated by a philosophical belief in the danger of nuclear energy, as opposed to any particular regard to this proposal.

But when we come to physical exact details such as the level of radioactive content, the levels in food and feed, in this case, then it is clear that it is experts with scientific backgrounds who have to make decisions that are proof-based. They're the ones who have to make the detailed decisions. So we will vote for a great deal, but we do not want to agree to the change in the law.

As shadow rapporteur and in order to promote legislation, in our view, more appropriate and up-to-date we contacted a number of experts in this field, experts who quickly stressed that the levels and guarantees proposed in the food security report were not sufficient. Hence the proposed amendments, in line with the Codex Alimentarius, revised in 2013, and where specific criteria for radionuclides in food are proposed, criteria that are more restrictive and that propose to change the levels established in case of emergency. It is also proposed that other radioactive isotopes which are not included in Annex I be included. However, these proposals were left out, because it was not accepted that the maximum levels of radioactive contamination allowed were questioned. At the meeting with the shadow rapporteurs, it was agreed to hold a meeting with experts, but that meeting never came.

I would like to go back to the terms of the report. I think he was sloppy. What for? Because there was only one meeting of the shadow rapporteurs. As my colleague said, there must have been one with the Experts at Euratom, but it was cancelled because these experts were not available. You must also know one thing: when we asked the Commission for the names of the experts and their links of interest, it refused to give them to us. This is the first time this has happened! In all health agencies, we have the names of the experts. And then we're told, \"Ah, but these great experts are going to set the standards for food contamination.\" However, when we had this file assessed - the report of these famous invisible experts - we realized that it contained at least fifteen errors!

If there is an accident, all food (water, milk, etc.) will be contaminated.

We cannot accept the proposed standards. That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to vote for Article 56, which will lower the standards by a factor of 10.

The proposed levels of radioactivity are identical to those of 1987, after the Chernobyl disaster. The limits proposed by the Commission are calculated for an accident occurring more than 1,000 kilometres from Europe's borders. This assumption allowed experts to bet on a low contamination rate: 10%. However, this rate would be much higher if the accident occurred in the very heart of Europe. The protection of populations is therefore not assured. This protection is even paltry when compared to that applied in Japan. In this country, the limits of radioactivity in food are 8 to 20 times lower than ours. It is this example that we must follow in order to better protect our people. After all, if you want to increase your powers, you have to accept the duties that go with it. For our part, there are only two possible options. Either the European institutions set standards that really ensure our food security, like Japan, or they refuse to do so and, in this case, the Member States must be able to do so for them, under Article 36 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

For years and decades, these effects of radiation have been felt, and these effects have very much an impact on human health and on our environment. To date, the European Parliament has only cooperated in setting the limit values for radioactively contaminated food and feed through a consultation procedure.

The maximum levels of radioactivity would thus be set within the framework of a proper legislative procedure, that is to say, also with the cooperation of Parliament, the Council and the Commission. It is really our first task as a chamber of citizens to take care of the interests of European citizens. We in our committee do the same on a daily basis. Highest quality should be guaranteed. Accordingly, I think it is really logical that we should have a say in tried and tested cooperation on this issue, which I believe we all agree on again – with the experts from the Commission and also from Euratom. Only in this way can we ensure that the strictest maximum levels are set and that the necessary controls are carried out for imports from the regions concerned.

There are countries that are more affected, due to the development of danger, so to speak, in that country.

But the question is who will take the decisions, and I think that the role of the European Parliament in this regard must be important and decisive.  Secondly, the proposal brought here by the Commission raises many concerns. It is based on a report 1998 which takes account of a fact that we will have a possible accident a thousand kilometres away from the centre of the European Union. But here, around Strasbourg and around Brussels, there are too many nuclear power plants. What happens if we have an accident? What if we have an accident in Koslonduy? What if we have an accident at the new factory, which they want to do in Turkey, on the border with Greece? Therefore, the terms and conditions that you take into account are incorrect. The boundaries must go too low. The limits you set are too high and have nothing to do with reality.

However, this is not provided for under the Treaty, the primary law. That is why we do not currently have the opportunity to publish these names without or against their will. Sorry, I am sticking to the law. Secondly, I myself have been a Member of a Parliament in my own country of Baden-Württemberg for more than 25 years. A strong Parliament is important to me. That is why I take the debate seriously today and I will report on it to my colleague Arias Caete. We will also incorporate these proposals and these critical approaches. However, our primary law creates a clear order of competence. The decision on the technology of energy is a matter for the Member States. The decision on nuclear energy yes or no was and is a matter for our Member States. France has therefore decided to use more than 70% nuclear energy and, contrary to what its President has said, none is currently being shut down, even though this was announced for Fessenheim, for example, and the share of nuclear energy is not now being reduced, even though the reduction to 50% has been announced. Fourteen Member States have no nuclear power, 14 have nuclear power. We – The Commission, also Parliament – have to respect this, because the decision under our contract law is a matter for the Member States. According to the Euratom Treaty, which is clearly responsible for this as a Lex specialis, this also applies to today's debate, to our Commission proposal today. You are involved in this, your co-advice and participation is planned. Unfortunately, codecision is not possible. I believe that, with all our interest in the matter and also of all understanding and emotion, we should not bend paragraphs, articles and treaties, but should endeavour to amend the Treaties, but on the basis of these Treaties we should accept that Parliament is called upon to participate here and not to codecision. I can accept one final point concerning Mr Buchner: I can accept scandal. For me, this is part of a sporting debate culture. What I do not accept, even if it was performed in a charming Bavarian dialect, is to speak here of incitement to murder. I reject this in all its forms.

It is clear that the prevailing position in committee has been to change the legal basis, which means, Commissioner, a review of the route, because we are talking here about food safety, we are not talking about issues relating to atomic energy. The view of this Parliament is therefore linked to the fact that the subject of the regulatory proposal is an issue in which the characteristic feature is the characteristic of food for food or animal feed. So it is clear that, from our point of view, the issue is different. I would also like to thank all my fellow Members for the debate that has taken place, during which different positions have emerged, but I would like to stress one thing to those who have raised concerns about radioactivity levels: it is clear that the one formulated is a proposal on hypothetical grounds. It goes without saying that what we need to define precisely is the path to be taken, if necessary, to change them, in conjunction with the Commission, because it is obvious that there could be nuclear accidents next to the front door, much further away and, of course, the levels of radioactive contaminants should be different depending on the conditions of the accident.

On the one hand, it is a great step forward. It recognises that users of copyrighted works have rights – a foreign concept to the current Copyright Directive. According to the Directive, rights holders have rights and users have exceptions to those rights. These exceptions are optional to the Member States. They can simply be disabled by a contract or by technological restrictions. Circumventing those restrictions is illegal, even for legitimate purposes. So it is illegal to make a book that has a technological lock available to a blind person, but the terms of service that simply erase an exception to copyright are completely legal. The Copyright Directive, so far, protects digital locks more than it protects the people. This report calls for a clear set of European consumers’ rights. It states that copyright exceptions must not be overridden by a contract, and that you cannot charge a levy for private copying on the one hand, but then, on the other hand, use technology that makes private copying impossible. This report calls for interoperability and cross-border access, so you should be able to buy and to use works on any device or in any country. It sides with the right to education and with allowing libraries, museums and archives to do their jobs in the digital world and to make our shared cultural heritage accessible to anybody, regardless of their social status. But, at the same time, this report is also a tragically-missed opportunity. Just a year ago, thousands of Europeans participated in a public consultation on copyright, and they expressed how they come into daily conflict with a law that is unfit for the digital age. Then Commissioner Kroes recognised that copyright must be radically reformed so that it would not become irrelevant. President Juncker announced his goal to tear down national silos in copyright, and Commissioner Ansip boldly took on geo-blocking. The message was clear: now is the time to act decisively. Not from this Parliament. Parliament recognises, in the report, that 28 different copyright laws are too complicated, but still it considers our cultures to be so different that we cannot possibly agree on simple things like the fact that drawing a caricature should not require permission, a rights holder should not forbid a journalist from quoting a work in order to criticise it, or public pictures of public space should remain royalty—free. This Parliament is at its best when it is the voice of the people. It has rejected the ACTA Treaty because the people we represent embrace the internet as an integral part of their reality. With copyright, you have seen tens of thousands of your young people on the streets opposing ACTA and holding signs saying ‘this video is not available in your country’. You have had thousands of responses to the consultation on copyright asking for more Europe in copyright law. You have had half a million petitioners demanding freedom of panorama. Now you have the chance to take up this call and to update copyright law to the digital age. Personally, I wonder if this report, as it stands, is really the best that we can do if this is what European leadership looks like. I also hope that you, my colleagues, will wonder why people considered it necessary to form a party that is solely based on reforming copyright, to give it the ridiculous name of the Pirate Party and to elect me here to the European Parliament to tell you that copyright reform is urgently needed. I am hoping that, when the reform from the Commission comes, my colleagues will be bolder in demanding European copyright and common rules for everybody. I also hope that we can make sure that Parliament is not just following the Commission proposal but is also a decisive player in making sure that copyright is fit for the digital age and understandable to ordinary people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 56, "date": "2015-07-09.json", "name": "Günther Oettinger", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Mr. The Commission. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Yes, the Commission has formulated a priority, namely to adapt copyright at European level to the digital age, in other words to modernise it and harmonise it and to create as much European rules as possible for consumers, for authors in the European digital single market. I would like to thank Mr Reda, but also many colleagues here in Parliament, for an intensive discussion of this in retrospect, but also with outlook. We will include your report in the next final steps in drawing up a legislative proposal from the Commission. Ladies and gentlemen! There are several objectives at stake here. It is a question of taking up digital technologies and, building on this, reviewing and modernising our existing copyright package at European level. Secondly, it is a question of a fair balance, some of which is based on different interests. We see the interest expressed by Mrs Reda in our information society, our citizens, our users, our consumers – on the one hand. That is why we want access to content to be maintained or created as far as possible across borders. A European market without national territorial borders must be the principle and portability – the right to take away without borders – in parallel. On the other hand, we are strongly called upon to stabilise Europe's creative industries and their entrepreneurial career prospects. I am not saying to preserve, but to restabilise. It is about our cultural heritage, but also about our cultural future. If you take authors, screenwriters, writers, film directors, journalists who research and comment, composers, musicians and singers as examples as representatives of our cultural heritage, but also of our creative industries, who have the future, then if one then takes between the user in the information society and the author still publishers, transporters, formaturtes, distributors of corresponding content, then the balance is not easy to find. However, this is our aim, and our legislative proposal will serve this purpose. The principle is: no borders within Europe, as much internal market as meaningful and possible. But principles do not exclude exceptions and/or transitional periods. If we take European film, Europe's film industry would only have an internal market and the principle of territoriality would be gone overnight, not viable. European film, which has been strongly promoted in recent decades, with outstanding roots in France, Italy, but also in new Member States, is built on our linguistic areas and built on the national film funding it calls for. And if it were exposed to a European market overnight, Hollywood, Bollywood, Google, and Amazon would sweep away this European film. This cannot be in the interests of our often cultural European society. That is why we will be making proposals on how, knowing the objective of the internal market, by creating portability, we can nevertheless enshrine territoriality in our proposal. I could mention a second exception: the sports sector. Both football and sports such as basketball, volleyball, tennis and others are also built on territoriality in their business model. This cannot be changed, at least overnight, perhaps in transition, and developed. But in one fell swoop, the implementation of the principle would certainly be a blow to our sports federations and our athletes in the European Union. Principles and exceptions will be the guiding principle of our proposal. The key word is exceptions in the opposite sense: if education, research and science are taken seriously, we will also have to create opportunities for access, unlimited or even free access to content in the digital world. Here we are still examining whether research carried out under public law, or industrial research, should be covered by this exemption of free access at no cost. In recent weeks, freedom of panorama has played a major role. There is certainly an objective interest behind this, but also a bit of marketing. Allow me to make a clear statement: the Commission does not intend to restrict freedom of panorama. For me, the following principle applies: what one can see with one's eye as a citizen in public places and streets in Europe should also be allowed to be photographed with the camera. I make no distinction between the eye and the storage of the eye by camera and pictures. That is why some of the excitement here was unnecessary, at least as far as the Commission is concerned. We do not encint: on this issue, some proposals from Parliament and the Technical Committee. We believe that the existing basis that a free Europe should also be given free electronic photographs of European cities, buildings and monuments must not be restricted. We will continue to make use of this principle in the future. That is why I want to give a warning here, at least as far as the Commission is concerned. There are no plans for any restriction on our part.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 57, "date": "2015-07-09.json", "name": "José Blanco López", "mepid": "125044", "text": "   Drafts member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. – Madam President, during the very hardest part of the crisis, European cultural industries have continued to create jobs.

We all want to develop cultural industries in the new digital environment, harness their potential to generate new jobs, drive innovative industries. But let no one consider the copyright reform announced to us by the Commissioner as a confrontation between authors and users, in which some must lose for others to win. Protecting authors is protecting everyone, because it is protecting cultural creation, it is protecting content. If we don't, we'll all lose.

This is the challenge if we want to make our digital single market work effectively. So the challenge is there, and we will meet it. The key points I wanted to raise are on e-book access, the ratification of the Marrakesh Treaty, and text and data mining. There are still too many barriers to libraries being able to provide books in electronic format, and I hope that we will see concrete proposals from the Commission later this year to try to address some of these problematic issues. Publishers and libraries have been working together to seek solutions, and these discussions must continue. Leading on from this, the ratification of the Marrakesh Treaty is no further forward than when we last discussed this in this House. The book famine, which visually impaired and blind people still face, is a clear breach of human rights. Let us remind ourselves that less than 5% of the books published in Europe are available in a format that is accessible. I urge Member States to take action and ratify this treaty. Finally, on text and data mining, which the Commissioner just touched upon in his speech: currently in the UK, as you know, we have got an exemption for non-commercial purposes under the current rules. The impact this is having on research is phenomenal. What would have taken years can now literally take hours, and for scientific discoveries and historical analysis the benefits are endless.

This report seeks to make copyright work in both the analogue as well as the digital world by giving users and creators the full possibility of drawing on the potential of both these worlds. It emphasises the importance of portability of content across borders, further remuneration for creators, respect for contractual freedom, market—driven solutions that reflect the ever—changing expectations of users, and the provision of solutions which are evidence-based. With this report, Parliament continues to show its belief in creators, as well as its aspirations to continue to make avenues available to make European cultural and creative works more accessible, by seizing the opportunities that the digital age provides.

Ms Reda’s report, as we all know, reviewed the 2001 Information Society Directive and as such, or perhaps not as such, it has achieved some notoriety. For an own-initiative report of this kind it has certainly received more attention than perhaps we would have expected. But the report, as a result of that, is both wide-ranging and forward-looking. We had lengthy negotiations amongst all the political groups in the Committee on Legal Affairs, and I believe – and I think my colleagues also believe – that we did eventually achieve a fair balance between the competing interest groups – between consumers and creators. And it is not either consumers or creators: both need to be taken into consideration and both need to be in the reforms that eventually come forward for copyright. But my focus, and I believe the focus of the Socialist and Democrat Group, has always been on creators – to give creators fair remuneration, to make sure that they are adequately paid. Because if they are not, we will not have music as we know it, we will not have much in the way of television and radio, and we will have very few new books. This is really a matter for our culture across the European Union, and we need to see it in that light. That is why I welcome very much what the Commissioner said earlier. I do not believe, as Ms Reda said, that we have missed an opportunity. I think what this report, as amended by the committee, does is to put forward constructive proposals which I very much hope the Commission will take on board.

I am therefore in line with what Ms Comodini and Mrs Honeyball have said, among others, which I thank publicly.  The result is satisfactory and the text is balanced. This report, which will be voted on today, is a far cry from the original text, which would have had the effect of reducing copyright without actually defending the consumer. What is a consumer defence in which the diversity of cultures in the 28 member countries would not have real legal protection to last? I support all the interesting avenues that raise the future of copyright and I consider that we are going back quite far, because the level of protection of creators necessary for innovation and especially for the powerful European cultural industry has been maintained. I am therefore pleased that the influence of economic competitiveness, on the one hand, and the singularity of cultural Europe, on the other, have been recognised and even clearly protected.  I am pleased that this report has also taken a first step towards the accountability of hosts, a sensitive subject, because these platforms cannot continue to tell us that they are just motorways. Their responsibility is increasingly high. We can see it now with another area, which is cultural freedom, security to be protected, and even the fight against financial crime. It is time for the Commission and our Parliament to look at what I call the three responsibilities rule, which will be discussed, Commissioner, when you return in December.

Since the adoption of the Information Society Directive in 2001, technology development, digitisation and the development of social networks have been constantly taking place. We can conclude that technology is ahead of the law. Personally, however, I have convinced myself that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to find a consensus on how to respond. This is due to the long-term existence of cultural and legal traditions in the copyright of individual Member States. Today we are evaluating the implementation of the Information Society Directive. The rapporteur originally came up with an ambitious proposal for greater harmonisation. However, our faction is concerned that such proposals would favour solutions based on the functioning of the invisible hand of the market and would bring additional benefits to large companies such as Google. After several months of intensive work, as shadow rapporteur for our faction, I have come to the conclusion that we are not yet ready to create a truly unified European copyright law to replace national copyright in the Member States. This is perhaps best evidenced by the heated debate on the so-called freedom of panorama, which is regulated differently in different Member States. Finally, after complex negotiations, we managed to formulate a compromise proposal across the political spectrum, which represents a balanced adjustment between the protection of authors and their remuneration, as well as the protection of users and citizens' rights.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 65, "date": "2015-07-09.json", "name": "Max Andersson", "mepid": "124994", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, my first computer had 3 583 bytes free – not kilobytes, bytes.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that good intentions do not necessarily lead to good political measures or good legislation. Rapporteur Reda was no doubt driven by a great deal of goodwill and generosity in her person when she tackled this thorny copyright issue. But she has clearly forgotten some principles that are urgently needed.  Defending culture also means defending copyright, which is both the fair remuneration of artistic creation and the protection of the moral right of artists. I regret that this moral right has never been mentioned throughout this report, it is the moral right of artists that determines everything else. The creator must be able to ensure that his work is not devalued or distorted artistically, politically or ideologically. However, the panorama exception, which the rapporteur defends at all costs, opens a gap in the protection of this economic and moral right. And if authors are derpowered to control the exploitation of their work, they no longer have any respect for their person. Contrary to the crazy rumors circulating on the internet, this control does not hinder the possibility for everyone to photograph public works. It only offers the indispensable guarantee that the work will not be exploited for obscene, political or ideological purposes by wacky or malicious people.

I have received such information from the media that this is a report that introduces copyright reform.

I thank the Commissioner for his initial comments on this subject.  I have also received information from the media that this is a panoramic law, clarifying that this is a document that will introduce a provision that any citizen who wants to take a picture of himself, for example, against the background of the Colosseum, will have to pay for it: it is not known how much and do not know to whom. I understand that everyone wants to raise their political capital where possible, but above all we owe reliable, clear information to our citizens.

You have even felt the need to emphatically reaffirm that the right to private property is the foundation of modern society.

The call for the introduction of the responsibility of digital intermediaries and service providers, as well as robust enforcement, which is likely to be, first of all anachronistic, given its frequent ineffectiveness, as well as dangerous for fundamental rights, is unacceptable.  The rights of authors are then mentioned instrumentally to justify the maintenance of pension positions on the market, which no longer make sense given the opportunities offered by new technologies.

I am very grateful for your dedicated speeches, which prove your expertise and which show that the copyright issues are in good hands with you. I note that we see a large majority here among Members who encourage us. It is time to modernise copyright. There was hardly a speech that said: leave your fingers off, do not take action. I believe that the option of not making a proposal would be the worst option. Secondly, we want to take account of technological development and market change in our copyright package and the interests of citizens and consumers.  Thirdly, we are trying to achieve a balanced proposal. The balance is crucial – the balance, which was also depicted in your speeches, between the legitimate interests of those who create spiritual works, who writes, who writes, who composes, who has contributed his time and competences for intellectual work, and, on the other hand, a wide access, preferably no limit or, if possible, narrow limits that are necessary. If we want to deviate from the principle of portability and open access throughout Europe, we must provide evidence for this – and i too have to show that this is necessary in the interests of authorship. I mentioned the film and sports sectors for this. We have received suggestions that we should analyse platforms in order to decide whether to include new providers in our regulatory framework. That is another way of doing this. Preventing piracy as best we can is our goal.  The subject of freedom of panorama took up a relatively wide space – it seems to me that it is a pure phantom. That is why we should not have phantom debates. Restricting freedom of panorama was not the Commission's idea. This was apparently a misunderstood idea in a parliamentary technical committee, but no one was represented today. That is why we could also say to the public here: it was a misunderstanding in the technical committee, it was never the will of a number of Members.  We do not want to restrict the existing rules.

I would particularly like to thank my colleagues in the shadow rapporteurs, who are supporting us with secretariats, colleagues, including the Executive Director of the European Fund for Democracy, representatives of the European External Action Service and the European Commission. First of all, I thank the NGO sector, which has very much supported us in assessing and looking at the work of the EED so far. What is the European Fund? It is a foundation established in 2012 under Belgian law by the Union and the Member States, also with the participation of other countries outside the European Union. The Polish Presidency took the initiative of setting up this fund in 2011. Since then, 4 have passed and the fund itself has been in place for 2 years. At the heart of the initiative is the fact that the classic instruments for promoting democracy have not worked, for example, during the Arab Spring or in the events that took place east of the European Union, in neighbouring countries. Furthermore, the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, as well as the experience of the peaceful transformation of the Member States from Central and Eastern Europe, including the experience of Polish Solidarity, also help us in this regard. The Fund aims to react more quickly, more flexibly than through classical instruments. It is also intended to support those who have not yet been supported. The Fund emphasises the involvement of actors on the ground, in countries that are going through this process of change, transformation. It has so far supported more than 186 initiatives in virtually all of the European Union's neighbourhood countries, both the Eastern Partnership and the Union for the Mediterranean. It is worth quoting one of the beneficiaries who said this: after the revolution, everyone disappeared. The EED brings with it a breath of freshness and hope, providing political and moral support not only to old well-established organizations, but also to new actors – these are the words of one of the activists from Egypt. The EED-backed parties are also undergoing positive checks in democratic elections over time – as was the case with Euromaidan activists in Ukraine. They are currently members of the Wierchowna Council. Of particular note is the ability of the EED to finance bridging, the so-called bridging, that is to say, financing, which persists between the end of one and the start of the second funding from the European Union, for example from the EDHR Fund. These procedures are more complex, longer, and therefore often this period of funding interruption proves difficult for those who are supported. Therefore, in such cases, bridging funding is very important. As part of the work on the evaluation report, we have held a number of debates and hearings so far to find out how the European Endocracies for Democracy are assessed. Among other things, we met with NGOs who reported on how they used the EED, what their experiences are. We have also conducted a number of consultations, both with representatives of the EED and with the cooperating institutions, the European External Action Service and the Commission. The report assessed the two-year action so far and made a number of recommendations. The key conclusions are that the EED is meeting the tasks set out in the Statute and, most importantly, in the European Parliament's recommendations of 29 March 2012 on the establishment of the EED. It brings important added value to the instruments available to the European Union for democracy in the world. At the same time, we call for the EED to be guaranteed sufficient and stable in the long term, both from the Member States of the Union and from the Commission itself. It made a positive decision as the fund received another three-year funding.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 124, "date": "2015-07-09.json", "name": "Jiří Pospíšil (PPE).", "mepid": "125706", "text": "   – Madam President, I would like to thank very much the author of this report.

In the 1990s I was in various youth organisations and I am aware that if it were not for the money from foundations that worked in Western Europe, we would hardly be able to do educational projects and conferences, we would hardly be able to get young people, the younger generation into Czech politics. I therefore consider this to be terribly important, it is not simply a distribution of money. It is our moral duty to help, especially the countries of the former Soviet Union, the countries of the Middle East, countries where democracy is still not strongly entrenched.

We have a special report from our Parliament in March 2013 that says that the troika is violating human rights in Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Cyprus. I didn't see any Fund activity about it!

It is very good to see that there is broad support across the plenary for the important work that the EED does and that the partnership we have with Parliament is very important: the work Members do on the Board and the way they take an active role in debating and spreading the work of the EED. I share the view expressed in the report that the Endowment plays a very important role by supporting democracy in our neighbourhood, and it has been a useful complement to the existing EU instruments. The EED has been proved, as you say in your evaluation, to be able to provide fast and flexible support in restrictive and repressive environments where often the EU cannot act efficiently to reach human rights defenders. The EED can also quickly deliver emergency funding and provide small grants as well as core and bridging funding to new democratic actors with limited capacity to apply for larger EU grants. I also believe that, whilst coordination and complementarity is key, the EED must remain independent and enjoy the latitude which is necessary to address the most challenging circumstances. In the report you make a number of suggestions regarding the ENP review. Let me assure you that the EED has been closely involved in discussions around the review of the neighbourhood policy and it has been given the opportunity to submit very concrete and pertinent recommendations based on feedback from the grantees. This has greatly contributed to ensuring that civil society in our neighbourhood has followed, and has been able to feed into, that debate. Taking into account the positive results of the EED evaluation and also the recommendation of your report to the European External Action Service and the Commission, we remain fully committed to supporting the work. Let me give you the good news that the Commission has just adopted a decision to grant an additional EUR 12 million for the next two years, 2016 to 2018. That is a considerable increase compared with the previous grant. Let me conclude by saying that it is important that the EED focuses on being complementary to the other instruments and tools to fund beneficiaries that are not eligible for other EU funding. I am very pleased with the pragmatic and very operational approach adopted by the EED and its focus on demand—driven assistance. We will continue to disseminate information about the EED among our staff and to use it to complement the support offered through the EU instrument.

Undoubtedly, at the outset, both sides can benefit from the mobilisation of all previously unused reserves. Over time, however, the American side may become the dominant party. This is due to its competitive advantage – lower energy and labour costs, as well as the fact that numerous raw materials are available. Looking far-reachingly at global markets, it is clear that the EU can become a valuable partner for the US in its activities in the Far East markets, including China, the largest US creditor.

It can improve its global competitiveness by opening a free trade area with the Eurasian Free Trade Area at the same time as TTIP.

It is estimated that the TTIP agreement will increase trade in EU countries by up to EUR 122 billion per year and increase European employment in millions of jobs. This growth would be necessary for Europe. It is particularly important to dismantle trade restrictive standards and barriers, then to facilitate access to the US market for European products and services.  Thank you to all the negotiators for the common vision that has now been found among the groups as a follow-up to the free trade negotiations. This strong support from the European Parliament will enable The Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström and the other negotiators to take the negotiations forward.  Although an agreement on free trade is to be reached, the negotiations must not compromise on the level of food safety and environmental standards that are important to Europe.

The European Union has a duty to support Macedonia in achieving as much compatibility with European rules as possible, with a view to its accession, in the not too distant future, to its structures. Ensuring this perspective is likely to contribute to the normalisation of the current volatile political situation and to the resumption of progress towards strengthening national democratic institutions. The adoption of the current Protocol to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is only a first step towards a positive development of this country on the path of European integration.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 552, "date": "2015-07-09.json", "name": "Marc Tarabella (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "29579", "text": "  In writing.

Of course, each of these countries has its own peculiarities, stemming from recent developments.  Serbia has experienced dramatic moments over the past two decades, which have undoubtedly affected the morale of its citizens, generating attitudes against Western values that are hard to erase in the short and medium term. Despite these problems, Serbia has seen an upward trend in recent years both politically and economically that has enabled it to gain candidate status for EU integration.  In the current international political context, however, Serbia has become the site of intense geopolitical rivalries between European structures and those promoted by Russia.

This Directive should also cover large companies and large groups of companies, whose shares are not listed on a regulated market, as their business also has a major impact. Although they do not own corporations, which are separate legal entities that are not subject to their full control, shareholders play an essential role in managing them.  The financial crisis showed that in many cases shareholders supported management in over-taking short-term risk. A higher level of shareholder participation in corporate governance of companies is one leverage that can improve the financial and non-financial performance of these companies. However, as shareholder rights are not the only long-term factor to be taken into account in corporate governance, they should be accompanied by additional measures to ensure a higher level of participation of all stakeholders, in particular employees, local authorities and civil society.

Within the Commission's broader efforts to modernise the legal framework in relation to European company law, regulation of issues such as shareholder participation in corporate governance, management remuneration policy and distribution of relevant information between company and shareholders has a special place. As long-term shareholding has a positive impact on the stability of companies, disincentives to excess risk and reducing excessive focus on short-term returns, establishing and improving mechanisms that encourage it are in the interest of economic development. It therefore appears that long-term shareholding can contribute to achieving more optimal company performance, while recognising significant differences in the legal frameworks of the different Member States. Adequate participation of all stakeholders, primarily employees, can also increase the quality of company management. The existence of a high level of transparency, including the possibility of establishing shareholder identity and direct communication by listed companies, is a prerequisite for an effective system of shareholding.

I welcome the fact that large companies will thus have to provide the public with information about the number of employees, the size of turnover, profits, subsidies, but mainly the tax paid on profits or losses. I believe that it is this procedure that will help prevent cases like Luxleaks and contribute to a fair distribution of wealth in Europe.

I opposed the provisions on submitting the remuneration policy to a vote and imposing a set ratio between Directors’ pay and employees’ salaries.

But for our industries, this solution is akin to creating a new indirect tax. And this will be all the more damaging to them if their non-European competitors are not subject to it.

I had advocated an entry into force in 2021 to give the industry time to get used to the idea that licences frozen during the last term of office should not be cancelled but placed on the reserve as soon as it was put in place. I also defended the idea of an innovation fund, which was included in the final agreement for up to 50 million permits before the launch of a new fund in 2021. Finally, the question of the competitiveness of European companies in the globalised market and carbon leakage have been raised and will be addressed in the revision of the ETS Directive before the end of 2015.

Quotas are currently very cheap because demand for them has decreased, including because of the economic crisis. However, there has been no movement on the supply side.

The main current of the sustainable development movement is based on the deep conviction that, with the right technological innovations, economic growth and environmental protection can be complementary rather than conflicting; however, this view ignores, misrepresents or underestimates the biophysical limits to human production and consumption traced by system dynamics and thermodynamics. Finally, it should be noted that a constant process of efficiency in the use of resources thanks to innovation has been in place since the beginning of the Modern Age at least, but that this relative decoupling has not prevented the neutralisation of the overall growth in the production and consumption of raw materials; there is a risk that a sharp increase in relative decoupling could, by virtue of the Jevons paradox, lead, on the contrary, to an intensification of the exploitation of raw materials, made less expensive by the acceleration of the movement of capital brought about by the reduction in the unit cost of production obtained thanks to the most efficient technologies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2376, "date": "2015-07-09.json", "name": "Cristian-Silviu Bușoi (PPE)", "mepid": "38420", "text": "  in writing. \\u2012 Europe depends on imported resources more than any other region in the world, and a transaction towards a circular economy would reduce this level of dependence on raw materials resources and costs.

There are around 600 million tonnes of waste in Europe with the potential for reuse, and if we want to build an economic system based on sustainable growth and efficient use of resources, we must necessarily encourage the reuse and recycling of products.

Its objective is to produce goods and services while severely limiting the consumption and waste of raw materials, and non-renewable energy sources.  However, this definition and economic model are the exact opposite of the economic model supported by the Union. Indeed, the circular economy is based on the short circuit, on local preference and not on the importation of products crossing the planet on cargo ships.

I see the importance of investing in the circular economy in that it can be fully aligned with the Commission's agenda for jobs, growth and competitiveness and has the potential to create a situation where all stakeholders involved benefit. The role of businesses, authorities and consumers in the EU by improving resource use through better design requirements and through waste legislation prioritising the waste hierarchy could generate significant net savings estimated at €600 billion; 8% of annual turnover, while reducing total annual greenhouse gas emissions by 2-4% which would ultimately lead to a 30% increase in resource productivity by 2030.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2472, "date": "2015-07-09.json", "name": "Andrej Plenković (PPE)", "mepid": "112755", "text": "  Written. ‒ Increased demand for resources and competition have put a lot of pressure on the environment and the need to move to a circular economy that will preserve the environment, increase product efficiency and added value, contribute to new economic growth and job opportunities, and reduce waste, almost eliminating it.

Many of the resources we are now using carelessly are running out. Consumption is also increasing, especially in developing regions with young and growing populations. It is essential that existing resources be used more efficiently in the future. In Europe, raw materials account for 40% of production costs. High-tech products in particular require rare imported minerals. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Sirpa Pietikäinen, for her good work, and at the same time I encourage Vice-President Katainen to draw up a circular economy package so that we can make strong progress. At its best, the circular economy is a new model of the economy, where materials and value circulate and add value to them through services and intelligence. In my own country, Finland, it has been estimated that the circular economy could grow the economy by over EUR 2 billion per year. At European level, the circular economy would increase GDP by 1% a year.  The bioeconomy is an important part of the circular economy. It is of particular importance for achieving climate objectives. However, it should be noted that requiring cascade use in the circular economy would create many problems, as it is difficult to define waste and residues. Today's waste could be tomorrow's raw material. It is precisely the uncertainty in the regulatory environment that is currently significantly slowing down investment in Europe.  We need to take a pro-business approach. If the Ecodesign Directive is extended, it must be done in cooperation with companies.

Unlike a traditional linear economy based on a pattern: take-make-use-to-dispose, the circular economy is based on reuse, repair and recycling. The circular economy can reduce pressure on the environment, have a positive health impact and reduce Europe's dependence on raw material imports, and the European Commission estimates it could create as many as 2 million jobs by 2030. According to some research, increased energy efficiency of buildings could generate over €1 billion a year to save energy in the EU. Appropriately insulating buildings, the EU would save millions of tonnes of fossil fuels and CO2 emissions would be drastically reduced. According to some estimates, an efficient circular economy could bring between 12% and 23% savings to companies in purchasing materials.

In Belgium, in 2014, almost 30% of small businesses did not get the bank financing they were seeking.

Specifically, I agree with the call to maintain the principle of differentiation in relations with individual States, greater coordination between the ENP and activities included in the common foreign and security policy, and to support partners in implementing more and more stringent security controls in order to be able to have greater capacity to defend themselves against terrorist and criminal attacks.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3256, "date": "2015-07-09.json", "name": "Lola Sánchez Caldentey (GUE/NGL)", "mepid": "125035", "text": "  in writing.

Its board of directors is dominated by conservative and social-democratic political representatives (no member of the GUE/NGL has been accepted), including incidentally the rapporteur of the text in question.

In this case, the case of Cambodia, not a year and a half ago. More specifically, in January 2014. There seems to be an insalvable contradiction — we should consider it – between economic development, the production of prosperity and respect for human rights, the rule of law, the establishment of basic standards of social, labour regulation, etc. We are now concerned, in the case of Cambodia, with a triple legislative initiative by the Government of Cambodia which does not seem to respect at all our minimum criteria for what should be a process of participation, of social debate, precisely because it affects groups such as non-governmental organizations or trade unions, which are protagonists, which should be protagonists of these basic rights. And this happens at the same time as in the country, classic issues are repeated, in recent years, especially policies aimed, for example, at the eviction of small growers of large areas of land, usually owned by the State itself, to convert them into concessions and pre-industrial farms, etc. Or it coincides with the proliferation of small workshops, which are also protagonists of a more than dubious respect for human rights. Part of that reality, let's be clear, has to do with ourselves, with our stimuli, with our industrial demand, with our consumption habits. There is a connection between large sugarcane crops and our soft drink industry; there are among the workers of the garment workshops and our large commercial chains.

As many of you have pointed out, Cambodia does indeed have a very vibrant civil society, and many NGOs and associations are active in various areas. The Cambodian Government has for many years argued that an overarching law on associations and NGOs was necessary to provide simple and transparent regulation to the sector. We in the European Union have been following this very closely since the idea of the legislation first surfaced many years ago. The draft laws have been a recurring topic in informal and formal meetings between the EU and the Cambodian Government. Our delegation and our ambassador there are very active and have frequent contact at different levels to make sure that our views on this are crystal clear and passed on to the government. We have made clear to them that the legislation that they are planning should enable, and not limit, freedom of association and expression in Cambodia. We have pointed out that a democratic process needs to be transparent and include meaningful consultation with all relevant stakeholders. A culture of dialogue is the basis of any democracy – dialogue with the opposition, civil society and the private sector. It is only through this dialogue that the government can take into account the needs and concerns of those who are subject to the legislation, and an inclusive process enables government to enact laws that are truly in the interest of the people. The National Assembly of Cambodia has a very important role to play here, so we welcome the decision by the National Assembly to organise consultations on the draft NGO law, and some of these have actually started to take place already. We hope that the results of this will be reflected in the text of the law. It is also important to have, as some of you do, peer-to-peer contacts between European Parliament Members and Members of the Cambodian National Assembly, in order to help them strengthen the capacity to scrutinise and to improve legislation in close contact with civil society and in a spirit of dialogue. We will continue to monitor the situation and developments, because in times when civil society and trade unions often face increasing obstacles and restrictions in many countries, Cambodia has an opportunity to prove that it is truly committed to strengthening its democratic credentials.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3785, "date": "2015-07-09.json", "name": "Przewodniczący. –", "mepid": "28372", "text": "   I close the debate.

We feel that we have strong support from this plenary to continue to pay close attention to the cases of Mr Bauma and Mr Makwambala and also the other people involved. As you know – and some Members mentioned – this year 30 people were arrested at the Filimbi workshop event in Kinshasa, the youth platform to encourage young people to get involved in civic life in a peaceful and responsible way. Most of those arrested were released or deported but two participants were detained further – the two people we are talking about here today. They were held by the National Intelligence Agency for more than 40 days without charge and without access to legal assistance. Later they were transferred to the Public Prosecutor’s Office and charged with several offences. The very little information that we have has led many to conclude that the charges are disproportionate and unsubstantiated, and there is an obvious risk in this context that the charges are politically motivated. We regret that a solution can still not be found to release those activists. A parliamentary investigation found no evidence to indicate that either the leaders or the participants at the Filimbi workshop were involved in planning terrorist or violent crimes, yet the Communication Minister of the Democratic Republic of Congo said that the Filimbi leaders were planning ʽterrorist activitiesʼ and ʽviolent insurrectionʼ – and I quote him. There is no evidence backing this, so these statements are of course without substance. Naturally we will continue to follow these cases extremely closely. Two démarches have been made to the Minister of Justice and EU Member States have been observing court hearings. Both EU Member States and our EU delegation have regular contact with human rights organisations and lawyers on the cases and you can count on our continued attention. More broadly, many of you have called for human rights to be at the centre of our dialogue with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It is a country with a remarkable plurality of parties, views and aspirations, and it is vital – this year more than ever – that all political and civil actors feel free to speak their minds and to submit themselves to the public through debate and discussion. Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are essential elements in the Cotonou Agreement. These issues are also critical for the electoral cycle between now and the end of next year. The EU wants to support that process, but we need to have the right conditions to be in place in terms of budget, calendar and political climate. In both the local statements and Council conclusions the EU has expressed concerns in the narrowing of the political space, particularly since the events accompanying the revision of the electoral law at the end of January earlier this year. We have underlined the risk of any perception that justice could be instrumentalised or serve political events. We are concerned by arbitrary detentions and arrests, especially those involving intelligence services, and by unnecessary use of force, physical threats and intimidation of journalists. Where members of the security services have carried out illegal actions, the Congolese authorities should take urgent action to investigate and prosecute cases. In our responses we have drawn on the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance, which stresses the importance of a political climate free of tension, allowing for an open debate, protecting freedom of expression and the right of the opposition to ensure the independence and impartiality of justice. The EU stands ready to support the DRC in a genuine partnership. The launching of a national indicative programme of EUR 620 million stands as proof of that commitment.

It is becoming increasingly difficult for Christians in Sudan to live their faith. The fate of Pastor Michael Yat and Pastor Peter Yen Reith is painful for this persecution. I am therefore grateful that, together with my colleagues in the ECR Group, I have managed to give the initiative for this resolution. It is an appeal against the persecution of Christians. Especially for the two priests, as for any other of the approximately one hundred million persecuted Christians worldwide: religious freedom is a fundamental right. I am glad that we have heard this on several occasions today.  We, as a Europe of values, must stand up for it worldwide, and fight for it worldwide. We must not tolerate the persecution of Christians. We must not look away when people are discriminated against because they live their faith peacefully. On the part of my group, therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to stand up with us against the persecution of Christians. Stand up with us for Pastor Yat and Pastor Reith!

This is appalling, and we must certainly do everything we can to get these two eminent and wonderful pastors freed, especially as Sudan has ratified the relevant UN and African Union conventions guaranteeing religious freedom.

In this Parliament, in this House, European Muslims are free to speak of their grievances, their social expectations, and we always discuss these appeals, we always respond to them.

Both pastors had been preaching in the Evangelical and Presbyterian Church in Khartoum. They spoke out against the demolition of this church, following the dubious sale of the land on which it stands, and their arrests were carried out by the National Intelligence and Security Services of Sudan. They face seven different charges, including undermining the constitutional system and espionage which – as you have pointed out – could lead to the death penalty. The preliminary hearing closed on 2 July and we had been hoping to come with some positive news, especially as the evidence presented was so weak. Unfortunately, the judge decided to admit the case and the full trial is now set for 14 July. You can rest assured that we will be following this very closely. The EU delegation in Khartoum has been in close contact with the pastors’ lawyers throughout the whole procedure and, following their advice, has been observing the hearings in collaboration with Member States. We continue to do so. We believe that this sends a strong political signal of the importance that we attach to the process, most importantly to the freedom of religion, freedom of belief, freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial. This illustrates, once again, the deeply worrying situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in general in Sudan, as well as the tight grip that the security forces have on state institutions. Let us not forget – as some of you have mentioned – that the situation in Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile continues to cause endless drama and a lot of suffering for so many people.
