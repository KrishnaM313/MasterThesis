It is also one of the main obstacles to the empowerment of women and girls and the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It has devastating consequences for the victims but also for our societies. It is our common task to put an end to violence against women and girls. It is a task of every moment, of every day, a task that must involve indignation but also action. Action to ensure gender equality, to prevent violence, to protect victims and bring those responsible to justice. Action to achieve global and coordinated policies, involving different actors and making a difference to the women and girls of our time. It is time for all Member States and the European Union to ratify the Istanbul Convention, the first legally binding international instrument to prevent and combat violence against women and girls. On the occasion of the 2019 International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, we will join the Orange the World initiative, bringing to light the stories of women and girls looking to a brighter and more violence-free future.

This statement was released on 5 November by 11 000 scientists from 153 nations. The climate crisis is accelerating faster and more severely than anticipated. The statement I quoted is in line with the recent special reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), according to which human-induced warming has already raised 1° Celsius above pre-industrial levels and is increasing at approximately 0.2° Celsius per decade. By the end of the century, based on the current climate policies implemented worldwide, temperature is projected to rise by 3.1° to 3.7°. It’s clear that progress so far is insufficient and efforts should urgently be stepped up. The United Nations indicates that the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) submitted by parties to the Paris Agreement collectively fall far short of what is required to limit the rise of temperature to 1.5°. The overall situation is rather bleak, yet there are some encouraging signs including global birth rate, investments in solar and wind power and fossil fuel divestments. Moreover, there is growing awareness and concern about global warming and its effects. All over the world, active civil society coalitions, citizens and the youth in particular are calling for decisive action that will determine the future of the planet and humanity. We have heard their appeal to implement the paradigm shift to climate-proof the circular economy, that our economies and societies urgently need in order to mitigate the most catastrophic consequences of climate change. The climate action summit in September demonstrated the political will to step up collective ambition. It resulted in a number of major announcements by governments and private-sector leaders, including at EU level, on the reduction of greenhouse gas production, climate finance and carbon neutrality. Madam President, Honourable Members, as regards the Paris Agreement, the EU is preparing its long-term strategy for greenhouse gas emissions reductions that will be submitted to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change by 2020. Most Member States agree with the objective of climate neutrality in the EU by 2050, and several of them have already set national targets contributing to that goal. The European Council is committed to finalising its guidance on the EU’s climate-neutral vision before the end of this year, with a view to reaching an agreement between all Member States. The road to climate neutrality in the EU will affect everyone and will require efforts from all sectors of the economy. It’s therefore essential that the transition must be just and socially balanced and that no one is left behind. It is equally essential to scale up their investment in research and development, if the EU wants reap the opportunities in terms of growth and employment that climate neutrality will trigger. The EU has taken the lead in implementing the Paris Agreement. We are set to over-achieve our 2020 20% reduction target. The climate and energy legislative framework is designed to enable us to reach the 2030 target. That involves a reduction of domestic greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% below 1990 levels. Actually, thanks to Parliament’s, the Council’s and the Commission’s good cooperation, we were able to increase the ambition level up to -45% while finalising climate 2030 files. The EU has successfully decoupled economic growth from emissions. From 1990 to 2017 the EU’s economy grew by 58%. Total greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 22%. A recent report by the European Environment Agency indicates that the EU’s total emissions decreased by 2% in the last year. This brings the total reduction to 23.2% below 1990 levels. By promoting this positive example, we can inspire all parties to the Paris Agreement to raise the global ambition. It is in that spirit that the EU actively prepares for COP25. We call on all parties to update their NDCs and to increase their clarity, transparency and understanding. COP25 will test the willingness of all parties to finalise the implementation of the Paris agreement. The rule book was almost totally agreed in Katowice last year, with the important exception of the rules on voluntary cooperation in Article 6. As agreed by the Council on 4 October, the EU is committed to working with all parties to develop robust and comprehensive rules on voluntary cooperation. The EU’s core position in this respect is to agree on rules on internationally transferred mitigation outcomes that encourage ambition and progression in NDCs, guarantee environmental integrity, avoid double counting and provide for the closure of the Kyoto Protocol Mechanisms. Finally, the fight against global warming needs adequate financial means and resources which are key for increasing global ambition and for facilitating the transition to climate-smart economies. The EU is the world’s biggest climate finance contributor. The contributions of the EU and its Member States exceed EUR 21 billion annually and fulfil their commitment towards the mobilisation of USD 100 billion per year by 2020 through to 2025, as part of the collective developed countries goal. The Council has recently adopted conclusions on climate finance. The Council reaffirms the commitment of the EU and its Member States to ensure that the deliberations set a new collective quantified goal from the floor of USD 100 billion per year prior to 2025. The deliberations are to take place in November 2020 with the aim of making global financial flows consistent with the long-term goals of the Paris agreement. The Council also stresses the importance of the need for a wider variety of funding sources and for a broader range of contributors. As you can see, we have an important and dense COP25 ahead with a lot of items to be discussed. Let me assure you that the European Union will play an active role in these discussions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 21, "date": "2019-11-25.json", "name": "Miguel Arias Cañete", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to participate in this timely and topical debate on the pressing issue of climate and environmental emergency, while we look ahead to preparations for the upcoming 25th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in Madrid, led by the Government of Chile. Climate change and the environment are a top priority for our citizens, and in particular for our young people. Science is clear: each year matters, each choice matters, each half a degree matters. It is of the utmost urgency that we act now. Fires have raged from the Amazon to Siberia; heatwaves, droughts and cyclones are affecting billions of people throughout the world. Climate change and the biodiversity losses are already affecting critical life systems on earth, threatening the livelihood of many. Together with you, we have put in place a comprehensive climate and energy framework and have delivered on our objectives in the Circular Economy Action Plan. But we need to do more. We need much, much stronger action, as science and our youth keep reminding us. The European Union is strongly committed to continuing an ambitious and urgent action to effectively address the interdependent environmental and climate crisis in an integrated manner – globally. This is essential for sustainable development, poverty eradication and delivering on all of the Sustainable Development Goals. On the environment side, we need to engage all partners in bringing about the ‘transformative change’ that is necessary for our planet’s survival. We must make 2020 a landmark year for climate, nature and ecosystems, including through an ambitious post-2020 global biodiversity framework to be adopted at the Conference of the Parties under the Convention for Biological Diversity in Kunming, China. On climate, we must continue our efforts and accelerate our action in the European Union and globally. Four years ago, the international community celebrated the Paris Agreement as a game changer. And last year we agreed on the Katowice Rulebook – the first ever universal transparency and accountability system applicable to all, with in-built flexibilities for those who genuinely need it. Both Paris and Katowice are landmarks for multilateralism and a true testament of global resolve and solidarity.  Looking ahead to Madrid, completing the work on making the Paris Agreement work well in practice must be our first collective objective. In this regard, a key topic for COP25 is the single element of the Rulebook left outstanding in Katowice: the guidance on voluntary cooperation and market-based mechanisms under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Securing a meaningful outcome for market measures under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement is important for the European Union. If we do it right. Compromises that put environmental integrity at risk are not acceptable to us.  The decisions that we take at COP25 must prevent the double counting of emission reductions, and to achieve this the rules must account comprehensively for all uses of international carbon markets. The decisions we take in Madrid should also create strong incentives to reduce emissions now and in the future, and this means avoiding the use of past emission reductions to undermine current and future ambition. The new mechanism under Article 6.4 should avoid the weaknesses of the Kyoto Protocol Mechanisms.  Second, our other substantive priority for COP25 is the successful review of the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage: to stimulate practical ideas that help people on the ground to take effective action to avert, minimise and address loss and damage, particularly for vulnerable communities in their specific situations. Third, the European Union attaches great importance to stakeholder engagement in COP25, particularly on Oceans. The Chilean Presidency has made this a top priority for this ‘Blue COP’. But in Madrid we must begin looking at the bigger picture, and how we – and all other parties to the Paris Agreement – respond to the increasing request from citizens everywhere in the world for more and more decisive action. We believe that in Madrid we must continue to incentivise, support and accelerate action from all actors towards the objectives of the Paris Agreement. The European Union will continue to do its homework on this and will continue to lead by example. Next year we will update our nationally determined contribution, to make it clear that the full implementation of our legislative framework will effectively enable us to overreach the current commitment of ‘at least 40%’. Around 45% reductions are estimated by 2030. Yet this is not the whole story. We will make it clear that the European Union is irrevocably committed to a path that will lead us to do our full part under the Paris Agreement, and will offer others an effective model to do their part. The European Union will be at their side, offering full cooperation and support. European Union leaders have committed to finalising their guidance on the objective of climate neutrality by the end of the year, in good time for the long-term strategy to be submitted to the UNFCCC in early 2020. The objective remains to create a modern, competitive, prosperous and climate-neutral society by 2050. At the same time, the demands of our citizens have spurred the European institutions to look again at what we need to do already in the 2030 perspective. The next European Commission has already announced that it will work in earnest to raise the European Union ambition higher than 40% or 45% greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2030. For the European Union this is a continuous process that can only stop when the objectives of the Paris Agreement are fully reached. Our efforts in this direction will continue well beyond our borders. The European Union and its Member States remain the largest contributor of public climate finance to developing countries, including to the multilateral climate funds, and have contributed EUR 21.7 billion in climate finance for 2018, which is double the level of 2013.  Yet we all know that public finance alone will be insufficient to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. Therefore, it is crucial to make swift and ambitious progress to make all finance flows consistent with the Paris Agreement. To this end, following its Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth, the Commission launched in October the International Platform for Sustainable Finance in order to deepen international cooperation and, where appropriate, coordination on sustainability approaches and initiatives for the capital markets. At the same time, we will continue to mainstream climate policies in all our international relations and in our development cooperation. We will continue to persuade others to follow the path of climate neutrality as soon as possible in the second half of this century, as science incites all of us to do, and we will offer all our partners dialogue, cooperation and support in doing so. Let me conclude by saying that we should all offer our strong support to the Chilean COP25 Presidency with a view to a successful outcome in Madrid.  At the end of this session, let me take the opportunity to thank you for your exceptional collaboration over the last years. It has been an honour to serve in the Juncker Commission, and a special privilege to work with such dedicated parliamentarians here in the European Parliament. I am at the same time humbled by all that we have achieved in these past five years, and proud of the leadership that the European Union and its institutions have shown, at home and abroad, and in multilateral fora. Together, we have achieved historic milestones, from the adoption and ratification of the Paris Agreement, through to the conclusion of a comprehensive legal framework on climate and energy in the form of the 2030 legislation and the Clean Energy Package. All that with exceptional political consensus and support in both the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. This is exactly the European Union at its best, an excellent example of European Union added value for our citizens.  What we have achieved puts in place a solid foundation for the next decades to enable us to go further and faster, as demanded by our European citizens, because, despite all we have done, alone it is not enough. And again, Europe and its institutions must take the lead in going forward. I will remain your strongest supporter as you embark on this important task in the years ahead.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 22, "date": "2019-11-25.json", "name": "Pascal Canfin", "mepid": "96711", "text": "   Author. Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are a few days after the Venice climate disaster, a few weeks after Donald Trump confirmed the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement, and we are now a few hours away from the election, which will be held in two days, of the new European Commission, which has made the Green Pact - action to combat climate change and biodiversity. We are also a few days away from COP 25. So there is no better time to have this debate and declare a climate and environmental emergency in Europe. We are in Strasbourg on Monday evening and on Thursday we will have to decide on the state of climate and environmental emergency. I would like to say today to the European citizens who are following our debates that as we speak, we are not sure that on Thursday this Parliament will vote on the climate and environmental emergency. Yet several national parliaments have done so: the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Portugal, Austria and others, with very different political majorities. I think it would be incomprehensible to European citizens, especially young Europeans who travelled massively in the European elections to make a strong voice heard and say: 'Don't let us down! We are 20 years old today; in 2050, we will have lived, we will be 50 years old, and you want to leave us a world with a global warming to three, four or five degrees? If we do not want this and we want to send this message to our children, to all our children, including mine, we will have to vote in three days for the climate and environmental emergency. It would be, once again, an extraordinary occasion if the European Parliament were the first continental parliament to say :'Europe is the first continent in the world to declare a state of environmental and climate emergency'. It would be an extraordinary opportunity; it would be an extraordinary message that we would of course send to our European citizens, but also to the citizens of the rest of the world. After the message that Donald Trump sent them, which basically meant saying, \"Go and be seen!\", we have to send the exact opposite message. We are interested in them, we are interested in the climate issue for our citizens and for all the citizens of the world, because - as was mentioned today - the first donor of official development assistance is the European Union, and we can be proud of that. So this message is symbolic. Obviously, it's not going to change everything overnight, everyone is aware of that. But if we could not send it, then the symbolism would be terrible. I therefore call for the responsibility of every Member of this Parliament. On Thursday, we will have to vote as widely as possible. It is not a partisan issue, it is not a matter of small partisan politics, it is a question of collective responsibility. We must vote - as other national colleagues have done - for a climate and environmental emergency. In the short term, we also have a resolution on COP 25 and the new European Commission which will take office in a few weeks. One of the great messages that we must send in this resolution, which I am sure we will send it, is to reduce our own CO2 emissions well beyond the current targets that Commissioner Caete has reminded and which are far below what science requires us to do. So what we need to do is reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 by 55% compared to 1990. That's what science asks us to do, it's not what emotion dictates to us, it's not what irrationality would ask us or would demand of us, it's what scientists are asking us to do, and I think that as politicians of the left, right or center, we have to listen to this scientific message and listen to the message of young people and listen to the message of young people. , and thus support, in the resolution for COP 25, this requirement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55%.

We are in danger of reaching tipping points, which will cause climate change to affect itself and our children and grandchildren will no longer be able to stop climate change, even if they make such a great effort. I think we are in agreement on this in the vast majority. Now there is this second resolution. Pascal Canfin spoke of \"urgence\" in French. In French, I agree that in German the term 'emergency' – that is a possible translation – has a very negative tone, it has to do with panic, it also has to do with the fact that in the Third Reich in Germany democratic rights were overridden under this term. That is why I would rather speak of an 'urgent' way. We need urgent and sustainable action. We don't need to panic, we really need to do something and take the rest of the world with us. If we could agree on this, I would be very, very happy. Then we will vote here together on Thursday.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 24, "date": "2019-11-25.json", "name": "Jytte Guteland", "mepid": "124991", "text": "  On the other: And on the S&amp;D Group.

Ladies and gentlemen, ahead of today's debate, new figures have just been presented showing that the concentration of climate gases in the atmosphere was the highest ever last year. It is very serious. Since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015, the heat records have been tight. And what we're seeing right now is that our house is literally on fire and every day we don't turn things around, this fire is going to be harder and harder to put out. For our planet, this is fatal; we need to work quickly and to understand the seriousness. We have a climate emergency in Europe and the rest of the world, and as elected representatives we have a responsibility to understand this seriousness and act accordingly. The Paris Agreement is the framework we have to deal with, but we see right now that the Member States are not doing enough to meet the necessary commitments. Commitments should be multiplied in order to comply with the Paris Agreement. As things stand right now, we are moving towards over three degrees of warming with temperature increases at that level. As a Parliament, we have a hugely important role now in the run-up to the Madrid climate summit, and I have to say that it is the A and O that everything is pulling in the same direction in the world. We cannot allow instruments that are even counterproductive to the efforts needed to bring down global warming. EU Member States still have fossil fuel subsidies worth an average of €55 billion each year. This is completely unreasonable and something that our group wants to put an end to. We must also ensure that the international community lives up to the Paris Agreement, that the Member States really make the necessary commitments, the national commitments, and that also applies to our own Member States.

According to the IMO, however, maritime emissions could even increase by up to 250 % by 2050. That is simply unacceptable! So what solution?

Ich brauche noch einen Moment, ich bin gerade gekommen. Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Parliament for the invitation to take part in this debate, which addresses the very important issue of violence against women and domestic violence. This is particularly important today, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women – that’s why we all have something orange with us.  Combating all forms of violence against women is a core element of respect for fundamental rights. In 2017, the Fundamental Rights Agency underlined the need for EU institutions and Member States to maintain their commitment to safeguarding the dignity of all women and girls in the European Union. The Fundamental Rights Report from 2019 encourages Member States to continue their efforts to effectively uphold victims’ rights and ensure rights awareness, access to appropriate support services, and effective remedies available to all victims of crime.  The Council has repeatedly expressed its commitment to preventing and eliminating all forms of violence against women, and it considers the Istanbul Convention a powerful tool in this fight. It’s a ground-breaking legal instrument, and monitoring of the implementation of the Convention has already shown that it is having a positive impact on the lives of women across Europe. As you know, Parliament, the Commission and the Council agree that the Istanbul Convention is a mixed convention which covers EU competences as well as Member States’ competences. Insofar as the Member States are concerned, we can note with satisfaction that by now all 28 Member States have signed the Istanbul Convention and that, to date, 21 Member States have also ratified it.  Insofar as the Union is concerned, on 11 May 2017, the Council decided that the European Union could sign the Convention. The Union signed the Convention on 13 June 2017. However, the proposed decision for the Union to conclude the Convention is still pending within the Council, together with the draft code of conduct setting out the arrangements between the Council, the Commission and the Member States for the implementation of the Convention.  The Finnish Presidency has continued working on the EU’s accession to the Istanbul Convention. The Union has signed the Convention, and the accession would enable better data collection and more accountability. We have also encouraged those Member States that still have not ratified the Istanbul convention to do so without delay. However, regard must be had to the fact that – as you are fully aware – in April this year, Parliament decided to request from the Court of Justice an opinion on the appropriate legal basis and the Council’s procedure for the accession to the Istanbul Convention. The Council will, of course, submit written observations to Parliament’s request for the Court’s opinion in due time.  On a more general note, the European Union protects women and children from gender-based violence through legislation and practical measures to defend victims’ rights. The 2012 Directive establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime, for example, places strong emphasis on access to appropriate support, including specialised support for women and children who have been victims of different forms of violence.  The European Union raises awareness of gender-based violence through co—funding campaigns run by national governments, and supports transnational projects run by non-governmental organisations that combat violence against women, children and young people. It facilitates the identification of common solutions among Member States by organising exchanges of good practices, and conducts research on gender-based violence.  I would like to conclude by reassuring you that the Council attaches great importance to this issue. The Presidency will continue working towards the conclusion of the Istanbul Convention by the European Union. We need to continue to seek solutions.

First, allow me to congratulate the newly appointed co-rapporteurs on the file, Ms Spurek and Ms Kokalari.  Violence against women is widespread globally. Today’s International Day Against Violence Against Women reminds us again and again about the millions of victims of this phenomenon. The European Parliament and the Commission have always been strong allies in combating violence against women. The Istanbul Convention is an example of this cooperation: although we have not yet achieved our common main goal, Parliament’s strong stance has facilitated the role of the Commission and helped in keeping the European Union’s accession on the political agenda. I hope that this cooperation will continue in the future.  The Convention is the best available international legal tool for the protection of victims of gender-based and domestic violence through a joint European framework. The Commission President-elect clearly stated that European Union accession to the Convention remains a priority for the Commission in the new mandate. Twenty-one European Union Member States have already ratified the Convention. Based on the discussions so far in the Council working party, there should be enough support for a qualified majority of Member States to conclude also European Union accession. We should therefore remain committed to a swift ratification. Commissioner—designate Dalli has been mandated to finalise the ongoing accession process and, as she stated in her hearing in front of this House, she will do her utmost to achieve this goal.  In some Member States, national ratification was widely debated in public. The Commission will continue working with civil society organisations and the Council of Europe to rectify the misunderstandings and misconceptions spread during these debates. However, if unblocking the negotiations at the Council turns out to be an insurmountable task, the President-elect has confirmed that alternative ways to better support victims of gender-based violence and domestic violence will be explored. She also announced that the new Commission could look into the possibility of proposing minimum standards regarding the definition of certain types of violence.  The Victims’ Rights Directive is the main European Union law on victims’ rights. It provides for a set of rights for all victims of all crimes, including victims of gender-based violence. Although the Directive entered into application in Member States in 2015, most Member States still have not transposed it fully. Correct implementation of the Victims’ Rights Directive is a Commission priority. We need to ensure that all victims can rely on their rights, independently of where in the European Union the crime took place.  Legislation is not the only way forward: a comprehensive set of policy measures is needed to ensure that violence against women is tackled in a comprehensive and holistic manner. To provide the still—missing data on this phenomenon, Eurostat already started to work on a survey on gender-based violence in 2016. The questionnaire and methodology will be finalised by 2019 for the action to start in 2020 and end in September 2022 at the latest.

Today, those who deny gender-based violence, thousands and thousands of women and men have been made a very clear message on European streets, they have dyed them purple and said very clearly: \"You are not alone, we are with you\".  And the European institutions must also engage in the fight against gender-based violence. It's indispensable. There needs to be ratification already of the Istanbul Convention against Gender-Based Violence, because this will be the first piece of European legislation to protect women.  And there is also a need for a European equality strategy from the future European Commission. We need to lay the foundations for a clear commitment to what needs to be a more egalitarian Europe, a Europe that protects its women, a Europe that does not allow the greatest scourge that exists at the moment in Europe and in the world: women who are killed for that reason, because they are women.

In accordance with Article 8 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the European Union may enter into an international treaty only with the unanimous consent of all Member States. For example, the governments of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary cannot grant this consent under national constitutions because the parliaments of these countries have notrated the Istanbul Treaty.

Ladies and gentlemen, today we are going to be talking about chickens cut strangely and a legal loophole. I would like to thank the Presidency of the European Parliament for finally circle the subject on the agenda of the plenary session. He has lessons to learn that make me think that this is really where the subject should be. What exactly is batman chicken? The Ukraine-EU free trade agreement concluded in 2016 allows imports of Ukrainian breast fillets within strict limits. There's a quota, and there's a heavy duty to pay. Yes, but there are two other lines of duty in this agreement that are not subject to quantitative limits or tariffs. At the time, he thought, in my opinion, that the Commission was not a problem, that it was such a small quantity. Yes, but on the Ukrainian side, some have taken advantage of this opportunity very cleverly and very mindfully, and have played out the FREE TRADE AGREEMENT with great creativity. Ukrainian businessmen brought in the chicken breast fillets with a small piece of bone, which had no customs duties or railings, and then they cut off these bones in the Union and put them on the market as breast fillets. While 3 700 tonnes of chickens of this type were introduced in 2016, in 2018 55 000 tonnes were already introduced thanks to this legal but tricky solution, which endangered the interests of EU producers and was a circumvention of the FTA. The Commission has entered into an exchange of letters with Ukraine to bring trade back into the regulated normal legal procedure by including the two customs lines concerned alongside the regulated breast filler and by increaseing the quota by 50 000 ton. I would also like to point out that health and veterinary standards have not been questioned, so the EU market was not in danger in this respect. In Ukraine, I can say that the government has already approved this amendment to the agreement, it was presented to parliament on 15 November. The relevant commissions have already discussed it and we are waiting for rada's plenary session to be put on the agenda as soon as possible. Finally, I would like to make a few requests. On the one hand, I ask the Ukrainian Parliament to hold the debate as soon as possible and to contribute to the agreement. I also ask ukraine, which is an important geostrategic partner for us, to trade with them fairly, to act in good faith, to apply it in good faith, and not to arregate the use of any loopholes or loopholes in the future. Finally, I would also ask the Commission to pay attention to the fact that the forthcoming free trade agreements do not include a loophole that allows them to be applied in bad will. Colleagues, I think that the Commission has found a good solution, and I ask that you vote in favour of the amendment to the agreement with Ukraine, so that we can protect the market and our own producers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 151, "date": "2019-11-25.json", "name": "Phil Hogan", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Ms Győri, and the shadow rapporteurs for their speedy work on this report, and I welcome the clear decision by the Members of the Committee on International Trade (INTA) to recommend that the European Parliament gives its consent to this agreement reached between the Commission and Ukraine earlier this year. I am grateful too for the favourable opinion by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) and I want to acknowledge the work of the rapporteur Mr Kuźmiuk. By giving consent to this agreement, the European Parliament is once again protecting the interests of our agricultural sector. Once Parliament has given its consent, the Council will have to adopt a decision on the conclusion of the Agreement.  As I’m sure you are aware, indeed it has been outlined very well by Ms Győri, the ratification process by the Ukrainian Parliament is still pending, even though the Ukrainian government agreed the agreement on 23 October last. We have been doing our best to encourage the Ukrainian parliament to proceed quickly with the ratification and I hope that they will do so when Parliament reassembles in Ukraine next week. In view of this likelihood and given the continued urgency of this issue, we are encouraging the European Parliament to give its consent this week so as to allow the completion of the ratification process from the European Union side.  You are all aware of the background, and this again has been outlined very well by Ms Győri and she has explained the sad and unsatisfactory history in relation to the poultry cuts issue. I want to assure Ms Győri that the European Commission will have learned lessons from this trading experience. The rapid increase in imports of the poultry cut in question did raise significant concerns due to the risk of potentially unlimited duty free amounts of poultry meat coming into the European market, particularly breast meat. In order to address these concerns, the Commission began consulting with the Ukrainian authorities last year and the agreement was concluded earlier this year. The solution provides for the inclusion of two particular tariff lines and the existing tariff rate quotas (TRQ) for poultry meat products, and an increase in the size TRQ by 50 000 tons, otherwise we would have an unlimited amount of poultry meat coming into the European Union in respect of breast meat. Out-of-quota imports under the other two problematic other cuts tariff lines would be subject to the most favoured nation tariffs.  Under the agreement reached, Ukraine is effectively accepting a limit to its exports of poultry meat into the EU, and while the increase of a quota by 50 000 tonnes is indeed substantial, it falls clearly below the current Ukraine export capacity of poultry breast meat. This agreement responds to a situation which threatened to present an enormous challenge to our EU poultry producers and I know that in your respective committees you have stressed the importance of monitoring closely the implementation of this agreement, which we will do. Not alone can I assure you on this point, but I also want to assure you that all of our Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) have been screened, that there are no further such loopholes relating to poultry lines involved in any previous agreements and we did not find any. We are committed fully to a continued close monitoring of the implementation of this and other FTAs and also, as you are aware, we are appointing a Chief Technical Officer in relation to trade implementation and enforcement in 2020.  While I welcome your acknowledgment that the agreement reached addresses the particular loophole, I do appreciate the concerns that have been expressed at the extent of the increase in the TRQ. I would point out, however, that the situation in question was monitored and identified at an earlier stage precisely because of this monitoring of our FTAs but nevertheless it is a substantial TRQ revision that has to be made in respect of this agreement.  I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate, to outline the background and also the action that we were taking, and also to thank again the Parliament for their anticipated consent to this agreement.

While the orderly arrangement of these imports entails a clear increase in the import quota for the country, it also offers hope of curbing imports outside it. However, the Committee on Agriculture expects the European Commission to introduce the possibility of protective measures in trade in agricultural goods into the agreement with Ukraine. Consequently, sanitary and phytosanitary requirements identical to those of agricultural products produced in the Union, as well as the need for Ukrainian producers to comply with animal welfare requirements, should be applied consistently to imported agricultural products from Ukraine.  At the same time, as a representative of Polish, a country neighbouring Ukraine, I would like to draw the Commission's attention to the fact that most of the agricultural goods originating in Ukraine imported into the Union under duty-free quotas end up on the Polish market and cause price competition, which seriously reduces the incomes of Polish farmers.

We believe that trade is a lever for economic development and can thus help to put a chicken in everyone’s pot. Yet, even if a 15-fold increase of imports of ‘Batman chicken cuts’ may have followed the letter of the agreement, it was not the intent to put our domestic poultry producers under such sudden strain. Therefore, I welcome this reasonable and negotiated settlement. The EU and Ukraine prove once again that the way forward in international trade is through negotiation, not unilateral actions.

When rules-based trading works, it is a powerful tool that benefits everyone. When it emerges that the rules that we have jointly laid down do not work, it goes without saying that, as a free trade friend, you have to be involved in taking responsibility and correcting them. This is precisely the situation in the case of the chicken within the framework of the Deep Free Trade Agreement with Ukraine, where it turns out that it has not worked. We must overcome this kind of loophole that undermines the whole idea of rules-based trade. Ukraine is a very important strategic partner for the EU, and the EU, in turn, is Ukraine's largest trading partner. Both parties thus benefit from the fact that trade between us is well organised.

It is said that this has at least plugged a loophole. But let's face it, I say it's just unfair that a fraudulent trade flow is legalised.

I know that people are certainly more informed now in relation to the background, but also on what we have done to try and correct this particular problem which was unforeseen at the time of the negotiations, but legally this particular loophole was exploited and it is now corrected.  We’ve also followed up with all of the other free trade agreements (FTAs) in relation to poultry and other lines to ensure that a similar situation doesn’t happen in those particular respective FTAs. So I’ve listened carefully and I do understand the concerns about having to concede 50 000 tonnes of additional quota of poultry meat from Ukraine, but at the same time there would have been an unlimited amount of poultry coming into the European Union otherwise.  As you know, one of the priorities of the new Commission is to establish this position of the Chief Enforcement Officer and this person will operate under DG TRADE and will have a very important role in ensuring the implementation and enforcement of all of the FTAs that we have to date. I could tell you that the Commission has prepared a draft implementing regulation which has already been discussed with Member States. This could be adopted in time for the opening and management of this additional quota by 1 January 2020, and for the sake of clarity, it is also worth making the point that the quota will be managed by a system of import licences, as is the case for the existing quotas of poultry meat. Just turning to a few of the points raised by the speakers. Ms Hazekamp and Mr Bert-Jan Ruissen have rightly pointed out to various issues in the Netherlands and the concerns that your poultry producers would have. The same can be said of France and Poland.  One point five million tonnes of poultry come into the European Union every year because we have a deficit in poultry in the European Union. Three million tonnes of an increase in consumption of poultry has been happening over the last three years in the European Union. That’s not to say that there are some producers in some countries where we have a high concentration of poultry which we certainly have to be conscious of.  In the Association Agreement reached, Ukraine has committed to approximate its sanitary and phytosanitary and animal welfare legislation with that of the European Union, and once this is concluded and implemented, Ukraine will be the first third country exporting significant volumes of poultry meat to the EU that applies EU welfare standards throughout the production chain. We have recently had a strategy meeting in relation to this and there has been an adoption by the EU-Ukraine SPS Subcommittee on 18 November 2019 where the strategy has been agreed between the EU and Ukraine.  And I’m sorry to say to Ms Hazekamp that I don’t think the common agricultural policy is going to be abolished. You will probably be on your own – 99% of the people here, I think, agree with that particular outcome. Can I finally say to my friend Mr Wallace from Wexford that we have to have continued exports of food and farm products from the island of Ireland: 90% of what we produce we export. If you want the thousands of jobs in Wexford to continue in the food sector, we have to continue exporting – and at the end of the day you will be doing so on the same level playing field as the EU standards. No product comes into the European Union without meeting EU standards. And if you want to close down food processors and particular people involved in the food sector in Wexford, you should tell them that, and the Wexford people, and maybe the Enniscorthy Echo as well next week.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 166, "date": "2019-11-25.json", "name": "Enikő Győri", "mepid": "96830", "text": "  Artist. – First of all, I thank Commissioner Hogan for informing us of good news.

I know that Ukraine wants to renew the free trade agreement, I think that this will all serve as a lesson for the future. Ladies and gentlemen, several of you have argued that this is a very serious quota increase, can we talk about the fact that this extra 50 000 tonnes, this is a lot or a few, the glass is half empty or half full.

Today’s European Union is built on the ruins of the Berlin Wall, on the spirit of the Solidarity movement in Poland, on the Baltic Way and the Velvet Revolution in the former Czechoslovakia. The accession of 2004 allowed us to reconcile our continent’s geography with its history and a collective wish to share its future together.  I vividly recollect 1989. We, the people in Czechoslovakia, wanted change. We wanted to come back to Europe, and I am convinced that it was not in search of material goods. It was especially in search of its freedoms. To live in freedom was a dream we all shared in Europe, but in the east it has become a reality later than in the west and the south. Living in freedom requires a process of adjustment, not only to the immediate benefits of individual liberties, but also to the meaning of individual responsibility and the constant process of debate and compromise, discussion and change which is inherent in democracy.  Our societies are now wealthier. We live longer, we can educate ourselves better, and we have immensely better choice. Our administrations are healthier when democratically accountable. Through that and the checks and balances assured by independent justice, the rule of law and fundamental rights, we live in a fairer, more just society built on common values which provide liberty, security and stability for its citizens, and therefore a better life. Yet, especially in times of uncertainty, there are those who peddle old lies and play to the insecurities of people. They point to a past that never was and promise a future that will never come. They say it requires the rule of a strong leader and they offer simplistic solutions to complex problems. Democracy is an invincible ideal, but also a fragile system and it is certainly not a given. We need to cherish and defend our European values, to maintain Europe as a resilient, assertive player standing firm on its pillars of liberal democracy, an inspiration and an example of a better way for people to govern themselves.  It is naive to believe that the democratic change we made after the revolution is irreversible. Democracy is a process. It has no end and it needs constant maintenance. With humility we should accept that, as politicians, we cannot protect the values alone. We need a robust and vigorous civil society and active citizens – not just consumers – to join us in our vigilance against authoritarianism and the efforts of authoritarian powers to interfere in and undermine our democracies.  We need to nurture our democratic institutions and our citizens’ confidence and trust in them, and in us as part of these institutions. The greater our institutions’ resilience, an independent judiciary, law-bound and accountable legislators and executive – and also of course free media and civil society – the stronger will be our democratic and self—confident Europe.

Let me share the three inspirations that this time has for me. First, let us remember that communism did not collapse on its own. Without thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of courageous people who were spreading ideas of democracy and freedom even then, he would not have collapsed.  The second thing, in these very divided times, let us remember how great it was when most of society was united by thoughts of a better future. A future that respects important values. And let's remember how much we seem to miss it today. And for the last time, let us remember that we have built a rich company, but we have succeeded less in building a company that is coherent and resilient. However successful we have been in very important things, we are part of a common Europe, we are involved in shaping it and we live in the best place in the world today.

I am pleased that, thanks to the Velvet Revolution, we later became part of the European Union. However, it has to be said that not all people's expectations have been met. Many have lost their jobs, their homes, and even today, decent housing is not a matter of course. According to many, promises have not been fulfilled that there will be no more expensive, redundancies or the sale of strategic industries and energy. That is also why I would like us to use this round anniversary, in addition to well-deserved celebrations, to debate across the political spectrum how to combat corruption more effectively, how to increase law enforcement and, in particular, how to strengthen social conveniences, in one word, how to make the whole of the European Union a better place to live.

We didn't always play the script. I think there is always time to reflect how we have used democracy and freedom and whether we have worked hard enough on it, because democracy and freedom must be worked on. It's not an automatic thing. I was very impressed when you some of you were talking about how you remember 1989 and that it was like a miracle. I also remember the euphoria that came when we understood that we would finally get rid of the totalitarian regime that distorted morality, which, for example, forced me to think seriously about how I would explain to my six-year-old son that he must not say outside what he hears at home. A number of other things we got rid of may be worth remembering again. It is not true what is being said today when we remember the 30th anniversary or when we remember the revolution, that communism collapsed on its own. It's not true. We were, I personally did not, but many people were persecutioned, very courageously opposed to the regime, many people gave their lives. I think that we are all committed today not to squandering those sacrifices and to continue the work, hopefully, on peaceful and democratic terms. Let's look to the future. As we analyse the present, we see that we have problems in Europe. As Vice-President of the European Commission, if the new Commission receives support from you, responsible for values and transparency, I will be responsible precisely for value principles such as democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, of course human rights, freedom of the media and the promotion of an active civil society. I think we have to work all this out, we have a number of problems in Europe, we have a suddenly returning principle in the minds of many that the winner takes everything after the elections. The belief is beginning to creep in that the one who lies better wins the election, the one who has more dirty money and uses more dirty methods, including the use of digital conveniences, wins the election. We have a number of new warning trends concerning both the media and the business model for independent media, which report that they are having great trouble maintaining. These are all things that we will have to work on together, and I am prepared, of course, to work intensively in my new position. I think we all have a duty to ensure that some elections in Europe are not the last, and we have a duty to ensure that people can count on it. At the same time, I must conclude by saying that we must also work very hard to ensure that the citizens of the European Union are with us in this endeavor, so that they understand what we are doing and why we are doing it when we are working for democracy, freedoms and human rights. So that we do not stay like the proverbial stake in the fence and czech colleagues know what I am talking about. We have to explain, but we also have to do a lot to make people in Europe feel like they are in countries where they have their certainty that they do not have to live in constant fear of the future. We know that our current society is really shaken by a great deal of uncertainty and a sense of injustice. I fear that people who are at risk of execution, people who calculate that, while our gross domestic product is increasing, the poverty rate remains the same, working parents who cannot pay their children a decent life, all these people may not have as much desire to think about why we need to fight for democracy, human rights and all those noble principles.

The aspiration for freedom had reached the Czech capital a few days after the fall of the Berlin wall. This anniversary reminds us that in a democracy, the right to demonstrate and to protest peacefully is more vital than ever. Most of all it enables the younger generation, but also others, to mobilise support for an alternative way of doing things. A vibrant civil society and pluralistic media are central in an open society, just like public participation in the democratic process. As a result, governments become accountable. The Velvet Revolution showed how this can be done even in the transition from an authoritarian to an open society. The values that it asserted are now proclaimed all over a Europe where citizens travel and cross borders easily and freely.

A free world and a united Europe would not exist in its present form if tens of thousands of young people and adults had not taken to the streets of Berlin, Prague, Bratislava, Timisoara and Bucharest. They demanded change: freedom of speech, free expression, free and equal elections. Many gave their lives, others risked their own safety and that of their families. Let's remember the brave. Since then, a generation has grown up with no direct experiences of a divided world and I hope they never will experience it. The 30th anniversary is a warning to us that our \"European life\", living in democracy, prosperity and peace, is not a matter of course.

I understand you will express your concern on the issue in a resolution later this week. We have already discussed this matter at the June session of the Justice and Home Affairs Council earlier this year.  The issue of the possible abuse of Interpol alerts is not new. We all remember the case of journalists with dual nationality who were arrested in 2017 on the basis of Interpol red notices. The issue was regularly raised and discussed at the half-yearly meetings of the EU Justice and Home Affairs senior officials with Interpol, with the aim of exploring possible improvements to the then existing Interpol systems and review mechanisms. A number of steps have been taken by Interpol since then, including the creation of a dedicated law enforcement task force to review the red notices. Continuous efforts in this direction are of great importance to protect the rights of our citizens, ensuring that an effective redress mechanism is in place to prevent the abuse of red notices for political reasons.  We also have to emphasise that an Interpol red notice alone cannot be the basis for a decision to extradite a person. That decision will still be subject to a judicial review. Inside the EU, this review falls solely within the competence of the Member States. All that said, it’s clear that we must keep monitoring this issue.  The Member States of the EU, when acting together, have a strong voice at Interpol and we should use it to make sure that the system of red notices is used only for its legitimate purpose – that is to help us arrest dangerous criminals, not political opponents.

On 12 November, the Lithuanian Minister for Justice spoke in the European Parliament’s Committee for Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs about the case. He informed the Committee that Lithuania had already raised its concerns in the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary (ENCJ).  What we see today is that clearly the events that took place in 1991 still have effects in our Union. The Commission expresses its support and solidarity with Lithuania, one of the EU Member States, for the attacks its judiciary has faced from a neighbouring third country. Lithuania has been constantly targeted by Russian disinformation efforts and a wide array of false narratives have been employed to this end. The present case is not an exception. As proven in the work of the EU Strategic Communication Task Force, Kremlin media have been, and continue to be, engaged in a process of historical revisionism. The events of 13 January 1991 have been portrayed by Russian disinformation activities as a conflict between Lithuanians, removing from the picture the crimes committed under the USSR.  Historical revisionism has been a core part of the Russian disinformation activities. The revisionism serves the purpose of discrediting or undermining the Lithuanian statehood sovereignty justice system and rule of law. Any attack against the judiciary of an EU Member State is an attack against the rule of law of the whole European Union. The Lithuanian judges and prosecutors are judges and prosecutors of the European Union. We strongly believe in the importance of letting Lithuania’s justice system conduct its work in full independence. We need to protect the integrity of our judicial system. The European Commission stands in support of an independent judiciary, without which the Union cannot function. As the Commission underlined in its communication published in July this year on strengthening the rule of law within the EU, upholding the rule of law in the Union is, and must remain, a key objective for all.

The Russian Federation has opened criminal proceedings against judges and prosecutors of Lithuania – it means, of the European Union.  In January 1991, the Soviet Government used military force in its attempt to remove the legitimate government in Lithuania. As a result of the military aggression, 14 civilians were killed and more than 800 were injured. This year in March, the Lithuanian court passed a judgment. Former Soviet Union officials were found guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity and of aggression against Lithuania. The Russian Federation did not cooperate in the case. In total, almost 300 legal assistance requests were sent to the Russian institutions. No replies have been received, or requests were rejected.  Criminal proceedings by the Russian Federation against officers who administered justice in this case is the new tool of hybrid warfare against the EU. We understand how the political system is being attacked. We must understand and state openly that we see how the judiciary of the EU is being targeted. Yes, it is another attack on democracy, which is the main target of Putin’s regime. We must send a clear signal from this Parliament that hybrid attacks against EU judiciary will not be tolerated.
