Contrary to the legend that one in two years conciliation fails, I am delighted that in 2016, for the 2017 budget, as in 2015, for the 2016 budget, we reached an agreement. I am glad that this year, surely overtaken by the many hours of negotiations, Parliament and the Council have taken one step towards the other in sending two clear messages. The first message is that the priority remains, more than ever, to tackle the problem of migration by strengthening the control of our external borders, while allowing the dignified reception of newcomers and the humanly sustainable return of migrants who cannot claim refugee status. Let us not be illusioned, much remains to be done in this area and our budget is extremely constrained in this area, but the progress made by the budgetary authority for 2017 is undoubtedly going in the right direction. The second message is that Europe is investing in its youth: an additional €500 million will be made available to the Youth Employment Initiative. In fact, $1 billion, if we add the additional allocations from the European Social Fund. In addition, 200 million additional appropriations have been allocated for future programmes, such as support for SMEs, the interconnection of infrastructure in Europe, Erasmus+ for students and apprentices — an emblematic programme on which the Commission had already focused in its draft budget — and research, with the Horizon programme 2020. Despite all the reproaches we can make to our budget, and there are many, 2017 edition sends a message of trust. Trust in the capacity of our institutions to work together and trust in our youth, which remains our most promising investment of the future. I thank our rapporteurs, Jens Geier and Indrek Tarand, who have informed our debates and our final arbitrations. Finally, I will express only one regret. Vice President Georgieva's last budget, which will have imprinted her brand, expertise, energy, training force and charisma. Madam Vice-President, accept our gratitude and allow me, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, to express my warm wishes for the success of your work at the head of the World Bank. We'll need you, ma'am.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2016-11-30.json", "name": "Jens Geier", "mepid": "96833", "text": " rapporteur. — Mr President. I have been told by the services that, although I only have three minutes of speaking time, I think I have six minutes. I would be grateful if you would briefly confirm that colleagues do not react completely irritated if I simply continue to speak after three minutes. Mr President, I do not know exactly whether you have listened to me now. The request is for you to confirm briefly that I have six minutes of speaking time. Thank you. Good. Thank you for being able to take the floor here as European Parliament rapporteur for the Commission budget. In the beginning, it is important to say thanks to all those who helped to succeed. I would like to thank the Slovak Presidency. I have always found their negotiation to be fair, open and accessible. That wasn't always the case. I would like to thank you very much for being a fair interlocutor and a good mediator for the European Parliament. My thanks also go to Kristalina Georgieva. I fully endorse what our committee chairman has said. It is your last appearance today in the plenary of the European Parliament, and I think that is important then that we, as the parliamentary part of the householder family, once again express thanks for an extraordinarily prominent work for the European budget. You have made a lot of progress, you have launched budget for results, a discussion about what we really want to achieve with the money. They have helped budgetary control. The budgets that you proposed under your aegis have often been guided by Parliament's priorities. We have always made a lot of progress in the budget negotiations with you. You were a fair partner and the Commission services under your leadership were an honest broker. For this whole many thanks and good luck with the World Bank. We will miss you, but we wish you all the best for the way forward. (Applause) The final thanks go to my shadow rapporteurs. I have always found the cooperation with them to be open and collegial. In the stressful moments that we all know — such as when you are standing on important issues in conciliation at 3 o'clock in the morning — it is good that, despite all the things that divide us, there is solidarity among the budgets across the political groups, and you even break a lance for things here and there, which was not necessarily voted for in the parliamentary debate. I think this is a very special form of cooperation that we have here, which I also find very pleasant. We want to vote on the 2017 budget package tomorrow. As rapporteur, I would urge you to adopt it, because the priorities of the European Parliament, as we have agreed here in this Chamber, are, as best they can, be reflected in this budget. We have received EUR 500 million in new money to combat unemployment, especially among young people, in the countries of southern Europe, and this will allow us to continue this very successful programme at the end of the day and continue to work to significantly reduce youth unemployment in many EU countries. We have achieved EUR 200 million more for growth and jobs, for small and medium-sized enterprises, transport infrastructure, research programmes and for promoting the mobility of people in the Erasmus+ programme. These are the most important headlines. Behind this, there are many important successes that recede a little before these two headings, but I want to highlight two especially because they are close to my heart. One is additional Money for UNRWA, for the UN Relief Agency for Palestinian Refugees. This agency is largely dependent on the money provided by the European Union. A Palestinian refugee must be worth as much to us as a Syrian refugee. We must ensure that the people in the camps have a social perspective, a training perspective for their young people, and what we have achieved is a guarantee of this. We have also been able to strengthen important social policy programmes such as Progress. That is particularly pleased — let me say that — a Social Democrat. We also did not achieve many things. I did not understand — and this task will come to us in the coming years — why it is not possible to include the heads of EU missions in the administrative category, where they also have their hat in the world as special representatives of the European Union! That sounds very technical. In the end, however, it is a question of whether we have more money for development policy and foreign policy and a clean system in the budget. There is apparently no legal basis here, and the Commission has to do something, and I myself find it unfortunate and have often been pointed out by the social networks that we have not succeeded in increasing humanitarian aid as we wanted. However, we have been able to strengthen important instruments in development policy. It is also particularly important to me, as a parliamentarian, that we have reminded the Commission and the Council a little of the dress code when it comes to spending money, which is to create the legal basis first and then put the money in the budget. That is why we will now wait patiently for the European Fund for Sustainable Development to come up with the legal basis. We're gonna have to talk again about how we can do this — then in the end very hectic — Improve procedures with the joint conclusions. This is a task for the future. I look forward to the discussion with you and hopefully a successful decision tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2016-11-30.json", "name": "Indrek Tarand", "mepid": "97136", "text": "  rapporteur. – Mr President, first of all I would like to inform the plenary that before the vote tomorrow I have to make a technical adjustment. I am sorry about this but it is my duty. I would now like to congratulate and offer my gratitude to everyone who helped me to finish this adventurous and creepy road of budgetary process. We achieved as much as we could, and the only complaint from my side would be that we did not meet the 20% of climate—related budgeting, which only recently came out from the Court of Auditors document. But let us try to do better next year. The conciliation meeting ended in a friendly atmosphere but in a bit of a rush. That is why, on the initiative of the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Arthuis, we had to make some technical clarifications. I must say that almost two thirds of them were very successful. Unfortunately, the Commission failed to put in the necessary point about the reserves, which Parliament adopted with a large majority. The reserves were meant to improve the Code of Conduct for Commissioners, particularly for a cooling-down period for former Commissioners. I promise to this plenary, to the Commission and to everybody else that we will come back to this issue, because it seems that President Juncker has sent Mr Schulz a proposal about how to improve the Code of Conduct, although for me for the time being it does not look like a step in the right direction, but rather the opposite. It proposes a cooling—down period for former Commissioners and to allow them to be lobbyists at the same time and employed as advisers to Commissioners. It is too long a period. We can cool nuclear reactors much more quickly than former Commissioners, and sometimes these former Commissioners have not given as much energy as a nuclear power plant. So we will come back to this issue. Secondly, the External Action Services need to pay more attention to their strategic communication activities. We agreed on that and I am very grateful to the Council and the Commission for adopting it. The most important thing is, of course, our own business. Political groups asked for 76 additional posts, and I, as a negotiator, made the utmost effort to get something. Finally we compromised in a budgetary-neutral way, and now the problem is with this House. I understand that the Secretary-General has been flexible enough to resolve it. I apologise to all the Parliament officials who feel that their share was reduced in order to increase the share of political workers, but that is the political decision. I would like to thank Commissioner Georgieva, who was very helpful in these efforts to achieve the agreement, and also the shadows and everybody from Parliament’s delegation, as well as Minister Lesay from the Slovak Presidency. I heard on the Bulgarian news that the Bulgarian Government is intending to appoint a replacement, Mr Ivailo Kalfin, who has a lot of experience in Parliament. His appointment as a Commissioner would relieve us from sophisticated debates over hearings, semi—hearings and mini hearings and allow Mr Oettinger to continue, under the experienced and firm supervision of Vice—President Ansip, on the digital area and perhaps also take some commercial flights. To sum up, I am extremely grateful and indebted to the secretariat of the Committee on Budgets and many other people in different institutions who literally saved my skin on numerous occasions when I was lost in this budgetary jungle. The only thing I can promise next year, under the Estonian Presidency, is that we can try to do better.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2016-11-30.json", "name": "Ivan Lesay", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, today it is my pleasure to attend the European Parliament’s debate on the general budget of the EU for the financial year 2017. On behalf of the Council, I would like to welcome the positive outcome reached by the Conciliation Committee in the early hours of 17 November after long and sometimes difficult discussions between, but also within, our respective institutions. We have been able to establish a realistic budget providing, on the one hand, the necessary appropriations to cover the needs expected in 2017 but leaving, on the other hand, sufficient margins to cope with unforeseen situations in the course of next year. I would like to underline the constructive atmosphere during our budgetary negotiations. The agreement on the 2017 budget could only be reached due to the readiness for compromise on both sides of the table, with tremendous help from the Commission. Thanks to the excellent teamwork, professional attitudes, mutual trust and Europeanism, we have managed to avoid another crisis, which our citizens would certainly not have understood – and rightly so. Parliament and the Council share the same two main priorities for the financial year 2017: to respond to the ongoing migration, refugee and security crisis, and to boost innovation, growth and employment in Europe. In the Union budget for 2017 we have been able to translate these priorities into concrete figures. Almost EUR 6 billion will be available for tackling migration issues within the Union, for dealing with its root causes and improving living conditions in our neighbourhood, and for reinforcing security in Europe and at its external borders. This amount corresponds to an increase of more than 11% compared to the budget of the previous year. Furthermore, more than EUR 21 billion was agreed for programmes and projects supporting competitiveness for growth and jobs, which translates into an increase of approximately 12% if compared to 2016. Successful programmes such as Erasmus+ are even increased by 19%, and the European Fund for Strategic Investments will see an increase of 25%. These figures are proof of our joint objective. Both Parliament and the Council want to make Europe a better and safer place to live, and to create training and job opportunities, notably for our young people. At the same time, the Union budget agreed for 2017 is a responsible compromise in these times of economic and financial crisis, which have led inter alia to major constraints on national budgets. Let me underline the importance of our joint agreement on reducing the number of staff in all the institutions, bodies and agencies by 5% by 2017. This signal is of the utmost importance for European citizens, especially in times when anti-establishment political parties are gaining stronger support across Europe. The package agreed by the Conciliation Committee includes a number of joint statements, and the Council strongly supports these statements and is fully committed to honouring them. After the successful outcome reached by the Conciliation Committee on 17 November, the Council formally approved the joint text on 28 November, and I am glad to inform you that no Member State voted against the compromise reached between our institutions. Parliament’s approval of the joint text tomorrow would allow the adoption of the general budget for the financial year 2017 within the deadline foreseen by the Treaty. For the first time, as was already mentioned by Mr Arthuis, for the first time since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, two consecutive annual budgetary procedures will have then been completed successfully in conciliation without having recourse to a new draft budget to be submitted by the Commission and a second round of negotiations. This outcome is also remarkable, as we had an additional challenge this year linked to the mid-term review or revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework. Due to the political momentum, the MFF revision has been a high priority, both for this Parliament as well as for the Council. Just in the following item on today’s agenda, and State Secretary Ivan Korčok will be clear here on the next steps which are necessary to finalise the MFF revision. Concerning the EU budget 2017, I would like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Jean Arthuis, and the two rapporteurs, Jens Geier and Indrek Tarand – especially for your constructive approach, Jean, Jens and Indrek – during the whole annual budgetary procedure, for your openness to compromise and for the positive atmosphere. I would like to thank all the other colleagues from Parliament who during the long and stressful hours on the Council’s premises showed patience and a strong spirit of compromise. Finally, I would like to thank Vice-President Kristalina Georgieva for facilitating our negotiations. Without your support, it would have been far more difficult, if not even impossible, to reach a balanced and timely agreement.

And of course we argued, because the needs are bigger than the resources that are available, and we had to make every effort to prioritise on the basis of what would do most for our people.  We have concluded that there are two overwhelming priorities: to manage migration flows and address the security threats, and to support the fragile recovery of our economy, especially with regard to what it means to be jobless for our young people.  I want to recognise each and every one of you who have worked towards finding the difficult, but finally successful room for compromise. This budget has already been described as remarkable because it injects additional funds for very valuable programmes that support the competitiveness of our economy such as Horizon 2020, Erasmus+, the Connecting Europe Facility and COSME. It has been emphasised that we have precious resources – a total of EUR one billion – for support for the Youth Employment initiative, and it has also been emphasised that we have not forgotten people who are depending on our kindness and generosity simply to survive, like the Palestinian refugees that Mr Geier talked about.  What I would add is that in this budget we have also been very careful to support innovation, new ideas, such as piloting a free access to rail for young people so that they can experience Europe, or supporting a European solidarity corps that would allow our young people to work together for Europe.  We have also not forgotten our farmers. In our budget we have EUR 528 million for the dairy sector and an additional EUR 100 million for the extension of the measures put in place to mitigate the impact of the Russian ban. To those of you who have been speaking up on behalf of those who are affected by the Russian ban, I just want to give you the reassurance that, indeed, their needs and the impact felt in the milk-sector are in our budget.  And finally, we have been very careful to allow the flexibility that has served us so well to be present in this budget, including by retaining a margin of EUR 1.1 billion, so that if a shock hits us we have the funds to respond.  Let me in these last hours standing in front of you finish with a word of gratitude to each and every one of you, for keeping me on my toes, for demanding of me and my colleagues to do our utmost, our best, so that our budget goes furthest for the people who rely so much on it.

This in itself is good news. Herewith we are proving to the Council, Commission and Parliament that we are ready to act and to deliver a budget to the European Union in these difficult circumstances and, not only that we have a budget, but that we have a good budget for the Union for next year. It responds to what we established at the beginning of the 7-year Multiannual Financial Framework as our main priorities: growth and jobs. In order to allow for more growth in the European economy to generate more jobs, we are investing the money which we have in innovation and infrastructure. It is those areas which will make the European economy stronger. We are also giving support to students, with EUR 50 million more for the Erasmus programme, and to SMEs and young entrepreneurs through investing EUR 50 million more into the COSME programme. As the Commissioner also said, we have not forgotten about farmers, and I want to see that, in addition to these additional priorities that we have had, we also respond to current and new challenges, making Europe safer again. We are strengthening Europol and Eurojust and we want to stop illegal migration to Europe and manage the refugee crisis which we have been tackling. The negotiations were difficult. We managed to agree, but to my colleagues in Council I also want to say that, if Europe is expected to deliver in the coming years, especially in 2018, Member States have to understand that, if there are new priorities and new demands vis—à-vis the budget of the Union, then of course fresh new resources are clearly also needed. What we are delivering this year is a good budget under difficult circumstances but, if we are expected to deliver more next year, then of course more resources are needed. To conclude, I would like to thank the main rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs, with whom we have worked in a good spirit. I would like to thank the Commissioner for the wisdom and the political sensitivity which she put into the negotiations – and sometimes passion too – to make this budget possible.

I would also like to thank the Slovak Presidency for the way they have conducted the negotiations, and of course our two rapporteurs, who I think have done a fantastic job. Indeed, I would say this is probably one of the best budget agreements we have had for a number of years, and of course the headlines will be the extra EUR 200 million for Heading 1A, research and development money, which is vital if we are to encourage jobs and growth in the European Union, and secondly, the EUR 500 million for the Youth Employment initiative. I think the Youth Employment Initiative has got off to a slow start in many states, but I also believe that youth unemployment is still one of the great scandals of our time. Therefore it is absolutely vital we continue to put money into the Youth Employment Initiative to try and tackle the scourge of youth unemployment. Hopefully colleagues will welcome that. Can I say on the 500 million and the written declaration from the Council, I think it is absolutely vital that they do allow the Commission to come forward with an amending budget next year. Too often in the past we have had written declarations, but when the time comes for the amended budget, the Council has backtracked and blocked it, so for the credibility of the European Union it is absolutely vital that the Council allows that to go ahead. Finally, can I say something on the various flexibility instruments – the flexibility instrument itself, the global margin and the contingency margin. Used in the right way, these flexibility instruments allow us to adapt to changing priorities and problems in the European Union and the EU’s budget, and hopefully we can learn lessons from that in the review of the MFF, and in the next MFF we must build in flexibility into a budget to tackle those new issues as they arise.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 10, "date": "2016-11-30.json", "name": "Bernd Kölmel", "mepid": "124824", "text": " Mr President, on behalf of the ECR Group. First of all, I too should like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Geier and Mr Tarand, for their work, for the report that has been presented. Unfortunately, as in previous years, this budget report is also going in the wrong direction. We have a 1.7% increase in commitment appropriations to EUR 158 billion. Once again, the priorities are wrong, as the EU intends to spend 72% of its expenditure on agriculture and cohesion policy in 2017. This is quite exactly the same as previous years. This means that we do not see any policy change here, we do not see any fundamental reorientation of our budgetary policy. The EU must not, however, be concerned with spending as much money as possible on certain projects, but must be concerned with spending this money in areas where the EU can create added value, where it can act better than the Member States on its own. This is the only reason why we should make money. And this is not true in many areas of the agricultural sector, at least not when it is a net contributor country. These net contributor countries could also distribute their subsidies without going through Brussels. That would be a real contribution to de-bureaucratization. In addition, we have a gap in this budget between commitment appropriations and payment appropriations of EUR 23 billion. I am, unfortunately, quite sure that we will again have problems with unpaid bills here in the future, because we promise more than we can afford. I would also like to point out that we have put forward EUR 500 million for cuts from the ECR, all of which were rejected by the Committee on Budgets. In particular, we had also proposed that we transfer funds for Turkey's accession to the EU to the EU, which was Unfortunately, God also refused.

I am referring to the 76 additional positions for political groups. I also make it very clear that we can meet in this budget, at least partially, our priorities. We support the priority given to youth by increasing credits for student and apprentice mobility, as well as the $500 million to combat youth unemployment. We support the strengthening of credit for SMEs by allocating an additional 50 million to the COSME programme. We support strengthening the capacity for research and development through the additional funds allocated to Horizon 2020. We support the additional appropriations allocated to “Connecting Europe Facility”. We support the additional means provided to assist farmers affected by the Russian embargo, in particular milk producers. And we support the unprecedented effort to address the migration crisis and strengthen security within the European Union.

Of course it is an elaborate budget, worked hard, with sweat — we say — and with an indisputable result. But let me say right away that the two-year rule to which Mr Arthuis was referring, that it was not necessary this year to reach an agreement, we have broken it at a price, at the price of accepting a result of the initial approach of this Parliament and far, above all, of the desirability or necessity of the European Union in its set. It can be said that politics is the art of achieving what is possible. Okay. And surely here we have as much as possible, in the sense that the limit of this' possible 'is set by the Council, and it is clearly and forcefully marked — 'resources available', as Mrs Georgieva said. Do not ask us as Parliament to accept this logic, because if this Parliament accepts this logic, it is simply accepting to be a resonant chamber of decisions that are already taken in advance. The problem is not for this Parliament or for my group; it is for the European Union, for the commitments we have made as the European Union on climate change, the Europe 2020 strategy, the sustainable development goals. All these commitments are not being respected by this budget. The 200 million that appeared at the last minute mean what they mean for the respective games — for Horizon 2020, for COSME, for the Connecting Europe Mechanism, for Erasmus. You speak, as I did this morning, with Mr Bourguignon, of the European Research Council, and you will see what it means in real result, in real budgetary value. The same is true of the 500 million Youth Employment Initiative that will appear — we say — throughout the year, far away from the minimum continuity that would mark us 6 billion for the four years or 1,500 for each of them. And if we add to that the question of the Code of Conduct, which Mr Tarand reminded us, the conclusion is clear: we are also losing the battle of credibility, the battle of image and respect. When we protect controversial actions by former members of the Commission, we are equally damaging our own institutional credibility. Last but not least, we have budget, but we don't have MFPs.

Because it is the same thing that happens over and over again. As it’s Christmas, let’s compare this to an annual pantomime. The Committee on Budgets, the Commission, the Parliament – well we all vote, don’t we, for more EU, more spending, more taxpayers’ money being thrown at this project? Then along comes UKIP and our colleagues in the EFDD – the Five Star Movement and others – and we suggest saving the taxpayer billions of euros. We show how it can be done, we show costs that can be cut and we show victimless cuts, saving money for ordinary people. Well, that makes us the pantomime villain. So you lot all boo. Oh yes you do. And Labour and Conservatives vote against whatever we come up with, and that sometimes shows how much they seem to care about saving money for ordinary people. And then the Council comes and proposes a smaller budget increase, and we have the ‘will they, won’t they?’ moment where the audience wonders if a compromise can be reached. So we go into the early hours of the morning almost every year, wondering whether they can find a new trick to find more taxpayers’ money without actually breaching the budget ceilings. And, after nail—biting tension, the audience on the edge of their seats, a compromise is always reached, the day is saved and everybody lives happily ever after – everybody, of course, except the general public, who have to pay for all of it despite, in the UK’s case, having voted for Brexit. Never mind a 3.3% backdated pay increase for EU Commission officials that went through the Committee on Budgets last time, never mind draft amending budget No 5, which means that the UK will have to fire off another EUR 700 million cheque off to Brussels, and never mind the repeated Court of Auditors reports.

That was, of course, very hard for us to accept. During that process, Vice—President Georgieva showed that she understood our difficulties, and she did something which is probably unique in the relationship between the Commission and the Parliament: she built a fund of trust. When in this budget we were able to repair some of the ills created by the first round of EFSI, I think we established a trustful cooperation between the Vice—President and Parliament. We are going miss her very much, particularly in the next round. The second question is balance. There is an old saying: ‘No taxation without representation’. That was the golden rule when the monarchies were broken and their power was broken. Now we are going to see the same issues.

A budget that satisfies us of course, but that I, as has been said, for the things you are said, that I want to consider as a beginning, a beginning of a path and probably — why not? — maybe, of a turn.

Maybe you can learn from this. On the one hand, I think it is right that we did not tie it to the MFF, because that would have meant that we would not be here today. That's why, in my opinion, you need to think carefully about whether you want to have the egg in the refrigerator or the omelette on the plate. For us, of course, it means that all the more so now at the MFF, where we have to achieve results, we are all the more dependent on flexibility that the well-meaning also give in. There are many good arguments to stick together with the MFF and move back together, which is why my appeal. I would also like to appeal to the fact that solidarity is not a one-way street. In the countries which claim solidarity for themselves, we need more understanding of the fact that solidarity also applies to refugees. We cannot live with some caring for the refugees and the others not. This will drive a large wedge into the European Union. That is why I can only say that the recipient countries have to move much more than they do so far, otherwise we will no longer hold this European Union together.

Let me respond to some of the points that honourable Members have raised. First, there are indeed grounds for concern about the level of payments in the budget for 2017 and, more specifically, about the level of payments for cohesion policy. It is unfortunate but true that the new programmes – the programmes under the current Multiannual Financial Framework – have taken some time to start, with the result that in many of them we are registering delays in implementation. We have been working very hard with Member States to encourage the availability of authorising bodies that can then certify expenditures so we can speed up implementation. That would, of course, have a positive impact on payments. So it is definitely not because we do not have the capacity to provide these funds. It is objectively because of the slower pace of the implementation of the programmes. We are working with the Council – as Minister Lesay would confirm – to find ways to speed up that process. Secondly, a number of speakers made comments about the new ways in which we tried to fund new priorities, more specifically the Turkey Facility trust funds. One of the comments very clearly stated ‘No taxation without representation’. There has to be a role for Parliament. On the Commission side we agree, and we are thinking of ways in which we can make sure that, if there is a need to mobilise extra budgetary resources, it is done in a fair way so that Parliament can have a say without creating processes that may slow down implementation. That is a fair point, and the three institutions will have to reflect on it and address it. Third, I am fully mindful of the fact that there are demands for money that we have not been able to meet within the parameters of this budget. It is therefore up to us in the Commission to follow up implementation very carefully. Should there be a reason for any programme to be slower than anticipated, we would do what we have done in previous years: relocate funds to a higher priority. In other words, what we have done with the budget up to now in this financial framework, gearing up for more agility and more flexibility, we will continue in 2017. Finally, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the Slovak Presidency for – indeed as many of you have recognised – being fair, engaged and determined, and to the budget negotiators, the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, the two rapporteurs and each and every one of you who stayed in the room until four o’clock in the morning so we could have a budget that, as you recognised, is a sound budget.

However, they have shown that our respective institutions share many objectives and that our positions are not that far apart. This has been my impression all the time, and that is why we have been confident that we would be able to reach a deal. It proved not to be too easy but we were happy to do it in the first round, and here we are with the compromise. As I said, the negotiations on the 2017 budget took place under complex circumstances. In spite of this, we worked together in a constructive manner and we were able to reconcile our positions on how to finance the different priorities and actions of the Union.

For, let us not be mistaken, other crises are in sight, other emergencies will justify torturing the budget to try to make it do what, in many cases, it is not able to accomplish. Look at how many budgetary protuberances have multiplied, how many satellites are densifying the European budget galaxy. Juncker Fund for Strategic Investments, Budget Facility for Turkey, Trust Funds here, Trusts Funds there, and tomorrow Juncker Fund for Africa or European Defence Fund. So many peripheral entities that are outside parliamentary control. The creativity of the European Commission cannot hide for a long time the destitution of the European budget and these budgetary practices are, for the Union, a danger. They put the European Union at risk, first of all, because the proliferation of budgetary satellites makes reading a European budget that is already too distant from the citizens. Let us not forget, ladies and gentlemen, that society has the right to ask any public official in its administration to account; this is a fundamental democratic requirement. Without budgetary readability, we risk disconnection. Europe becomes weakened when it proves to be unable to speak directly to European citizens. Finally, such a budgetary contortion tends to accredit illusions and, unfortunately, disappointments. A Union without a budget, committed on all fronts, risks giving a show its helplessness. The urgency is to agree on the competences that Member States are ready to transfer to the Union, because they no longer have the ability to assume them in a globalised world. The budget will then have to be endowed accordingly, to show our ambition to make Europe a world power.

I would like to lead you through, but we agreed with Vice-President Kristalina Georgieva that she will explain more in detail the components of the package that the Council is proposing. Instead, I will share with you a few political remarks, but I would like to start by saying that the Slovak Presidency has a clear guidance for the process of review/revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework, and that was given by the MMF Regulation agreed in 2013. I would like to quote what was written there, namely that the review shall, as appropriate, be accompanied by a legislative proposal for the revision of the MMF Regulation. So that was a clear guidance for us. I would like to say that we started in the Council the work on MMF review/revision with a political debate, so this was not for us, Mr President, a technical exercise. On the contrary, we knew that we needed to have a frank and open political debate where we should ensure consensus, or an opinion, on whether the financial perspective, as agreed back in 2013, corresponds to new challenges both outside of the EU and inside the EU, and whether we have sufficient flexibility to react to unforeseen circumstances or events. So these two objectives were at the forefront of our effort. Number one: whether we need more in terms of financial resources, and to ensure more flexibility. I can say that the outcome of this political debate that we have had under our leadership in the Council was, yes, the Council recognised that the events outside of the Union and internal challenges in fact require additional resources, and that we need more flexibility to react swiftly to the challenges that I have referred to. So on that basis the Commission has proposed, in mid-September this year, a review and revision of the financial perspective that we have agreed in 2013. The second point that I wanted to make is about the process. This was important. Of course the substance matters, but the process this time was extremely important. We all know, both Parliament and the Council and the Commission, that we have been working in a framework given by special legislative procedure. Nevertheless, we in the Council knew that Parliament has well-defined expectations when it comes to the need to revise the financial perspective; we were aware of the resolution that you have adopted, and that is why, in spite of this special legislative procedure, we, together with the Commission, have engaged in a very open dialogue with you, with Parliament. I want to thank your representatives, representatives of this House, led by Chair Arthuis and the two rapporteurs Madam Thomas and Mr Olbrycht. I have to say they were very tough negotiators. There were moments when really it was not easy for us to accommodate everything for which you, Mr Chair, Madam rapporteur, rapporteur Olbrycht, have been fighting for. It was very difficult with you. But, when I look back, I dare say that it was thanks to your perseverance that in fact we were able together to come up with a package, which I think duly reflects both the need for additional resources and for more flexibility, so I think it is to your credit and your merit that it is included in this package. Thirdly, as I said, I will not go into details. I would like to kindly ask Kristalina to lead you through, but I would like to say that this package, when it comes to resources, is giving a chance to mobilise more than EUR 6 billion to be allocated for the most outstanding priorities until the end of this financial perspective. Two, I would like to say that 85% of these additional resources represent fresh money. Redeployment is part of it, but it was needed, because you know that the resources of the Member States are limited – they are scarce – so redeployment is a legitimate part of it. But 85% of additional resources represent fresh money, and this fresh money will be used in the most pressing challenges, starting with migration, with security, with youth unemployment. And when I speak about youth unemployment, I think that is not an issue of everyday practice that the Council has in fact agreed more than the Commission has proposed, so the Council is proposing for Youth Employment initiative 20% more than the original proposal of the Commission matched with additional resources. I think we will have a good deal to fight what are the concerns of our citizens, that is, youth unemployment. Secondly, when it comes to flexibility, very quickly, we know we are living in difficult times, and we need to react swiftly to the events outside of the Union and inside the EU, and therefore I would just remind you that what the Council has agreed on is increasing the emergency aid reserve, the flexibility instrument – additional funds allocated by reshuffling of special instruments – and we increased the ceilings for global margin for payments and extended the scope for global margin for commitments to cover also the areas of migration and security. So this is just a fraction of what the flexibility and the changes to flexibility can bring if we agree on this revision. In conclusion, I dare say that this is the moment where we have to bear in mind that it is possible to agree on a package (or it was not possible to agree on the package) where everyone’s demands, requests and expectations can be met up to 100%. In politics this is rarely the case where everyone can be happy up to 100%. At the same time, I dare say, on behalf of the Presidency, when I look at the moment where we started in mid-September, and compare to where we are today, where the landing zone possibly could be, I am quite proud, because I would like to remind you that we started at the moment when the appetite to go beyond mere review in the Council and engage in a real revision which could be a result of our common effort, was very low. So I think we, all the three engaged institutions – the Commission, Parliament and the Council – can proudly present this package where the Council has found a broad agreement on its element on 15 November. And two, it is important for me to recall in this House that if you look at the package as it stands right now, I think the elements that are in there represent the maximum possible of what the European Parliament’s demands were. And this is why I hope this House at the end of the day will look at it politically – look at it as a chance for our citizens – and in fact Parliament will be able to give consent for this Multiannual Financial Framework mid-term review. I thank you for your attention and I am looking forward to your interventions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 55, "date": "2016-11-30.json", "name": "Kristalina Georgieva", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, it is indeed very satisfying that this time, when I talk about the mid-term process, I will no longer use the word ‘review’. I will talk about mid—term revision, because the proposal we have in front of us is a proposal for revision. Indeed a lot has been done – also in informal consultations with Parliament – to move us towards a place where the job of providing resources to our citizens for the remaining period is well done. I do, of course, fully recognise that there are aspects of this where Parliament does not feel completely satisfied. I realise that there will be opportunities today to debate, and perhaps to continue after today. But let me outline the key elements in this broad agreement that the Council has proposed. First, a very important element is what we would call top-ups – in other words, additional financial resources towards our top priorities. The total of these additional resources is significant – EUR 5.1 billion – of which EUR 3.9 billion is for migration and security and EUR 1.2 billion for the Youth Employment Initiative. I do recognise that, while it is below what Parliament recommended, the proposal is above the original Commission proposal, which was for EUR 1 billion. We also have to put on record that for Heading 1A the Council’s broad agreement falls behind the Commission proposal and even further behind Parliament’s proposal. The Council has requested that these top-ups be financed from redeployments within Heading 1A. We think that there should be more flexibility regarding redeployments. We accept the fact that we have to squeeze the budget for priorities, but there has to be more flexibility, and they anyway need to be decided in the course of the annual budget procedures. I think that there is some room here for a pragmatic compromise solution that fully respects the prerogatives of the budgetary authority. It is not for the Commission but for the Council, the budgetary authorities and the Parliament to decide, but there may be some space here to reach a pragmatic outcome. The second – and actually the most difficult and therefore the most valuable – part of this package is on flexibility. Why? Because any amendment of the MFF regulation requires unanimity. It requires all Members of the Council to agree. In that sense I genuinely congratulate the Slovak Presidency for guiding the Council towards that broad agreement on flexibility. What are we talking about? We are talking about sizeable increases in flexibility in terms both of commitments and payments. In very simple terms, if there is no agreement on this proposal – if it falls apart – we will have no funds available under the flexibility instrument in 2017, and that is the EUR 740 million that otherwise would be available. Secondly, over the years 2017—2020 we would have additional availabilities for special instruments amounting to a bare minimum of EUR 1.3 billion. It would definitely be more than EUR 1.3 billion. Why? Because we are calculating only one year of what is left over from the European Globalisation Fund and European Union Solidarity Fund. It is very unlikely that in the other years there would be nothing left over based on historical evidence, but we have taken a very conservative approach to count only what we are certain would be available. This is critical for us in terms of building flexibilities as, without an agreement, the possibility to use the margins left under the ceilings in the previous financial year for financing additional measures via the global margin for commitments would end next year. If we want to continue, we will have to have unanimously agreed revision. Last but not least, the Council has agreed to raise the global margin for payments available in 2019 and 2020 when we know that demand for payments will be highest by a total of EUR 6 billion at current prices. The Council has also agreed to settle in a very pragmatic and positive way the issue of the disputed EUR 350 million in payment appropriations which arose in 2014 in relation to the mobilisation of EUR 2.8 billion from the contingency margin to reduce the backlog of payments. So, from that perspective, what we see is a chance to expand flexibility that is pretty much exhausted as a result of the crises that have been pressuring us. In conclusion, we have a very valuable opportunity to revise the MFF and give us more space. It is a matter of accepting our responsibilities – all of us – to make sure that we have that space to do what is necessary. From the Commission side, we would be happy to facilitate further discussions. We believe that we have all been putting our best foot forward in terms of bringing what we believe is right and to end this calendar year knowing that in the future we have more money and more space to do what is necessary.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 56, "date": "2016-11-30.json", "name": "Jan Olbrycht", "mepid": "28288", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — Mr President! Commissioner! Mr. Minister! There is a fundamental difference between the previous debate and this debate. In the previous debate, we clearly emphasised that we had come to the end of a certain action together, that is, we have achieved a certain goal. During this debate, we are still in the process of investigating the target, we are still before the end, and therefore the tone of our debate is somewhat different. I would like to stress that the European Parliament, in preparing this perspective, has made clear that it will be necessary to check in the middle of the period whether it has actually been well constructed. A review needs to be done, a review, and if it becomes necessary, a review will need to be carried out. We are very pleased that despite the first negative responses to our proposals for revision, both the Commission prepared its proposal for revision, as well as the Council, the Slovak Presidency, took up this topic and agreed that the perennial perspective needs to be revised. What does it mean need to be revised? It requires change. Since it needs change, it is a matter of approach to what needs to be changed. Some essential elements have already been introduced in the 2017 budget. They have opened some action, and now we need to take a step further and actually improve or change the financial outlook for the next years in line with what we agreed in the 2017 budget. The European Parliament, we as rapporteur, we very much appreciate the efforts of the Slovak Presidency to develop a unified position in the Council on the perennial perspective and revision. We also very much appreciate the European Commission's contribution to making this proposal important, interesting and indeed acceptable. At the same time, however, I would like to say that the European Parliament is very remarkable to follow the dynamics of what is happening in the Council. We see what's happening with Italy's protest. We have information from the Italian government that the Italian government expects from the Presidency of such talks so that the revision would be more ambitious, so that the revision would actually indicate more flexibility, to greater flexibility in the following years. If that is the case, we understand that the Council's proposal is not yet ready and that work is ongoing. Today we are not yet at the stage of agreeing — or not — because we understand that the situation in the Council is still dynamic. We accept that and we enter, therefore, into this process. The European Parliament is therefore looking forward to further talks, which also coincide with talks with the Italian government. We would also like to point out that the European Parliament will definitely indicate the need to strengthen the flexibility elements, in particular to increase the flexibility of the EU budget, the flexibility instrument, the emergency aid provision, the global margin commitments and recycling of unused cancellations of obligations. On this, it looks like we agree, in part, with the expectations of the Italian government. We expect openness from the Slovak Presidency and talks that will seek to reach agreement so that we in Parliament, in accordance with the consent procedure, can finally approve or confirm our position. We expect openness of the Slovak Presidency and further talks.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 57, "date": "2016-11-30.json", "name": "Isabelle Thomas", "mepid": "114279", "text": " on behalf of the S&D Group. — (FR) Mr President, Mr Representative of the Council, allow me to begin by joining the tribute paid by my colleagues to Vice-President Georgieva, to whom I wish well, although I am sure, I hope, that she is not quite a party. To talk about the revision, I have to go back to the 2017 budget for a moment, as my co-rapporteur colleague did. These negotiations have been rough, which always leaves me perplexed since we share most of the priorities: jobs, growth and especially youth. We have stood on course and, despite daylight saving time, we reached an acceptable agreement, notably thanks to the €500 million for youth employment and the additional EUR 200 million for growth and employment. As you have said, Mr Representative of the Council, this is for once new money and not redeployment, that is, without cutting into existing programmes but by mobilizing unused budgetary margins that are essential to meet current challenges. Parliament therefore obtained the relaunch of the European programme to combat youth unemployment, which no longer had commitment appropriations in 2016. But if we are to fight youth unemployment, we will not be content with an extension for the 2017 programme, but we must be able to make sure that this programme will be effective in the years to come. The same applies to our economic stimulus instruments. In short, the financial framework of the European Union 2014-2020, adopted in 2013, needs an ambitious revision and I welcome both the Commission and the Slovak Presidency's efforts to recognise it, and I thank you, Mr Council Representative, for agreeing to open the discussion with a view to a compromise in which no one will be 100% satisfied, nor the Parliament or the Council. The arrival of refugees, COP 21 commitments, agricultural crises, underinvestment, internal security, defence, in short, all these upheavals require it. However, we must be aware that everything we achieved in the 2017 budget is likely to be lost if we accept the Council proposal on the revision of the European Union's financial framework as it is today. I know that the Council does not yet have a unanimous position, as Mr Olbrycht said, that discussions continue, but I must insist. At the moment, the account is not there, but I am sure our discussions will be fruitful. Parliament could not accept, I do not know which annex would reduce the multiannual financial framework and further constrain the annual budgets, while we see all the additional challenges that have arisen since 2013. On the contrary, this revision must be an opportunity to increase flexibilities — as you said, I think we all share it here — so that the European budget can adapt to a changing world. To strengthen existing instruments such as the Flexibility Instrument, we are proposing €750 million a year. For the emergency aid reserve, we ask for EUR 400 million a year — you see that we are even lower than the Commission's proposal. Similarly, the European Commission had proposed that unused commitment appropriations be reinstated into the Union budget. We propose that discommitments from at least two headings be reincorporated into the budget: Heading 3 on security of citizenship and heading 4 'Europe in the world' to feed into the overall margin of commitments. On payments, serious measures must be taken against a payment crisis at the end of budget programming. The maximum ceilings for the overall margin of payments need to be increased. Accounting outside of Payment ceilings for special instruments remains debated on the table and will be a major issue at the end of the period, let us bear in mind that the current financial framework is both lower than the previous one and yet more demanded. It must therefore be fully utilized. Because, if we are talking today about the revision of the current financial framework 2014-2020, tomorrow will open debates on the forthcoming financial perspectives and I would like to recall a reality that causes many difficulties that we face: 90% of the budget the Union is based on direct contributions from the Member States. This system is inherently perverse, as it encourages each State to reduce its contribution to the Union budget as much as possible in order to keep the maximum for its national budget. The general European interest is therefore swept away in favour of national selfishness by the system itself. Worse, the overall result is a reduced budget, ultimately contrary to the interests of the Member States. This situation is not a fatality, solutions exist. These are own resources. As has been the case in the past, own resources must take a prominent place in the European budget. We are waiting for a strong proposal from the high-level group, of course, and we would be glad, if not delighted, if the Council would also issue a signal to that effect.

And anyone who works here must not conform to anyone that state programmes can permanently create jobs. Ultimately, these are all market distortions. Because we have to make a distinction: where aid is needed in the short term, of course, it can and should be provided, but the aid provided by the EU is usually started once and then continued on a permanent basis. We can't and shouldn't afford that. Nor should we take this opportunity to hide the fact that many euros are fixing problems that we would not have without the euro.

First question: is there a need for a review? The European Parliament has always said yes, and it needed a firm determination to ask for it, and this was done when our House approved the good report by Mr Olbrycht and Mrs Thomas. Then we needed a good legislative proposal from the Commission and, Mrs Georgieva, you met our expectations: there was a legislative proposal from the Commission and I said, as soon as we became aware of it, that it was a good basis for discussion to reach an agreement. Then there was a need for a positive will on the part of the Council, and I must say to the Slovak Presidency that it happily surprised me. We did not expect such a positive attitude on the part of the Council to the Commission's request. Second question: do we need additional resources? Yes! The current corset is too narrow, the financial framework does not allow us to meet the urgent needs we are facing. Are there any additional means? Yes! Are they well affected? Yes! They are in line with the right priorities, both youth employment and the management of migratory pressure and security. Is that enough? I think not, and I think in particular, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the corset you are making for heading 1a is not wise. This is an area in which practice only through redeployment seems to me a mistake in relation to the requirements. Third question: Is there a need to improve flexibility? Yes! Is there one proposed? Yes! Is that enough? I think we can do a little better and that, in particular, the requests we made in the Olbrycht and Thomas report seemed to me more sensible than those you have withholding.

We still do not have in our hands, as perhaps it would have been appropriate, the formal proposal, the proposal which should already be submitted to formal consideration and therefore to an immediate next vote. That's not yet the situation. We have your explanation, and what Mrs Georgieva has just given us, but as it was already seen coming — a little — we confirm that the mantra, that the new mantra, the new word that fixes everything, that resolves everything is 'flexibility'. “Flexibility” fits everything: new objectives; new and not so new problems; emergencies; immigration; economy; security, etc. And it is obvious that we are abusing the concept of flexibility. I sincerely believe that the Member States are once again saying 'no' to Europe. That's the evidence, at least until this moment. Of course, with the UK's abstention and still doubting what Italy's final position will be, pending more from its own referendum than from this very European debate — or which, in any case, has called for time in that regard. I sincerely believe that the Council has imposed an undue separation between the revision of the financial framework and that of the annual budgets that develop and implement it. Mrs Georgieva told us the other day, at the hottest point of conciliation: 'We must concentrate on the effort to exercise budgetary authority every year'. And it's true, I agree with that. But let us also accept that the appropriate logic would be for this exercise of budgetary authority to take place within an effectively known, agreed, shared, multi-annual forecast framework as the financial framework should be. In the proposal we know so far there is no growth in real spending ceilings. There is limited flexibility and generous use of available margins. That's it. That is why, when we now hear President Juncker, on the other hand, talk about growth, fiscal policy, the turn to start abandoning austerity, we cannot understand what seems incoherent: the counterproductive rigidity in the role of the European Union budget, which the Council's proposal still looks like, and apparently, also of the Commission. The decision should now be how we grow it from its initial dimension — now it is Horizon 2020, COSME, CEM — and not how to recover the EFSI cuts, at what rate and if we recover them all — that we do not recover them. We should be discussing how we make it grow. We should be discussing how we assume our rightful responsibility in the refugee crisis — and therefore how we add resources there. We should be discussing how we have sufficient resources for internal and external security issues.

I have heard so many colleagues and also the Commissioner ask for new resources to combat unemployment, for growth, for small and medium-sized enterprises, to finance innovation: it is all beautiful, but for doing this serves money and today the money is not there. Member States are reluctant to give money to the European Union, for two reasons: today they are experiencing an endless economic crisis and austerity that has compressed Member States' incomes and resources and today They do not believe — as Mr Maragall said — in the European Union, that the European Union can spend this money well. It is pointless to talk about the flexibility of the multiannual financial framework and ask for more resources, when at the first opportunity the hawk, as the president of the Eurogroup did yesterday, invites exclusively to strict adherence to the rules. If we want more resources, we need to get Member States and Europe back to growth, and we know that today, the main bloc on growth, has a name and there is a responsible one. That responsible is the euro, the single currency that forces squeeze and austerity. Without the release from this constraint we are not going anywhere. We can discuss flexibility all we want, but we won't come to any results, it will be pointless. As useless as the controversy of Prime Minister Renzi, who wants to veto the multi-year financial framework. I believe that after the referendum on 4 December, if he is still the Italian prime minister, he will return to his steps and give in immediately to pressure from Juncker, Merkel and his associates. Why Renzi does not tell Italian citizens that, having voted yes to amending budget number 5, forced Italian taxpayers to pay a billion euros additional to the European budget.

At the same time, Erdogan blackmailed the Union with hordes of illegal immigrants and directly threatens Greece and Cyprus with invasion of their territories.

Its position to receive a three-year operational plan with general quotas on the important aspects of the Union's economic policy, great room for flexibility, with an emphasis on real growth, work, not just the employment of citizens and the treatment of finances imbalances between Member States.

With this review, we show that we have flexibility for what is happening to us — from migration, through youth unemployment, the agriculture crisis, to lack of investment, investment in research and development, into startups — that's all we have to respond to. However, we must take care of the nature of individual policies. The fact is that cohesion policy contracts much more in the early years, and only later a lot more is paid and we should not jeopardize the future payments needed for cohesion policy.

And, in order to respond to a British Eurosceptic MEP who spoke earlier, I am also referring to the decrease in the rate of the pound sterling, which has produced serious effects for British citizens and the European Union.

We do have a critical task to complete. I heard many voices expressing the wish that it is completed before the end of this year. This is very wise, because we do need to be able to predict how we are going to approach the remaining time of this multi—year financial perspective, and we do need to have the certainty for funds that are going to be absolutely essential for our work to be done. Just to give you one example: we have agreed that it is critical for the European Union to better protect its external borders. For that reason we have proposed the creation of a new agency, the Border and Coast Guard Agency. When we look into the future of implementation, we of course count on having the space to fund it, not only in 2017 – for which we do now have the money – but also in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Or when we think about how critical it is to address the needs of young people to have jobs and to be able to benefit from education, it is not good enough to know that we have boosted these funds for 2017. We do need predictability for 2018, 2019 and 2020. So, in that sense, reaching an agreement that allows us to provide these funds in the future so that the money will be there for multi—year programmes of that significance, I believe in my heart of hearts means that we have to find a space for an agreement that allows us to have this predictability. Secondly, I agree with those who said that we cannot resolve everything with flexibility. That is very true but, if we have more flexibility in the budget, we can respond when unexpected events occur. I would remind us all that we have generated three times more money to deal with migration and refugees inside Europe and in their countries of origin because of the flexibility that Parliament demanded as part of the agreement for the MFF. But we are now coming close to exhausting the reserves we have had in terms of flexibility. Therefore we ought to build more and expand it further. Third, is this really fresh money? Yes it is, because we are taking money from the margins and we are allocating it predictably. You might say that the margins are part of the MFF. Yes and no because, if we do not make a commitment and if we do not expand the global margin for commitment and make it available in future years, there will be no commitments to demand further payments from the budget. In fact EUR 5.1 billion extra is EUR 5.1 billion extra. It would have not been there without that revision. Is it true that we are facing more demands than we have resources? Yes; since 2012, every year we have been struggling to cope with the demands on the EU budget. However, we also need to be honest with ourselves. Unanimity is required to go above the ceilings, and this unanimity is not being met. It is quite simply not there. Should we continue – and I look at the Parliament – to advocate for the needs of European programmes? Yes. Maybe that moment will come when this unanimity to go above and beyond the ceilings is there, but it is not there today. If we do not tell ourselves the truth, we will not be able to do what we are here for, namely to serve our people. It is as simple as that: to make sure that everything is done to get the resources to them in a predictable and secure manner. Do I have regrets? Yes. I thought we had come up with a very good proposal to create a crisis reserve using the commitments. We put it forward, we lobbied for it and we argued for it, but neither net payers nor net recipients liked it. They didn’t like it. They didn’t accept it – and, yes, I am looking at Mrs Thomas, who wants to have a second bite of this particular apple, bon appétit, hein? But I think, if I am to respond to what people have been saying, that we should continue to work – of course we will continue to work. The work is done only when it is done.

I shall try to once again reiterate what I said at the beginning, and I feel confirmed, after having listened to you, that the package that the Council has agreed on is a good package, and the question, I dare say, now is not whether the Council is ready to accept 100% of what Parliament would like to see there, but the question is whether with this package we are better off than we would be without it. And I dare say if you look at the elements that are already in there, with additional money mobilised and with increased flexibility, I dare say the EU and its citizens will be better off. I know too, distinguished Members of the House, that you would like to see more, but this does not mean that the Council is less concerned about the challenges and the circumstances that are challenging us every day. It is not the case that the Council is less concerned. The question is whether we can land at a compromise which would be acceptable to all of us. I have to say as well, however, that it is very difficult for me to hear that additional resources and flexibilities are hot air. This is not hot air: this is exactly the opposite. This is something that we can have in addition to what was agreed back in 2013. I have to say, too, that I totally agree with Vice-President Georgieva when she explained why this is fresh money. Frau Trüpel, ich glaube, man kann nicht sagen, dass es sich nicht um frisches Geld handelt. Die Begründung, die wir von Frau Georgieva gehört haben, ist eine ganz exakte Begründung. Und zusätzlich möchte ich noch sagen: Wissen Sie, warum das frisches Geld ist? Es muss zusätzlich zu dem transferiert werden, was wir 2013 verabschiedet haben. Es muss von den Steuerzahlern aus den Mitgliedstaaten zusätzlich transferiert werden. Deshalb denke ich, kann man nicht sagen, dass es sich hier trotz der Tatsache, dass es sich innerhalb der Obergrenze bewegt, um nicht frisches Geld handelt. Denn wir könnten auch kein Geld haben. Deswegen ist es wichtig, dass wir das ganz realistisch sehen.  And finally, I have been listening very carefully to this debate, and I have to recognise that there is an expectation and there is a demand here to continue our exchange. However, I have to say, fairly, that I see very limited space, if any, for further amendments or changes to what the Council has agreed on the 16th. But after having four meetings with you, Mr President, with Madam Thomas and Mr Olbrycht, I see no obstacle to having another one on a political level before the Council sends a formal request for consent to this House. I think this will only confirm that both the Presidency and the Council are ready to listen, so I say: why don’t we meet again in the days to come? But I would like to invite you to remain realistic when it comes to the possibilities of further improving the deal, because I would like to say that what we are offering is a good deal for our citizens.

It is especially important for Ghana. In 2015, Ghanaian exports to the European Union accounted for EUR 2.4 billion. 46% of Ghana’s exports was to the European Union. The consequences of voting ‘no’ to this agreement, of not ratifying this agreement, would be dramatic for Ghana. They would face a wall of EU tariffs. Even though the average tariff for Ghana would be around 8.13% – it might not sound much but it is a prohibitive tariff level; for many products in areas where Ghana has a lot of exports, the tariffs are even higher. For bananas, for example, they would have most favoured nation duties of 19.7%, and for prepared tuna 20.7%. The consequences of saying ‘no’ to this would be dramatic for Ghana. And why would they face this wall of tariffs? The answer is simple: because the current trade regime the EU has with Ghana – the Market Access Regulation – is running out in 2016. That is the reason why we have to take this decision now. And then one might ask: why does the current regime run out in 2016? The answer to that is actually pretty simple: it is because we in this House decided so. With a broad majority. I remember negotiating with my good friend and colleague David Martin, on specifically that date, to say that this existing trade regime should run out in 2016. But the thing with this trade agreement is that it is actually a pretty good agreement. It is a good agreement that we present instead of the current regime. Ghana will get duty-free access to the European Union from day one. 75% of Ghanaian tariff lines will be liberalised, yes, but they will be liberalised over 15 years. People talk about the fact that we need to have asymmetrical agreements, taking into account that they do not have the same level of development in many areas and competitiveness. I would say if this is not asymmetrical, taking that into account, I cannot imagine what would be. They get free access: from day one, 75% of their lines will be liberalised, but over 15 years. It is worth repeating. And the tariffs removed in Ghana are mainly things like industrial machines, pumps, generators, turbines, certain vehicles, boats, aircraft, cars, certain chemicals – all of those are used as input to Ghanaian industries and not produced locally. Eliminating import duties on these products will reduce the cost of imports for local businesses and increase their competitiveness. What we didn’t liberalise is mainly agriculture, the sensitive stuff, things like chicken and other meat, tomatoes, onions, sugar, tobacco, beer, clothes, wheat, frozen fish, some industrial things like industrial plastics. We did take their needs into account. And there are safeguards in this agreement to protect the Ghanaian side. But not only that. The reason I speak about Ghana now and what this means to Ghana is no serious actors have questioned that this will have any serious implications on the European Union and our trade policy. Those who are criticising say it is bad for Ghana, but we should let Ghana decide what is good or bad for Ghana, and Ghana is a democracy. The government and parliament have with broad majority supported this, and why should we then reject it? Let me therefore finish by quoting the Minister of Foreign Affairs from Ghana, Hanna Tetteh, in her letter to the Committee on International Trade, where she says: ‘We believe, when it comes to determine the matter of what is in our best national interest, we, as elected representatives of the people of Ghana, the Parliament of the Republic of Ghana, have both the legitimacy and the mandate to make that determination, and not to any other third party, irrespective of however well intended such third party decisions might be’.

This is actually the third time this year that I have had the opportunity to discuss with you in plenary the agenda of our Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with Africa. I came in February, we had a debate on an oral question on the sustainable development provisions of the EU—West Africa EPA and we had a good debate in December on the SADC EPA, following which you gave your assent, so that has now entered into force and I thank you for that. We are now working with our friends in SADC countries with great enthusiasm to put that into practice and to make it to function as intended.  Throughout Africa we are moving to the implementation phase as more and more African parliaments are giving their ratification to the EPAs. The Trade for All communication recognised that fulfilling the promise of these agreements will be a major deliverable for the next few years. It is now for us and our partners to fully use trade as a tool for growth, sustainable development and employment.  In West Africa a large majority of countries have signed the regional EPA which, as you know, ultimately intends to foster and strengthen the regional integration process in that part of Africa. We are committed to the conclusion of that EPA together with the regional organisation. But, while that process is ongoing, Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire decided to keep up their economic development by preserving their access to the EU market.  They did so by reviving the best option available at the moment, an interim bilateral EPA. The interim EPA with Ghana remains compatible with our objective of achieving a regional EPA which will, of course, ultimately replace this one. We are continuing to work hard to get a West Africa EPA in place for the near future but today let us focus on the one we have on the table with Ghana. It is a self—standing, WTO—compatible trade agreement of unlimited duration. It immediately guarantees Ghana’s exporters duty—free, quota—free access to the EU market. The agreement protects local development through safeguard clauses and a limited and gradual liberalisation focusing on equipment and inputs. Many provisions deal with support for Ghanaian producers to meet EU standards, which is, of course, good for farmers and for the transformation of agricultural products. The EPA also contains cooperation provisions to accompany Ghana during the implementation of the agreement. I would also like to highlight that the EPA is anchored in the provisions of the Cotonou Agreement. This includes the essential elements and sustainable development objectives, its provisions on labour, environment, democratic principles and human rights. This is very important to remember.  When I came here in February – I think it was in Strasbourg actually – I committed to having sustainable development as a strong element of the implementation of all our EPAs. It is true that this bilateral EPA with Ghana has been negotiated with 2018 in view and it does not contain a sustainable development chapter on top of what we have in the Cotonou Agreement. But it is linked to the Cotonou Agreement and this does not mean that we are not active in this area.  We are committed to engaging in a dialogue on sustainable development in the EPA Joint Committee that will be created by this Agreement. The same goes for involving civil society. There are provisions in the EPA that give us a hook for putting this into place. For example it is foreseen that civil society organisations can participate as observers in the EPA Joint Committee, and I can guarantee you that Ghana is very committed to doing this. Ghana is one of the thriving democracies in the region. They have a well—developed civil society in place. That is not always the case in the region, but in Ghana it is. The Foreign Affairs Minister, Hanna Tetteh, made it clear when she came to the Committee on International Trade and she said to you – and I spoke to her as well – that they have already started to engage civil society and they are committed to sustainable development at the highest level. This is about companies and about people. A substantial part of Ghana’s trade is done with the EU. Ghana’s exports to the EU amounted to EUR 2.6 billion last year. On cocoa and bananas they are heavily dependent on us, and non-traditional exports, such as processed tuna, depend on the EU market even more. Those exports contribute to building local value chains which involve SMEs and create jobs, directly and indirectly. So this provides a solid environment for local and foreign investors, which should not be underestimated because when European investors settle in Ghana, they increase the share of formal employment, which ensures more protection for Ghanaian workers as well.  Finally, I believe that the successful implementation of the EPAs with Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire and other African countries will be the best proof that our trade responds to the many challenges faced with our partners. It is also the best way to convince remaining partners to opt for the regional EPA, demonstrating on the ground the benefits of deepening trade relationships with us. I hope there will be strong support for this when you vote on it tomorrow in the plenary.

I believe that this interim agreement has the potential to provide growth, stability and development for Ghana. Let us be honest, this is not something that will be of major importance to make the European economy grow. We are not doing this for the European economy. It will have marginal effects on the European economy. We are doing this to support the development, the diversification of the industry and the stability of a country like Ghana, a rare democracy in a region where that is not always the case. Ghana’s commitment to the regional EPA is very strong. They want to integrate and to develop in a transparent manner. As the Foreign Minister, who we have been quoting here today, said in the letter to you, she is very committed to making this happen, and she has already started to work with the civil society organisations and will continue to jointly work with them.  There are indeed alternative options to the EPA that have been voiced, but they are not realistic. They do not provide the same advantages to Ghana as the EPA does. Some of them are not even WTO-compatible. But this agreement is something that Ghana wants. They have chosen it and they have decided on it in a parliamentary vote by their democratically elected Parliament. I am sure you have also read the letter where the Foreign Minister, Ms Tetteh, explains this very clearly.  It is true that we are working on a regional agreement but, as you know, there are some countries blocking this. Why should Ghana be blocked while we are waiting for this to happen? It will happen someday. We are working very hard on it, but we should not punish a country which wants to cooperate with us, which wants to be a close ally and which has chosen this path. The regional EPA is a way to overcome the challenges regionally. We are working on this. It is of course up to West Africa to decide about the future, but for the moment that agreement is not available. So let us work together for a successful interim bilateral EPA with an important country which wants to engage with us and, at the same time, continue our advocacy, together with the West African regional organisation, for a regional EPA.

For the first time in history, the United States of America are entering into a binding international agreement on data protection standards. This House has asked for such an agreement between the EU and the United States for years and, finally, we will have it.  So what is the agreement about? First, it establishes a comprehensive framework of data protection principles, safeguards and rights when personal data is transferred for criminal law enforcement purposes between the EU and the USA. Those protection standards do not only apply when law enforcement authorities exchange information, but also when private entities transfer data to law enforcement authorities, for example European airlines to the US Department of Homeland Security under the PNR Agreement. Second, this framework does not only cover EU-US agreements, but also bilateral data transfer agreements between the EU Member States and the United States. This is a huge success, which has not been clear from the beginning because Member States resisted the inclusion of bilateral deals. It was finally included because the European Parliament consistently asked for it as one of the conditions for giving consent to such an agreement. The agreement establishes a right to judicial redress for EU citizens before US courts should they think their rights under this agreement have not been respected. It was again the heavy pressure from the European Parliament which in the end made it clear that the US needs to open up their judicial redress avenues to EU citizens in order to restore mutual trust. Earlier this year, the US Congress amended the Privacy Act in order to do this. I am not sure how often it has happened in history that the US Congress, which had a hard time agreeing on anything in recent years, has changed US law because we have asked them to do so.  It is also important to clarify what the agreement is not about. The Umbrella Agreement is not a data transfer agreement. Article 1 clearly specifies that the agreement cannot be a legal base for any transfer of personal data, and that a separate legal base shall always be required. The Umbrella Agreement does not limit any individual rights. On the contrary, it increases the level of data protection where data are being transferred already today. We have now made it crystal clear that if the US side restricts rights under this agreement, the EU authorities can consider that the USA is not delivering sufficient safeguards for data protection enshrined in the agreement and suspend data transfers. This is all clarified now in the Commission’s declaration to the agreement, which I share and which will be published together with the agreement, so it will guide any legal interpretation. The uncertainty of the incoming Trump administration is just one more reason to conclude the agreement while President Obama still in office. If we conclude this agreement, the United States will be bound by international law, which gives unconditional data protection rights.  There are motions on the table to refer the agreement to the Court of Justice, and even though I am convinced – after intense discussions with our Legal Service, the Commission, data protection authorities, and other experts – that the agreement is good enough and fully complies with EU law, I have no problem voting in favour of this request if doubts remain with some of the Groups. But let me be clear: this agreement is a huge step forward for fundamental rights and, in particular, for the right to data protection in times when data exchange is key for effective law enforcement cooperation between the EU, its Member States, and other partners in the world. With the Umbrella Agreement, we will restore trust in the effective protection of personal data as a precondition for better law enforcement information exchange. Thank you very much.

It is with this in mind that I ask you for your consent to the Agreement so as to allow its conclusion under the current US administration. Let me briefly recall what the Umbrella Agreement is about and what type of immediate benefits it will bring to Europeans. First – and this is unprecedented, not only in the trans-Atlantic context, but also more generally at international level – for the first time we will have a genuine data protection agreement in the field of law enforcement cooperation. By that, I mean not an agreement that authorises transfers, but instead an agreement that focuses exclusively on data protection safeguards and the rights of individuals, an agreement that contains the same type of catalogue of principles, safeguards and rights that we have in our data protection legislation. These include purpose limitation, restrictions on onward transfers, the right to access and rectification, administrative and judicial redress, and independent oversight. In assessing the value of the Umbrella Agreement, let us also recall the current situation and what the status quo would mean. As we speak, data is being shared between EU Member States and US law enforcement authorities. These exchanges are taking place on the basis of legal instruments, in particular bilateral agreements that very often lack basic privacy safeguards or contain only limited protections. As we know, these transfers will continue to take place and are likely to intensify, notably in response to terrorism threats. The Umbrella Agreement addresses this serious deficit of protection. With its entry into force, all these transfers will benefit from the additional safeguards and rights provided by the Umbrella. In other words, this is an agreement that will bring immediate and very substantial improvements to the situation of the EU data subjects. In doing so, the Umbrella Agreement will also remedy the current imbalance of protections between both sides of the Atlantic. Today Americans already enjoy these protections when their data is transferred to the EU, while this is not the case for Europeans when their data is transferred to the United States. This is why you asked us, in your resolution of 12 March 2014, to put rights for EU citizens on an equal footing with rights for US citizens. The consequence of all this is clear. It is first and foremost the protection of the fundamental rights of our citizens which will benefit from the agreement. I see no benefit in delaying its conclusion. This will only be to our detriment.  I would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Mr Albrecht, for his support on this important agreement. The help from the Parliament has also been essential to ensure the adoption by the US Congress of the US Judicial Redress Act, which extends important rights to our citizens that were previously reserved only for Americans. I would like to thank all of you for your continuous support on that.  I know that certain aspects of the Umbrella Agreement have raised questions among some Members of this House. The Commission has taken these concerns very seriously, and on various occasions provided explanations and clarifications to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. Most recently we have transmitted to Parliament a statement that contains these clarifications. The Commission will issue this statement at the time of the conclusion of the Agreement by the EU and it will be published in the Official Journal. While I understand that some of you still have reservations, I hope that our central message has been heard. This is a big leap in terms of data protection, and a major improvement compared to the status quo. This includes the adoption of the Judicial Redress Act, something which would not have been possible without the pressure stemming from the Umbrella Agreement negotiations. Making the Judicial Redress Act operational still requires that the US Attorney General designates the EU as being covered by the Act. This is a necessary step for full implementation, and we have agreed with the United States that the official notifications triggering the entry into force will only be exchanged once this designation has been made.  So time matters here. We understand that this can still happen in the coming weeks under the current administration.

That is a major step forward. The Umbrella Agreement improves the current regime of data protection in the existing bilateral agreements between the USA and EU Member States. We must know that the existing bilateral agreements are really weak and they do not provide our citizens with data protection safeguards. For example the treaties on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters between the USA and Germany, the USA and Spain, the USA and Finland, the USA and my own country Estonia, and many other countries, do not comprise important rights of the data subject such as the right to access, the right to rectification, the right to be informed about the process, onward transfer restrictions, enhanced protection of sensitive data, rectification in case of data breaches, the fight for judicial redress, and so on.

I feel that we could have something ideal in an ideal world, but in the real world, with the incoming Trump administration, I think that delaying this decision means that we will be really naive to hope that we will have a better solution under this new administration compared to what we have. At the same time, the Umbrella Agreement also foresees law enforcement cooperation. In situations of terrorism and all kinds of other international crimes, specifically cyber-crime for example, we need cooperation with America, even under the Trump administration. But in this situation we also need better and concrete safeguards, so I think that in order to have better safeguards for our citizens and better police cooperation we have to support this agreement and to try to implement it as fast as possible. Time really matters.

Never before have we negotiated such a high level of protection between the EU and the US in the exchange of personal data for the fight against terrorism and organised crime. We're still a target of terrorism. That is why cooperation and exchange of information are indeed crucial for protecting our society, but we must and can organise this exchange properly, respecting our European values, including the protection of privacy. I would stress that data protection and the fight against terrorism do not stand in the way of each other, and a common data protection framework will, on the contrary, lead to better cooperation. The critics are now trying to torpedote the umbrella agreement by submitting it to the European Court of Justice. This sounds noble, but it's nothing more than a retardant. Postponement will make the current situation stand, and it is much worse. In addition, there is a guarantee that the agreement will be constantly monitored and regularly evaluated. Similarly, the agreement will only enter into force when it is fully implemented by the US. I therefore call on everyone not to support the reference to the Court of Justice.

But it is a bit like with Swiss cheese – the cheese is fantastic but it is the holes that are the problem, as in this case. I would say to my colleague, Mr Voss, who is accusing me of political opportunism, or something like that, that there is a negative opinion by the Legal Service of this House, by Working Party 29, by the EDPS, by various legal experts, and also some pertinent and negative remarks by the Advocate—General of the European Court of Justice, so this is not politics. There are very legitimate legal concerns.  This may not have the effect of an adequacy finding, but it does have the effect of being a kind of green light, because it provides appropriate safeguards, as we say, so we have to look very closely at what we do. Now one thing, Madam Commissioner, is that the Commission has conceded that in order for the umbrella agreement to be fully implemented, it is necessary, it is a precondition, that the exemptions from the Privacy Act for PNR, TFTP and comparable programmes be repealed, because only then can the umbrella agreement be considered to be implemented. So what do you think the chances are that will ever happen? I think they are zero. They are zero under the Obama administration and they certainly are zero under the Trump administration, so what are you going to do if the United States will not repeal? What will the European Commission do? Will we be in the same situation as with Safe Harbour, which had to be repealed but it took the ECJ ruling to actually annul this.  Then the rapporteur said we have unconditional data protection rights. Well that is misguiding, Mr Rapporteur, because there is a condition – namely for judicial redress, namely allowing for data transfer for commercial purposes. That smells a little bit of ‘buying’ our rights; that is not unconditional.  Finally, we all know that the rights do not extend to all EU citizens and they do not cover people living in the European Union without EU citizenship. Therefore, I do think that an ECJ opinion is not a stalling tactic, but will address very legitimate legal concerns which have been expressed not only by my group, but also by the legal experts that I have mentioned before. I find it remarkable that the rapporteur, the Green rapporteur, who is known as a privacy activist, now seems to rely on the word of Mr Trump for the safeguards of European citizens.

In our view, the Agreement does not meet the requirement of the Charter under EU law and fails to provide the required levels of protection. The wording is not strong enough when it comes to purpose limitation and onward transfer and, as the former speaker said, not all individuals are allowed to have effective judicial redress. It differentiates between EU citizens and non-citizens. Legal actors have criticised the Agreement. It is an international agreement, which would mean it is very difficult – near impossible – to challenge its legality in court. It will, as such, override the EU’s data protection legislation, endangering what we have fought very hard to have, our good data protection rights. For all of these reasons, we think that the Agreement has to go to the European Court of Justice so we can have clear legal guidance on the manner in which these international agreements in the field of law enforcement and data protection interlink and whether they comply sufficiently with EU law.

Both institutions actively supported the completion of the IANA transitions, as well as the extension of the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) mandate, which was part of the successful outcome of the review of the World Summit on the Information Society one year ago in December 2015.  Recently a historical milestone for internet governance was finally achieved. The IANA contract has expired. As of 1 October 2016, the multi-stakeholder community is responsible for the overview of the IANA functions. In parallel, a series of improvements in economic accountability have come into force. This is a major step in making internet governance truly global and I warmly welcome it. Parliament, our Member States and the Commission have long called for the globalisation of the IANA functions. We have all worked together with the rest of the global multi—stakeholder community for it to happen. Indeed the European input into this process has been substantial. However, the transition is not only the end of a process. It is, much more importantly, the beginning of a new phase. The multi-stakeholder model will now be put to the test. It is now up to all of us to live up to our new responsibilities. My message to you is that it is even more relevant now for Europe to have a strong presence and voice in international discussions. While the United States has stepped back from its previous role, the continued threat from more authoritarian countries means that the EU must remain vigilant and play an even bigger role in the stewardship of the internet and defence of the multi-stakeholder model. Next will be the Internet Governance Forum in Mexico. It is a very good sign of Parliament’s engagement that, as I understand it, 18 MEPs will be participating in this global meeting. Now that the IGF’s mandate has been extended, the challenge is to make it even more relevant and helpful for the whole multi—stakeholder internet community, which will face an ever—changing technological landscape. The internet of today is very different from the internet we will have in 10 years’ time.  Europe can, and should, be a more active and powerful player in internet governance in line with the importance of the internet for the European economy and society. The role of the internet and digital has never been so high on the political agenda. In Europe we are working hard to deliver on the digital single market. A fundamental building block for our success is ensuring that the internet continues to function in a reliable and stable way and its governance is balanced, inclusive and transparent.

In fact, 2016 has been an enormously fruitful year in the maturation of internet governance. As of October 1 this year, the management of the Internet Number Assignment Authority (IANA) was linked to the United States Administration. As of 2016, the maturation of internet governance has culminated in its emancipation from ICANN, from the United States Government, through the transfer, on September 30, of its contract for the performance of IANA's duties from the US Administration. This is a really important milestone. There have been many years in which this process has developed. Right now we are facing a situation clearly defined by a multistakeholder approach to internet governance. It must be said, as the Commissioner said, that the European Union has played an important role: the European Commission, representing the interests of all Member States, on the one hand, and also the presence of the European Parliament at all meetings — and they are going to be eleven — which, since its founding, has had the annual Forum for Governance of the European Union.

In the conclusions of this Forum, emphasis was placed on the commitment of the United States Government to ensure the transfer of IANA functions to ICANN through a transparent process, monitored and verified by the global user community. That happened. In October 2016, the transfer process was consummated. A very important step has been taken to ensure an open and participatory model of Internet governance. It is now up to the 2016 Global Forum, which will take place in Guadalajara, Mexico, from 6 to 8 December, under the sign of inclusion and sustainable growth, to consolidate the proven governance model, founded on democratic values and based on networks of nationwide structured user forums, to regional level and at the global level. It is essential to ensure that, with the new digital revolution and the new technological platforms, the Internet continues to be an open network, free of interference, technologically neutral and capable of reconciling the market approach with the social dimensions of inclusion, universalization of access and the generalization of utilities. The European Union has been a key partner in affirming an open and plural vision in the dissemination of the Internet. This vision, coupled with successful global partnerships, made the difference at key moments of the decision when the heralds of Internet control tried to assert their perspective and failed.

Most people involved in the work of ICANN will say that it will not change much, as the US Commerce Department was only validating that decisions follow protocols, but this is how it was, and with new leadership things can change. So for non-Americans there is definitely a sense of relief that the transition has been done, not only because of the US political landscape, but because internet governance just cannot be under oversight of one specific country.  Trust and openness are at the heart of the internet, so people expect the internet to function and to be able to trust it; but maintaining that trust does involve a lot of technical work behind the scenes that most of us do not really see. The work of ICANN on domain names is a good example. Domain names are like phone numbers: if some of us have the same number, then it’s a problem. So people need to trust that there is an inclusive and transparent process in place on how domain names are distributed and how name collisions are dealt with. The internet was created with the dream of free flow of information, but since then interests around controlling the internet from both the private sector as well as the public sector have been growing. Therefore this is an important time for multi-stakeholder internet governance to be successful. It is crucial to show even in a rather technical area that the process is independent and transparent.

We know that, however positive were the amendments made by Regulation 2014, i.e. those referring to prepayments up to 10% of the amount, the eligibility of costs related to preparation and attention to disaster and restoration operations, but also the extension of the time limits for the submission of the application by Member States, the introduction of the period of six weeks for the Commission's response, new provisions on prevention, natural disasters and improvements in their procedures. I firmly believe, however, that many steps forward can and should be able to improve the effectiveness of the fund and show our citizens, affected by disasters, that Europe is really close to their necessity, therefore it is important that the presence of the European Commission today is important to ask the Commissioner that the Solidarity Fund is still improved, in order to overcome some issues that still remain remain. So I ask Commission to assess the possibility, to increase the threshold of prepayments, from 10 to 15%, because it is important the immediacy of availability, which the territories can achieve in comparison with emergential situations, as well as still in Italy, compared to the dramas he lives, I just mentioned, as well as the possibility of shortening the terms for the treatment of six questions from six to four weeks. I also call on the Commission to examine the possibility of establishing an eligibility threshold which, from 1.5%, is achieved instead, with the limit of 1% of regional GDP, and to consider in the assessment of questions the level of socio-economic development of the affected regions. However, I would also ask the Member States to act with responsibility, in improving their means of communication and cooperation with local and regional authorities, both during the initial evaluation process of Permissible damages, for which financial support is required, because too many times the delay and little administrative capacity, caused additional obstacles. I would also ask this Commission that in the specific case of the earthquake, be given the opportunity to revise the rules on flexibility and the stability pact, especially with regard to investment anti-seismic and sustainable reconstruction, because in this specific case they should be excluded from the calculation of the national deficit under the Stability Pact, because in this case it cannot be asked a derogation from the rule for electoral reasons, but to safeguard the lives, the suffering of hundreds of people who, in the context of natural disasters, have lost their lives.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 172, "date": "2016-11-30.json", "name": "Lambert van Nistelrooij", "mepid": "28165", "text": "  author. –  Mr President, Mr Cicu has made a lot of very concrete proposals. It is now two years ago that we first spoke in this House about the Solidarity Fund, and it is indeed possible to be quicker, to be more effective and to have a reconsideration of the exact territory and figures. So my question to the Commissioner more generally is whether the Commission is able to take over these proposals and what kind of planning does it have to deliver these ameliorations. And it doesn’t have to cost more. In fact, since the Solidarity Fund started we have spent EUR 3.8 billion, and it has been mobilised in 70 natural disasters in 24 countries of the Union. So as Mr Chico said in his report, it is very close to people and it can be used to act immediately. At this time of naturalistic, populist debates, this really is being close to the people when with floods, hurricanes and earthquakes things go totally wrong. I support Mr Cicu strongly on this. The second question, harking back to the previous period and the proposal from Mr Kallas in 2007 on earthquakes, is that it is so important to have a good preventive alarm system, and also with our funds – combining the Solidarity Fund with the regional development funds – to put prevention in the forefront. I think we are having the right debate, especially as the situation in Italy makes this a timely debate, and I am very glad that the government recently brought the proposal to the European Commission.

That is why I want to point out on this occasion that it is very important that we adopt the resolution we proposed tomorrow, because we need to point out the problems we face when we talk about the EU Solidarity Fund.

It is therefore still a very serious emergency that is being faced with rapid but effective measures, which are already taking action, both for reconstruction and prevention, and colleagues have very appropriately called back. In the resolution, which we are co-authors, a group of representatives of the different political groups, we welcome the willingness — which we hope the Commissioner will confirm — and the granting of a greater flexibility for emergency expenditure, but also for securing costs, which are (I believe) a very important element for the whole seismic area, which, as my colleague recalled is Italian but also of the Balkans.

But it is also important that this financial support to tackle the consequences and mitigate the consequences comes in time, to the right headlines. But often in this area there are also administrative barriers, which in principle should also prevent abuse, corruption and, of course, things that are sometimes exploited for bad purposes. And that is why I think that the Commission could also take a step forward in this area and prepare in some way some “guideline” and instructions to the Member States — recommendations on how to make the most effective use and of course ensure the distribution of that aid. On the one hand, those from the Solidarity Fund and, on the other hand, of course also within the Member States. In this place, I would also focus on another problem, namely sometimes we forget about those who risk their lives when rescuing people and property in the face of natural disasters, earthquakes, floods. I'm also talking about firefighters, civil protection and those volunteers who are putting themselves in protection — like I said — people and, of course, property as well. And I think that some of the Commission's attention needs to be paid to that in the future. In particular, because many volunteers who are in employment do not, of course, receive adequate compensation from employers for their absence, even though it is a work of sacrifice and solidarity.

Italy is at high seismic risk and is often lashed by climate events causing landslides, floods, landslides, landslides, like just days ago in the north west of the country. Citizens await resources and want them to be properly employed, for the prevention of disasters, to combat hydrogeological dissest, for securing homes, schools, hospitals and companies. It has been talking about it for decades, but the facts belie the promises made by all the governments that have come together. Complicating the picture, there are then the chains and constraints imposed by this Europe, which takes the breath away already in ordinary administration and which in cases of calamity, risks strangling the population and the people productive activities. The 5 Star Movement since the beginning of the legislature, insists on the discourage of the structural funds from the calculation of the deficit, one of the parameters of the Stability and Growth Pact. And today, coherently, calls for the exclusion of sustainable reconstruction, earthquake prevention and actions co-financed by structural funds according to the thematic objective, five. I appeal to all my fellow Members to support and vote on this position, expressed in the resolution in Compromise No 11.

I believe that my colleagues, many colleagues, beyond the different positions, agree, on pursuing these objectives. And the relationship is a step forward, but more remains to be done. Experience tells us that this Solidarity Fund, although it is limited, has not been fully used so far, although natural disasters are increasing in Europe, also due to changes climate. In 2014, for example, only 126 million were spent out of the 500 available. Also because the access thresholds are too high. We need to change that mechanism. Make it more functional. In what way? The simplest would be to lower the thresholds, which was proposed and the states rejected it. We propose as an amendment, also another solution, complementary to lowering thresholds, perhaps fairer, which is to calculate thresholds not only on the basis of a single event, but also by adding up damage suffered by the same region over one year, as a result of natural and repeated disasters. We brought here, all of us, the tragic experience of the people of Central Italy who had just begun to rebuild their cities, destroyed by the earthquake in August, when three more devastating shocks have annihilated the work done. But there is also the experience of regions, especially in Southern Europe, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Greece and Cyprus, where climate change, the bad policies of the territory, produce catastrophes that have now been happening they follow in series, leading populations to despair.

Solidarity, as has been said here, is one of the fundamental values of the European Union. However, this value takes on even more importance when one of our Member States, regions or accession countries is hit by natural disasters.  The EU Solidarity Fund was created exactly for this purpose. As a speaker rightly said, two years ago we introduced a reform to make support from this fund better and simpler. We are currently assessing the impact of this reform, but we can already note some positive consequences.  First: clarity. Criteria for support from the Solidarity Fund are now much clearer. This means more transparency, but also greater ease for beneficiaries to prepare successful applications. Second: rapidity. Assessment and decisions on support are now speedier, not least thanks to Commission-streamlined procedures. Third: advance payments. Now we can ensure that shelter, clothes and food can be delivered while we are deciding on applications. Thanks to this possibility, Italy will be receiving EUR 30 million in advance payments already in December to help alleviate the consequences of recent earthquakes. But beyond these changes, the ongoing simplification of cohesion policy regulations should also help facilitate swift decisions on solidarity fund applications.  Sulla situazione in Italia dopo il terremoto quattro domande orali. Sono lieta di annunciare che le autorità italiane hanno recentemente introdotto la domanda per attivare il Fondo di solidarietà dell'Unione europea. Questa domanda riguarda i terremoti di agosto e di ottobre. Stiamo ancora lavorando con le autorità italiane per completare la valutazione dei danni causati dal terremoto in ottobre, poi saremo in grado di attivare concretamente il Fondo di solidarietà. Nel frattempo abbiamo già lanciato la procedura per assegnare un anticipo di 30 milioni di euro, che è il massimo consentito dal regolamento. Questo anticipo sarà già disponibile la settimana prossima e consentirà di sostenere gli interventi più urgenti. Ma, cari colleghi, e la solidarietà dell'Unione europea non si limita soltanto al Fondo di solidarietà. Anche la politica di coesione può e deve essere attivata. In questo contesto, la Commissione sta esaminando come i programmi della regione colpita dal terremoto possano essere adattati per sostenere la prevenzione delle catastrofi e il rilancio sociale ed economico nelle zone colpite da terremoti. Infine, ho proposto che i lavori di ricostruzione in caso di calamità naturali possono essere interamente coperti dai fondi strutturali, per esempio per la basilica di San Benedetto di Norcia.

This is to be as timely as possible in emergency situations, in the case of unpleasant disasters. At the same time, we believe that it is not possible to carry out a good check without total transparency, because it should not be allowed to speculate on emergency situations in the least. That is why in the report we call on the Member States and the Commission to make public and fully accessible all information on the use of the Solidarity Fund, something which has not been done to date and allowed in some cases, misuse of money, including the last earthquake that had happened to the Eagle. I would like to add personally, on behalf of the 5 Star Movement, that it is not acceptable, to hear about European spending constraints, at a time of demand crisis like this and like what we are in, and for long time less when catastrophes are in the way.

To allocate the necessary funds to rebuild homes, schools, health centers, churches, infrastructures is simply rebuilding lives. And this is where the principle of solidarity must be applied with greater intensity. I lived a similar experience when the land opened in my region, the region of Murcia, which then presided, ravaging a historic city, that of Lorca, and, worse, taking many human lives ahead. That is why I also show my solidarity with Italy, in general, and with the affected areas, in particular. I am aware of the economic and human implications caused by earthquakes. I know that this is when citizens most need the response of political institutions, especially the proximity of the institutions of the European Union.

From its founding until the end of July last year, a total of €4 billion was approved and paid out based on 72 requests from 24 countries. After several attempts in 2014, the Commission's proposals on amendments to speed up payment procedures were finally accepted. Advances are introduced and gives more time to use grants. The scope of application is clarified and promotes the prevention of damage from natural disasters. However, the Fund's biggest problem is certainly the slow payment of approved funds. Regardless of the reforms mentioned, it must take a minimum of up to 10 weeks until payment because permission must be given by both the Council and Parliament. In practice, the term is also longer. For example, money for floods that hit Croatia and other countries in the region in May 2014 The Commission approved it in October, but it was only confirmed by Parliament in December of the same year after a full 7 months. In the people there is the following saying: “Who helps immediately, helps double”. I believe that a stronger financial instrument is missing so that a larger share of the total cost of damages could be covered. At present, only 2 -5% of total damage is concerned. The advance payment rate should be increased from the current 10%. So we will really show solidarity and guarantee quick assistance to people affected by major natural disasters.

It is therefore very good that Europe has a Solidarity Fund and in this way can show real solidarity with regions, countries and victims affected by natural disasters. I would like to thank Mr Cicu most sincerely for his work on his report, but I am critical of the efforts made by a number of political groups which have tried to bring about all sorts of new adjustments to the current regulation in the report.

So again, I am critical of calls for the Commission to be reinstated and to come up with new proposals for readapting the current Solidarity Fund. And I am also critical, Mr President, when it comes to the resolution which says in paragraph 7 that investments in sustainable recovery, in earthquake-resistant investments should be excluded from the calculation of national deficits under the Stability and Growth Pact.

However, I believe that an important opportunity to propose real improvement for disaster-affected populations is also missing. It would also have been time to extend the objectives of the Solidarity Fund to include humanitarian disasters and not just natural disasters; an excellent opportunity to use Community funds to alleviate, for example, the effects of the migration crisis, which is causing so many deaths on our borders. And, with regard to the threshold system, although it is true that the minimum threshold has been lowered, it is proposed equally for all regions. It would be fairer for poorer countries and regions to have easier access to funds, using a progressive threshold system, in which richer countries and regions would have higher thresholds than the poorest countries and regions. With regard to the amount allocated to the Fund — it has already been mentioned here: EUR 500 million a year — it should be noted that it has not changed since its inception in 2002 and that the consequences of climate change show a steady increase in natural disasters and that the forecast is even worse. Therefore, the financial amount of the Fund should be increased. And, last and certainly not least, I believe that the introduction of gender equality policies should have been considered as a criterion for the choice of proposals, since women are one of the groups that suffer most virulently the consequences of natural disasters, as reflected in many reports of the organizations such as the UN or the World Bank.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 185, "date": "2016-11-30.json", "name": "Bronis Ropė", "mepid": "125214", "text": "on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. — Thank you, President. Commissioner, honourable colleagues, today we are discussing a policy on insurance against natural disasters by the Member States of the European Union, the European Solidarity Fund. It ensures the Union's ability to help in the event of natural disasters. No less important is that the proposal also includes measures to increase efficiency, and I do not believe that the proposal to reserve the amount allocated annually to this fund in the budget of the European Union next year will result in considerable resistance. At the same time, I want to draw the attention of colleagues to the harmful trends that have begun to emerge after the recent natural disasters. As you know, the draft resolution is currently being debated in Parliament, calling for the costs of increasing resilience from one type of natural disaster — earthquakes — and only in a geographically restricted area. And why, in this case, other types of natural disasters, such as floods, landslides and other regions, are ignored? I think this is dangerous. The danger is that, in addition to the assistance that the European Solidarity Fund can provide, Member States will be able to pursue unsustainable financial policies. It is easy to guess what a precedent would mean for public finance management and the Stability and Growth Pact, especially when the concept of increasing seismic resilience is rather undefined.

Another special report by the Court of Auditors would now be desirable to show us whether the funds have really all been used for the purposes for which they were intended. We should not forget, however, that the best protection against disasters is still preventive measures and this requires transnational cooperation, including exchanges of experience within the EU.

Near Rome the land continued to shake and you live continuously in the situation of instability.

I do not think we should touch the Stability Pact in general, however, for this particular situation, I believe that a very careful look needs to be taken.

The same applies, of course, to repair the damage caused by natural disasters, floods and fires that hit Greece this year.

In your reply you mentioned, Mrs Crețu, that EUR 400 million is being allocated to Greece from the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund. However, the question is this: given the damage suffered by the inhabitants of these regions and given the high financial cost of this damage to the local authorities, what measures does the Commission intend to take, Mrs Crețu, to compensate the inhabitants of these areas. areas.

As I said, and I repeat today, the Commission adopted a proposal to amend the Common Provision Regulation (CPR) to allow for 100% co-financing – so it’s not co-financing any more – regarding the construction costs in areas hit by natural disasters. This is not only available for earthquakes, it is not only available for Italy – because I had this question by Mr Ropé: ‘why only earthquakes?’ – it is everything related to natural disasters, and we did this not only for earthquakes but this year we just paid for Madeira for fires, for Cyprus for drought and fires, for Greece as well, so now with this amendment for the CPR all the reconstruction will be done by EU money without any need for co-financing. This is news today.  On this report by Mr Cicu, which is very important, on the Solidarity Fund, this own-initiative report presented by the Committee on Regional Affairs (REGI) and drafted by Mr Cicu emphasised also the main challenges we are facing. As I said two years ago, the reform of the EU Solidarity Fund allowed support to be made clearer and swifter, but also fairer, thanks to the advance payments. So, as I said, EUR 30 million will go next week to Italy as advance payments, and I would like to remind you that we have received the application from Italy just at the end of October, so of course we will assess the final sum, but we are coming as quickly as possible with the advance payment. The ongoing evaluation of this reform we adopted two years ago will provide further light on these improvements and allow for a possible further revision in the context of the future MFF post-2020.  For the Commission, flexibility and responsiveness of the Solidarity Fund is only one objective. Another one is respect for sound financial management, as well as assurances on the legality and the regularity of spending – as Parliament, especially the Committee on Budgetary Control regularly and rightly recalls. The Commission has to strike this balance between these two objectives which can obviously have an impact on the speediness of closure procedures. On the situation in Italy after the earthquake, in any case, as I say the Commission is supportive, is currently working with the Italian authorities to ensure that the EU Solidarity Fund is mobilised as soon as possible following the payment of the advance. Unfortunately Italy has been the leading beneficiary of the Solidarity Fund since 2002 with an amount of EUR 1.3 billion, so we are very much aware that there is a big problem, and it is the frequency of the earthquakes which is really very dramatic. Don’t forget that I am also coming from a country who lost many people in Amatrice, and I will be there in several days to speak with the Italian authorities in Rome, I will visit Amatrice and also Norcia, so we will see on the ground whatever it takes to help – and to help the citizens first of all, this is our first objective. We also stand ready to work with Italy on possible revisions of the programmes of the European Structural and Investment Funds. We have offered this opportunity and we are very open to rapidly change some operational programmes if needed and if the Italian authorities require. We expect these solidarity instruments to be supplemented by support from the European Solidarity Corps once it is established as announced by President Juncker.  Finally, we are exploring possibilities to help Member States and regions better handle the period between the disaster and the payment of EU support. In this context, one possibility could be setting up a bridging loan facility with the European Investment Bank which would help bridge this gap.  I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the Commission’s full commitment to strengthen the various solidarity instruments of the European Union. I saw that there have been recurrent inquiries about the Stability and Growth Pact. I am not responsible for this, it is my colleague Mr Moscovici, but as you know short-term emergency and reconstruction costs related to major natural catastrophes are excluded from the Member States’ final effort.

In that case, the Treaty solidarity clause requires the Union and its Member States to act together using all instruments at their disposal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 211, "date": "2016-11-30.json", "name": "President. –", "mepid": "37324", "text": "  The next item is the report by Pascal Durand, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on Commissioners’ declarations of interests – guidelines (2016/2080(INI)) (A8—0315/2016).", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 212, "date": "2016-11-30.json", "name": "Pascal Durand", "mepid": "124693", "text": " rapporteur. — Madam President, Commissioner, we are here in a debate which is absolutely major. It may seem technical, since we will talk about the possible modification of a code of conduct and conflicts of interest. In fact, this debate is, as you know, in a very particular context for Europe, at a time when European citizens, sometimes rightly doubt, that Europe is defending the general interest, the common good, and not necessarily private interests or particular interests. We must therefore be very attentive to this issue. The question of transparency, control and functioning of our institutions is, as the European question stands, of major importance. Transparency is one of the pillars of democracy and, more than ever, we need to be exemplary in this regard. The situation has worsened in recent times. A number of debates, not to use too loud words, took place, including the passage of former Commission President Barroso in a private bank, Goldman-Sachs, which had a very direct connection with the 2008 financial crisis. Of course, these elements must be taken into account. Sometimes I wonder whether the Commission is fully aware of this reality. When we asked Commissioner Moscovici, who was in your place recently, he explained to us that there was no problem, and that the code of conduct of the Commission and the Commissioners was perhaps among the best — I do not know if he did not even say “the best” — in the world! For me, it's just a denial of reality; it's the Coué method which consists of saying that everything is fine. No, everything is not fine! In order for things to change, so that we can move towards more transparency and more control, two committees in this European Parliament have unanimously approved, and I stress, both reports — the Committee on Budgetary Control and then the Committee on Legal Affairs. This unanimity must also call upon the Commission, as it shows how united the European Parliament is, I would say, in this effort to amend rules which are currently dysfunctional. So, what is malfunctioning? I will deal very quickly with two elements, namely conflict of interest and the code of conduct. Let's talk first of all about conflicts of interest. At the time when Commissioners take up their posts, at this stage, they must declare only what they consider themselves to be likely to create a conflict of interest. However, this concept is not defined anywhere. The first thing to do is to define what a conflict of interest is. We do so in this report, and we ask that the Committee on Legal Affairs of the European Parliament be able to check the financial statements and assets in order to determine whether or not there is a conflict of interest. This will simply be a matter of applying the separation of powers. This is a significant advance, and it must be implemented. We ask for the same thing during the term of office, when there is a change in assets, financial interests or portfolio. That is for the issue of conflict of interest and, of course, this requirement must be extended to family interests, since this is the case during the term of office. The second question is the Code of Ethics and the Code of Conduct. At this stage, Commissioner, you and all your colleagues have a duty of honesty and delicacy. This is not defined anywhere. Define what is meant by honesty and delicacy. Ensure that the ethics committee, currently in charge of monitoring, is composed of independent experts and is completely protected from pressures from private interests or the Commission. I'll add a third element. We you let us ask to ensure that, for the three years following your term of office, you do not have the opportunity to go to work in the private sector in areas that you have had to know in the performance of your duties as commissioner. Commissioners are paid for that; it is not outrageous. You see, the changes we ask for are not exaggerated. What we want is simply an alignment of the Commission's operating rules with what is happening in all democracies around the world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 213, "date": "2016-11-30.json", "name": "Andrus Ansip", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, the Commission welcomes the contribution to the debate from Mr. Durand's report on envisaged guidelines for Commissioners’ declarations of interests. This shows Parliament's interest in this subject, which is of course an important part of the democratic scrutiny exercised by this House of the Commission and its Members. Let me therefore respond to a few issues.  I would first thank Mr Durand for the report and the other Members and committees for their work. The President of the European Commission, whom I am replacing here today, considers the highest ethical behaviour to be of paramount importance for the credibility of the EU institutions. I would also recall that the rules of the Treaties and the Code of Conduct of our Commissioners are clear; they represent standards that go well beyond those applied in the majority of Member States and in the other European Union institutions.  With its Code of Conduct, the Commission is subject to the highest ethical standards. Let me underline that some of the matters covered by the report already correspond to the current ethical framework and procedures. For instance, it is already the case that any situation entailing a possible conflict of interest which might impair the independence of a Member of the Commission during his or her mandate has to be notified to the President of the Commission. The President will then take appropriate measures, including reallocation of the file to another Member of the Commission, if necessary. The President will also inform in due time the President of the European Parliament of his decision to reallocate any file to another Commissioner. Regarding membership of what the report describes as secret societies which could interfere with the exercise of the function of public bodies, I should stress that the Treaties themselves and the Code of Conduct already provide that Commissioners must discharge their duties in the general interest of the Union without seeking or taking instructions from any other body.  In addition, other recommendations are already being implemented. For example, the report mentions the three-year transitional allowances for former Commissioners. Let me point out that these rules were recently, in February this year, amended by the Council. The new rules will apply to all Commissioners and other EU public office holders who took up office after 4 March 2016. The transitional allowances will in the future be paid for a maximum of two years. The report proposes the extension of former Commissioners’ cooling-off periods to two years. President Juncker wrote to President Schulz on 23 November 2016 informing him of his intention to modify the Code of Conduct in order to extend this period from 18 months to three years, as regards the President of the Commission, and to two years, as regards the other Members of the Commission.  I would like to underline that the Ad Hoc Ethical Committee is composed of personalities who are not Members of the Commission or Commission staff.  Their qualifications and independence are beyond any doubt and they gave a very independent opinion to the Commission. Allow me to note that the European Parliament's Advisory Committee on the Conduct of Members, which gives guidance on the interpretation and implementation of the Code of Conduct for Members, is composed of Members of the same Parliament.  Finally, I would like to recall that, in line with the Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission, the Commission has the right to be consulted before any changes in Parliament's Rules of Procedure directly affecting the Commission are decided. The possible need to amend the Framework Agreement also needs to be examined. The Commission will pursue its dialog with Parliament and will come forward with further remarks and comments as and when needed. Thank you very much.

And then we will surely come to the target, which Gräßle's colleague mentioned, and which Durand was talking about. Why does the Law Commission care so much about these changes? Well, we are responsible for conducting, at the outset, when creating the College of Commissioners, such a small investigation — even though we are neither the prosecution nor the court — whether all that is in the financial statements is actually in line with reality and is not there is conflict of interest. However, we do not have, as a Law Commission, the appropriate instruments to be truly satisfied that we have checked what has been checked. So these requests are moving towards streamlining the verification process so that we can achieve success together.

Moreover, when examining the declarations of financial interests of the members of the Juncker Committee in 2014, it became apparent that the Committee on Legal Affairs of the European Parliament needs to be given more powers and more comfortable time to enable it to establish the any mistruths or omissions of such statements. There have been cases of Commissioners, such as Mr Cañete's, where the content of the statement or other elements raised open questions but these were not adequately investigated.

I therefore endorse the Durand report, which is trying to improve this control. However, I doubt that any effectiveness will be achieved. Basically, the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament do not want too deep investigation into the financial interests of Eurocrats. As proof of this is the decision to appoint and retain Mr Miguel Arias Cañete as Energy Commissioner, despite the conflicts of interest that have been discovered and denounced on several occasions. The European Union has denied European values in favour of the cult of the golden calf. It is entirely dominated by lobbies, financial powers and thirst for profit.

That's good news, because the voters demand it of us. But the second question is how do we want to implement this goal. And here I must say, unfortunately, that I am not convinced that all the procedures proposed in the report will ensure the effective implementation of these objectives. Through minimizing conflicts of interest in the public sphere, we primarily want to ensure that our citizens have greater confidence in their institutions. Each institution has its place in the system and is supposed to have competencies corresponding to that position in the system. The European Parliament is not, in my view, the institution that should act as an investigating institution.

This is also what my report, which was adopted last Thursday in Strasbourg, on the action of the European Ombudsman, points out.

It must therefore be an indispensable prerequisite for the hearing.

The proposals in this report not only affect economic activities but also aim to support the environmental needs of the European region. Work related to oil and gas production has a significant economic impact but also high environmental hazard. Most of the oil and natural gas activities take place either in the North Sea or in the Mediterranean. In view of the nature of this work, it is extremely important to ensure the protection of undertakings which are directly linked to the environment. The commercial fisheries sector and the people involved in the aquaculture sector can suffer significant economic losses from accidents or incorrect use of chemicals. Businesses in the tourism sector could also suffer financial losses from the reduction of customers due to possible related accidents. It is therefore obvious that we need to lay down rules to protect all these economic activities located close to offshore activities, the exploitation of oil and gas fields, especially given that over 90% of oil and 60% of the oil. gas produced in Europe comes from such offshore activities. It is also of the utmost importance that there are compensation mechanisms for damage caused by offshore activities and similar mechanisms aimed at restoring ecosystems. The current European Directive makes holders of offshore licences responsible for preventing and restoring all environmental loss resulting from their activities. It also requires Member States to establish procedures for handling claims for damages. However, the directive does not deal with liability for damage to natural or legal persons in respect of injury or financial damage, nor with criminal liability for offshore accidents. It is therefore necessary to assess the importance of further harmonised rules and a compensation mechanism for offshore accidents in order to facilitate victims' access to justice. In order to promote this harmonisation, the possibility of creating a fund on the basis of fees paid by offshore industries could also be considered. We also need a European Union action plan to prevent and combat the consequences of oil and gas accidents. Their impact has serious and long-term implications for the marine environment and this should be taken into account in the directive. The Commission should cooperate with the Member States in order to speed up the relevant procedures. Risk analysis and environmental impact assessment for offshore activities could also be published regularly, according to parameters such as biodiversity, climate change, sustainable soil use, protection of the marine environment and appropriate training of personnel before any licensing business. It is my personal belief that prevention is better than treatment, and institutionalisation of criminal responsibilities at a pan-European level could be a further deterrent, in addition to existing civil sanctions, thus leading to better protection of the environment and the citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 238, "date": "2016-11-30.json", "name": "Tibor Szanyi (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124703", "text": "- Madam President! I very much agree with the report, all activities that damage the environment and human life must be linked to collective redress, and serious sanctions must be applied. Yet the relevant 2013 directive has not been transposed in all Member States, so I call on the Commission to encourage Member States by all possible means to remedy it. However, I consider the 'polluter pays' principle to be an important tool for preventing damage, which we have already underlined in other areas, for example in the resolution on the red sludge disaster in Hungary. For my part, I would completely remove the use of fossil oil and gas, of course, while ensuring gradual gradation, as this is an endless risky operation.

At the same time, an increasing proportion of these sources come from offshore activities. It is therefore of major importance to ensure a high level of safety and the prevention of natural disasters from these offshore activities. The Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf of Mexico cost billions of dollars to the American economy. We therefore understand that a similar accident in an enclosed sea such as the Mediterranean would be disastrous, and that is why stricter rules and standards should be laid down on the liability of the oil companies and, because these disasters do not stop at the borders of the states, this high security in offshore oil operations must apply everywhere.

I would also like to thank you for your thoughts and comments on our report on liability, financial security and compensation in the offshore oil and gas sector.  Let me address some of the vital issues that came up in your report and today’s debate. You have asked the Commission to take new initiatives which may have a large impact on citizens and the offshore oil and car gas industry. After an initial analysis, the Commission will examine in detail your proposals and consider how best to carry out the assessment and the collection of more information, as suggested. Your report provides valuable policy lines for the offshore oil and gas sector, which will guide our work. It underlined certain weaknesses of the current legal framework with regards to many questions surrounding liability when offshore accidents happen. We are very grateful for this constructive and substantive contribution, which provides a structure of issues to be dealt with in the near future.  Furthermore, before deciding on new legal initiatives, we need to know what progress has been made on these subjects in Member States when implementing the directive. The deadline for implementation of the Offshore Safety Directive was 19 July 2015. At the latest in 2019, when the Commission will assess the implementation of the directive, taking into account the efforts of Member States, specifically their competent authorities, the report will include as appropriate its proposals for amending the directive and, if necessary, for additional initiatives. It is clear that the issues examined in the 2019 report, also in line with your proposals, should include an in-depth analysis of questions regarding liability, compensation and financial security for offshore and gas operators, with the objective of addressing potential shortcomings.  In the meantime, the Commission will exchange and discuss with the Member States respective experiences of practical implementation on a permanent basis, and specifically in the framework of the existing European Offshore Authorities Group. When carrying out the dialogue with Member States on these sensitive issues, we will take the utmost account of the contribution from the European Parliament, upon which we can build. We will bring your issues forward in the European Offshore Authorities Group, and in any other available forum. Both in expert groups and high—level groups, the Commission will refer to your report, which establishes clear guidance and potential target lines of where we should get to, for the benefit of EU citizens.

The trouble was caused only by a device — the breakout detector — but yet it entered history as one of the greatest natural disasters ever. Of course, it is a legitimate expectation that, learning from the American example, Europe should not only try to prevent a similar disaster, but also be prepared to deal with it both technologically and legally. However, we must be very careful that this kind of effort does not suffocate the industry we want to regulate. Oil and gas extraction in the North Sea and the Mediterranean is essential for Europe's energy supply. It is important that companies extracting these regions do not feel that we are striving to make them impossible, but to see a helping hand in the Union, which settles legal relations and helps to minimise risks. In addition to protecting existing extraction, it is at least as important not to discourage potential future investments. The mineral resources of the Black Sea, the eastern Mediterranean or the Barents Sea could be a long-term solution for Europe's energy supply, which would greatly help reduce dependence on external suppliers.
