As you know, the annual report outlines the work done by the European Union on human rights and democracy across the whole range of our external relations during the past year. It tells the story of our enduring efforts to defend and promote human rights and to support democracy around the world. The European Union has put human rights at the very centre of its external action and is undoubtedly one of the main international actors in the field. One of the reasons for this is the leading role played by the European Parliament in influencing and shaping our democracy and human rights policy. I would like to praise the work of all those honourable Members who have played and are playing a crucial role in promoting human rights and reporting violations and abuses, in particular those who are active in the Subcommittee on Human Rights. Last December we had the opportunity for a broad debate in plenary on the excellent report on human rights and democracy in the world drafted by Mr Kukan. Many of the topics and concerns raised in the document are taken up in our annual report. This proves that in the protection and promotion of human rights and democracy we stand united. Since the adoption of the human rights package in June 2012, our annual reports give us an opportunity to assess our capacity to implement the ambitious 2012 action plan on human rights and democracy. We are happy to see that Parliament has appreciated this effort to provide transparency and accountability. Allow me a few words on the Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy. The adoption of this package was a landmark decision. It provided us with a clear set of principles and objectives to guide our work in promoting human rights in the world. Thanks to these comprehensive documents, the EU’s delivery has become more tangible and more measurable. It has also made our endeavours part of a collective effort involving all EU institutions and Member States alike. I am pleased to say that, in two years, we have accomplished most of the nearly 100 actions set out, and we are working on completing the remaining ones. At a time when democratic values are increasingly being challenged in many parts of the world, the High Representative and her services, including EU delegations, have addressed human rights and democracy as a matter of priority. Those who are oppressed around the world, as well as civil society representatives and international partners, look up to the European Union and count on our contribution. The EU has not feared to go beyond traditional diplomacy and to express its concerns openly. Baroness Ashton did just that over the developments in Russia in relation to civil society. She spoke out on the harassment of civil society in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. She called for the release of political prisoners in Bahrain while attending the EU and Gulf Cooperation Council ministerial meeting. In Myanmar she joined Aung San Suu Kyi in attending a special civil society forum with more than 60 participants from all parts of the country. Civil society representatives were similarly involved in the EU-Myanmar/Burma Task Force and participated actively in its political session. The role of Stavros Lambrinidis as the EU’s Special Representative for Human Rights has also been crucial. Throughout these past two years he has shown incredible stamina and has spared no efforts in designing and projecting our human rights policy across the world and in advancing the universality of human rights. He has been, and is constantly, engaging with all our strategic partners and has consistently addressed human rights challenges with key countries in democratic transition. He has been, and still is, tirelessly reaching out to NGOs and civil society organisations. Stavros has proved to be the EU’s solid and loud voice on human rights. Our EU annual report sets out a number of our key achievements. We have moved forward with our human rights country strategies: we have now concluded more than 150 strategies, covering the globe and providing tailor-made approaches and strategic objectives for each individual country. This has been an important step in empowering our EU delegations in their new post-Lisbon role. In addition, we have established human rights focal points in all EU delegations and common security and defence policy missions and operations. We have stepped up efforts to train our staff on human rights and democracy issues, both in the delegations and at headquarters. Every year the Union holds human rights dialogues and consultations with more than 30 partner countries and regional groupings. In 2013, human rights dialogues with South Africa and Burma/Myanmar and consultations with the Republic of Korea were held for the first time. We have extended our toolkit by adopting new EU human rights guidelines. In 2013 we adopted guidelines to promote and protect the enjoyment of all human rights by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intra-sex persons, as well as guidelines on freedom of expression freedom of belief, following the adoption by this House of a detailed recommendation on the topic. We have promptly condemned cases of religious hatred, intolerance and violence in the world: in Egypt, Nigeria, Iran, Libya, Mali, Pakistan and Tunisia and, more notably, following the tragic developments unfolding in Iraq and Syria. At the same time, all our instruments – political dialogues, démarches, technical assistance and support for NGOs – are used to address more systematic issues related to freedom of religion or belief in a bilateral context. Conscious of the increased incidence of intimidation and harassment of journalists and of restrictions on media freedom, we adopted a few months ago the first ever guidelines on freedom of expression online and offline, in consultation with civil society and under the inspiration of Parliament’s report on the freedom of press and media in the world. At the same time, the EU has loudly condemned attacks on journalists and bloggers, and has participated in all international efforts to promote and protect freedom of expression. The EU has used all its available tools of diplomacy and cooperation and assistance to work towards the abolition of the death penalty. We have issued hundreds of statements and carried out hundreds of démarches to condemn the use of capital punishment wherever and whenever it occurs. Thanks to our constant efforts and lobbying, the UN General Assembly 67th session adopted a resolution on a moratorium on executions, with unprecedented support. Thanks to our efforts, no European drugs are exported to states that use lethal injections to execute. As we approach the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the UN Convention Against Torture, the EU has stepped up its efforts to address this unacceptable practice, which still exists in so many countries around the world. The EU has shown an equally active commitment to combating discrimination, especially discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. We have never refrained from stating our belief that all people are created equal and that no cultural, societal or religious traditions can be invoked to justify any form of discrimination. Gender has always been a top priority. The EU has taken an active stance on the elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls. Thanks to our outreach, we were able to contribute to the successful adoption of conclusions at the 57th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women. Our strong engagement has also yielded results in the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security. The protection and the promotion of children’s rights and the issue of children and armed conflict have been central to the EU human rights policy and funding instruments. The EU is proud to support the campaign, Children, Not Soldiers, jointly initiated in 2014 by the UN Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict and UNICEF, aiming to end and prevent the recruitment and use of children in conflict by 2016. Supporting civil society has remained at the heart of our objectives. We continue to focus on protecting NGOs and human rights defenders and expanding the space in which they operate. We have called on numerous governments to make sure that new legislation is adopted and implemented in line with international standards. Human rights defenders play an important role at local, national, regional and international levels, and the promotion of human rights cannot exist without them. This year the EU celebrated the 10th anniversary of its Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders. Through various instruments, such as small grants and ‘sheltered cities’, the EU has actively illustrated its support for vulnerable and marginalised human rights defenders. EU and Member State diplomats on the ground have attended the trials of human rights defenders and made efforts to secure their release. A recent trial observation in Saudi Arabia is just one example. Over the years, the EU has supported electoral processes throughout the world. Since 2000 we have deployed 140 election observation missions. As in so many other fields, strong cooperation with Parliament is all the more apparent here. At a multilateral level the EU remained active and engaged with all major international and regional partners. In recent years we have stepped up our cooperation with the Council of Europe, the OSCE and other regional mechanisms working on human rights. We intensified and advanced our agenda in Geneva and New York. The EU’s role has been pivotal in key United Nations achievements such as mandates for special rapporteurs and country resolutions from Belarus, Iran, Burma/Myanmar, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Syria. I am looking forward to the debate on this important report and I look forward to your further contribution to the promotion of human rights in the world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2014-09-18.json", "name": "Andrzej Grzyb", "mepid": "23785", "text": "  On behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab I am very happy to say that, at my request, as coordinator of the European People's Party, it was possible to introduce this report for the first post-holiday session of the new legislature. I thank Commissioner Mimica for his presentation. It seems to me that this year 2013 was very important in the Union's work for human rights and democracy in the world. We are implementing the changes that result, on the one hand, from the Treaty of Lisbon and, on the other hand, we also have an example of how our response to the challenges of the Arab Spring materialises. We also have all these problems that are in the neighbourhood, with our neighbours in Europe – that is, what is happening behind the eastern border of the European Union. It is good that the report refers m.in. to the work of the European Union Special Representative for Human Rights, Stavros Lambrinidis, who is also present at today's debate.  I would like to emphasise that the European Parliament is involved in these changes through its reports, numerous recommendations or the work of the contact group set up in 2012.  2013 is also the approval of the Multiannual Financial Framework. I am pleased to note that the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights has been significantly increased in financial terms. We also appreciate that almost 150 different human rights strategies were developed in 2013 for partner countries and that 123 of them were finally approved by the Political and Security Committee. However, we renew our calls for procedures for effective access by the European Parliament – even if not in its entirety, at least to the rapporteurs or shadow rapporteurs on the subjects – to these strategies.  The Council report notes that the European End for Democracy also started operating last year. This is an initiative of the Polish Presidency. By the end of 2013, almost half a thousand applications – only 5% of them could be implemented due to financial thinness , but this also demonstrates the legitimacy of the establishment of this instrument. It seems worth looking at the achievements, effectiveness of the approach and considering changes that will make greater use of the Union budget.  The european Parliament's numerous actions in the report have also been recognised. It is worth noting the second summit of ceasers of the European Union and the Eastern Partnership. What is happening behind the eastern border of the European Union is worth including the spokespersons from these countries in this process and showing good practices and their exchange, not just indicating what you should do. This is definitely a better instrument.  Efforts by the Union for corporate social responsibility and for human rights have also been noted. We have finished work on the report. This work, which was completed in 2014, resulted in m.in. amendments to the non-financial disclosure directives, and in both cases I can say that they must also take into account not only the interests of these large corporations, but above all the competitiveness of European companies.  Finally, I would like to appreciate the issues of freedom of religion and belief that have also been noted. What is happening about people of the Christian faith, the Yazyds, requires our special care. It must not be the case that people cannot express religious beliefs or have the right to freedom of religion.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2014-09-18.json", "name": "Elena Valenciano Martínez-Orozco", "mepid": "4334", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Madam President, we only have to read the morning papers to realize that human rights remain an outstanding subject in the European Union. The truth is, we can check it every day. But it is true that, for a few years now, we have improved our position, because we have tools to carry out our task. And this annual report is a good opportunity to assess what we have done. However, clear indicators and even clearer commitments remain, so that we know whether the European Union really succeeds in advancing its strategy of defending human rights in the world. We are about to draw up a new action plan in which this Parliament unfortunately does not have much voice, but we know that we will still be heard. And I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Lambrinidis on the task that the special representative has done over the years and I want him to continue to be able to advance all the work that is being done. Because there's almost everything left to do. In human rights I would say that, in order not to take a step back, many steps must be taken forward and that human rights cannot be just the friendly face of the European Union. It has to be a cross-cutting policy and a commitment from all of us and all of us. Human rights are universal. It seems a lie that this principle must be reiterated again. They're universal. And there is no cultural, religious, political or other relativism that should push us back on this principle, which we defend very strongly. Human rights are universal and have to reach all human beings, in every country on Earth. Human rights are universal and, therefore, the European Union has to work on them very cross-cuttingly, with a very clear commitment. You see, I believe that for the European Union to be respected in the world, without giving lessons, it should give some examples. Just a few days ago, a hundred children drowned on our shores of the Mediterranean.

It needs to be clearly and firmly emphasised that Christians remain the religious community which is persecuted on the largest scale in the world today. North Korea, Iran, Somalia, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Syria, Iraq, Pakistan, the Central African Republic: these are only the most shameful examples in a group of about 50 countries in which persecution of the Christian religion is taking place on an unprecedented scale, including in some cases intimidation, refined acts of humiliation, abductions, rape, sophisticated torture, massacres and mass executions. According to the special report of the international agency Open Doors, more than 100 million Christians suffer from religious persecution. In addition, I would like to emphasise the fact that the European Union maintains diplomatic relations with most of the aforementioned countries, and has standing delegations there. I strongly recommend appealing to the heads of these delegations to submit special reports on acts taken with regard to protection of the rights of Christian minorities in the countries mentioned.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2014-09-18.json", "name": "Charles Goerens", "mepid": "840", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. Madam President, the European Union's annual report on human rights and democracy in the world leads me to make the following remarks: the worst violations are perpetrated where the State, deliberately or helplessly, does not or no longer fulfil its regal functions. This is particularly the case in the Middle East, where we must see with Brahimi the risk of this region becoming a warlord-dominated territory.  What are we doing about that? Very little, if we see the difficulties that refugees in this region have in finding a land of welcome. It was a statement of helplessness after the international community refused to intervene when the opposition to Assad implored us to do so.  State crisis or state crime, the hotbeds of crisis where populations are exposed defenceless to barbarism, alas, are becoming more and more numerous. Thus, in Africa and especially in the eastern part of Congo, where there is no longer even the appearance of public order, Dr. Mukwege notes that the woman's body has become a battlefield.  All of this makes us approach the human rights situation with great modesty. It is easier to take stock of atrocities than to take stock of the conflicts prevented - to put it in the words of Bernard-Henri Levy. This should not discourage us as the European Union from persevering in the path set out in its strategy to promote human rights and democracy on a global scale. On the contrary, if the Union continues tirelessly to intensify dialogue with its partners around the world, it will no doubt be able, not dramatically but nevertheless substantially, to make improvements in this area.  Finally, I would like Europe, always inclined to teach the rest of the world, to ensure that it is exemplary within its own borders. We're still a long way off.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2014-09-18.json", "name": "Marie-Christine Vergiat", "mepid": "96858", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL group. Madam President, Commissioner, for the last five years I have been working here on human rights issues, as a Member of Parliament, I have been mixing bewilderment, anger and helplessness. It is with that in mind that I read your fifth report. Yes, since 2009, there have been improvements, but overall we are still far from it, far from a document that simply allows us to have a comprehensive analysis, to judge objectively what the European Union is doing in this area. I will take two cartoonish examples, but which I think will show the efforts to be made.  When I read in the Union's assessment of the matter that Mrs Ashton participated in the 150th anniversary of the Red Cross, I say to myself: who is being mocked? When I read that the European Union has helped China and Poland to have a dialogue on good practices on youth unemployment, I am thinking the same way. More seriously, because I like to be constructive, yes, the contribution of the European Parliament is better taken into account, but in order to move forward, as I have already said, the contact group must really work. We're a long way off. We need to see our emergencies really being closely monitored. So thank you Mr Lambridinis for all your efforts. I kind of want to tell you: thank god you're here.  Very concretely still, yes, there are focal points everywhere, but their effectiveness is very variable. So let's take a real look at that and work on that. The same applies to state-by-state strategies, which would be more operational if they were transparent, including to NGOs working in the countries concerned. The country-by-country analysis remains marked by a certain \"double standard\" contrary to a universalist vision of human rights. And let us not feed ourselves cultural, religious relativism, as we have just heard. All this would be even more convincing if the subjects were really carried by the High Representative, by the Member States and the new composition of the Commission. The Commissioner's mission letters are contrary to the priorities you have just outlined to us. You are well aware, Commissioner, that this is not the case, but there is still a whole world between the speeches and the actions of the European Union in this area.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2014-09-18.json", "name": "Barbara Lochbihler", "mepid": "96728", "text": "  Mr President, For better, I would like to make a name for my free Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her This report shows that there are many positive developments in the EU's human rights work, particularly as regards the structures and methods that have been created. However, it is an ongoing challenge to continue to work on policy coherence, as EU foreign policy is also an area of economic interest.  On the positive side, all EU delegations have now designated Focal Points for Human Rights. In addition, some have also created contact points specifically for human rights defenders. This has a real impact on the work of the activists on the ground, and the feedback to us in Parliament on this is consistently encouraging. Just over a week ago, we held a conference in Berlin on ten years of EU guidelines for the protection of human rights defenders. Here, too, we have heard that this is seen as very positive by activists on the ground. It has been noted that work should be extended, particularly in rural areas, and in particular support for female human rights defenders, and not least to help those who advocate self-determined female CVs. The report describes the work of the Special Representative, Mr Lambrinidis, in a positive light. I can only underline this. Both in exchanges with individual countries and in multilateral for a, his presence and commitment to the universality of human rights carry weight. I can only encourage you, Mr Lambrinidis, to continue this work in this sense in such a focused and targeted manner. However, if I look at the EU trade agreements and the task of applying criteria for the application of the human rights clause in them, my assessment is very sceptical. My question is therefore: how consistently will we apply this clause – especially when there is also a trade agreement with so-called strategic partners? I would also like to link this to the question: what does the Commission intend to do now? Will it change anything, including in its dealings with its strategic partner Russia? We also repeatedly address the results – or rather, the lack of results – of existing EU human rights dialogues. The report shows very specific suggestions for improvement. I hope that they will take effect. There is also talk of an impact assessment on individual human rights protection measures. I also see this as a positive thing, but we must, of course, see in concrete terms and in detail how these impact assessments are conducted. What is the practice, for example in China? However, I would also like to combine this with a specific criticism of an impact assessment – on the investment agreement with Burma, the so-called GSB+. This is because it completely disregards the human rights violations that still exist. Parliament has already called for the Commission to commit itself to complying with the GSB+ rules in the case of Burma. I also see a need for action for us here in Parliament in the implementation of the GSB+ rules. It would be very important for the Committee on Human Rights to be consulted with the Trade Committee when considering delegated acts in the CSB+ under the new rules. The report deals with the issue of business and human rights. There are sensible actions here, such as .B the human rights guidelines for three divisions. We will see that this is important later this morning, because it is about the work of human rights defenders in Azerbaijan and their threatening situation, because they are dealing with the oil and gas industry. The aim here, of course – and I believe that we very often have a disagreement between my group and the Commission – is that we should have binding human rights protection rules in the long term with regard to corporate activities. Volunteering is good, but it is not enough.  Then you will also see clearly, if you look at the action plan, that the measures listed on economic and cultural rights are much smaller than those in the area of civil and political rights. We also call on you to ensure a little more balance in this regard in the future. Finally, yesterday we discussed the resolution on the fight against the Terrorist Militia Islamic State. It is necessary here that the Commission should look at ensuring that the mistakes made in the so-called war on terror of recent years are not repeated and that it is always examined whether the measures are in line with international law and human rights standards.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2014-09-18.json", "name": "Bill Etheridge", "mepid": "124951", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Madam President, here we go again, with yet another good cause and good words hijacked and twisted for a battle cry for the liberal elite who run this place; a way to allow human rights to become no more than a charter for international human rights lawyers like the odious Cherie Blair to make a fortune. The EU tells us that we must let it regulate our emissions from our factories or the world will end. It tells us to join closer together or our external enemies will defeat us or, worse still, will fight each other. It now tells us that it must dictate human rights to the whole world. That is cultural imperialism. We should think more of justice, not of these so-called rights. Think of 1993: a 14-year-old girl called Jennifer Ertman and a 16-year-old called Elizabeth Peña were gang-raped and murdered in Texas. A gentleman called José Medellín was sentenced to death. In 2005 the EU intervened with a legal case. It used our money to defend a child raping murderous monster. That is not rights; that is not what we believe in, surely. Recently, Randy Ertman, the father of Jennifer, died after a lifetime spent supporting victims’ rights.  Human rights are not granted by this place and this is cultural imperialism. All human beings need the right to freedom of expression and the expression of their opinions, but most importantly the right to wield justice just like that which this place sought to deny Jennifer.

The Union's foreign relations policy has as one of its main objectives the universality of human rights throughout the world: the world looks to us to defend them and we cannot disappoint them. But there are many countries where fundamental rights are violated and where many people are not guaranteed. The lack of freedom to live their religion is a clear example of these human rights violations. Every day we find continuous massacres of minorities in Iraq and Syria, with particular effect on the Christian community, whose members are forced to renounce their religion; if not, they are exterminated. Christians in the East look to us with the despair of those who need to be protected. The Archbishop of Baghdad told us on his last visit to this Parliament: \"We need help not because we are Christians, but because we are human beings.\" I welcome the fact that this report concerns the negative impact of terrorist acts that have been increasing in Iraq, but I miss a greater commitment to the consequences of terrorism in the world, including Europe.  This report abounds in the abuses committed in the fight against terrorism, and it is necessary to point them out when they exist, but I must say that the text should express a stronger condemnation of the global rise in terrorism and make clearer mentions about the victims of terrorism. In my opinion it is therefore un balanced.  Human rights have no meaning for terrorists: they feed on barbarism and utter contempt for human life. Examples include cases such as girls in Boko Haram, Nigeria; the case also of the abduction of girls from religious minorities in Iraq, who are used as sex slaves; or the heinous killings of journalists and co-operators doing humanitarian work.

For us, it is also a way of assessing the state of implementation of the strategic framework of the European Union's action plan on human rights and democracy. There is, however, one thing that I believe needs to be resolved, and quickly. The report lacks precise indicators of progress or decline compared with the previous year, and without this type of indicator it is difficult to assess the effectiveness of European policies. To date, the European Union has developed human rights strategies for almost all countries. It would be appropriate for the observations, critical issues and objectives contained in these strategies to be made clear in the report. This is one of the particularly important aspects, because these country strategies are still classified as documents for internal and non-public use.  With regard to the strategic framework, our view is that we regard the adoption of the strategic framework of the action plan launched in 2012 as a milestone. The fact that this strategy has been complemented by the mandate of the EU Special Representative for Human Rights makes it all the more important. However, this strategy is essentially completed this year. We need to relaunch it very strongly, and the start of a new action plan scheduled for January 2015 must be a reason for having proper consultation with both Parliament and civil society.

There is general talk of freedom of religion, but the rights of religious groups, such as Muslims, are mentioned much more often. Also, in the report of the European Union Agency for Human Rights 'Fundamental rights: challenges and achievements for 2011', the word Christian is not even mentioned. I would ask the Commission to take the right to freedom of religion seriously when preparing these documents, taking into account how many citizens subscribe to Christianity. I would also like to call on the European Commission to take more serious citizens' views. I am disillusioned with the Commission's position on the most successful European initiative, called One of Us, which also concerned human rights, namely the unborn. Unfortunately, the fact that almost a million 800 000 citizens have expressed their opinion, which the Commission has literally swept off the table, is damaging the image of the European institutions ...

The first thing that happens is that we are discussing how to exclude ourselves from having any influence whatsoever in politics. Do you call it respecting a democratic election when you exclude 13% of the country's voters? This circus continues when you come here to Parliament. When you do not get what you want, you try to exclude groups, just as we did here in the case of the Committee on Petitions, when you practically stole a chairmanship that was important to the EFDD Group.

As I have seen, Morocco is the state that benefits most from its relationship with the European Union. It also has an advanced statute.

In addition, it commits very serious attacks on the people of the occupied territories. It's funny, before Tunisia there was an Arab spring in the Sahara and we didn't know anything. For example, prisoners in the Gdeim Izik group of the Camps of Dignity sentenced, in February 2013, by a Moroccan military court: twenty-five civilians tried; eight sentenced to life in prison; four, thirty-four, twenty-five years old. It's funny: When are we worried about citizen movements? Only when they are enemy countries. There is no talk of changing the Moroccan regime, but about cooperation to improve governance.

Is Europe aware that Christian countries peacefully tolerate the activities of other religious denominations on their territory, whereas the same principle does not apply in any way to Muslim countries?

The Tatar nation, which faced horrible persecution and sufferings during the Stalin era, is now facing the same situation again. As we speak, full-scale discriminatory action against Tatars is underway in Crimea. Their homes are being searched and their leader is not allowed to enter the country. People are being persecuted just for keeping religious literature in their homes. So I call upon the EU to show clear support and solidarity with Crimean Tatars, whose basic rights are being violated in their own homeland, which is under illegal occupation. Discrimination and human rights abuse in Russia has reached new heights as well, even when compared to the Soviet Union. As you may know, mothers of the Russian soldiers who are fighting in Ukraine have formed an association, but this association has now been called a ‘foreign agent’ and therefore could be banned, just because they announced that their children are dying in the war in Ukraine.  I think I can say that Mr Andrei Sakharov, whom we honour every year when we nominate the most important defenders of human rights, would himself be persecuted and named a foreign agent by Mr Putin and his regime.  Therefore, I call for the implementation of the EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan on human rights and democracy, this and the next year, to focus the necessary attention and resources in particular on the above-mentioned groups on the eastern border of the EU. If we cannot stop the violations in the countries that are closest to us, that not only weakens the position of the European Union but also sends a very bad signal to all countries that are seeking deeper cooperation with the EU.

However, one issue I wish to briefly highlight is the ongoing shameful lack of action of the European Union on the situation in Palestine. The EU-Palestinian Authority’s European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan, adopted by the Council in June, envisages a Palestinian state based on the rule of law, full respect for human rights, development of democratic values and the promotion of a vibrant civil society. Recent events show that this is far from happening and, by continuing trade relations with Israel, the EU condones their actions and plays a part in the oppression of the Palestinian people and the continuing denial of human rights. There are no human rights without freedom and peace. There is no point celebrating human rights defenders when the EU does not defend human rights itself and takes no action against Israel’s gross violation of human rights and allows it to act with impunity and carry out crimes against humanity under human rights and international law.

As such, the annual report is a valuable resource for improving the work of the Union.  I would like to highlight four points: first, the mandate of the Special Representative for Human Rights ends next year. We must be careful that this position is renewed but, once again, above all, that the Special Representative is given the means to really play his role, to give coherence, effectivity and visibility to the Union as a promoter of human rights. The second element of the report that I wish to focus on is women's rights and gender equality. It seems to me that 2013 was full of initiatives in this area. For example, the integration of a women's rights adviser into 70% of civilian and military operations, the \"zero tolerance\" initiative for female genital mutilation, the women's network of diplomatic service. I can only encourage the next High Representative to continue these efforts. Women's rights are part of human rights and we know how decisive the role of women is in countries in transition or pacification, so that sustainable solutions are put in place.  Thirdly, I will stress the missions of electoral monitoring to assess the implementation of the recommendations made by the Union's election observation missions. When the 2012 annual report was published, I remember calling for better follow-up. In 2013, three missions were deployed. In 2014, I myself led the mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo. This makes our support and messages to partners more effective, credible and consistent.  Finally, I will stress the coherence between, on the one hand, our different external policies and, on the other hand, between our internal and external policies. The cross-cutting of human rights must be ensured in trade policy with strategic partners, in our security policies, asylum or migration policies or the example of the fight against terrorism, and in the coherence between our external and internal policies, if necessary, to maintain our credibility as a defender of human rights and as a reliable partner.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 31, "date": "2014-09-18.json", "name": "Richard Howitt (S&amp;D). -", "mepid": "2073", "text": "   Madam President, I worked on the human rights report this year and the achievements it reflects, in particular the creation of the new human rights dialogue with Burma to seek to contribute to the process of transition in that country, the agreement of new guidelines to respect the human rights of LGBTI people and for freedom of religion and belief, the agreement of the updated instrument on the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights in which this Parliament was a partner, and the conduct of successful election observation missions during the year, including in Pakistan where I was present myself and where our presence is proving to make such a real difference in defending democracy.

This is precisely one of our objectives and we look forward to discussing this issue with you, including in the contact group, to which we are committed. Thank you also for your positive words about our work on human rights defenders around the world and your appreciation for the excellent work done by Special Representative Stavros Lambrinidis. Rest assured that we make every effort to make our human rights dialogues result-oriented and to see that all agreements contain effective human rights clauses, as foreseen in our action plan, and to broaden our action beyond civil and political rights to economic cultural and social rights. I would like to assure you that we are making – and shall be making – every effort to alleviate the plight of Christian communities and ethnic minorities in the Middle East and worldwide.

We need to voice further our human rights concern with our partners at all levels and in all forms of dialogues and contacts.  Challenges do not only come from the outside, which is why we will strive to achieve the most challenging objective – integrating human rights in all EU external policies such as trade, development, conflict prevention, counter-terrorism and other areas. We have made progress but need to continue to work in that direction, including a human-rights-based approach to development and in business, together with Parliament, the Commission, Member States, civil societies and other stakeholders.

The government has intensified its already authoritarian crackdown on independent political and other public voices in Azerbaijan. According to Human Rights Watch and according to Freedom House, the authorities have imprisoned at least 40 political activists, human rights defenders, journalists and others, on various trumped-up charges including drug possession, tax evasion and even treason in the last two years. In a dramatic escalation since last July the government rounded up the country’s most senior human rights and other public figures, imprisoning them on politically-motivated charges. These include Leyla Yunus, the well-known director of the Institute for Peace and Democracy, and her husband, the historian Arif Yunus, Rasul Jafarov, Chair of Azerbaijan’s Human Rights Club, and Intigam Aliyev, the highly respected Chair of the Legal Education Society. They were all part of a group compiling a comprehensive list of victims of politically-motivated arrests in Azerbaijan. Now they are on that list.  In addition, the governmentʼs already tough restrictions on the activities of non-governmental organisations have been further tightened. Many groups have been effectively forced to shut down after their bank accounts were frozen or their sources of funding blocked.  On the other hand, Azerbaijan is making the most of new opportunities to boost its international profile. In a perverse twist – there is no other word to express it – Azerbaijan in May assumed a prestigious position in Europe’s leading human rights body, the rotating chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, and on 24 June President Ilham Aliyev used his speech before the Council’s Permanent Assembly in Strasbourg to deny any human rights problems and to call his critics liars.

Secondly, this summer we also saw an escalation in the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, which registered the most serious breaches of the ceasefire agreement since its signature in 1994. The EU had been vocal in expressing its concerns over these worrying developments, in particular over human rights and the conflict situation. Human rights have also been raised bilaterally with the Azerbaijani administration. Commissioner Füle and Deputy Secretary-General Helga Schmid did so during their meetings with President Aliyev and with civil society representatives in their recent visit to Baku for the Eastern Partnership informal ministerial dialogue. These issues were also addressed during President Barrosoʼs visit to Baku in June. In response to the rapidly deteriorating situation we have also triggered our Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders and instructed the EU delegation to offer concrete support to human rights defenders at risk. The ongoing pressure on independent civil society in Azerbaijan contradicts our common values and the spirit of the Eastern Partnership. We cannot stress enough the importance of a thriving civil society for a thriving democracy and we will keep on reminding our partners in Azerbaijan that the best way to achieve stability and prosperity in the country is through a functioning multiparty democracy, open societies and open economies. We maintain our offer to base our relations with Azerbaijan on a new, legally binding basis. It will have to be inspired by common values and in particular human rights and fundamental freedoms. We have started negotiating an association agreement and a strategic modernisation partnership. These steps are very important, not least in the context of Azerbaijan’s role in ensuring Europe’s energy security. The EU recommends that Azerbaijan, which is currently chairing the Council of Ministers of the Council of Europe, reviews its recently amended NGO legislation and takes forward the recommendations of civil society and international organisations to bring the legislation into line with the commitments it has made in the Council of Europe. We will continue to pass messages to all relevant stakeholders in a spirit of partnership. Following the contact between the Council of Europe’s Secretary-General Thorbjørn Jagland and President Aliyev, we look forward to a meeting of the Joint Committee between the Presidential Administration and representatives of civil society in the presence of a Council of Europe representative. Unfortunately the committee has not been convened in the last six years, so this meeting would be an opportunity to relaunch dialogue between the Azerbaijani authorities and civil society.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 66, "date": "2014-09-18.json", "name": "Preşedinte. -", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   The debate has been closed.

We attach great importance to his situation, which has received considerable attention in our dialogue with the Burundian authorities. As you know, protecting and encouraging human rights defenders is one of the major priorities of the overall EU policy on human rights and democracy. Human rights defenders have a vital moral and practical role to play in giving confidence to civil society organisations and to citizens wishing to assert their rights and enjoy their fundamental freedoms in challenging circumstances.  The arrest of Mr Mbonimpa gave us cause for significant concern. The EU expressed that concern strongly, underlining to the Burundian authorities that the legal and human rights of the accused should be scrupulously and transparently respected. We also reacted publicly to the misguided decision to keep Mr Mbonimpa in pre-trial detention.  The EU delegation and the EU Member States represented in Bujumbura have been in close contact with Mr Mbonimpa’s lawyer. Just a few days ago we were informed that he had been sent to hospital. Naturally we will continue to enquire about the conditions under which he is being treated and about his state of health. We must also continue to insist that his rights are fully respected.  The world is watching this case as a test of the respect in practice for rights and freedoms in Burundi. In Burundi, and throughout the world, the EU has spoken out against any measures that encourage the perception of politically motivated justice. Experience shows that this perception in itself is dangerous and destabilising. It is regrettable that Mr Mbonimpa’s case should need to be assessed in such a context and even more so that it comes against a background of other apparent breaches of judicial standards and of increasing tension ahead of the elections in 2015. These threats command continued attention and response. The Cotonou Agreement is about dialogue of equals and we will not hesitate to raise our concerns. The EU is fully committed to accompanying and supporting Burundi in its peace-building process and democratisation. Promotion and respect for human rights and the development of an independent and reliable justice system are, of course, at the core of this action. Through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights and the European Development Fund we are supporting actions against discrimination and violence in the country and promoting a diverse and constructive Burundian civil society, including for the LGBTI communities. The local, legislative and presidential elections in 2015 are an important test for the stability of Burundi as well as its democratisation. It is important that the UN also follows the situation closely in cooperation with the EU.

The ban on trade unions in export processing areas, where working, health and safety conditions are extraordinarily negative, must be ended. The mandatory mechanism should now be put in place to compensate the 1,100 dead and 2,500 wounded in Rana Plaza still unscathed.

They have helped the government make significant progress on the Millennium Development Goals and we want that to continue to be the state of affairs. That is why we are concerned at particular legislative changes which we feel put that dynamism at risk. This is an issue that we raised when we were there earlier this year. We are not yet clear about how these changes, and particularly the NGO changes, will affect donor engagement. The EU is, of course, a significant part of that, so I would hope to hear something from the Commission about it. We all know that politicians, whatever their party, find a critical press and NGOs inconvenient, embarrassing and even threatening at times, but they are an important element of a democratic society, especially when the formal political opposition is weak or non-existent.  We also raise the issue of the Rapid Action Battalion. We should welcome recent moves to indict a number of officers, but the number of those dying at the hands of the RAB has begun to rise again. We have seen 88 deaths in the last seven months and there is real concern about the lack of accountability. We want to see the government operate its zero-tolerance policy against human rights abuses by law enforcement agencies and we welcome the training put in place with the International Committee of the Red Cross.  We need a strong and independent judiciary and a civil society and active parliament to make sure that the measures take effect. Others have referred to the death penalty. There is widespread public and political support in Bangladesh for this, so we welcome the government’s acceptance of the Supreme Court’s commutation of the death sentence of Mr Sayedee under charges under the International Crimes Tribunal. For those who are concerned about the issues around trade union rights and decent pay – and quite rightly concerned – there are major issues there.

The leader of the third-in-power political party was arrested without waiver of his immunity and has been jailed for a year now along with six other members of his party. His wife, also an MP, is allowed to visit her husband only once a month. Three other Members are under house arrest, two Members are prohibited from speaking at political gatherings, and all have been subject to restrictive conditions. The government and some jurors set up a plot based on the criminal activity of a person who simply declared himself a member of the party. Totally undemocratically, the party's funding was cut off, which was subsequently classified as a criminal organisation without even a trial. However, ladies and gentlemen, what I have described to you unfortunately does not happen in Bangladesh but in Europe, in my country Greece, and in my party the Golden Dawn People's League. For reasons of political expediency and avoidance of their upcoming electoral crash, the Samara-Venizelos co-government, completely against every rule of law principle, imprisoned, strangled financially, gagged and falsely charged a political party that simply believes that Greeks deserve better luck than the other political parties that have ruled in the past.

As part of bilateral relations, the European Union has consistently engaged with Bangladesh to support the consolidation of democracy. It has repeatedly called on all parties to create favourable conditions for transparent, inclusive and credible elections. The EU regretted the fact that such conditions did not materialise in the elections of 5 January of this year. This means that the people of Bangladesh were not given the opportunity to express fully their democratic choices. Since then we have been closely monitoring developments, which unfortunately remain a cause for concern. We are in a situation where the main opposition party is not represented in Parliament, which would help to ensure democratic accountability and meaningful oversight. This leaves the country without proper checks and balances. We are concerned about the situation of human rights and those of minorities and indigenous people. The space for civil society appears to be narrowing. We recognise the strong support of Bangladesh for women’s empowerment. However, violence and discrimination against women and child labour still exist and demand further efforts. Overall, as the Parliament has rightly stressed in its resolution, the situation remains worrying. The EU is closely following key human rights issues, notably allegations of excessive use of force by law enforcement agencies and discrimination against minority groups and indigenous people, including the lack of implementation of the peace accord for the Chittagong Hill Tracts region. We are monitoring the recent policy guidelines on broadcasting. This policy is likely to limit and restrict freedom of speech and have a chilling effect on media freedom. The EU opposes the death penalty as a matter of principle. The EU is also closely following the situation of the Rohingya minority in Myanmar and Bangladesh. We encourage both countries to discuss the issue and to address the humanitarian situation.  The EU remains committed to continuing to help the government of Bangladesh in the implementation of its national strategy on Myanmar refugees and undocumented Myanmar nationals, whilst seeking to improve the conditions of operation of humanitarian service providers. After the Rana Plaza disaster, the EU launched the Global Sustainability Compact to improve working conditions, labour rights, and safety conditions and to foster corporate social responsibility. The signature of the Sustainability Compact has permitted Bangladesh to continue benefiting from the duty-free, quota-free tariff preferences for exports into the European Union, which are key to sustaining exports and a major instrument of stability and poverty alleviation. We very much value the commitment of Bangladesh to pursuing the implementation of the Sustainability Compact and we call on the government to make real progress in meeting compact commitments. While progress has been significant, much remains to be done and we must keep up the momentum. Human rights and governance dialogue between the European Union and Bangladesh is in place within the framework of the EU-Bangladesh Joint Commission. The next meeting will take place in the coming month. When preparing for it we will remain in close contact with and give support to civil society partners and human rights defenders in Bangladesh. We will continue to work with the European Parliament to monitor the situation and encourage the political parties to engage in genuine dialogue to strengthen democratic accountability and to hold transparent, inclusive and credible elections as soon as possible.

In reaction to the 4500 rockets and mortars fired at Israel by Palestinian militants, the 5226 air strikes carried out by the Israeli air force left Gaza in ruins and in humanitarian need. The ongoing cycle of violence must be broken. Although Israel has the legitimate right to defend itself against militant attacks, the death of children and innocents is simply unacceptable. The only way to break this vicious circle is to find a sustainable agreement that will address all the root causes of the conflict. Such agreement should restore fundamental freedoms to the people in Gaza and at the same time provide security for Israel.
