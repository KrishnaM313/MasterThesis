Leaders will hold a further substantial discussion on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). At the request of President Tusk, Chancellor Kurz will present to leaders his assessment of work done so far. Much has been achieved in the last few months. As requested by the June European Council, the Council set out in July to examine the proposals in a comprehensive manner and without delay. That is what the Austrian Presidency has done. As a result, today in the General Affairs Council, ministers are discussing a draft negotiating box that presents a comprehensive picture of all the components of the future MFF. This means that the parameters for the negotiation are now established. Of course, the draft negotiating box contains no figures and a range of options. Delegations still have diverging views on many issues. This is not a surprise at this stage in the negotiations. We all know how difficult the final agreement will be. Any agreement will be a complex balancing act between very different views around the table. We will listen carefully to what heads of state or government will say this Thursday when they discuss the MFF, including its timeline. This political guidance will help the Council determine the next steps. It will also help our Romanian colleagues to build the space for compromises during the next semester. Throughout this process we will continue to cooperate closely with Parliament, keeping in mind the special nature of this procedure. We are meeting your rapporteurs regularly and I am confident that President Tajani will convey your views to leaders when he is heard by the European Council. The European Council will also return to the implementation of its comprehensive approach to migration, combining effective control of the EU’s external borders, increased external action and an internal dimension. The Austrian Presidency has worked intensively on all three dimensions of migration policy, including in bilateral meetings during the summer and, later, in a tour des capitales, Chancellor Kurz will inform leaders of the progress achieved. Following the Council conclusions in June and October, this meeting will be an opportunity for leaders to review the progress on the different tracks and provide additional guidance where needed. The future of our single market will also be on the table. In the current global context, we need to invest in this key asset of our Union, make sure the single market delivers on its potential, make it fit for today’s world and equip it to meet the challenges of tomorrow: from digital transformation to the transition to a greener economy, as well as the application of better regulation and the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. The fight against climate change is one of those major challenges. While COP24 is in full swing, leaders will return to this matter this week. We are extremely pleased that last week the Council adopted the Declaration on the Fight against Anti-Semitism. The European Council will recall the importance of the fight against racism and xenophobia, including anti-Semitism. Turning now to security and defence. The progress we have made in the last couple of years is substantive. In addition to the many initiatives to enhance our strategic autonomy and our capacity to act as a security provider, deepening at the same time our cooperation with NATO, the European Council will also refer to the civilian aspects of our common security and defence policy. The recent agreement on a Civilian Compact will help strengthen the EU’s capacity to deploy civilian crisis management missions, to reinforce the police, the rule of law and the civil administration in fragile and conflict settings. The European Council will also address this information.  Here I don’t need to recall the importance of preserving our democratic processes and protecting our citizens from massive exposure to fake news, or deliberately misleading information. Urgent action is needed to tackle this evolving threat in all its dimensions – ahead of the European elections, of course, but also in the light of many elections in Member States next year. At the same time, we also need to recognise that this is a long-term effort. The European Council will consider the main challenges. Finally, as usual, the European Council will also discuss the latest developments in external relations and it will prepare the upcoming summit with the League of Arab States.

Sehr verehrter Herr President, Frau Ratspresidentin, meine sehr verehrte Damen und Herren! Der Gipfel Ende dieser Woche wird kein gew-hnlicher Gipfel werden kunnnen und darf es auch nicht sein. Es muss einen Beschlussgipfel geben. Die Beschlàsse, die zu treffen sind, kann man vielerorts verorten. Beispielsweise: Vertiefung der Wirtschafts- und Wàhrungsunion. Yesterday liegen alle Vorschlàge auf dem Tisch. Die Kommission hat ihre Arbeit gemacht. Es ist jetzt an den anderen Institutionen, vornehmlich und vor allem am Rat, Beschlàsse zu treffen.  Es wird darauf ankommen, dass wir den Europ-ischen Stabilit-tsmechanismus stunken. Wir messen dafar Sorge tragen, dass er zur Letztsicherung fer den einheitlichen Abwicklungsfonds wird. Wir messen weiter an einer europeischen Einlagensystemst-rkung arbeiten. Die Risiken haben abgenommen. Die faulen Bankkredite haben sich nach unten korrigiert. Ich kann keinen wirklichen Grund erkennen, wieso und weshalb man sich mit diesem Thema nicht aktiv im Europeischen Rat und im Rat der Wirtschafts- und Finanzminister befasst.  Es muss gemacht werden. Die Bankenunion muss zur Vollendung gebracht werden. Ohnliches gilt fer die Kapitalmarktunion. Yesterday liegen 13 Vorschlàge auf dem Tisch. Genug geredet: Es muss jetzt umgesetzt werden. Es geht hier um die Glaubw-rdigkeit der gesamten Eurozone er den Tag hinaus. Wir messen das stunken, das uns stark gemacht hat, das hei't, an der Vollendung des Binnenmarkts konsequent und kontinuierlich weiterarbeiten. 67 Vorschlege der Kommission liegen auf dem Tisch; 44 sind abgearbeitet und 23 messen noch zur Beschlussreife gebracht werden. Das sollte man tun. Alle reden vom Binnenmarkt - dann messen wir auch etwas fer die St-rkung des Binnenmarkts tun. And then there's the problem, I'd say almost eternal, of migration. We will have to get out of the ideological debates without end and without purpose. Again, it is a matter of deciding, it is a question of agreeing on the reform of our asylum system. Seven proposals have been submitted by the Commission. Five proposals can be adopted this evening or tomorrow morning, but they must be adopted, there is no point in holding the five directives on qualification, on Eurodac and others, to hold them hostage pending full and full agreement on the seven proposals. Let us adopt those that are ready, and Parliament, from that point of view, has done its job. And then, as the chair just said, we will have to discuss the multi-year financial framework. Here, I must say that the Austrian Presidency has done an excellent job: it has managed to gather all the elements concerning the negotiating boxes. I would like the European Council not only to take note of this, but to continue on this basis the work, which I would always like them to be able to arrive at the right stage before the European elections.  I know that the enthusiasm of decision-makers in this regard is waning, but we owe it to those who are part of the Erasmus programmes, research programmes and many others to achieve results before the European elections so that we can be judged not on what we said years ago, but on what we will do in the coming weeks. And then there is a surprise guest at the European Council: Brexit. I am surprised, because we agreed on 25 November with the British government. Still, there seem to be problems at the end of the journey. I will see Ms May this evening, and I have to say here in Parliament - as I said before in this Parliament - the deal we have achieved is the best deal possible. It's the only deal possible, and so we can't... (Applause) There is no room whatsoever for renegotiation, but of course there is enough room - if used intelligently - to give further clarification and further interpretations without opening the Withdrawal Agreement. This will not happen. Everyone has to know that the Withdrawal Agreement will not be reopened. (Applause) The big problem, of course, is the backstop for Ireland. We have a common determination to do everything not to be in a situation one day to use that backstop, but we have to prepare it - it's necessary. It's necessary for the entire coherence of what we have agreed with Britain, and it's necessary for Ireland. Ireland will never be left alone.

The unity of the European Union, its institutions and the 27 Member States is important to all of us, and I will reiterate this position to the European Council. It's okay to talk, it's okay to receive and meet Mrs May, but we can't change a position that has now been taken.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2018-12-11.json", "name": "Manfred Weber", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I first want to speak about the new guest in the room – about Brexit. I wonder sometimes myself what people outside of this bubble of our Brussels discussion think about what we are doing there on the Brexit negotiations. They see that the Brexit majority was already two years ago – more than two years ago. We have been negotiating now for one and a half years on the Brexit treaty. We negotiated more among the different British camps than between the EU and Great Britain, and then we have a final agreement on the table accepted by the British Government and accepted by the 27 EU governments. And now we see again a reopening, an attempt to of renegotiate the whole thing. I think we have already lost too much time discussing Brexit, and we need more discussion about the future of the European Union and not so much about Brexit.  That’s why the EPP Group fully supports the position of our Commission President that there is no chance to reopen the treaty which is on the table. We don’t play this game, especially in the Irish interest, because the backstop is due to our common goal that we want to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. And again, for the EPP, I want to clarify in this regard that we are all Irish.  (Applause) The second point is a political declaration. We can clarify again that hopefully the backstop will not be needed in the future, but the best would be to avoid such a backstop – to clarify now what we want to achieve in the trade negotiations. If we could include, for example, already today, that we want to achieve a Norway+ model or something like that, if we can have clarity on these points, it would help us a lot to speed up the negotiations during the transitional period and to avoid the risk of a backstop. That’s why, when our British colleagues are asking for additional clarification, we can also consider to do so as the European Parliament.  I want to fix two considerations first: everybody in the European Union must know that when you leave the club, you’re losing the advantages, and that is what the Brits are experiencing today. And secondly, the EU27 is strong and united. London is facing economic problems, and sometimes also – from time to time – a politically chaotic situation, and the message behind that is important for our election campaign next year: it is risky to leave the European Union. Let’s reform the European Union where we see a need for reforms, rather than to leave or to destroy the European Union.  We have two other points which I want to mention. One is about the economic reforms, especially on the eurozone: we would welcome to have further progress on the capacity for a strong investment budget for the European Union to be more capable to react in future crisis times. There, we see a lack of initiatives, but what we really appreciate and welcome is that the European Monetary Fund will get more independence from the international infrastructure in this regard. In the future, we have to guarantee that the next crisis – which could happen in the future – could be managed without depending on international infrastructure in this regard.  For the second point, I want to underline migration again. When I listen to what the Home Affairs Minister said last week about strengthening Frontex – the 10 000 additional Frontex officers – it’s a disaster to see this: that the Council is proposing this, that at the Council level all our leaders are asking us to speed up to immediately implement these Frontex forces to guarantee strong border control, and then the Home Affairs Ministers don’t care about what the Council members are telling us. So I think that it is on us to clarify. If we don’t do so, it means no solidarity with the South, it means no strict border controls, and it means no better management of migration flows – and that is exactly the opposite of what the people in Europe are asking us to do.

Madam President, I too am fascinated by this week's agenda. Brexit is back again - and why not? We already know what we think about it. But the good news comes from the European Court of Justice. They have made it completely clear that, yes, the UK can revoke Article 50 if it so wishes, unilaterally. They don't need anybody else. Good news! (Applause) So, this is a question to the parliamentarians in the United Kingdom. As it stands, and this too is surprising, there is no vote this week. What's it about giving back control to the parliamentarians? What's it about giving back control to the people in the UK? Now we are in a situation where neither the people nor the parliamentarians are allowed to have a say. How ridiculous is this whole exercise! And we should put a stop to this, by saying that, in democracies, the people have to have a say. This is what my group thinks, and this is my personal supply. Let the people have a say! Fortunately, thanks to Mr Guterres, thanks to the United Nations, we now have 164 countries supporting the migration pact. What lies have been told about this migration pact: it would make the space narrow, you can no longer decide nationally about its migration policy – all lies, all untrue! In reality, it was about something completely different. Mr. Bannon, Mr. Trump's former accuser, was on the way, and Ms. Le Pen was on the way. What was the attack? The attack was that there must be no more multilateral solutions in this world. No, we must be nationalist, we must be nationalist. That's wrong! That is why it is good to defend the United Nations, because we know that migration is an issue, migration is an issue that is indispensable in this modern world. If we do not defend the United Nations, which wants to work multilaterally, then we cannot defend the European Union, because we are of the same wood. We too know that borders must be overcome in order to provide modern answers for people in a modern world. That is why it was right that we should have worked for this. Unfortunately, we were not all on this page. And here I really must say: Mr Kurz, the Austrian Presidency – at a time when it bears central responsibility for Europe, to leave Europe alone and to join the chorus of those who rush elsewhere, who defame those who bear false testimony: we were not well represented in Marrakech. It was a disgrace – not for the European Union, but a disgrace to this government, a disgrace to this Presidency. This must never happen to us again, ladies and gentlemen. I believe, Mr President of the Commission, that you have provided a very courageous handwriting when it came to the major issues of asylum policy. Yes, it was right to say that we cannot only provide the right answers by drawing borders, we cannot only provide the right answers by means of defensive measures, and we cannot just give the right answers by sending people back. In this world as it is, we must deal with the fact that there will continue to be migration and flight – unfortunately also flight. That is why we need common answers, and the European Parliament has indeed done its homework here. But the reform of Dublin is still necessary and must not be abandoned, because everything else is piecemeal. Ladies and gentlemen, we must not accept this, we must remain courageous, the Commission must remain courageous and not give in at this point. However, what has happened in terms of incitement also shows us that we must call on all the Member States, that we are asking the Commission, to take all measures now so that these next European elections are safe. People need to decide – not the business models of the big tech companies – how the next parliamentary assembly in Europe will be composed, how the next European Parliament will be composed. That is our common task. And I would say that this is urgent, and we must do so now, hopefully with the appropriate support from the Member States and the support of the Commission. Let's get on with it! That is the most important thing at the moment. People must be in charge of their fate in the European Union.

As chairman of the committee responsible, I can of course only welcome that. This year we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the single market, but there is still a lot of work to be done.

Nothing at all. What you are going to decide on that is a mystery! Is it missing? Or what’s in your papers? Because, let’s be honest, there will be an annex, I hope, to be confirmed in a separate summit, because it’s absolutely necessary. We need it, and that’s a point that I want to make in this debate today, because I also want to try to analyse with you, colleagues, what is happening in France with the ‘gilets jaunes’. It is my firm opinion that this is one of the consequences of a decade of low growth in the European Union – low growth that has created, in the middle class, a request for an increase of income, and also a request for an increase in social benefits. I had a mentor in European politics and in Belgium politics, and that was Willy De Clercq. You all know him – certainly you do, Jean Claude. He was a former Commissioner and he was also a Member of this European Parliament, and he always said that ‘on an economic graveyard you cannot build a social paradise’. Cela ne voulait pas dire que l’économie européenne était un cimetière, ce n’est pas cela qu’il voulait dire, mais bien que pour créer une politique sociale, il faut d’abord créer de la croissance économique. C’est impossible d’avoir une politique sociale sans croissance économique, et tel est le problème pour le moment en Europe depuis une décennie, disons-le, pas seulement en France, mais aussi en Belgique, en Italie et même, Monsieur Weber, en Allemagne. Car les chiffres sont en fait accablants. Comparons depuis 2010 la croissance économique dans la zone euro avec la croissance économique aux États-Unis: elle est de 1,3 % en Europe dans la zone euro et de 2,3 % aux États-Unis. Cela fait une différence de 1 % pendant neuf ans, cela représente 1 200 milliards d’euros, cela représente en fait 500 milliards de recettes en moins pour les États membres de la zone euro. Cela veut dire, pour la France, Madame Grossetête, exactement 11 milliards d’euros, c’est exactement les promesses que M. Macron a faites hier, mais sans aggravation de la dette publique, sans aggravation du déficit budgétaire. C’est cette croissance qui manque pour le moment, pendant cette décennie, et c’est pour cela que je trouve qu’il faut davantage accélérer cette réforme de la zone euro et achever le marché unique.  If we don’t do it, well, it will be extremists like Steve Bannon who will continue to use this protest by the ‘yellow vests’ – if I can call them that – to spread his hatred. I was shocked – as I think you were, Ms Grossetête – when I saw on Belgian television Mr Bannon, in the presence of Ms Le Pen, enjoying Paris burning. That was the start of his revolution. He enjoyed the violence in the streets. And that is what the Alt Right agenda is all about. It’s all about the destruction of the European Union, not about people’s interests – the interests of the working middle class in France, and certainly not of the poor people who have to live off benefits. That brings me to the third element on your plate, Ms Bogner-Strauss, and that is, again, Brexit. Once Brexit, always Brexit. It too is something that is increasingly being hijacked by the Alt Right movement in Europe. What is there to say about Brexit after the past 24 hours? That we have spiralled again into a new mess. The vote has been delayed. Ms May is coming back to Brussels again, and I think that, in this Parliament, we have two messages for her. The first is that, whatever the request may be, we will never let down our Irish friends. It’s out of the question to renegotiate the backstop on Ireland. Secondly, if she is looking, in the political declaration, for a closer relationship with the European Union, in order – as Manfred Weber has said – to avoid the use of this backstop, there will be no obstacle. There will be no problem in doing that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 9, "date": "2018-12-11.json", "name": "Marisa Matias", "mepid": "96820", "text": "  gue/NGL Group. – Madam President, I must confess that we are beginning to be painful to see these Council statements which are at least empty in relation to the brutal challenges we face.

Instead of taking any decisions, things always get to be postponed; they’re going to be re-discussed later on, and then they are going to be put on the agenda, or not at all. Like migration, for example. The European Council has already been discussing this for hours without end, but just talking won’t get you anywhere. You also have to take decisions. In the European Parliament I think we also like to talk a bit, but then we vote and then we find compromises and we take decisions. That’s why the European Parliament has already agreed on a Dublin proposal, both in 2013, first, and now again in 2017. So we have proved that it’s possible to make compromises across parties, across countries – so why can’t you, the Member States? And now to decide that the distribution system is supposed to go into the freezer altogether is not going to help, because how would anyone imagine a European asylum system to come about without one of its central pieces, the Dublin reform? And also, how can the heads of state and government again and again refuse to even consider the European Parliament’s position, thereby totally disregarding this institution? I would say we can no longer wait, and I would call on those Member States who are serious about solidarity to go ahead, to join themselves together and to come out of their corner and start some action together. It’s time to make a move, and let’s not wait for the last one to come out of their corner. The other continuously postponed item is, of course, the eurozone reform. For years the European Council has been talking about it, postponing it, and talking about it again, and now all that the eurozone finance ministers could agree on is a eurozone budget that is far too small. It won’t allow for sufficient investment, it won’t do anything to overcome poverty and unemployment. But if we do want to have a stable currency and a stable eurozone, then we have to go further. Most heads of state and government clearly are not courageous. They don’t even seem to be interested in their common future and the future of our Union, the future of the countries that they govern. They are stuck in very nationalist debates. But it’s time for more courage in European politics. The future doesn’t just build itself; it doesn’t just fall from the skies: it needs to be built. And talking about the MMF that you have mentioned, I think the MFF debate would be a perfect opportunity to send a very clear signal to the climate conference happening in Katowice at this very moment, because nice words on climate only lead to action if you put some money behind that, and I believe that the Katowice summit could really use some clear signals. Courage will certainly also be needed in the Brexit talks, even though probably even more on the other side of the Channel. But I hope that the European Council will make two things very clear. Firstly, that we all stand together for the European Union principles and interests – and that includes the Irish interests. But secondly, they should make very clear that the British people would always be welcome back if they decide to do so; if they decide to revert to their original situation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 11, "date": "2018-12-11.json", "name": "Rolandas Paksas", "mepid": "96694", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – The streets of Paris are writing a death sentence for today's European Union policy.

According to him, the departure of a Member State should give us a deep reflection on the state of the Union. Excessive centralisation of competences has taken place and citizens do not feel that the Institutions of the Union are their own. Referendums and elections have demonstrated that the peoples of the Union reject the model of a federal state.

Make this Council a miracle, a miracle of the decisions taken, of the proposals before us! Do not make it a council of delay and no advice of blockade!

Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. A few brief comments: I am very much in favour of us in the Council looking at the issue of medium-term financial frameworks more intensively than is the case. But I must praise the Austrian Presidency here: the Commission presented its proposals as early as ever, and the Austrian Presidency has worked on the negotiating boxes – negotiation boxes – as quickly as any Council Presidency before. If there are no negotiating boxes, there will be no medium-term financial framework. I would be glad if the European Council were to refer to these negotiating boxes, so that we can take that on board in the coming months and into the next Presidency. This is essential. Secondly, I am disappointed that – I believe it was the Ministers of Home Affairs and Justice – has not been able to agree on the Commission's proposal, which is to bring the border and coastal protection officers towards ten thousand troops. This was a proposal from the Commission, and this was a proposal from the Austrian Presidency. And I am not surprised that for years – and not only in Sunday speeches, but also here and in the national parliaments – we keep talking about greater border protection, and when the proposal comes along, you get cold feet and refer to national sovereignty. Either, or! Either we strengthen external border protection, or we should stop these speeches immediately, instead of constantly asking for something that could be had tomorrow morning! (Applause) Pour ce qui est du cadre financier pluriannuel, apr s avoir écouté les uns et les autres et avoir lu m me les parties illisibles de ce qui a été mis sur papier dans différentes capitales, je persiste croire que le budget pour la prochaine période de sept années que la Commission a soumis votre médit Nous avions le choix, comment dire, entre rien et tout. Le Conseil européen, les différentes instances du Conseil, ce Parlement se sont mis d'accord sur de nouvelles priorités: recherche, innovation, défense, Erasmus, etc. Nous devions inclure ces nouvelles priorités dans la masse budgétaire qui sera notre disposition. Donc, il fallait que nous réorganisions la structure du budget en réduisant les fonds attribués la politique agricole commune et la politique de cohésion, qui ne sont pas de vieilles politiques, qui sont des politiques d'avenir, mais il faut tenir compte des évolutions économ Si nous avions intégré dans une m me proposition les nouvelles politiques que je viens de mentionner – je pourrais en citer d'autres – plus les vieilles politiques qui restent modernes, le budget aurait atteint un plafond de 1.4%. Me le Parlement a cru sage de limiter le plafond 1.3%. Si je m'étais présenté devant vous avec mes coll gues pour présenter un budget de 1,4%, nous n'aurions eu aucune chance de voir les chiffres budgétaires atteindre de tels niveaux, dans aucun état membre. Donc, je crois qu'il faudra que nous accélérions nos travaux. Then some people are upset about the Austrian Presidency's balance sheet, which is not yet available. I am not a spokesman for the Austrian Chancellor, nor is i a spokesman for the Austrian Federal Government or a spokesman for the Council of Ministers. However, I would like to draw attention to this as someone who has contested four or five presidencies in the Council that there has never been a Presidency with which Parliament would have been fully satisfied. I, who was President-in-Office of the Council, was never entirely satisfied with what I myself, as a person, have contributed to European progress. I wasn't free of weakness.  One weakness was that Austria did not sign the migration pact. But the Austrian Federal Government is not alone in this case. So it is not enough to criticise the Presidency here. Then, by naming the states, you must name all those who refuse to do so. I would have liked the European Union to have appeared in Marrakech in a united battle formation, rather than like a headless heap of chickens. This does not fit with the European Identity Foundation in the field of foreign policy. But that is not the fault of the Austrians.  Moreover, the Austrian Presidency has taken a number of initiatives, brought about many decisions in the Transport Council and others that show that this is a good Presidency, with the exception of this small weakness. There have already been presidencies in recent years, which have had to take more criticism than the Austrian one.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 50, "date": "2018-12-11.json", "name": "Juliane Bogner-Strauss", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, President Juncker, honourable Members, thank you for your comments. Let me first address the subject of migration. I can assure you our Presidency has invested heavily in this subject in order to find solutions. We felt that only if we tried to unite all Member States behind solutions would they be implemented seriously. The Presidency suggested a broader concept of mandatory solidarity, which would allow Member States to choose from a set of solidarity measures when one Member State is in need – with allocation being one of the possible measures to choose from. This concept was first discussed during bilateral meetings at ambassador level over the summer. It was further developed and discussed over a ‘tour des capitales’ conducted by the Austrian Presidency to seek Member States’ views on what additional elements they deemed necessary to operationalise the concept. Another question we looked at was the possibility of making progress towards adoption of some elements of the package. However, the Austrian Presidency has also been working intensively on all three dimensions of migration. In addition to the internal dimension, there is the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) package, and the Austrian Presidency has also considered the external dimension, as well as external border protection, and has examined possible measures that Member States can adopt in those areas.  This new approach was also presented to the Council at the working lunch of Interior Ministers on 6 December 2018 and, prior to that, at the technical meeting on 22 November. The participation of European citizens when discussing this and other European issues is very important. Thus, let me say a few concluding words about the pan-European exercise of the citizens’ dialogue and citizens’ consultations. This was a unique endeavour to engage with citizens across Europe and it was a truly inspiring experience. I myself had the opportunity to participate in several events in Austria. Besides those organised by the Member States, the consultations and discussions with citizens on the future of Europe undertaken by this House and by the Commission – which has already done its own citizens’ dialogue for a very long time – as well as the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee all contributed to this process. The outcome will be presented to the leaders by Chancellor Kurz this week in order to further reflections on the strategic agenda.

Leaders considered that co-legislators should be able to agree on the banking package before the end of the year, which we managed to do. I would like to thank the European Parliament again for the excellent cooperation.  At its meeting after 3 December, the Eurogroup, in an inclusive format – so with 27 Member States – also made significant and concrete progress. It is not up to the Council to deliberate on the Eurogroup agreements, so I will limit myself to presenting the highlights of this agreement to you. The Eurogroup concluded on the two concrete deliverables that leaders had requested from by December: the term sheet on the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund (SRF), and the terms of reference on ESM reforms. The common backstop to SRF is an important building block of a completed banking union, as is of course the co-legislators’ agreement on the banking package. The agreement on ESM reform will contribute to a more resilient EMU. First, it provides for more effective use of the ESM’s precautionary credit lines. Second, an enhanced role for the ESM could make the euro area’s capacity to act less dependent on third parties, while respecting the prerogatives of the Commission. Third, the debt sustainability approach will ensure that taxpayers in creditor and beneficiary countries do not have to shoulder a public debt that is assessed to be unsustainable in the context adjustment programmes. In its report to leaders, the Eurogroup also suggested a way forward on other dossiers such as liquidity in resolution, a European deposit insurance scheme (EDIS), and the euro area’s fiscal capacity. As far as the euro area budget is concerned, there was a readiness to continue working on instruments for promoting convergence and competitiveness. There was no common view on the need to pursue stabilisation instruments. It’s now up to leaders at the Euro Summit later this week to provide guidance as appropriate.

The European Parliament has rightfully been a central driving force behind the debate on deepening our economic and monetary union. This is a decisive moment on what has been a challenging path, and the strong support of this House is more important than ever. On behalf of the Commission, I would like to thank you for that. Last week the Eurogroup agreed on a number of steps. They were perhaps not giant but, nonetheless, important. The discussion was far from easy, but the results show the willingness around the table to find workable solutions on our common challenges. We made progress on many issues discussed, in particular the terms of reference for the common backstop for the single resolution fund and the reform of the European Stability Mechanism. As regards budgetary instruments for the euro area, further guidance from the Euro summit will be needed. For the upcoming Euro summit, we must build a momentum, as we urgently need to press ahead with ambitious reforms. On the backstop for the Single Resolution Fund, we need a credible, fast and efficient system of decision-making. The ESM Commission cooperation should stay within the boundaries of primary and secondary law. Also, we have to make sure that the conditions of ESM instruments are not too strict to make them usable. Eventually, the ESM will need to be brought into the Union framework to increase democratic scrutiny, most importantly by closer involvement of the European Parliament. We also see reasonable steps to promote the existing framework of the debt sustainability in the euro area. Now let me turn to the budgetary instruments for the euro area. I welcome the openness of the Eurogroup to work on budgetary instruments for competitiveness and convergence, subject to further guidance by leaders. Unfortunately, the Eurogroup has shown less consensus on instruments for stabilisation, which are also essential. We therefore hope for further progress, guidance and also more ownership at the Euro summit. The Commission’s proposals for a reform support programme and the euro area fiscal stabilisation function should provide the basis for this discussion, which should take place in the context of the next Multiannual Financial Framework. We can, of course, develop them further, to reconcile our design with the ideas coming from France and Germany, but also other Member States and the European Parliament. Parliament can play an important role in designing these budgetary instruments. It is therefore also in your hands to take the proposals further and accelerate work. Finally, on the European deposit insurance scheme (EDIS). This is indeed the most difficult part on which little progress has been made at the Eurogroup. As progress has been slow both in the Council and Parliament, last year the Commission set out a workable approach to introduce EDIS step by step and closely linked with risk reduction. We believe that there has been enough progress on risk reduction to warrant the start of political discussions on at least its first phase. Dear colleagues, the Commission counts on your continued support. Your clear political push will be indispensable to generate the ambition needed. We can build on solid ground on risk reduction; the progress report we published two weeks ago shows that non-performing loans on banks’ balance sheets can continue to decline to an average of 3.4% in the second quarter of this year, a decline of 1.2 percentage points in a single year. MREL buffers are being built up, with about 90% of the required MREL already in place. We welcome the agreement on the banking package and the vote of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) on non-performing loans last week. On that basis, the completion of the Banking Union, also on the risk-sharing, is a matter of priority. The Capital Markets Union can also strengthen the Economic and Monetary Union by diversifying financing sources of the European economy and promoting private risk-sharing. I call on you to close the many CMU files still before the end of this term. Finally, following the Commission’s communication, the international role for the euro will also be addressed at the December Euro Summit. Stronger economic and monetary union, as well as deep and liquid capital markets, are prerequisites for a euro that better reflects Europe’s political, economic and financial weight.

The Commission's proposal, which was a timid proposal but was an embryo of the euro area budget, is simply ignored by the Eurogroup, which is content, at a minimum, with a Franco-German proposal revised downwards between June and November, which is progressing in the only direction that interests a number of Member States. , but certainly not those in this Parliament who argue for a genuine eurozone budget.

Convergence is not a real convergence, since it does not talk about the issue of surpluses or deficits but only serves in reality as a cover-up for structural reforms. As for the stability function, which is unanimously or almost unanimously - and clearly not within the Eurogroup - recognised as the missing function of the euro area budget, it is simply ignored.

This European Parliament, at the snatch, night and day, has negotiated a banking package that is now tied up. It has reached an agreement on reducing non-performing loans, and risk reduction is there, but risk sharing is evaporating. This is dangerous, it is not sustainable.

We see the behaviour of stock prices in the US; we see problems with excessive debts in China; we see a number of emerging economies in financial distress. The question arises: are we prepared to face this new crisis coming? Unfortunately, my answer is negative. I think, first of all, that we face the problem with excessive debts in some of the countries. As we all know, monetary policy is not sufficient: it is at a zero interest rate level and cannot help to fend off the recession. Fiscal policy has to play the primary role, and many countries are not prepared.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your questions and for this intense debate, which shows the interest of your House in these subjects, it is true decisive. I mean that the European Parliament, throughout this mandate, has been a major ally of the Commission in the decisive work of deepening economic and monetary union. At a very important time on what has been a difficult path, your support is more important than ever. Strengthening our economic and monetary union must remain a top priority. The economic and fiscal situation in the euro area is now positive, but we also know that significant risks remain both inside and outside Europe, and this must push us to act quickly. We may need these tools, which, I recall, the only purpose is to protect Europeans. We may need it much faster than we think, and it would be a mistake to abandon this much-needed reform of the euro area. The euro area is certainly an asset to our economies, we know it, our citizens are attached to it, but we also know that it is incomplete and that, incomplete, it cannot fulfil all the functions that are expected of it. Despite the urgency, I am obliged to recognise that the formation of a consensus between Member States on these issues now seems difficult.  The long and even very long discussions of the Eurogroup last Monday reflect deep differences between Member States on the method, but also on the means to be implemented to strengthen the euro area. Some Member States, and I regret this, have failed to go beyond their national interests to the general European interest. I am aware that the conclusions of this meeting do not live up to your legitimate expectations and, to be very frank, they also do not live up to my expectations. If I had, and I have, like you, a much higher level of ambition, I still want to start with some positive elements that came out of the December 3 meeting. Firstly, we must welcome the fact that the Eurogroup has reached an agreement in time for the 14 December summit. You have to be aware that it was not given in advance. The President of the Eurogroup, Mario Centeno, had wanted the finance ministers to work methodically, subject by subject, to try to build a roadmap, and it is there. Although it is modest, I hope it will encourage European leaders to take strong decisions to strengthen economic and monetary union. The second good news is that the agreement on the safety net for the Single Resolution Fund is decisive. As Valdis Dombrovskis pointed out earlier, this is a necessary and important step towards the completion of the banking union and the effective protection of the deposits of European savers, which we must absolutely guarantee, especially in times of economic crisis, and we know that we must always prepare for the next crisis. Finally, our arguments in favour of reforming the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) have been heard by the finance ministers. We agreed - it was not easy - on a compromise, following the position that Valdis Dombrovskis and I had drawn up with Klaus Regling. It respects the European treaties while preserving the Commission's legal and institutional competences, and will enable the ESM to strengthen its role. So much for the three positive points and, objectively, I think they should be welcomed by all, because these are pragmatic advances that we needed. However, on other projects, which I have said are essential, the Member States have not been able to agree and the results are very honestly short of our expectations.  I am thinking first of all of EDIS, the deposit insurance system. Of course, we have agreed to continue the technical work and to appoint a high-level working group, but - you can see my smile right away - when we appoint a high-level working group, there is still a long way to go.  The risk-reduction effort by many Member States seems to me to call for much more decisive progress on this front and towards risk-sharing. Indeed, for me, responsibility and solidarity must go hand in hand. And now that the level of risk has clearly fallen in the euro area, we must make room for solidarity. I call on the Member States to agree on a concrete roadmap as early as Friday. We must not stop at his promise.  I think, second instead, to the creation of a eurozone budget, and you know that I have been attached to it for years, long before I even joined the European Commission, when I was my country's finance minister. This is a particularly complex point of the negotiation and, in the absence of agreement, we had no choice but to send the ball back to the heads of state and government.  As the conclusions say, we await their guidance and it is up to them to decide, at the euro summit, whether our work will continue. And I am counting on them to give the Eurogroup a clear and ambitious mandate. We need it because, as inequalities widen between Member States as they grow within them, it is absolutely essential to put in place active tools of convergence and solidarity, once again, between the countries of the euro area.  And as such, I also think it is urgent to make progress on the creation of a possible stabilization function. As the Eurogroup's conclusions say, no common position has been reached - I recognise that. Further technical work is called upon. I call for further not only technical work, but also political reflection. There is no question of the Commission, I tell you, abandoning its proposal, which is still on the table. I hope that the Member States will be able to stand together and make concrete progress at the summit on 14 December, based on the Eurogroup's proposals.  I had spoken several times about a window of opportunity to reform the red zone, I am obliged to note that this window is closing little by little and that we have no more time to waste. The return of economic growth is an opportunity to move forward and we now have the prospect of the European elections. This should encourage Member States to act to ensure stability, to revive convergence within the euro area. It is yet another way of demonstrating to Europeans the usefulness, the added value of the European Union on subjects that are at the heart of their concerns. This is nothing less, once again, than employment, growth, solidarity, convergence between economies, solidarity between regions.  On the other hand, I want to make one last observation. It was not in the Eurogroup meeting, but I am doing it for myself, sort of. I note that our proposals to strengthen the democratic functioning and transparency of the euro area are not progressing, to the point where they were not even on the agenda of the meeting.  I am thinking of the transformation of the stability mechanism into a kind of European monetary fund, which you support, but included in the European institutions, which is therefore controlled by your Parliament. I am thinking of the creation of a eurozone finance minister who would also be a member of the European Commission and who would also be responsible to the European Parliament.  I know that when there is democratic control, the quality of decisions is quite different in nature. These proposals are not taken into account by the Member States, and I deeply regret that. I still believe that European citizens have a say in decisions - as our Greek friends know - that affect their daily lives, and I also believe that the European institutions cannot act without democratic control. For me, it's a real political creed, it's mine for years, believe it remains so. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in this fight for the completion of economic and monetary union, your support will be absolutely essential. I am convinced that the european Parliament's support, but also the political pressure, will still be able to move the lines in the coming months, the next years, and this must also be one of the issues at stake in the European elections.  I will not participate, at least not as a candidate, but I encourage the various political parties to focus on that. The European Commission is counting on you to get you fully involved in this debate. Your voice matters, I think you have the capacity to make the peoples of Europe aware of the need to complete these reforms and to push European political leaders to seize them in turn with even more force.  This meeting of the Eurogroup was a start, it was a stage, it is certainly not the end of this debate and this fight which I invite you to continue and which I will naturally continue in my place and in my role.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 94, "date": "2018-12-11.json", "name": "Juliane Bogner-Strauss", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened carefully to your remarks.

I am speaking here not only on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats as shadow rapporteurs, but also on behalf of my colleagues Harkin and Mr Stevens of the ALDE and ECR Groups. There are good reasons to vote against the granting of the mandate. On the one hand, there are reasons for the substance: we in the European Parliament should really consider whether we are doing something good for the most important people in our European Parliament, whether we are doing something good for the citizens, especially the workers, with this report. We have highly mobile workers who, according to this report, do not know if they are working in one country today and tomorrow in another country, what kind of social security system they will be in. For mobile workers, especially for people who commute across the border, we have a far too rapid change in social law from the sending country to the country to which they are posted. We have a situation where workers who move from one country to another today, in that country when they become unemployed, receive unemployment benefits from that country from day one. There is the question: do we want this? Nor should we create an incentive for social abuse. We should create incentives for social systems that are good in Europe to benefit the people who need them. The second point, which is very important, is that we should put the whole of the European Parliament to the vote on this report. The whole of the European Parliament should vote on this important report, and not just the EMPL Committee. It is not a question of rejecting this report today. We all do not want that. What we are talking about today is that we in the European Parliament – all Members – should have an opinion and that we should then vote together on this report again in the next strasbourg week. That's what I'm campaigning for. And I would also like to say one more thing to the Commission: it is simply wrong that the most important files should always be brought to a conclusion, at the last second, and that we in the European Parliament have little time to deal with them sensibly, and that we are then put under pressure and said: now, however, you have to get ready quickly.

In order to fight for the mobility of artists, to make it easier to move, to deprive them of the visa requirement, to also to admonition the Eastern Partnership countries, those young people, the artists who operate in Georgia, who operate in Ukraine, operate in Belarus, so that they too can take advantage of certain privileges enjoyed by artists or representatives of this creative industry in Europe itself.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 146, "date": "2018-12-11.json", "name": "Момчил Неков (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "125013", "text": "   – Mr President, the European Union is gradually emerging from a crisis that has had a significant impact on the cultural and creative industries.

However, it is unacceptable, every time, to deprive our citizens of contact with culture at the expense of new priorities. We must also not ignore the fact that one of the main barriers to cultural access is precisely the lack of funds. According to eurobarometer data from 2017, 36% of Europeans have not participated in any cultural activity in the last year. In the same line of thoughts under the European Union's most popular Creative Europe culture programme, only 16.2% of the projects that participated received funding. This means that demand is times greater than supply. I supported my colleague Gramakis's report because I believe that the Union must have a coherent, sustainable and well-funded culture policy.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has I would like to start my speech with a short quote: \"International terrorism unfortunately does not stop at any national border. If we want to protect ourselves effectively, we need good cooperation between the security authorities in Europe. We need a better exchange of all available information in the EU – and much more quickly – on extremist perpetrators of violence. We must be as united as possible against all forms of extremism and terror.\" These words of August 2017 did not come from a conservative interior minister or political commentator, but from the then Social Democrat German Federal Justice Minister Heiko Maas. Although I do not usually adopt quotes from political competitors, I would like to send this appeal by Heiko Maas to everyone in this House. Terrorism is something that we want to combat across all political groups, where we want to stick together and adopt a powerful report. First of all, a brief review: we have a labour-intensive 15 months ahead of tomorrow's plenary vote. I would particularly like to thank my co-rapporteur, Helga Stevens, and also my shadow rapporteurs, who have worked most intensively with me. Dear Caterina, you are sitting here, Maite is also in the room. A very, very heartfelt thank you for the good cooperation. However, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to Nathalie Griesbeck, who, as the head of our committee, has worked hard to allow and facilitate very good objective work. Thank you very much, Nathalie, and in particular a thank you to the Staff of the Commission, to you, Dear Julian King, to Commissioner Avramopoulos, to all your staff from the Commission, but also from the relevant agencies that supported, accompanied and helped us, and also to the institutions from the Member States that made it possible for us, whether in Paris. , London, Berlin, Madrid or wherever – to gather information, to make visits, to receive information, to discuss issues, problems, but also possible solutions. Building on these experiences and impressions, we then jointly produced a report which aims to analyse the most important problems and fields of action in accordance with the mandate given. A horizontal issue that has repeatedly come to our eye is the need to implement existing legislation in the field of counter-terrorism consistently and on time – that is one of our demands – and also to ensure the appropriate technical and human resources for practical applicability. We also call on all Member States to stop opt-outs in the existential area of the fight against terrorism, but instead to work together on all of them. Our mandate has focused on cooperation in the field of information exchange. I am all the more frightened by the motions that the GUE has just received, which would in fact completely undermine this exchange of information and make it impossible. I hope that together we will decide to exchange information and not against an exchange of information. We must make the most of the technology we have today, just as the criminals end up doing on their side. On the technical side, too, we must not penify our security and judicial institutions, but must urgently try to provide our institutions with appropriate instruments, which, of course, take into account the case law of the ECJ and also take account of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We are calling for all the technical possibilities to become so good at some point by default – in English, the fine expression – that the quality of the information, the standards of information, that we can exchange it much, much more quickly, perhaps eventually exchange them with long-term objectives by default, that Europol becomes a real hub for the exchange of information, and that Eurojust also has additional powers. We also want us to blacklist hate preachers. We are calling for improvements, especially for the victims of terrorist attacks. It must not be all on paper, but real aid must be offered to the victims. And we have put together a comprehensive catalogue for this. I would like to thank all those who have helped to make this report better and I hope that we will be able to adopt a powerful report here tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 153, "date": "2018-12-11.json", "name": "Helga Stevens", "mepid": "125105", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is now more than two and a half years since we were confronted with the terrible bombings in Brussels. The bloody terror attacks in Paris were still fresh in our minds at the time. The images of untold human suffering and testimonies of survivors have forever changed our view of the world.  This report has become a vision text with advice on all aspects of the fight against terrorism. I would have liked to have put forward some of these proposals to you. Several new solutions are proposed in the report. Hate preachers and foreign funding of mosques are a problem. That is why I propose that there should be a European blacklist of hate preachers so that they can no longer hop around Europe. The financing of mosques and organisations by third countries which do not engage in democracy, the rule of law and human rights should also be banned.  Several terrorist attacks in the EU were carried out by persons known to the judiciary. Car rental companies should therefore be able to exchange information such as booking or reservation data with security services for cross-checks with police databases. The Commission should therefore examine how a system can be set up to verify the identity of persons renting vehicles, aircraft and boats.  Existing loopholes are also being sued. So far, for example, there are no methodologies to measure the effectiveness of radicalisation projects. However, the EU budget up to 2020 provides €314 million for such programmes. It is therefore called for the european Commission to set up a service to start pilot projects and then use scientific methods to measure their effectiveness. We also need an overview of all funds for deradicalisation programmes.  The difficult management of victims of terror is also a painful problem. The way in which they had to beg for financial interventions to which they were entitled is unacceptable. That is why we propose three things. First, a standard form to apply for compensation. Secondly, clear obligations with deadlines for insurers, and thirdly automatic pre-financing by the government shortly after the tax to cover the immediate costs. I was also inspired by interviews with experts from home and abroad, including our own police and intelligence services. They pointed out to me a number of good practices in Belgium, which also convince at European level. This is the case, for example, of the local integral security cells that Jan Jambon wanted to roll out as Belgian Minister of The Interior throughout Belgium. Pilot projects have shown that these cells can be a successful tool to tackle potential violent radicalisation at the municipal level through human-sized counselling.  As for Brexit. The EU and the UK are heavily dependent on each other in terms of security. Therefore, arrangements should be made with the EU to ensure that the UK and THE EU can continue to collect, share and analyse vital information on the fight against serious crime. I am very pleased with the current text of this report. I therefore call on all members to vote in favour of this report. Finally, I would like to thank the co-rapporteur, shadow rapporteurs, colleagues and experts for their contribution and help in the preparation of this report. I would also like to thank the Secretariat of the Special Committee on Terrorism for its unbridled commitment. Last but not least, I would particularly like to thank the victims of the attacks for their courage in coming to testify and for their important input. I dedicate this report to them and their families. The report is the result of titanic work, made possible only thanks to the cooperation of all of you. Thank you again. Remember, making Europe safer is teamwork and all of us responsibility.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 154, "date": "2018-12-11.json", "name": "Julian King", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, when the Special Committee on Terrorism was established a year-and-a-half ago, the remit given to it was, frankly, pretty challenging. It required from its members both an understanding of the overarching issues as well as intricate knowledge of counterterrorism policy. I believe that the draft report the committee has presented more than does justice to these high standards and to its ambitious task. I’d like to express my warmest thanks to Ms Griesbeck, the Chair, to the two co-rapporteurs, Ms Hohlmeier and Ms Stevens, and to all the members of the committee. The report, once adopted, will help shape the future framework for our collective counterterrorism efforts for the years to come. I’m very happy that the report reiterates the paramount importance of respect for fundamental rights in all of our security policies. These are indeed a vital part, a foundation, of any effective counterterrorism action. Another cross-cutting issue on which we are very much in agreement is the need for Member States to deliver on what has been collectively agreed. The Commission will be relentless in making sure that all legislation that is adopted is implemented fully and in a timely manner. Indeed, our latest Security Union progress report, published earlier today, gives a full update on all of the ongoing work we are pursuing. It focuses on three areas where we need to maintain momentum. First, we need, as a priority, to deliver on the outstanding security proposals, for example on interoperability, before the end of this Parliament’s current term. Second, we need to ensure that we enforce measures which have already been agreed, for example on passenger name records (PNR) and on the Counter-Terrorism Directive. And third, we need to continue to build our resilience on issues such as protecting our elections and tackling disinformation – on which we’ve called on the big internet platforms to live up to their commitments – as well as practical issues such as better protecting our public spaces. Given that ensuring security requires international cooperation, the report also outlines the progress we’re making in various negotiations and dialogues with third countries. Let me come now to the key issues considered in detail in the committee’s report. First, I welcome the emphasis the committee has put on protecting the external borders and the need for efficient information exchange, including maximising the use of existing information systems. This translates directly into the energy this Parliament has been putting into the ongoing negotiations on the interoperability proposals. I’m looking forward to the third trilogue later this week and I’m confident that, with the help of the two excellent rapporteurs, Mr Lenaers and Mr Melo, a political agreement is within reach.  I know Parliament is also working very hard on the Commission’s proposal to strengthen the European Border and Coastguard Agency. I’d like to thank Ms Metsola for her commitment on this issue. Strong and reliable protection of the external borders is a precondition for ensuring security in our shared space. That said, we should be clear about the need to avoid conflating the challenges of migration, on the one hand, with those of fighting terrorism, on the other. At the same time, we need to make progress on prevention. Indeed, this brings me to the second point I want to highlight: on prevention, we are reinforcing our efforts to tackle radicalisation, both online and offline. The report underlines the need to achieve automatic detection and full, fast, systematic and permanent removal of terrorist content online, and calls on the co-legislators to proceed urgently with their work. I very much agree: we should provide a clear harmonised framework, prevent the misuse of hosting-service providers for the dissemination of terrorist content, while at the same time ensuring the full protection of fundamental rights. So I’m happy to report that the Justice and Home Affairs Council (JHA) last Thursday adopted a negotiating mandate and is ready to start discussions with this House. I’m sure that Parliament will respond to this by adopting its position so that negotiations can start as soon as possible. I remain fully at the disposal of the rapporteur, Mr Dalton. I truly hope that we will manage to close this file before the end of the current parliamentary term.  The Commission also continues to support work being done by Member States on the prevention of radicalisation offline, and welcomes the committee report’s concrete recommendations on thematic priorities, including work on education, tackling radicalisation in prisons, and the role of local actors. These recommendations will feed into our ongoing work in this crucial field. Third, the committee has devoted a lot of attention, as we’ve just heard, to the victims of terrorism. I fully agree and I recognise that victims need special attention and support. That’s why the Commission is committed to making sure that Member States fully implement the Directive on Combating Terrorism, which significantly reinforces victims’ rights. In addition, the Commission will support the setting-up of a new coordination centre for victims of terrorism, an initiative that originated in this House. This hub of expertise, guidance and support will be up and running next year. Fourth, to close down the space in which terrorists operate, the report calls for the swift adoption of the Commission proposals aimed at improving cross-border access to electronic evidence. The JHA Council adopted a general approach on this proposal last week and is ready to launch interinstitutional negotiations. I’d like to echo strongly the urgency expressed in the report. We need progress in order better to support the investigation and prosecution of cross-border crime, including terrorism and cybercrime. Fifth, I welcome the importance that the report attaches to fighting terrorist financing. I am happy that Parliament has adopted its negotiating mandate on the proposals to facilitate the use of financial information and that the co—legislators will start talks this week. I also share the concerns expressed in the report about an increase in large-scale money laundering, as a source for terrorism financing, through certain banking institutions in the euro area, and I take due note of calls for the establishment of a European Union Terrorist Finance Tracking System. Personally, I think this is something we need to be pressing ahead with. Sixth, on building resilience, the report is ambitious in its recommendations on explosives precursors. I’d like to thank Mr Mamikins, the rapporteur on our proposals on this subject, for his efforts which resulted in the adoption of his report by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) yesterday evening. I’m looking forward to the speedy adoption of the negotiating mandate so that we can start trilogues as soon as possible. The report is also clear that Europe needs to do more to tackle cyber-threats, particularly cyber-terrorism. We have collectively done a lot in this respect and I’d like to congratulate the co-legislators, and in particular the rapporteur, Ms Niebler, for the agreement on the Cybersecurity Act that was reached yesterday – an important milestone. Lastly, allow me to touch on hybrid threats, including disinformation. As discussed in this Chamber on a number of occasions, these threats can be particularly damaging for European democracy in the context of upcoming elections, including of course next spring’s elections to this Parliament. That’s why on 5 December the Commission, together with the High Representative, presented an action plan with proposals for a coordinated EU response to the challenge of disinformation. We have made a lot of progress on these security issues. There’s still a lot of work ahead of us. I welcome the fact that we share similar visions of future priorities and on what we need to accomplish in the short term. Let me once again thank the Special Committee for its properly impressive work. We are all counting on this House now to help deliver on this ambitious vision in order to strengthen the Security Union further and better protect our citizens against terrorism.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 155, "date": "2018-12-11.json", "name": "Przewodniczący. –", "mepid": "23768", "text": "   Thank you very much, Commissioner.

Mr President, with this special committee, we have been able to measure how jihadist terrorism, but also the rise of other forms of violent extremism, pose a lasting and complex threat to our continent. This threat is now, unfortunately, rooted as much in the activism of radical groups outside our borders as in the reality of our European societies. This Parliament therefore had to show its credibility in dealing with these sensitive subjects and this text is an excellent basis. It addresses citizens' concerns, proposes concrete measures to support professionals involved in counter-terrorism and takes into account the needs of victims. It must be acknowledged that many initiatives, as you have pointed out, Commissioner, are already under way on the part of the Commission and on the part of the Member States. This is especially true for the most important of these initiatives, which is not necessarily the most spectacular for the general public: interoperability, which is something absolutely crucial.  There is no magic wand in counter-terrorism, contrary to some illusions, and the key is certainly not to stack structures at European level, but it is imperative to smooth trade, to use European platforms more systematically and to harmonize anti-terrorism methods and legislation from the top. The temptation exists today to put the threat into perspective, because it is more diffuse and because some terrorist organizations have suffered military setbacks, but that would be a serious mistake, because the last three decades have taught us that jihadist terrorism stems from a true ideology of determined, organized groups that know how to adapt. We must therefore remain extremely vigilant and the recommendations of this report must be implemented quickly, both at the level of the European and Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 157, "date": "2018-12-11.json", "name": "Caterina Chinnici", "mepid": "124861", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the report we are debating today is the result of intensive work, sometimes not easy, given the sensitivity of the subject, but I am convinced that the text has struck the right balance between the necessary measures to combat and the full protection of the fundamental rights on which our model of society is based. There are many recommendations aimed at prevention, such as combating the spread of terrorist content online, and funding is one of those aspects on which to take effective action to combat the phenomenon, which is increasingly fuelled by money laundering. In this respect, the exchange of information and cooperation between the relevant European agencies is essential. However, over and above the provisions included in the report, we have tried over many months to respond to the concerns of European citizens, who are asking us for more security, and above all to the victims of the attacks, by asking the Commission for a legislative proposal on the victims of terrorism, defining their specific condition and rights, and also the creation of the European Centre for the Coordination of Victims – victims who are all victims of terrorism. , I always want to remind you of this, innocent people, victims of attacks aimed at destabilising our democratic societies. Finally, I would like to point out that we did not want to focus exclusively on jihadist terrorism in the report, but we wanted to give our work a broader scope, also addressing the resurgence of other forms of violent extremism, which also pose a risk to civil coexistence.

We haven’t had a multi-casualty terrorist attack in Europe since, I think, 23 March 2018 in Carcassonne. The public mind is naturally on other matters. But I am under no illusions: those that wish us harm and seek to disrupt our societies are at this moment actively plotting and preparing attacks. I congratulate the police and security services in all our countries for their professionalism and vigilance.  The United Kingdom has among the most professional and capable intelligence and security services in the world and makes an enormous contribution to the security of Europe as a whole. As Helga Stevens has mentioned, this report endorses the need for a close future security partnership between the EU and the UK. While there is a certain ideological boneheadedness in Brussels in other areas concerning Brexit, it’s nevertheless widely recognised by the professionals and, I believe, at the political level that there must be continuity in the security relationship between the EU and the UK. This includes UK contribution to, and access to, information and data networks. We also need close cooperation in many other areas, for example in dealing with those returning to our countries from the ISIS terror organisation, and none of us has yet found an acceptable solution to the problem of convicted extremists, both during their term of imprisonment and – most importantly – once they have served their sentences.

We are obliged to understand changes in the terrorist threat, its mutations, anticipate as much as possible and identify which legislative instruments should be developed in the next mandate, be effective and reach consensus as far as possible. Personally, it is what I have tried not to forget, and I have not forgotten the testimonies of the survivors of the attacks or the families of those killed. On behalf of my group, and in my group, I will underline some of the recommendations. The level of information exchange between Member States is improveable. That is why we call for stronger cooperation and coordination between European Union agencies, national agencies, intelligence and police services, as well as the obligation for Member States to meet minimum data quality standards when introducing information into the system. Some Member States find it difficult to understand that European cooperation improves their operational capabilities. That is why my group — the ALDE Group — has asked the European Commission, through an amendment, for a proposal to extend Europol's mandate so that it can initiate investigations on its own initiative. The fight against violent radicalization is one of the outstanding subjects. That is why I think it is so necessary to request the establishment of a Centre of Excellence for the Prevention of Radicalisation, which is capable of measuring the effectiveness of programmes. We need to improve the evaluation of anti-radicalization instruments and to develop prevention, counter-up, local work in an orderly manner. For the first time – and it is a milestone – the Commission is asked for a legislative proposal on victims of terrorism, including a common definition of its status and rights and the procedures for accessing the necessary attention. And it is also very important that you recommend concrete functions for the European Coordination Centre. Member States are asked to avoid tributes to terrorists with a firm conviction.

Mr President, there are subjects which are difficult to debate because they unleash passions very quickly, which often prevents reason from taking precedence. However, we have largely escaped this in the context of these special committees, and I welcome that, although our views may differ quite widely. There is a consensus between us. Our citizens have a right to security, and the fight against terrorism must be a priority. But our citizens also have a right to security, which means that their rights must be protected, including from the risks of abuse of power by public authorities.  This means that the end, as legitimate as it is, does not justify any means and, in particular, that any infringement of rights and freedoms must be justified by the principles of necessity, purpose and proportionality. That is why we are against the proliferation of information exchanges. There is an increasing number of people, including those who may have intended to commit an act. This theory of generalized suspicion is not the right method, especially prevention. Moreover, there is no justification for a hierarchy between fundamental rights, nor can there be second-class or second-generation citizens whose rights would be different. We reject the stigmatization of whole sections of the population. Although it has been improved during the negotiations, this report remains below our expectations.

For, under the guise of fighting terrorism, the supporters of the clash of civilizations and the enemies of democracy actually want to extend their influence, whether to divide society by sizing fear and hatred or to muzzle oppositions.

We propose measures against the shocking failure of our governments to implement European legislation and FATF recommendations to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, including the need to set up a European financial information unit and reform VAT to prevent carousel fraud from continuing to finance transnational mafias, including terrorists. We also propose measures to put an end to the hypocrisy of European governments abandoning the victims of terrorism once the media spotlight has been diverted.

The terrorist threat knows no material borders, no immaterial borders, and that is why, by taking our political responsibilities, and not just by working in a technical way, our Parliament, through its work, through the work of the committee, has targeted what needs to be done to develop, alongside the Member States, a real added value to combat this scourge. To carry out this work, to make the diagnosis, the Committee has set up a real forum, a kind of European platform on terrorism, which has allowed us to listen, to audition, to meet, to work, to deepen, to question all the major players of the whole of the European Union.  Two objectives: to learn from the past, to see good practices, to see also the flaws, and above all to look to the future, through these recommendations which cover a multitude of the challenges that are posed to our time: radicalisation, exchange of information, judicial and police cooperation between the intelligence services, victims' rights, the fight against the means of action of terrorist organizations. We call for the creation of a centre of excellence to prevent radicalization and work in the heart of neighbourhoods alongside states. We call for the strengthening of European agencies, in particular Europol, which must become a genuine centre for information exchange and cooperation in the fight against terrorism, a kind of European FBI. Work to be carried out also with Eurojust, with the request to extend the powers of the European Public Prosecutor's Office, to the fight against terrorism. At the heart of the mandate, the report calls for an approach to the sharing of information by default of all data related to terrorism between the States and the European agencies concerned, except of course on the current cases and without altering, of course, the protection of sources, which is a major element. We call for the creation of a European programme to monitor the financing of terrorism so as not to depend on our American 'friends', and, of course, a coordination centre for victims.

That is essential. Information must be exchanged automatically, continuously and directly between national police forces. That's already happening, but it can always be better.

Europol is indeed the hub and the most suitable instrument. It must be developed into that central European digital counter-terrorism unit, as the report states.

In an area without internal borders, European action is crucial to facilitate cooperation and the exchange of information between The Member States and with the European Union. I agree with the request to extend the powers of the European Public Prosecutor's Office to combat organised crime and terrorism, but international terrorism must be particularly affected in its sources of funding.

I hope we are all agreed that effective security policies in the area of countering terrorism, as in others, must necessarily be rooted in respect for fundamental values. We can achieve the results we seek only when we work together, and, to that end, I have to say, on a personal basis, that I am very grateful to all the members of the Special Committee on Terrorism (TERR) for the very powerful role they’ve played in developing our counterterrorism policy for the period ahead, and I look forward to our continuing cooperation. Successfully tackling the threat posed by terrorism and developing an effective and genuine Security Union has to be a shared responsibility not only for our Member States, of course, as many of you have underlined, but also for the Commission and, indeed, for all of us here in this House. Just to pick up one or two of the issues that have been raised. The first thing I want to say is that I think we should be proud of our values, including those of freedom of expression and freedom of belief. I don’t think there’s anything to be gained by stigmatising religion. Indeed, that runs the risk of doing the extremists’ work for them. That said, we also have to be unremitting in identifying and tackling radicalisation and opposing violence from whatever source. On the victims, whom many of the speakers referred to with real compassion, the Commission recognises the special character of victims of terrorism who’ve been indiscriminately caught up in attacks. That’s why we went to the trouble, with your support, of specifically reinforcing the means of support in the Counterterrorism Directive for the rights of victims and their family members. We now need to make sure that this is effectively implemented, and for that reason we are picking up your initiative and setting up a centre of expertise for the victims of terrorism, as a first step towards establishing a permanent EU coordination centre for victims of terrorism. That’s also why we are awaiting the report by Ms Milquet, the special adviser to President Juncker on the question of how to do better on compensation for victims, including victims of terrorism. She will present her proposals, as you know, early next year. Last point of detail: I agree with the many Members who called on us to strengthen our agencies in this area, in relation to the support they can give to the shared effort and to the work of our Member States. Europol does an excellent job. We will continue to support Europol in any way we can within the existing Treaty provisions. Europol has unique capabilities that are put at the service of law enforcement across our Union and, indeed, beyond. Europol builds trust and confidence among the Member States and their law enforcement authorities, and that’s exactly what we need in order further to enhance police cooperation against terrorism. On these points, and on a wide range of other issues that have come up in the debate, I believe this report provides a significant and substantial contribution to Europe’s approach to counterterrorism for the years ahead.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 195, "date": "2018-12-11.json", "name": "Monika Hohlmeier", "mepid": "96780", "text": "  Rapporteur.

Let me also thank the shadow rapporteurs. I believe that by working together and building compromises we have reached a very good outcome, so that we can have a meaningful vote tomorrow – not only on the agreement itself but also on a resolution in which Parliament sends out important messages about trade, and calls on the parties to make the most of the progressive potential of this agreement. As standing rapporteur, let me begin by saying that we are discussing here much more than a trade agreement. Yes, this is a historic moment. In front of us, we have the most important bilateral trade agreement ever concluded by the EU. Two of the largest economies in the world, together representing nearly a third of the world’s GDP, will move closer to each other, eliminating a number of heavy tariffs as well as non—tariff barriers to trade. As a result, European products and services will get major new opportunities in the Japanese market. Acknowledging the successful outcome of the negotiations, all EU economic sectors are now speaking in favour of this agreement, including the agri—food sector, which will benefit from new export opportunities while protecting 205 geographical indications. No matter how relevant it may be from the economic point of view, however, this agreement is, above all, of major strategic importance. It gives us the chance to shape the global agenda at a time of rising protectionism, thus sending a clear and timely signal in favour of an open, fair and rules—based trading system. We should not miss this opportunity to promote our own values and standards in the Asia—Pacific region and in global trade. I would not be standing here as rapporteur supporting this EU—Japan Agreement if it were not a progressive trade agreement: an agreement clearly belonging to a new generation of trade agreements, in which sustainable development matters and environment, labour rights and consumer protection matter. Of course, there is no such thing as a perfect agreement, but this agreement recognises the UN Sustainable Development Goals. It is the first trade agreement with a reference to the Paris Agreement on climate change and it fully respects public services and the right to regulate. Moreover, it includes not only a commitment to pursue the ratification of the core International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions but also a review clause for improving the enforceability of labour and environmental rules. Japan, it is fair to say, has made substantial efforts, even before the entry into force of the agreement, and it is already discussing at inter—ministerial level the implementation of its sustainable development commitments. This should be warmly welcomed as a very good sign. Parliament has closely followed these negotiations from the beginning. We were supportive but also demanding. Last Friday, the Japanese Parliament approved the agreement. Tomorrow this Parliament will have the final say. My position as rapporteur is that this trade agreement is economically balanced and of major strategic importance. Furthermore, it clearly represents a step forward on sustainable development.

This week we are completing one of the most important projects of the European Union in the last two terms. It is not just about the financial effects of a strengthened partnership, it is much more. It is important that the European Union and Japan share a common understanding of global and regional challenges and want to work together to resolve them. The Economic Partnership Agreement is the largest free trade agreement ever concluded by a European federation. However, the Strategic Partnership Agreement is the most ambitious agreement of its kind to date, building on relations with Japan into a multisectoral and long-term partnership with global impact. Both agreements will have a positive impact on the European and Japanese economies and will strengthen the role of both partners in facing global and regional challenges. The complementacity of the forcing economic partnership agreement on goods and services is determined by a strategic partnership agreement of more than 40 areas of cooperation with Japan. The partners are committed to working for peace, security, against terrorism, poverty reduction, the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement and much more. In doing so, they emphasise their devotion to international law. This agreement is the first of its kind, which also includes a health chapter. By promoting regulatory harmonisation and research, we will improve access to global markets and use the combined knowledge to address health challenges. This is particularly important given the challenges that both partners of an ageing society bring. We are concluding these two agreements with Japan because we share not only common interests, but the same fundamental values and principles. Both agreements express a common commitment to respect human rights, democracy, fundamental freedoms, good governance, the rule of law and more. It was a pleasure to be rapporteur for the Strategic Partnership Agreement and to work with the shadow rapporteurs from both mandates. From the outset, we have worked hard for a forward-looking report. I would also like to thank the main negotiators and their teams for their excellent work and cooperation in a spirit of transparency, trust and shared responsibility. I would also like to thank several Japanese ambassadors for monitoring our work and working closely together. Thanks also to the parliamentary delegations of the European and Japanese Parliaments for their attention to the work of the negotiators and rapporteurs.  And let me conclude by thanking civil society in the European union and Japan for its interest. A strategic partnership agreement is not only an achievement, it is a new, great opportunity. I would like this agreement to experience dynamic validation in the Member States so that we can implement it as soon as possible. Of course, I recommend, or expect, strong support for this agreement tomorrow. Thank you for your attention, arigato.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 205, "date": "2018-12-11.json", "name": "Cecilia Malmström", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, on behalf of the Commission, I would like to ask for Parliament’s consent on the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) between the EU and Japan. As the rapporteur, Mr Silva Pereira, has explained, this is a very important agreement, and I would like to thank him and his team for the good cooperation we’ve had throughout these negotiations. As you know, the foundations of world trade are being shaken right now, and it is therefore important for the EU and its partners to reinforce their ties and to demonstrate the value of free economic exchanges based on fair rules, as opposed to whim and transactional strength, and Japan is clearly one such partner. The EPA has a strategic importance and an unquestionable economic and political value. It supports free and fair trade and helps the EU to make further inroads in the Far East, after a free trade agreement with South Korea. Japan is the world’s third largest economy. It’s the EU’s second trade partner in Asia and, through its economic footprint in East Asia, Japan can play a big role in shaping the development of rules and standards in the EU. We have every interest in the European Union in cooperating with Japan to secure a free and open environment in the region in Asia. From a bilateral perspective, the EU-Japan EPA removes the vast majority of the EUR 1 billion duties paid annually on EU exports to Japan. It will open up the Japanese market for 97% of all product categories, while the remaining ones will benefit from increased market access opportunities. We estimate in the Commission that these will lead to additional annual EU exports worth EUR 13 billion.  Important longstanding non-tariff barriers will be removed in the car sector, as the EU and Japan have agreed to reinforce international standards and to rely on them in defining the regulatory framework. European companies will be able to bid on equal terms for public procurement contracts, including at sub-central level for the 54 largest cities in Japan. European origin names for more than 200 foodstuffs will be protected against misuse. We also have a specific chapter on small and medium-sized enterprises, in which we commit to supporting our SMEs through dedicated information portals and contact points. This is clearly economically beneficial and it is intended to provide a basis for advancing important EU priorities regarding the economic transition towards a socially and environmentally sustainable model of growth and the protection of areas of overriding interest to public policy, such as health, safety and individual privacy. The EPA protects the European model of regulation. It sets up mechanisms that both parties can use to accompany the industrial transformation that the world’s environment requires. Under the regulatory cooperation provisions, we will engage with Japan on common responses to new technological challenges, from electric vehicles to product standards, to reducing waste.  The agreement lays the groundwork for bilateral engagement on social protection rules. Japan is a country committed to sustainable development provisions and it has established an inter-ministerial group to work on their implementation. This group is to consider the ratification of two fundamental International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions, as well as any domestic legislative adjustment that may be required, but Japan’s national legislation today also protects workers’ rights in this regard.  It is important for us in the EU to protect our economic and social model by spurring sustainable growth through free and fair trade and by cooperating with a friend and ally like Japan in the defence of these common interests. This agreement has been designed to spur our trade with, and our competitiveness in, a major economy with which, moreover, the EU must cooperate to defend open economic relations and develop sound international standards. I hope that Parliament will send out a strong global signal tomorrow by voting with a strong majority for this agreement. At the same time, you will also be voting on the Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA). Here again, it ties us closer to our Japanese friends’ democracies with their attachment not only to fair and free trade, as I have said, but also to multilateralism, human rights and the rule of law – and we have so many common interests and fundamental shared values.  A strong EU-Japan partnership is more important than ever in an international context in which these values and principles are, as you know, being challenged. We need to work together and to show joint leadership. This is of strategic importance, as is the EU-Japan Strategic Partnership Agreement. It will help us to make a positive contribution to the shaping of a cooperative regional order and it will help us to promote joint interests in the global arena. In this way, the benefits of the partnership go well beyond our bilateral relations. The agreement provides for close cooperation on global issues. Japan is, in fact, an indispensable partner in tackling many of the challenges that we both face – including climate change and cybersecurity. Japan is an important partner when it comes to development aid and humanitarian assistance. Together we count amongst the world’s biggest donors. The report by Mr Peterle – and I would like to thank him and his team for the excellent work they have done – also highlights the direct connection between European prosperity and Asian security, and the other way around. This is very important because it will help us to strengthen cooperation on security, crisis management and peace-keeping and we will do so jointly. The EU and Japan have been able to promote sustainable, rules-based connectivity in Europe, Asia and the Pacific, so we are bringing Asia and Europe closer via this agreement, and that reflects the policy direction contained in our global strategy.  It will strengthen our cooperation in tackling the many other challenges that our economies and societies face, and Mr Peterle mentioned them –remaining competitive, respecting rapidly emerging economies, coping with ageing societies and addressing energy and resource concerns. We have a lot to gain here by sharing experiences when we address these issues. The SPA will serve as a charter, underpinning our partnership, helping us turn our political ambitions into concrete action and joint initiatives. The European Parliament has a crucial role here in adopting the agreement. In addition, there are the EU-Japan interparliamentary meetings, the parliamentary diplomacy that makes a valuable contribution to our existing and future strategic partnership. Parliament’s engagement has underpinned decades of successful cooperation, and we can build on these efforts.

We are now working with the European Parliament, the European Data Protection Board and the EU governments to scrutinise our findings and make sure our assessment is correctly informed. The adequacy decision is of crucial importance because, with the adequacy in place, we will be able to create the biggest area of safe flow of data between our economies. While our citizens will benefit from greater privacy protection, our economies will also benefit from easier transfer of personal data. The most crucial aspect is, of course, that of convergence, the similarity of our data protection regime. As Commissioner Malmström has just said, Japan is a stable democracy, respecting fully the principle of rule of law. At the same time, Japan also is a country that has recently decided to change its approach to data protection by adopting a law that shares all key elements of our European General Data Protection Regulation. Actually, it is difficult to find another country outside the EU that has inspired itself so much from our approach to privacy. The Japanese law contains the same core principles, safeguards and individual rights as we know them from our law. These rules are checked and enforced by an independent supervisory authority – the Personal Information Protection Commission – which was also our main interlocutor throughout the adequacy negotiations. According to the Court of Justice, adequacy does not require a photocopy of our rules; the mechanism can differ, but the overall level of protection has to be essentially equivalent. It is our main benchmark in all the negotiations of possible adequacy decisions with other countries. This is also why we have negotiated a set of additional safeguards, which address the few relevant differences that we have found comparing the European and Japanese systems. We have also obtained the creation of an ad hoc complaint resolution mechanism, easily accessible for EU citizens in the sensitive area of government access to data. All the elements we have negotiated will ensure a high level of protection for data transfers to Japan. This type of convergence with the EU data protection system is exactly what the European Parliament has been calling for. It would thus be very important for your resolution to welcome it. This brings me to the strategic importance of this decision. As you know, Japan is one of our most important trading partners, and thus the destination of a large volume of data. This underlines both the need for protection and the economic relevance of the adequacy finding. In this process we have engaged intensively with all stakeholders, with the data protection authorities, with the European Data Protection Board, Member States and, of course, with the European Parliament. And this has already helped to clarify and strengthen a number of elements in the decision. I am therefore confident that we can finalise this process and adopt the adequacy decision as soon as possible. On the Japanese side, the Japanese data protection authority has already finalised its adequacy assessment for the EU and the timing of its decision will be synchronised so that we have both adequacy findings on the same day. Together, these mutual adequacy decisions will create the largest area of safe and free data flows in the world, thus complementing the Economic Partnership Agreement and increasing its benefits. This will also send a strong message to other countries that it is worth bringing their data protection framework closer to ours and, in other words, that convergence pays off. This will also confirm that the EU approach works while we are keeping the parallel tracks of negotiations, and personal data are not part of the trade talks. This proves we can work together to enhance strategic partnership with our allies and support the objective of secure data flows between our economies. In the end, this is a win—win situation – a win for the citizens and a win for the traders.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 207, "date": "2018-12-11.json", "name": "Christophe Hansen", "mepid": "193419", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, the EU-Japan EPA is far from being Godzilla, as some have called it in the past.

First of all, the huge economic gains. The EUR 1 billion tariff cuts for our companies and farmers. Secondly, its chapter on sustainable development, including our renewed commitment to the Paris Agreement. It is a clear win-win agreement that comes at a critical geopolitical moment, where trade wars can be triggered by a simple tweet and unilateral tariffs barriers are raised.

Also in this context, I warmly welcome both agreements. The Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA) will see the EU and Japan stepping up our cooperation in around 30 areas. The Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) is certainly the most wide-ranging, largest and most modern bilateral agreement ever achieved. I would call on my colleagues who are considering not supporting this agreement to ask themselves whether they would also be against promoting cooperation in the world, economic growth in Europe, opening job opportunities to hundreds of thousands of citizens and bringing benefits for consumers.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done.

We want fair and ethical trade, not modern free trade. We take seriously the concerns well-founded by thousands of citizens and non-governmental organisations, and that is where the agreement has big holes. Undoubtedly, the agreement will massively accelerate the interdependence of our economies, but digitisation and automation in production will increase competition in many sectors of the economy and cost many jobs. However, you no longer see the necessary structural adjustments as your responsibility. The social consequences are borne by the Länder and municipalities. The agreed dispute settlement mechanisms are not sufficient. We must also honestly recognise that the cheaper agricultural products exported from the EU to Japan will not only enrich the supply of goods in Japan, but will also contribute to the death of farmers there. This is not a contribution to fair globalisation and the distribution of wealth. And, Commissioner, On the important area of data trading: when we talk about global value creation, the advanced EU data protection is not represented in this value creation process, because it is not part of the agreement and is not represented in the agreement.

Trade with Japan is certainly important, but this agreement goes far beyond trade. It interferes with our basic democratic rights. This concerns local politics. Their tasks, such as schools, waste management, hospitals and regional transport, are being liberalised, which means that they should be privatised as much as possible. Local citizens should no longer be allowed to take up these tasks themselves. Once privatized businesses are privatized forever. They must no longer be returned in the hands of the citizens. Nor do our governments have the right to legislate on the social and environmental laws they want. The laws must not constitute a major obstacle to trade and investment, the agreement says. A particularly important case is the ban on genetic engineering. The European Commission has failed to reserve us this right. It would have been possible, but the Commission obviously wanted to introduce genetic engineering to us. JEFTA is also abolishing rules designed to prevent a new banking crisis. We do not need a free trade agreement to enforce fair trade rules. The principles of our General Data Protection Regulation were adopted by Japan even before JEFTA.

Until now, these opportunities have been hidden behind a dense jungle of technical and discriminatory barriers, which penalised European products and investors.

As some of you said, every agreement is a compromise – you give and you take, and sometimes the end result is not exactly as you wanted but rather good. You may like this agreement or not, but you have to stick to the truth: there is nothing – and I repeat nothing – in this agreement forcing any country of the European Union, or Japan, to privatise public services. Nor is there anything hindering any country of the European Union, or Japan, from taking back privatised services and renationalising them, as long as this is done in a non-discriminatory way. So stick to the truth. I also want to reject the claim that this is not transparent. Over the past two years, there have been 40 meetings with EU governments and 15 meetings with Members of this House, including the monitoring group. We have published negotiating texts. We have made available detailed reports of each negotiating round. We have had a lot of public meetings, I have attended several of them, and we put the whole text online in July 2017 when it was finalised. There are also many memos and fact sheets, including on a regional basis, and sometimes online, in which you can look at the content of this agreement. So please stick to the truth. On data adequacy, I also want to say that this House asked for clarifications. We have launched the process to adopt the final decision involving the opinion of our independent data protection authorities and, once that is finalised, which will be very soon, the EU-Japan mutual adequacy decision would confirm our global lead in setting high standards for the benefit of our citizens. This is an agreement with a friend and an ally. Japan is a strong democracy that shares our values, and together we stand for fair trade, free trade and sustainable trade, based on multilateral rules – and you all know that they are under question today. The agreement opens up fantastic possibilities for our goods, services and agri-food products, Irish whiskey and many others, that can be sold to the benefit of Japanese customers, and for cooperation in many areas beyond traditional trade. We have had a focus, jointly, on SMEs to try to help them in this regard. I have learned during these negotiations that we have much more in common with our Japanese friends than maybe we thought a few years ago. I am confident that the trade agreement and the strategic partnership agreement will give us a framework for developing areas of cooperation that are already ongoing, and many others as well, and that we will set a high standard for the world.

He has been for long years an interlocutor for many and a key figure in Turkey’s democratic debate. So today we are discussing not just the fate of a human being, which is probably the most important thing the Chamber can discuss, but also the state of Turkey’s democracy. We are discussing the individual and collective rights of all Turkish citizens. In the past two years, we have witnessed the detention of elected politicians, journalists and academics. We are well aware of the incredible challenge that Turkey faced, back in July 2016, with the attempted coup d’état but today the state of emergency is over and this should be the time to strengthen Turkey’s democracy. The independence of Turkey’s judiciary is being undermined. Fundamental rights such as the presumption of innocence are often ignored and violated. On the one hand, the case of Mr Demirtaş reflects these wider trends and, on the other hand, this case is quite unique. Demirtaş is a Member of Parliament, a former presidential candidate, the Co-Chair of his party and a democratically elected leader. His case is about pluralism in Turkey and the right of every individual freely to take part in their country’s democratic life, and, for this reason too, we have followed his case since his detention more than two years ago. On the day of his detention, Commissioner Hahn and I described him as ‘our trusted and valued interlocutor’, and I believe many in this Chamber will share these views. As you know, I raised this case again, in public and in private, during my last meeting with Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu at the High Level Political Dialogue in Ankara last month. That, by the way, was a very fruitful, open and constructive meeting, and I’m very happy about that. This was just two days after the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights which we are discussing today. The Court had ruled that Mr Demirtaş’ extended detention violated the European Convention on Human Rights. As Commissioner Hahn and I said in Ankara, just a couple of weeks ago during this meeting, we expect the Turkish authorities, including the Turkish judiciary, to follow up in an appropriate manner on the recommendations by the Council of Europe and on the rulings by the European Court of Human Rights. We expect to see concrete progress in Turkey on the rule of law and fundamental freedoms, including those of Mr Demirtaş. The Court in this case has described his detention as an unjustified interference with the free expression of the Turkish people’s opinion and with his right to be elected and to sit in Parliament. The Court found, ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ that his time in prison had the purpose to suffocate pluralism and Turkey’s democratic debate. Let me remind everyone that the European Convention on Human Rights does not belong to the European Union nor to any of our Member States. It is the result of work done in the 1950s by the Council of Europe, and Turkey is a proud founding member of the Council of Europe. The European Convention on Human Rights is embedded in Turkey’s domestic law so this is a violation not of a recommendation from the European Union but of Turkey’s own laws, principles and values. Mr Demirtaş’ legal status has changed now, following a recent ruling in another case by a Turkish court of appeal. Nonetheless, I believe that it is not only Turkey’s responsibility but also in Turkey’s interest to follow up immediately on rulings by the European Court of Human Rights. This is not just about Turkey’s status as a candidate country. I would like to be very clear on this. I believe it is about the kind of country the Turkish people and citizens want and deserve: a country with stronger institutions, a more inclusive country, and a country where all the people of Turkey can find their place and contribute to Turkish society’s collective progress. What we would like to see, as the European Union, is a strong, free, secure, prosperous and democratic Turkey as a key neighbour and partner in our region, not just as a candidate country. It is in our shared interest to contribute to this, and all the Turkish people should know that they can count on the European Union to be at their side for a secure, democratic, free and prosperous Turkey.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 265, "date": "2018-12-11.json", "name": "Kati Piri", "mepid": "37229", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Madam President, opposition leader Selahattin Demirtaş is facing a maximum sentence of 183 years.

For representing millions of people in Turkey who want peace, millions of people who want to continue their struggle for equal rights through democratic means, and for being the voice of Kurdish – and Turkish – youth who are fed up with the decades-long bloodshed. The European Court of Human Rights last month unanimously ruled for his immediate release. To say it in the words of the Court: ‘It is beyond reasonable doubt that the Demirtaş detention had pursued the predominant ulterior purpose of stifling pluralism and limiting freedom of political debate.’  This is the definition of a political prisoner. This is the reason why President Erdoğan has no plans to release his political opponent. It’s easier to rule without an opposition, without free press, and without civil society.

Tomorrow a new trial will begin in Ankara, which my colleague Anne-Marie Mineur will attend. Like so many Kurds and progressives in Turkey, Mr. Demirtas was arrested more than two years ago. He has been the subject of 29 investigations and faces up to 150 years in prison. The bulk of the accusation is based on speeches made in support of the peace process in Turkey, which the European Union has accompanied. Just yesterday, in Diyarbakir and Batman, about 50 people were arrested. Their crime: supporting the hunger strike of another Kurdish MP, Leyla Goven. That is why the detailed decision, which you have just mentioned, of the European Court of Human Rights, calling for Mr Demirtas's release as soon as possible on the grounds that his indefinite pre-trial detention undermined pluralism and the free play of democratic debates, has brought a wind of hope. He said that this was not a binding decision, flouting the law of the Council of Europe.

This, therefore, undermines pluralism and democracy itself. When state authorities abuse pre-trial imprisonment to silence opponents and limit freedom of political debate, we cannot remain silent. Nor should we remain silent waiting for another ECHR ruling concerning similar situations that exist today in the EU: for example, those of the Catalan political prisoners in pre-trial detention who are also MPs who cannot exercise their duties as elected politicians, and some of them were even prevented from participating in the electoral campaign.

The EU security environment is today more volatile, more unpredictable, more complex and more ambiguous than at any time since the end of the Cold War. We have often heard the High Representative telling us about this in this plenary. We all know that we are confronted with a number of interstate conflicts, also in our immediate neighbourhood, with terrorism, failed states, cyber attacks and hybrid warfare. The European Union has a growing responsibility to safeguard its own security, while, on the other hand, defending its interests and values in the world. The time indeed has come for the EU to take its destiny into its own hands and embrace its role as a fully-fledged sovereign, political and economic power in international relations. Colleagues, we all know that no single EU Member State can respond effectively to today’s global challenges on its own. We must continue to promote our European values while staying committed to multilateralism, a rule-based international order and economic cooperation.  I would like to highlight two very important aspects that should shape the EU’s foreign policy in the future. The first aspect is the so-called integrated approach to external conflicts and crisis as a framework for a more coherent and holistic engagement by the EU. The European Union is a major player when it comes to diplomacy, trade, development cooperation, humanitarian aid and – step-by-step – also in the field of security and defence. However, our Union should act strategically by using its wide array of policies and instruments to respond to the challenges in our direct neighbourhood and beyond. The second aspect concerns the effectiveness of the EU’s decision-making process in foreign policy. As a Union, I believe we should be able to reach positions by qualified majority voting in the Council; the need for unanimity keeps us from being able to act credibly on the global stage. Would this entail amendments to the Treaty? I believe not, because Article 31 already allows the European Council to determine which decisions may in the future be taken by a qualified majority.  Colleagues, as this is a joint debate on both reports, a short remark on the European Union’s Common Security and Defence Policy by my colleague Mr Paşcu. Soft power and institution- building alone cannot be sufficient to exert influence in a world where power politics is increasingly significant. The effectiveness of the EU’s foreign policy will depend on an adequate combination of soft and hard power tools. Looking to the left of the plenary, becoming a credible hard power does not mean militarising the European Union; we should rather become more autonomous and live up to our global responsibilities.  Yes, Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s Common Security and Defence Policy is on track. PESCO has been launched to strengthen our security and defence, with 25 Member States participating. Moreover, the European Commission has proposed an EUR 13 billion European Defence Fund for the years 2021 to 2027 to increase our strategic autonomy, to bolster our ability to protect our citizens and to make the EU a stronger global actor. With today’s debate and tomorrow’s vote on the EDF, this Parliament can send out a strong signal in support of the Fund.  Finally, I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs for their good and fruitful cooperation. It was, and is a pleasure, to witness that at least the larger political groups in this House act in concert towards a stronger Common Foreign and Security Policy of our Union.

The post—Second World War order is ending. We are confronted with systemic challenges in which multilateralism stands to be substituted by unilateralism, free trade by protectionism and solidarity by self-interest, and the problem is that the kind of global challenges we stand confronted with require global answers, which are difficult to get in an increasingly fragmented international system.  The report starts with an analysis of the strategic environment and underlines the importance of the transatlantic bond. I think you know that, here, it’s an appeal to everybody to try to preserve the functioning of the transatlantic bond, trying to separate the influences coming from the commercial area into the security area.  We also mention the recent activities and policies of Russia, which have reduced stability and changed the security environment. In all this picture, common security and defence policy is one of the useful tools for addressing many of these challenges. It would be used more efficiently and in coherence with other external and internal instruments. The security of EU Member States is deeply interconnected, and the need for cooperation – although recognised – requires more to be done in that the respect.  Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) is reflecting an increased investment in security and defence as a matter of urgency, as it is requested in the global strategy, and we are asking you now to look seriously for the 2% to be allotted from the GDP for defence. We welcome the creation of a dedicated heading for defence in the Commission’s Multiannual Financial Framework proposal and, in particular, the establishment of a budget line from which the European Defence Fund and military mobility projects should be funded. This will require also the development of a well—defined overarching strategic approach to European defence, and here we reiterate our call for an EU security and defence white book.  With respect to the capabilities of the Union, we underline – like our colleagues – that the EU needs to apply the entire toolbox of available policy instruments from soft to hard power and from short-term measures to long—term policies, developing the necessary civilian and military capabilities as outlined in the global strategy. We consider that the EU Member States must endeavour to improve military capabilities to cover the full spectrum of land, air, space, maritime and cyber capabilities, including strategic enablers to make the EU CSDP a credible force. In this respect, we recognise the strategic dimension of the space sector, and we encourage movement in that respect.  We consider that the capabilities of Union security and defence could be improved by making better use of the existing frameworks of defence and military cooperation, such as the European multinational High Readiness Corps’ headquarters and the EU Battlegroups, reinforcing but not duplicating similar initiatives with NATO, and we are asking for the transformation of national armed forces into forces that are more interoperable, more sustainable, more flexible and more deployable.  I would conclude by saying that we support the array of missions which are undertaken already and we also ask for a parliamentary oversight of an increasing attention paid to security and defence.

Let me start by thanking David McAllister and Ioan Mircea Paşcu for their excellent work. Looking at your reports, I see very clearly a shared understanding of our world and of our joint place in this world as Europeans. We all agree that no single European country can respond effectively to any of the challenges of our times and that we, the European Union, have a responsibility to embrace our role as a global power, working together for peace, security and human development worldwide, and in some cases even filling a gap. And yet, we also have an interest in doing so, because together we have unparalleled leverage in shaping global rules, peace processes or trade agreements.  Let me say this very clearly: I believe there is no contradiction at all between European interests and national interests, in particular in this field. The European Union is the most powerful instrument we have, as Europeans, to serve our national interests on the global scene. None of our Member States is big enough in the world of today to pursue their own national interests all alone, and this is why some in the world might cherish divisions among us. It might be in their interest, but never in ours. Likewise, there is no contradiction between our support for multilateralism and the work to advance our European and national interests. We know from experience that our national and collective interests are best served through multilateral institutions, and the European Union is in itself the most successful multilateral institution that was ever built. We need multilateral institutions to promote rights, to protect the environment and to govern globalisation. We need multilateral institutions to build peace and security worldwide. We couldn’t do this without them in our multipolar, disordered world. When we join forces, as Europeans, and take part in global negotiations, we are not giving up on our sovereignty. On the contrary, we are exerting our sovereignty more fully and more powerfully on the global stage.  This is why we have chosen the United Nations as our fundamental partner. We are the first economic contributor to the UN system, and we support Guterres’ work to reform the UN system and make it more effective. We are also exploring new ways of working together, for instance by ensuring full complementarity and compatibility between all our new projects on the ground. Our foreign policy is cooperative by definition. The McAllister report rightly points out that the transatlantic partnership remains indispensable for Europe, for America and for the rest of the world. In spite of substantial disagreements with the current administration on certain issues, we continue to work together on the great majority of issues, from Ukraine to Afghanistan, and from the Balkans to North Korea. In these years, we have also deepened our cooperation with other traditional partners – the African Union: our cooperation with them is now closer than ever – and the same can be said about a great number of partners, from our eastern partners to ASEAN, and from Canada to Japan or Central Asia.  I also very much agree with your idea to work on issues—based coalitions of likeminded countries and regional organisations, but also with other global powers. This idea has already driven our foreign policy in these years, successfully, I believe. Our work on climate change or the work to preserve the nuclear deal with Iran are both examples of our readiness to engage selectively and with ad hoc coalitions. I will not go through all the geographical priorities and the current conflicts, but let me just mention three points as a matter of priority: first, the Western Balkans. David, I couldn’t agree more with the report. Our common goal is to bring all the Balkans inside the European Union, and we have two urgent tasks ahead of us now: to continue to work tirelessly with our friends in Belgrade and Pristina so that they can reach a legally binding comprehensive agreement to fully normalise their relations, and finally to open accession negotiations with Tirana and Skopje. Let me mention two other priorities: Ukraine – we will have a specific debate on this later this evening so I will keep it for later. The third priority I would mention is the conflicts in the Mediterranean and, in particular, Syria, Yemen – the beginning of a dialogue on Yemen and with the Yemeni parties in Sweden is also part of the diplomatic work we have done to bring some of these parties to the table – but also Libya and the conflict in Israel and Palestine. I believe the European Union has had and continues to have a unique, even though difficult, role to play, but I am sure that we will continue to work together to support a sustainable political solution to each one of these crises. The McAllister report underlines that we Europeans have an unparalleled potential as a force for peace and security with a unique set of foreign policy tools. In these years, we have invested to strengthen and to multiply these tools. Our work on security and defence is not a separate chapter from this, but it has constantly been part of this broader engagement for peace, security and human development. I would like once again to be very clear on this, as you have been, David. Our work on security and defence is not a way to militarise our Union and will never be. For instance, it is not at all in contradiction with our work for non—proliferation and disarmament. On the contrary, as you all know, we are engaged on a daily basis against nuclear proliferation as well as to prevent new arms races here in Europe and all around the world. Our work on defence stays true to this approach. There is a unique European way to security and defence – a way that is very much needed in the world of today, that is very much appreciated, and for which I see a lot of demand. We have somehow the responsibility of exercising this special European way to peace and security. When we send a military mission abroad, it is to save lives, to protect peace or to help rebuild a country. When we invest in military capabilities, it is to defend our citizens from attacks or to put the best technologies to the service of peace. Yes, we are investing in Europe’s hard power – finally – and we would all prefer that we lived in a world where this was not necessary, but our work on defence is always – and will always be – at the service of peace. This is why it is so important to strengthen it at this time. It is also for this reason that I wanted a new compact on civilian missions to be an integral part of our work on a Europe of defence. I talked about this in this Chamber exactly one year ago, and last month the Council approved our Civilian CSDP compact. The civilian dimension of our international missions is already a source of European pride today, from Mali to Ukraine, from Iraq to Somalia. We now want to expand our civilian action even more, with new capacities and shorter reaction time. The Paşcu report calls for closer cooperation between our civilian and military initiatives. I totally agree with this, and it is one of the goals that we want to achieve with the civilian compact and with the reform of our command structures in Brussels. Our two command centres – civilian and military – will now work more closely together. On the military side, our command centre should also be ready by 2020 to run small—scale executive operations, so going beyond what it is doing now, which is commanding training and advisory missions. Last month, together with Member States, we also decided to double the number of cooperation projects in the framework of the Permanent Structured Cooperation on Defence (PESCO) from 17 to 34. The new projects cover many capabilities that we collectively need, from drones to a European School of Intelligence, from cybersecurity to aerospace. By investing together, we will invest our resources more efficiently and we will make it easier for national defence forces to work together. In the coming weeks, we will also finalise the general conditions for third states to be exceptionally invited to join PESCO projects. The Paşcu report also asks to move forward on military mobility and, as you know, work is going well on a project within the Permanent Structured Cooperation, as well as at the European Defence Agency, and in full coordination with NATO. Let me add that this is not an investment done at the expense of civilian projects but, on the contrary, a clear dual-use investment.  One of the main goals of all our work on security and defence is to help Member States spend their resources more effectively. It is not up to the European Union to define how much of the national budget is spent on defence, but we can help Member States invest more efficiently and better. We can have an impact on the output of the investments. That is to say that, with the same investment, we will be able to achieve more for our citizens’ security. This is also the objective of the Coordinated Annual Review of national defence budgets. We have concluded its trial run, and the review will become a standing activity as of next year. This will help coordinate defence planning among national governments to find new opportunities for cooperation and joint investments. Finally, in support of this work, we have proposed a very substantive defence package for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). We want to address the fragmentation that has hampered Europe’s defence sector for decades, again to make national defence investments more effective and efficient than they are today. I am particularly glad that the Paşcu report supports my proposal to establish a European Peace Facility. Our goal is to be more strategic in how we plan our missions and to work more closely with our partners to prevent new crises or to stabilise a country after a conflict. The facility would fully respect the legal parameters provided by the Treaty, and it would avoid duplications with its existing instruments, as called for in your report. We all acknowledge the fact that security today is much more complex than it ever was. It is military, but it is also civilian. It is about defence, but also about development, artificial intelligence, climate change, crisis management and also reconciliation. It is about our own capabilities, but it also requires us to work to strengthen our partners and their capabilities around the world.  I believe the two reports we are discussing today highlight this very well. There is no contradiction between investing in Europe’s strategic autonomy and cooperating even more closely with our partners. On the contrary, we Europeans are taking more responsibility for our own security and for the world around us, and we are doing this together – together with the United Nations, together with NATO, together with the African Union, and with all our partners around the word. Rather than discussing whether we have to choose between strategic autonomy or cooperation, I would say that we have chosen the path of cooperative autonomy and we’ve taken this path together, joining forces among the Council, the Commission, all our agencies and, of course, the European Parliament, which has accompanied this process from the very beginning. This is a legacy that you can share with the Council and the Commission as the mandate comes to an end. We still have a few months of common work ahead of us. They will be important months for many of the issues we have discussed, so my appeal to you is that we can still continue our fruitful cooperation and make the most of these few months ahead of us.

These are two great achievements from these years of work. Furthermore, we consider cooperation in the area of intelligence and, in particular, INCENT, also a very important step forward, and finally the creation of the single defence market which can also give some directives on arms export policy and which, on the other hand, can also be integrated with the civil protection mechanism and the border and coast guard.

Unfortunately, we are not there yet, although progress is in place, and I think we still have a number of hurdles ahead of us. There is an obstacle to believing that others will continue to take care of our security, particularly through NATO, which is an organization that probably has a lot of merit, but it is clear that the reliability of alliances is not fully guaranteed, and, in any event, it does not exhaust all the work that needs to be done in terms of crisis management in our environment. The second obstacle is also an excess of euphoria, if you can afford me. In particular, I find that the recent statements of some European leaders, including the French President, who are calling for a European army, do not help to make pragmatic progress towards, I was going to say, a common defence policy which already requires a great deal of effort, and we see that we are far from the point.

This also means that decisions need to be taken more quickly. That is why we are calling for a change to more qualified majority voting in the Council, particularly in the case of civil EU missions or in the field of human rights. Europe needs a stronger and more coordinated foreign policy. This is not a criticism of the High Representative, but rather a call on the Member States to continue working in this direction. One of the reasons is quite clear: the United States has repeatedly turned its back on the multilateral world order in recent months, for example by withdrawing from the Iran deal. This deal is in our European security interest. With all the interest in redeveloping and retaining common ground, we must see that the American President can also develop from a security guarantor for Europe to a security risk. There can only be one answer for us, namely a united Europe and effective multilateralism. Now it's not just about soft power. We also need to do more with hard power than we have done so far.

First of all I want stress the fact that it is exactly to strengthen the autonomy, but also a cooperative autonomy that the Union has on foreign and security and defence policy, that we have done together with the support of the European Parliament in this last couple of years a big work on the Europe of security and defence and on strengthening our global role – exactly in a moment when the word is looking towards the European Union, looking at us in search of leadership in many different fields. We feel the responsibility – I think rightly so – to respond to this demand in a positive manner. It is a demand from our citizens and it is a demand from our partners.  I would like only to underline three points. First, some of you mentioned the issue of human security, and this is a principle guiding our action. I fully agree, for our security is never purely a military concept. The European way to peace and security is a way that comes from our history. We know perfectly well that there is no threat, no challenge, no crisis, that can be addressed only through military means. Sometimes it is needed, and this is why we’re working on strengthening our defence work, but no threat can be addressed with military means alone. This is why we are strengthening our civilian and military cooperation in a way that has never been done before. The second point I would like to underline: it is not by coincidence that a strengthening, as never before, of the European Union work on security and defence has gone hand—in—hand in these last years with a strengthening of EU—NATO cooperation. It is exactly because we believe that strategic autonomy doesn’t mean going it alone, but means strengthening cooperation with our partners – starting from NATO, but also with the United Nations and other regional organisations that for us are key partners and allies. The third point I would like to underline that came up in the debate on the Europe of security and defence: now, in these remaining few months of work this Parliament has in front of it, I think we have some relevant work to do. First of all, consolidating the work that has been done so far on security and defence. And secondly, ensuring that there are adequate financial resources and instruments to sustain the work that has been envisaged so far.  Finally, let me thank the two rapporteurs, Mr McAllister and Mr Paşcu, and I sincerely thank the European Parliament for the support and the impulse it has given to our work in this field of foreign, security and defence policy.

I would like to make one remark. This is also about what the High Representative had to say at the end of the debate. This is the last Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) report in this term. However, a lot of work lies ahead of us, in particular the ongoing negotiations of the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), and I believe that with this next MFF, adequate financial resources should be made available for our Union’s external action, because this is a direct investment in the security of our continent. In these upcoming negotiations, we don’t only have to ensure adequate financing, but also the coherence, the effectiveness, the responsiveness and the flexibility of our external financing instruments and, most importantly, we shouldn’t get tired of stressing the need to adequately involve our Parliament in the scrutiny and in the strategic steering of these instruments.

However, the celebration has been more thought-provoking than I would have wished for, and this is reflected in the conclusions of this report on human rights and democracy in the world in 2017. It is only to be regretted that recent years, including 2017, have been marked by a dramatic increase in human rights violations, democracy crises and conflicts all over the world, affecting the most vulnerable of our societies. The persecution of Rohingyas in Myanmar, the crackdown of opposition in Cambodia, Venezuela or Nicaragua, the rule of law disarray in Congo, war crimes in Syria and Yemen, drastically shrinking civil society space in our direct neighbourhood, Russia – these are numerous other examples which stand before my eyes as a painful reminder of the negligence of human rights principles.  In parallel, we have also seen the growing number of populist and nationalist forces, even among the EU Member States who resort to means such as using disinformation and restricting clauses to consolidate their power.  These are all the worrying trends which have been taken into account and documented in the report and its country annexes. The aim of this document is to provide a critical analysis of the EU’s actions and provide answers to the questions on what more can be done from the EU side, and how we can advance our human rights action response to make it more effective, pre-emptive and focused. Therefore, despite being concerned, I am also optimistic, because during the preparatory work of this report we have found a strong agreement throughout the entire political spectrum in this House on our main priorities in the human rights field.  There was a firm understanding and agreement that the EU is, and shall remain, the leader in the human rights fight in the world and the UN system. I believe that the EU’s global role in leadership also implies coordination and guidance in fighting a common position among western community counterparts, which would place human rights at the heart of its foreign policy. By this, I also refer to the rather disappointing stance by our current US leadership in this regard.  For the EU to be more effective, it is crucial that the human rights clauses are mainstreamed to all our external policies and agreements, including trade policy. Deepening political and economic ties with EU partner countries is our fundamental objective, but for this goal to be achieved we should aim to make better use of the human rights conditionality. I am convinced that in such cases when partner countries persistently fail to observe the principles of democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, there is a point in time when we have to face certain sanctions from the EU side. On the other hand, those who respect their commitments to these principles should receive adequate privileges for being EU partners. I strongly call on the EU Member States to uphold this commitment in their bilateral agreements, too.  As far as other priorities are concerned, with this report we emphasise the importance of strengthening support to human rights defenders in our neighbourhood and third countries. Our support to their tireless and courageous endeavours is the only way to go forward.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 319, "date": "2018-12-11.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, just a couple of weeks ago we celebrated together the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights at the European Parliament in the Hemicycle in Brussels and we decided to celebrate it with human rights defenders and civil society organisations who are working every single day to turn the principles of the Declaration into action. We know that too many people around the world do not enjoy all the rights that are recognised by the Universal Declaration – this is still work in progress.  The report that we discussed today describes a global pushback against democracy, human rights and the rule of law. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Petras, for this work, which is excellent. I'm glad to see that, once again, the report by the European Parliament resonates with the one adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council last spring. We agreed that we face new challenges in our work to protect and advance human rights and, against new challenges, you are right to discuss new ways and new instruments to make our action even more effective. The European Union – you said it well – is, and will continue to be, the leading global actor in the promotion and protection of human rights and democracy. Already today the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights is the largest financial instrument in the world with this focus. With these resources we address violations, we provide a lifeline to human rights defenders, we empower those were at the margins of societies. Every day we try to take a little step further to turn the Universal Declaration into reality because we know that a little step further makes a lot of difference for the people involved.  Let me give you a concrete example. In your report you highlight the need to combat violence against women. Just a couple of weeks ago I had the pleasure of meeting again and welcoming to Brussels the Nobel Peace Prize laureates Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad. I had already met both of them here in Strasbourg where you awarded them the Sakharov Prize, so let me say that this is yet another demonstration that the Sakharov Prize is truly shaping the global conversation about human rights. This year's prize to Oleg Sentsov is also important to keep a strong focus on the illegal annexation of Crimea and its consequences. We had worked with Denis and Nadia since they received the Sakharov Prize. Last month I invited them to join our meeting of the Development Ministers of the European Union. Together, we decided to invest EUR 1 million in Nadia’s initiative for stabilisation and reconstruction in some areas of Iraq and another EUR 4 million to support Denis’ hospital for victims of sexual violence. It is a small gesture to support two powerful symbols of the fight for women's rights and, on top of this, let me remind everyone about our broader commitment. With the spotlight initiative we have launched the largest-ever programme to stop violence against women in the world, with EUR 500 million invested. But working on human rights is not just a matter of financial resources. Human rights are an essential component of all our policies, as you said: from trade policies to our engagement on security and defence, from our human rights dialogues including with difficult countries, to the work we do at the United Nations and with other regional organisations. Electoral observation is also a vital part of this work with the crucial engagement of this Parliament, because we all know that democracy is never achieved once and for all and it has to be invested into constantly through every election as well as in the time between the elections. I am particularly glad that the report acknowledges the excellent work done over the years by our Special Representative for Human Rights, Stavros Lambrinidis, sitting next to me now. His mandate will soon come to an end a few months from now. So let me thank him once again for his relentless engagement with governments and civil society organisations all around the world, as well as his role in shaping the good human rights stories initiative.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 320, "date": "2018-12-11.json", "name": "Cristian Dan Preda", "mepid": "96838", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group.

But whether inside or outside Europe, we will continue to advocate for strengthening and supporting the promotion of human rights in a wide range of areas: freedom of expression, religious freedom, the rights of minorities and migrants, the fight against torture, forced disappearances, the death penalty, children's rights, gender equality and also a reference to the LGBTI community. We support NGOs and human rights and environmental defenders, but we need to be more assertive in bilateral dialogues, strengthening the training of those working in these organisations so that they can help in some way in the transition to democratic regimes. The role of this Union has been fundamental in promoting human rights. However, I think we can go further. It is necessary to insist on monitoring and evaluating the actions taken by the European Union with third countries, in particular through its delegations. I am particularly concerned about freedom of expression in the world and, citing Reporters Without Borders, \"There is an increase in the number of countries with violations and abuses against the free press, even on European territory.

One is that, as some of you have mentioned – and some of you have mentioned specific human rights violations or specific work we are doing on human rights in the context of wars, crises and difficult situations around the world – the human rights component is, I would say, embedded and is at the core of every single action we take, every single policy we establish and every single piece of work we do daily in our services all around the world. From Myanmar to Yemen, from Afghanistan to Syria, Libya to Venezuela, to the Balkans, the human rights, the promotion of human rights, the protection of human rights defenders lies at the core of our foreign policy in every single step we take.  The second point I would like to underline – and this was not really underlined during the debate but still I believe this is very important – is that our credibility in our work on human rights in the world lies in our capacity to lead by example. The credibility of the European Union as a global human rights defender and promoter lies in the standards we manage to keep inside our own Member States and inside our own countries. For sure the Commission can always do more, but I think that every single government in the European Union has a responsibility and a duty to raise the bar and raise the standard of our implementation of human rights standards, because it’s not a mission accomplished and it’s not work finished. On the contrary, there are backlashes, also inside our European Union, when it comes to standards of human rights and we should not turn a blind eye to this. This is also damaging our capacity to have an impact with our partners around the world.  Last but not least, let me thank the rapporteur for the excellent work done and for the excellent cooperation we have had over this time. Let me also thank Stavros again, as many of you have mentioned – and this is no surprise, coming from this Parliament – but let me also sincerely thank the European Parliament, as an institution, for the constant work and the constant credibility that has helped keep on our work on human rights.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which Ukraine is making great progress in implementing the reforms agreed in the Association Agreement. We commend this. Since the agreement was signed in 2014, Ukraine has implemented more pro-European reforms than in any previous years since independence. The Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement, part of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, which entered into force on 1 January 2016, provides a solid basis for Ukraine's economic development and modernisation. I am therefore pleased to say that the Ukrainian economy has not only been stabilised over the past four years, but is also showing signs of recovery. Twelve percent of citizens have to save to afford food, 33 percent have to save or borrow money for clothes or shoes, and 45 percent – almost half the population – have existential concerns. These citizens rightly expect the country's new course to be reflected in an improvement in their living conditions. Despite all the progress, we are still particularly concerned about corruption. The feeling of impotence towards the rich and the brazen, especially the oligarchs, is widespread. They seem to be able to take everything out of themselves and still go unpunished. The fight against corruption must be much more decisive. In order to do this, we must also take competition and antitrust law into our own hands. Our European experience shows that where small and medium-sized enterprises, where freelancers can develop their economic activity unhindered, people are better off. We condemn Russia's destabilisation of Ukraine. We call for the release of the arrested Ukrainian sailors. We are calling for targeted sanctions if they are not released. We are soon celebrating Christmas and New Year, and we are asking Mr Putin to release the sailors so that they can experience this again at home with their families! I want to say two things to the Ukrainians. Firstly, we will always support Ukraine as a free European country. Secondly, the best way to combat the destabilisation that Russia has undertaken is to continue the European course courageously. I would like to say to our citizens and to the Putin friends and defenders in this House: the future of the European Union is also decided in Ukraine. If Russia, with its increasing activities against Ukraine, succeeds in destabilizing the country, or even reclaiming it, it would have serious implications for Europe's security, for the radiance of the Western model of values, and for the effectiveness of the European Union as a shaping power. Aggression and annexation must not determine the future of Ukraine and must not be the last word of history. That is why Ukraine is not just any neighbour and the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement is not some kind of agreement. That is why we are working for the joint success of Ukraine and the European Union. I think that by awarding the Sakharov Prize to Oleh Senzow, we are also giving the right signal at the right time, tomorrow. We appreciate his peaceful commitment to the rights of Ukrainians in Crimea. Like him, we call for the release of all Ukrainian political prisoners from Russian prisons, and we naturally call for the release of Oleh Senzov. Russia must refrain from any further provocation and escalation in the region. International trade shipping to the Sea of Azov must be able to pass through Russian controls without hindrance, as provided for by international law.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 342, "date": "2018-12-11.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, we are here to discuss our Association Agreement with Ukraine and I will come to this in a moment, but I want to start with a mention of two other issues that the rapporteur also referred to. First of all, I would like to mention once again the awarding of the Sakharov prize to Oleg Sentsov, and let me join this House in calling for his liberation, as we have been doing consistently throughout these years.  I would also like to update you on our recent discussions about the situation in the Sea of Azov. Yesterday, Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin was our guest at the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels. We discussed together ways to increase support to the regions of south-east Ukraine, and today the Commission has made available the first EUR 500 million of the new macro-financial assistance programme to Ukraine. I think these are clear gestures that show the Ukrainian people in reality the solidarity of the European Union and the consistency of our policy. We are now looking into further projects to support Ukrainian regions affected by the situation in the Azov Sea, in close coordination with our Member States, and also with the European financial institutions.  Last week in Milan, at the Ministerial Council of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) I had meetings with both Pavlo Klimkin and the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov. I took the opportunity to stress very clearly that we do not recognise the illegal annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and that the current tensions are a direct consequence of Russia’s violation of the OSCE founding principles of international law.  We expect Russia immediately to release the vessels and their crew. International law obliges the Russian Federation to ensure the unhindered and free passage of all vessels through the Kerch Strait. Russia’s behaviour violates international law and is causing economic damage not just to Ukraine but also to ships sailing under EU flags. We have already discussed this issue here in this Chamber in October. I remember that well, and your report, Mr Gahler, is also vocal on this, and rightly so. Now let me focus on the main subject of our discussion, the report on Ukraine’s implementation of the Association Agreement. Five years have passed since 2014 and we share the report’s assessments that in these five years and despite very difficult circumstances, Ukraine has passed four important reforms to deliver on its citizens’ aspirations. I will have an opportunity to discuss progress directly with Prime Minister Groysman and his Government at the Association Council next Monday in Brussels. I would like to thank the EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Association Committee for its work on monitoring the implementation of the Association Agreement. Over the past year, many of the reforms demanded by the Ukrainian people have started to take shape. New laws have been adopted on decentralisation, intellectual property rights, the environment, food safety and energy, as well as a new company law. A number of important reforms have been launched on pensions, healthcare and education. Public administration and decentralisation reforms are being implemented and there has been progress with reform in the areas of the judiciary and of anti-corruption measures, albeit at a slower pace.  A landmark bill on national security was adopted in June – and I have discussed this several times with both the President and the Prime Minister in Kiev – introducing the principle of parliamentary oversight over the security sector. Now it needs to be followed up with secondary legislation, including on reform of the security sector. But the report also makes clear that many challenges remain, and that was, I believe, a clear shared understanding among all of us. The fight against corruption is probably the most urgent issue. I share your views. We are looking forward to the High Anti-corruption Court becoming operational. All anti-corruption institutions must be fully independent and free from political pressures, and this is also true for prosecutors. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine is carrying on a very delicate task and it is essential that high-level corruption cases are prosecuted, including those relating to the large-scale banking fraud unveiled in 2014.  We’ve also made clear that electronic declarations should be a tool to fight corruption, and not an obstacle for civil society organisations that are working to make Ukraine a better place. So we’ve asked for the repeal of the requirement that anti-corruption activists and foreign members of supervisory boards of state-owned enterprises make e-declarations of assets. Ukraine is making progress in strengthening democratic institutions and human rights. However, we are worried about the attacks against civil society activists and journalists, which are becoming more and more frequent. One such case was the acid attack against Kateryna Handzyuk, who passed away last month, and we expect these incidents not only to be investigated swiftly but also, and most importantly, to be prevented in the future. One of Ukraine’s main assets is the strength of its civil society. I’ve seen this first-hand many times in Kiev. We will continue to work on the side of all those who have decided to engage personally for Ukraine’s common good. We also encouraged Ukraine to make the best use of international consultation mechanisms when preparing important legislative acts, for example those affecting the rights of persons belonging to national minorities. It is important always to take into account the recommendations of specialised international bodies such as the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights at the OSCE and the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe. We, the European Union, will continue to be on Ukraine’s side, to end the conflict in the east, to end the illegal annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and also to deliver on the aspirations of all Ukrainian citizens. The Association Agreement is the most ambitious agreement that the European Union has ever developed with any partner country, and since 2014 the European Union has invested in Ukraine more than in any other country in the world. We have put together the biggest support package in our history. So we want Ukraine to succeed. We’re working to make sure that Ukraine succeeds, making its own choices but with our support, in spite of all the difficulties and obstacles along the way.

We know the areas that require more effort – these are the fight against corruption, establishing an independent judiciary. But we have to remember that Ukraine is implementing the Association Agreement under extremely difficult circumstances – the country is experiencing war, part of its territory is occupied, recently we have had another act of aggression by the Russian Federation in the Sea of Azov, and, finally, the country is also the target of an intensified propaganda war from the Russian Federation.  So for that reason I think, and having in mind the fact that next year is the election year, that we have to intensify our efforts here in Parliament and also in the Council and the Commission in order to provide all the necessary assistance to the pro-European government of Ukraine and, in the first place, to pro-European citizens of Ukraine.

The latest crisis in the Sea of Azov only confirms that security opportunities in the east of the continent are highly unstable. It will remain so because the foundations of international law are continuously violated. By attacking Ukrainian ships in international waters south of Kerch, Moscow has unequivocally violated international law. In 2003, the two countries established the free passage of their ships through the Kerch Strait by a treaty in 2003. The Sea of Azov, of course, has not become an annexation of Crimea by Russia's inner sea. The increase in military exercises in the Black Sea region is also worrying, and the number of incidents between Western allies and the Russian military is also growing. The European Union, as the most convincing and successful peace project in European and world history, must remain a mediator of peace and a promoter of cooperation.

I am convinced about this; namely, this makes me believe that the remaining internal challenges such as deoligarchisation, the fight against corruption and judicial reform will yield the results that we all expect.

I thank you, even though we see the conclusion and the assessment of the implementation of the agreement differently for the bilateral relationship to be put on a new footing. With the upcoming presidential elections and the ongoing fragile security and dangerous conflict situation in the east of the country, it remains to be seen that the many unresolved domestic and foreign policy problems – despite many reforms – the growing gap between rich and poor require fundamental course corrections by the Ukrainian government. They require overcoming the oligarchic system as a prerequisite for economic advancement. They require a political willingness to implement the Minsk Protocol and to clarify it. It is precisely this, as well as the cessation of all those actions that only further inflame tensions in bilateral relations, that applies to the Russian leadership, also in view of the events in the Sea of Azov. It is a prerequisite for an independent, active, active political-diplomatic international monitoring of the much-needed exit from the spiral of confrontation and violence in relation to the Russian Federation.

I would like to add very explicitly that I believe that in Ukraine, the direct influence of politics by a few oligarchs as a major problem is still a major problem for us not to make progress in some areas. However, I would also like to say, after Mr Scholz, that a friend wrote to me a few days ago, after critical debates on the imposition of martial law, that if Putin withdraws his troops from Ukraine, the war is over. If Ukraine no longer defends itself, then Ukraine, as it is organised today, will certainly not exist for long. We recognise this by trying to contribute to political solutions. Following the escalation in the Sea of Azov, I would like to propose once again that the OSCE observation mandate must be extended to the Sea of Azov as a matter of urgency, that if the Kerch Strait and the shipping lanes are not cleared for Ukrainian shipping, we should close European ports to Russian ships.

One, we all stand by Ukraine and we support its sovereignty and its territorial integrity. Two, Ukraine’s citizens must enjoy freedom and be respected. And three, the freedom of the press must be respected. If there’s anyone who doesn’t support these values, they had no business supporting the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement in the first place. But the words of that agreement must match reality: rhetoric is not government. I have every sympathy with Ukraine when it comes to Crimea, when it comes to Russian aggression and interference. But as surely as you can’t fight fire with fire, it is wrong to fight repression with repression. We’ve seen activists and journalists alike being violently attacked by radicals, with little if any reaction or protection from the Ukrainian Government. Yet no one in this Chamber would question that freedom of the press is one of our most cherished values. The Ukrainian Government is in the process of banning the two biggest TV channels in the country, Channel 112 and NewsOne, and proper democratic procedures are being ignored four months before an election. How can this be: that the President of Ukraine can potentially closed down independent media just before an election? This report rightly criticises the erosion of the freedom of the press in Ukraine, and it is time for the Ukrainian Government to take action, rather than pay mere lip service to it. Support for freedom and democracy should be universal, whether back home in the UK, here in the EU or in Ukraine, or anywhere else in the world.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must confess that it is very difficult to talk at the moment with the news that is coming a few kilometres this way. We have already experienced in this parliamentary term a tragic event such as what is happening at the moment, in Brussels, and it is really difficult. I will try to make a few very simple comments, because I do not think there is any point in letting go – although we are at the end of a long journey, which has lasted a year – I do not think it is appropriate to allow ourselves to be made redundant. I just want to inform the Commission here, the Austrian Minister and Presidency and this Parliament of the conclusions of the work on the 2019 budget. These were particularly difficult and complicated work, in which there were also times of great tension and which unfortunately we could not finish in the time we had given ourselves in the first conciliation. There have been some divisions, even strong ones, we must tell the truth, not with the Austrian Presidency, which I thank for the work it has done, but with the Council, some divisions have been particularly strong and difficult to heal. However, I would like to thank the Austrian Presidency for the work it has done and Mr Loger, in particular, for the enormous personal effort it has put into recent months, as well as the Commission for the work it has done and for the continuous and successful attempt to help the Council and Parliament find the best possible solution. I would simply point out that I believe that the budget that we are going to vote on tomorrow and that we are going to present to the citizens of Europe can be a source of pride for this Parliament, because it recovers the priorities that Parliament set itself in March of this year and then in July, it fully recovers all the answers and priorities that we had identified, both on research and on young people. , the environment, the fight against climate change, migration and a correct migration phase. These are very important figures, which bring us close to a recovery of eur 1 billion for next year. However, I cannot fail to recall, and I repeat, by closing my speech, the difficulties that have been encountered with the Council. These are difficulties, I repeat, not due to the management of the Presidency, as regards a mechanism inherent in the Council itself, which prevents the presidency-in-office from having relations with this Parliament on budgetary matters, open, proactive relations and truly capable of investing in the future for Europe. We need a Council that is able to free itself from the constraints that enclose it and from the too many vetoes that are in there. This Parliament has been ready – including on the innovations that have been introduced by the Commission and which have been accepted in recent months by Parliament and by the Council itself – this Parliament has been ready and will be ready in the coming months to apply all the innovations that the Financial Regulation gives us in our hands. Unfortunately, this time it has not been possible, and I consider it not a defeat for Parliament, I consider it a defeat especially for the Council, which did not have the courage to activate the instruments that it had itself adopted. I repeat that this is by no means the time to rejoice, but next year certainly the citizens of Europe, our institutions, our municipalities, our research bodies, young people, businesses and small and medium-sized enterprises, those that innovate, will certainly have much more resources at their disposal.

Mr President, I would like to thank the I would like to express my sincere thanks to President Sassoli, who played a major role in the Bureau of the European Parliament in ensuring that we have a thrifty but efficient budget: the lowest sum for 15 years, as is the case with the overall budget of the European Union. Fifteen years ago we still had 1.2% of the GNP, and now we have 0.9%. So, as you can see, it is being used sparingly at European level.  However, new priorities are also being set, and I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Finance Minister and President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Löger, because he has, of course, also tried, together with the European Parliament, to set the priorities for the future. The future is simply research, Erasmus+, small and medium-sized enterprises, border security. That has been a good thing. I would also like to thank Mr Viotti, because it is simply important that we think about the future, about young people, and that action is taken accordingly.  We have made savings in the area of pre-accession aid for Turkey. We have also made savings in other areas, and it is precisely the investment in buildings, which has been scaled back accordingly, that shows that taxpayers' money is really being handled carefully in the negotiations.  In terms of priorities, we have been able to increase strategic communication by 1.2 million at the European External Action Service– the European External Action Service. A small but effective amount. We have allocated a total of 943 million to the European Parliament's priorities. It has also been quite successful that this EUR 1 billion, which the Council has used from the budget to support the refugees in Turkey, has been approved by Parliament, and it is a very efficient way of providing the refugees on the ground as well as possible, so that they can return home as soon as possible.  So: 1 billion on the one hand, 1 billion on the other – I think it was a good deal. It is a deal for the citizens of Europe, because in the end this money will go back to 94% for the citizens, in order to show internationally that Europe is able to come to an agreement. Especially in the time of Brexit, it is important to show agreement accordingly.  In the case of payments, the total amount has been EUR 148 billion, which is roughly twice the Austrian budget or about half of the German budget. That is a relatively small amount. While at national level 30 to 50% of the GNP is spent accordingly, the European Union has remained well below 1%, which was the target.  In recent years, we have shown that the reduction of 1% per year has also brought a total of 5% savings. We have shown that funds can be reallocated and that the reserves are used accordingly.  It is a good basis for the multiannual financial framework that we start here from the right base.

During our various meetings in the course of this year in trilogue or conciliation format, as well as during many informal contacts, it became clear that Parliament and the Council share the same two main priorities for the financial year 2019: to tackle challenges related to migration and security and to boost innovation, growth and employment in Europe. In the Union budget for 2019, we have been able to translate these priorities into concrete figures.  After the successful outcome reached by the trilogue on 4 December 2018, the General Affairs Council today has formally approved the joint text. The Council expects Parliament to approve the agreement tomorrow in order to adopt the general budget for the financial year.

Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. The Commission is grateful that, after difficult discussions, an agreement has been reached on the European Union budget for 2019 on 4 December. It has not been easy, but I believe that, through the intensive cooperation of your colleague, Minister Löger, the rapporteur and Jean Arthuis, the chairman, we have all agreed with a sufficient willingness to compromise and yet we have achieved our essential objectives for next year's fiscal policy. I believe that Parliament can be satisfied with this budget. Allow me to highlight only a few priorities for next year. We have earmarked EUR 80.5 billion for growth and employment, of which more than EUR 57 billion from the European Structural and Investment Funds alone. Research, and therefore competitiveness, has been a priority and a major interest of Parliament. Next year, we are significantly increasing Horizon 2020 compared to this year, by almost ten percent to 12.3 billion euros. Ten percent more research next year, that's a word. Young people who should have more opportunities to develop their educational and professional qualifications and who should get to know Europe. The Erasmus+ programme, also a priority for Parliament, supported by the Council and the Commission, will be increased by a whopping 19.5% compared to 2018 to a maximum of EUR 2.8 billion. In addition, the Commission has promised to propose an increase of a further EUR 100 million to the two budgetary authorities by amendment in the spring of next year. We are continuing the Youth Employment Initiative with an amount that will remain very significant next year, so that it can successfully enable new jobs and the placement of young people in jobs, particularly in the south of Europe. In the field of migration and security, next year's budget provides sufficient resources to pursue effective migration, refugee and security policies and to provide effective financial support for the implementation of measures already under way, such as AMIF and related agencies such as Europol, Eurojust and EASO. In the area of climate protection, we are increasing the LIFE programme in order to make a contribution so that the 20% target as a mainstream is achievable in the budget by the end of 2020. The Facility for Refugees is secured. The second tranche will be financed with three billion – a hard point of contention. I am grateful that this will enable Europe's credibility and commitment to refugees who are currently living in Turkey and to whom we are funding human dignity. At the same time, we have significantly increased funding for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Refugees from Palestine in the Middle East. The fact that we have once again cut pre-accession aid to Turkey has to do with the regression in turkey's rule of law, democracy, human rights and the media. I am glad that Parliament is being made possible by all the pilot projects it has proposed, thereby providing funding for all the pilot projects in the 2019 budget. Complementary resources for the External Action Service and the Court of Justice are added as further examples of a sensible budgetary decision. I believe that, despite the approaching election day in May, despite considerable differences in the starting position of the Council and Parliament, you have all demonstrated that we have all shown our willingness to act for Europe. A good budget that has been agreed upon!

And that is why I would like to begin by thanking Mr Viotti for his excellent work on the entire negotiating team in the European Parliament, but also Commissioner Oettinger and Minister Luger, and I would particularly like to congratulate Mr Viotti on his leadership of budgetary negotiations which were obviously complicated. Once again we have been on the brink of the budgetary crisis, on the verge of non-agreement, because the Council did not know or did not want to enter into serious negotiations. And so Europe is not built, because we are talking about a budget that accounts for only 1% of GDP. We are talking about derisory increases from a budgetary point of view but they are very important to citizens. For example, we have achieved 240 million euros more for Erasmus, which will allow around 65,000 more students to live that experience; or an additional 150 million euros for research programs, which are key to our future; or EUR 116 million more for the Youth Guarantee, which will allow young people to continue training or access their first job; or 160 million euros more that will give opportunities and hopes to our neighbors. And this is what the European Parliament has achieved. And this is what the Council initially denied us. And the truth is, it's been pretty sad to see some European leaders blocking this budget, after making bombastic speeches that were obviously full of cheap Europeanism. Because speed is shown by walking, and that is what the budget is about, of translating the european Union's raison d'etre into concrete things and of making unimaginable projects a reality.

You can pour a bit of water into the wine, that comes out every year. In this respect, we really have to ask ourselves: is this procedure that we are carrying out here in the EU for the preparation of the budget really effective? I mean No. I am thinking no because Members of this House should finally realise that we are not talking here about money that grows on trees or that is thrown off by helicopter; that is taxpayers' money. This is money, it comes from the Member States of the EU, and it has to be generated first.  It bothers me incredibly if some speakers here pretend that the Member States are the brakes and that the EU is the great organisation here, which would simply have to open the casket, and then we could immediately eliminate unemployment and promote SMEs on an unprecedented scale. I think that is a completely wrong message; does not send out the correct signals. The EU can do many things much better than individual Member States, for example fighting the migration crisis. In order to do this, however, we must also make it clear what our political objectives are. Before we spend money, we must first make it clear what is to be achieved. The same applies to Connecting Europe and many other programmes that we have that are justified. But we need to do it more efficiently. As long as we don't do that, we're on the wrong track here.

Mr President, Madam Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, in turn, would like to express our satisfaction. Here we are at the end of a long negotiation. It is true that we tried, on the occasion of the budgetary conciliation, to find a compromise, but on the evening of 19 November we had to find that we could not succeed, and at that time Commissioner Oettinger handed the book back on the job, offered us a new possibility of compromise, we met on 4 December , and the trilogue was successful.  Let me thank President Hartwig Leger for his availability at each of our meetings, and to thank Commissioner Oettinger and his team in particular, who have put on the table, with determination, elements of compromise that have enabled us to move forward. I would also like to greet and congratulate my colleagues, our rapporteur-general, Mr Viotti, our rapporteur from the other sections, Paul R-big, also Jens Geier, for the agencies, and thank all the members of the Committee on Budgets. We have done a good job, and I would like to say to Mr Kulmel that we have been constantly concerned with checking the added value of the appropriations committed to this European Union budget. We wanted to put this budget at the service of Europeans, at the service of young people, at the service of innovation, growth, employment, security, defence, but we also wanted to give ourselves the means to better control migration flows and to welcome the many migrants and refugees in humane conditions. What I found particularly positive was the answers we gave on two main priorities. I am thinking first of all about research: we have been able to register an additional 150 million in the final process and, as you have pointed out, Commissioner, Horizon 2020 is progressing compared to 2018 by almost 11%. This is how the future of Europe is prepared. With regard to Erasmus, which is so dear to us, we were able to register an additional 240 million compared to what the Commission had originally planned and endorsed by the Council. We have achieved an excellent result and I would once again like to thank all those who made this happen. I would only have two grievances, which I will recall very briefly. The first is that by putting $1 billion on the table to finance the facility for Syrian refugees in Turkey, we have put Parliament to the test. The budgetary authority is made up of two branches and everything is negotiable. However, by making it very clear that there was no negotiation possible, it was a sort of altering the authority of Parliament. The second point that we have taken with hold is the application, finally, of Article 15, paragraph 3, of the new financial regulation. It has been in force since 1 August and I pay tribute to the Commission which had the intelligence to put it on the table. This article allows for the deferring of unused credits in the research field alone. We have not been able to come to fruition this year. I have no doubt that we will get there in the next few years, that the Council will have become familiar with these provisions. I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that this is the last budget of the mandate. Of the five budgets we have negotiated with the Council, I believe that it is the one that most directly meets Parliament's expectations.

There are only two certainties in life – death and taxes, and it doesn’t seem entirely certain who that quote should be attributed to but what is certain is that it is out of date. So here’s my quote: the three certainties in life are death, taxes and that the European Union budget and power will continue increasing. That’s the principle of ever closer union in the Treaties and the principle that I think hastened the UK’s decision to leave.  Every year we show genuine savings that can be made to the EU budget but every year they aren’t. This year’s increase will be different because the UK will only be an EU Member State for 89 of those 365 days. So this budget is reliant on one thing – that the UK will leave the European Union with a deal and that the UK will be paying the so-called divorce bill, because the Attorney General’s advice is that the UK legal obligations are something in the region of EUR 8 billion compared with the divorce bill agreement of EUR 39 billion. That would, if there were no deal, leave the EU short part way through the year.  So the question becomes, will we have a deal? Well that is very much questionable at the moment because Theresa May is seeking assurances from EU leaders on a deal that she knows does not have the confidence of the British Parliament. Indeed, there are questions as to whether there will be a motion of no confidence, either from parliament or from her own backbenchers by the end of the week.  Well, I would certainly, for one, love to have a good, decent, honest, free trade deal between the UK and the European Union with reasonable cooperation between us both, but that sadly, at the moment, doesn’t seem to be on the table. Ms May’s deal is what is on the table, and there are many people who would prefer no deal to May’s deal.  The European Union budget, as well as the UK, needs to be prepared.

Mr President, Commissioner Oettinger warns that if the new 2019 budget is not adopted now, several EU flagships cannot be implemented. That is because the amounts of the 2018 budget are lower than the proposed 2019 budget. Oettinger's nightmare scenario seems to me to be a good plan. Every tenth of a percent less budget saves taxpayers hundreds of millions of euros.  The word austerity and the expression the word 'denering' do not appear in the dictionary of the Europhiles. That's why I'm proposing the next cut. The withdrawal of 400 000 Erasmus+ grants for schools, professors and students will prevent further EU indoctrination, saving €3 billion a year. The 100 000 volunteers selected for the European Solidarity Corps will pay for their working holidays themselves, and we will be left with over EUR 300 million a year. Less funding for the European Solidarity Fund and the European Globalisation Fund means that countries themselves are solving their problems instead of holding their hands up. No more billions of euros to the Facility for Refugees in Turkey. According to the Court of Auditors, this unnecessary aid did not lead to the desired outcomes in half of the cases.

The negotiation did not go well in the first phase, but then insisted on a point which is the possibility of using funds that were affected and were not used with regard to research and innovation. This agreement is very positive and I would say that it is very positive despite the Council. We are talking about a small budget, a budget where in payments we have 0.9% of gross national income, but which has an important, enormous added value: a budget mainly dedicated to investment, where only 6% are for administrative expenditure.  Our priorities for research and innovation, for small and medium-sized enterprises, the priority of youth, Erasmus, are placed here.  But there's a question I couldn't get an answer to. Why did the Council not want to use the funds that were not used in previous years in Horizon 2020 with regard to research and innovation? Why does the Council proclaim research as a priority and then does not accept the possibility, does not realise that priority, does not act accordingly?

This is a budget that looks to address the reality of migration rather than seeking to exploit migration by stoking fear in the cynical pursuit of votes, and while I am always pleased to see investment in the Horizon research programme that opens up new opportunities and extends human frontiers, it is a little disappointing, as Mr Fernandes said, that we were unable to persuade the Council to roll over de-committed funds from 2018 to 2019.

I know how difficult it is to agree on a budget because we want to do good, we want to finance the priorities, we have limited resources, we want to fulfil the expectations of the people. Therefore, one very important element in order also to avoid difficult situations like this in the years to come, is to agree on what the European Union should deliver in the upcoming years, and the next negotiations for the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2021—2027 should provide a good opportunity for this. We should firstly agree on what we expect the European Union should deliver and then equip it with the right tools in order to avoid situations like this, where Parliament on the one side, and the Council on the other side, are trying to either reduce or increase the amount for certain areas. The second thing I would like to see is research and innovation. This is essential if we want to stay competitive in the global area. I would just like to draw your attention to the much lower success rate in this MFF with regards to Horizon 2020 projects compared to the past MFF, which means that we can finance fewer projects than in the past MFF.

For me, of course, it is always important that we support small and medium-sized enterprises, and i would like to thank us for 100 million for the SME, for the financial opportunity in this area, because this is a sign that we are also committed to employment and growth in this area as well. The fact that we have increased some staff – not as much as we would have liked, but nevertheless – for the Court of Justice, namely five new posts, shows that we take Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty seriously, because, of course, the European Court of Justice must resolve disputes arising from Article 50 accordingly quickly. We have also seen, of course, that the 2.4% increases are not too much, that the funds are being used sparingly. Finally, there is a problem that will perhaps occupy us a little more intensively for the MFF. We have seen that pensions have increased by 6.5%. There is now also a proposal within the European Parliament to increase it to 65 years, that index development should perhaps be reduced somewhat and that perhaps a levy should be made accordingly here too. I believe that reform in this area is urgently needed, and I would like to hope that the MFF will focus on future design opportunities and European added value, and that we see that it is actually clear that if Europe cannot solve something, the costs of non-Europe can be very clear to citizens.

I would like to warmly thank my co-rapporteurs, Mr Marinescu and Mr Telička, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs for their good cooperation.  The Connecting Europe Facility is one of the important programmes for the coming period, with the aim, above all, of investing in European infrastructure in the fields of energy, digitalisation and transport. We know that when we want to boost Europe's growth and competitiveness and ensure that new businesses and jobs are created for us, it is absolutely essential that we have a modern and well-maintained infrastructure and that the links also work between Member States. The fight against climate change will be a particular priority in the coming period. 60% of this Connecting Europe Programme is to be directed towards projects to combat climate change, and that is a very important aspect. As far as energy is concerned, we have already defined the most important European links to which this funding will be used in the past: we are talking about contact networks that are essential for Europe, cross-border connections, and that list will, of course, be updated in the coming years.  During this period, the focus has been quite strongly on gas infrastructure, that is, on the fact that we have been able to build gas pipeline connections across Europe. In this way, we have been able to strengthen our own gas market. But naturally, now that the big gas projects are starting to be completed, in the coming period from 2021, when this program comes into force, the focus will be even more on electricity transmission networks. This is also necessary because the amount of renewable energy is constantly increasing in Europe and transmission links and cross-border inter-border inter-border connections play a very important role.  A new element in this programme will also be the possibility of financing joint renewable energy projects in the Member States. The Commission suggested that no more than 10% of the programme could be allocated to this, but in the European Parliament we increased that proportion to 15%. Renewable energy is an important area where investment is needed.  The digital section of this programme will be slightly smaller than in the current programme, precisely because we now have a completely new Digital Europe programme to finance these other projects, and this digital contribution will focus specifically on infrastructure projects. Parliament wants to make 5G networks a particular priority, that is to say, that we can build high-speed 5G connections along the most important transport routes. It is also important to be able to finance maritime cable connections through this fund and the Connecting Europe Facility.  Of course, my colleagues will soon be talking more about transport projects, but our aim of people, goods and services moving across borders in Europe will, of course, require us to have very good cross-border transport links, and that is what this programme will focus on in the next period. There are also lessons to be learned from where we have not done so well this season, and that has certainly been to seek synergies. We must also find more synergies between transport, energy and digital projects in the future. This is what Parliament wants to emphasise in particular in the future. This means, among other things, the distribution infrastructure for alternative fuels along transport routes or smart grids for energy. In other hand, there is a greater desire for synergies between digitalisation, energy and transport, which will give us a very modern and modern infrastructure in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fi", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 395, "date": "2018-12-11.json", "name": "Presidente. –", "mepid": "2187", "text": "   I will interrupt the debate for a moment to tell you that there was an attack in Strasbourg.

I want to express my regret for what has happened and is still happening now in the centre in Strasbourg. I also thank my colleagues for the cooperation we have had in drafting this report. I believe that a very good dossier has been voted on in the TRAN Committee, it is a balanced proposal. Firstly, we propose that the budget for transport infrastructure in Europe should be up by another 6 billion, which I think is absolutely necessary. Also, for more predictability and to have projects that are much better prepared, we propose that, on the part of the Commission, a framework programme should come in 2020 to present what will happen in the next 7 years, so that Member States and other wishers, beneficiaries, can prepare very well, to submit very well-made projects. We also proposed rules for the use of money for military mobility, because there were no rules proposed by the Commission, so as to ensure a fair use of that money for both purposes - civil and defence. This is very important, in my view, and we also ask that, if there are still amounts not used for this purpose, that transfers to the general tyre. We also call for transparency, we ask that on the Commission's website there is a real-time presentation of the projects that are in the works: who funds them - the Commission through the ECF or the Member States through the Cohesion and Regional Development Funds and, of course, also from national budgets, so that we can have a full picture of the completion of the European corridors. This is, again, very important. We have reworded the Commission's proposal on the amounts transferred from cohesion to transport policy, to the Connecting Europe Facility, so as to allow cohesion states to use the money according to the national tyre for 2 years and then, if they have not used the money, to be transferred to a common fund for all cohesion states and, on a competitive system, to allocate this money for projects. There is also a proposal in plenary, which has not been voted on in the Committee on Transport, for a new figure on the transfer from cohesion to transport policy. I believe that, in the end, the final decision must be taken by the REGI Committee, I mean Parliament's position, because they decide how much will be allocated to transport policy. So, in conclusion, I think it is a proposal from the Committee on Transport that must be supported in Parliament's plenary, because it brings great benefits to both transport and the other sectors - digital and energy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 397, "date": "2018-12-11.json", "name": "Pavel Telička", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, I would also like to join my two colleagues, the co-rapporteurs, in appreciating the interaction, and also the shadows; some of them, like Inés Ayala Sender, are present here today. It was in fact highly professional, enjoyable and I think we have a good result.  The Connecting Europe Facility is a success story. I mean, it is delivering results. Maybe it’s something that we should be better at communicating to the public but it is a success story, and I think that what we are aiming at is that we will be spending hopefully, as Marian-Jean Marinescu has said, a higher amount of money, that there will be a budgetary increase, but that we will spend it more effectively and efficiently than so far, and that was the objective which brought us through while working on the report.  Let me give you a few examples. I think it has already been referred to that we are looking for multiannual programming. This is something that should provide for greater transparency, predictability and planning, but also consistency. This is what is needed. At the same time we should be evaluating constantly its implementation and we have asked the Commission to work on qualitative indicators so that we would not just be assessing the kind of money we are spending, but what are the real results that we are achieving. One element that I was also quite strong on was joint ventures. We have one TEN-T project where we have that experience and we know that a joint venture composed of entities from the countries concerned in a concrete TEN-T corridor provides for better coordination in terms of planning and projecting, but also in securing financing, constructing and also future implementation. What we were looking at is also that we would be providing additional stimulus, bonuses, so whether you provide for greater synergy or you provide for better utilisation of the funds by having a joint venture, this should be remunerated with a higher degree of co-financing from the European funds.  Now one question which I would like to also highlight, and it has already been referred to, is the cohesion envelope. I think that I would advise all colleagues to look very thoroughly into the compromise amendment that we have tabled on the TRAN part with Marian-Jean Marinescu because we think that it is a bridge between two diverging positions. One, let’s say, that was proposed by the Commission and one which was very strong also among some colleagues, MEPs, and I think that this is something that could be quite unfortunate in terms of implementation in the future, so that would be my plea and my advice.  Military mobility has been mentioned. May I underline that we are talking about dual use. I know that some colleagues in the Hemicycle, some Members of the European Parliament, will tend to put too much emphasis on the military and automatically present it as a major shift offset. That is not true. We are talking about dual use, and by the way, we need it in terms of increasing the security in the European Union of our citizens, of our own.  But this is not just about military, this is dual use, but it is also about managing crisis situations. We might be faced with a situation where we will have to move heavy equipment, let’s say, or a large number of people because of a natural disaster or whatever. So what we are proposing to you is, in my opinion, a well balanced report, one that got a vast majority in committee, and I think that the compromises that are put in front of you are, in fact, taking on board a number of important elements.  And one last remark, because there was strong – and I know that I’m over time – but also on the climate and the environment. Climate proofing is again a part of this package, so this is as good as we could have made it.

The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) is key for Europe’s connectivity and efficiency in the strategic transport, energy and digital sector, to provide tangible benefits to European citizens and businesses and enable trade and exchanges across borders. The current CEF programme is now supporting 1200 investment actions, corresponding to a total investment of EUR 54 billion. This is a tool that delivers jobs and growth, and we want to further reinforce it. I am glad to note that the key objectives of CEF are part of the report, and let me recall them for the three pillars of the CEF programme: transport, energy and digital. First, for CEF transport the first objective is to deliver on the commitment to complete the core network by 2030 and move towards completing the comprehensive network by 2050, thanks to investment, with priority on cross-border sections and missing links. This will provide better access to businesses and citizens from all EU regions to markets and development opportunities. In other words, it allows all Member States to capitalise on the benefits of the biggest single market in the world. Second, to support the transition to smart, sustainable, inclusive, safe and secure mobility. For this we propose a strong and a broad emphasis on the modernisation of the transport system. This is absolutely key to deliver on our vision zero – zero fatalities, zero pollution and zero paper, to save lives and provide the mobility services that citizens and businesses need. Third, to promote a streamlining of the investment process with visibility on the pipeline and coherent eligibility criteria, we propose an efficient use of CEF, InvestEU and the Regional Development Funds to address the significant needs for investment to complete the TEN-Ts. With streamlining we are overcoming the fragmented approach to financing and maximising the investment value delivered. With respect to the cohesion envelope, we need to ensure a balance between sufficient predictability of funds for each cohesion Member State and maximisation of EU value added, as well as a sound financial management with a ‘use it or lose it’ principle. So let me clearly point out that the transfer of a part of the cohesion envelope to CEF is in the interest of the projects concerned because, under CEF, such projects can be co-financed to the tune of 85%, compared to only 70% in case of no transfer. Fourth, to promote synergies between transport, energy and the digital sector as much as possible, to make our connectivity modern and fit for emerging needs. All three sectors are increasingly interrelated so joint projects are needed. We propose integrated, innovative approaches to mobility, combining efficient transport, clean energy and digitalisation. Fifth, in line with the action plan on military mobility adopted in March 2018, we propose to support the critical development of civilian dual-use transport infrastructure to ensure an efficient use of taxpayers’ money. So let me stress now the objectives for CEF energy. CEF will increasingly focus on electricity while keeping the window open for gas. In electricity, the objective is to complete the TEN-E electricity grid through the development of projects of common interest, and for the first time, we will open CEF towards supporting cross-border cooperation and renewable energy. This will allow the completion of the internal market to foster EU competitiveness and facilitate the clean energy transition while increasing energy security. The new CEF will thus complement the legislative framework proposed and, to a great extent, already agreed under the clean energy for all Europeans packages. Last but not least, the objectives of the CEF digital. CEF will contribute to the deployment of very high capacity digital network featuring a high level of security to support all innovative digital services, including connected mobility and other services of public interest. In addition, it will contribute to ensure that all the main socio-economic entities, such as schools, hospitals, transport hubs, providers of public services and enterprises have access to future broadband connections by 2025. Lastly, it will contribute to the overall connectivity of the EU, including that of the outermost regions to the internet.

I would remind you that decarbonisation does not appear in the Paris Agreement. The Committee on Regional Development has not even agreed to my amendment to support clean coal technology. Not including this amendment can significantly reduce energy security in the European Union. The Commission's text is also controversial due to the transfer of funds from the Cohesion Fund. In my opinion, we have reached a compromise which the Committee on Transport has substantially changed, raising the amount to EUR 10 billion (Chapter I, Article 4 of the Regulation), and draws these 10 billion from the Cohesion Fund. The Commission's proposal is, I believe, unacceptable to the Member States, especially those most benefiting from the Cohesion Fund.

I am therefore pleased that the Commission's proposal for the CEF is already so important. I am also pleased to see the European Parliament's position, particularly on rail and waterways. We therefore support the report, but we now have some problems with the forthcoming votes. I believe that this should be even more about the fact that CEF funds cannot be blocked for years. If countries are unable to use the money, they must be able to release it for tenders.  Unfortunately, the CEF's financial resources are not as required by structural needs. That is why I see this as a really destructive signal from the European Parliament that we in the Committee on Regional Policy now want to reduce the EUR 10 billion that we are actually entitled to for the CEF to EUR 4 billion. This is destroying the CEF in Eastern Europe.

Thanks to good cooperation we have faced precisely some attempts at cuts; we have maintained the percentage of 50% co-financing for the studies; we have also managed to reach up to 50% co-financing, which means a little more capacity, in order to finance railway hours in the best time; also for cross-border projects, which may also have higher funding; and, above all, I think that everything related to the increased participation of local and regional authorities and the increased capacity, too, to make these corridors really a fundamental element of the future must be highlighted.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by emphasising that, in the face of a unified and shared commitment in the SEDE Subcommittee on Military Mobility, the same interest is not paid for in the ITRE and TRAN committees. This led me to re-table in plenary an important amendment on the need to have a geographical balance with regard to military mobility, a point that was approved by a very large majority in the opinion for which I was rapporteur in the SEDE Subcommittee. It is hard to understand why the three rapporteurs did not want to take this very important suggestion into account during the CEM negotiations. The need for a geographically balanced approach to military mobility is dictated above all by the speed of change of crisis scenarios, scenarios that are often unpredictable and therefore require a multi-directional and balanced approach, able to effectively face even those threats that are still not too obvious today.

I just wanted to say that it is a fund and that, as a fund, the most important thing is its budget allocation and I am worried. I am concerned, first of all, because this endowment will only really be set within the multi-year financial framework, that is, it will be fixed in the long term, but not now. Then there is a threat - we talked about it - about cohesion funds and, indeed, it would probably be to the detriment of the cohesion countries if that fund was reduced.  I regret that my proposal to transfer the 20 billion of the ERDF was not accepted because we see that there is a huge distortion between the needs, 500 billion, and the funds available.

A quick comment, therefore: THE MCE is a great opportunity and I, contrary to what my Italian colleague legitimately said just now, express my satisfaction with the decision to invest heavily in strategic infrastructure networks of all kinds. We have decided, as the European Union, to provide the European Union with infrastructure to ensure its development. I think my government understood this lesson and understood that without infrastructure and without major works the word growth becomes empty of content. The major operations that we are trying to finance with this funding are operations that do not serve wealth but help growth and have their main effects on the weakest sections of society, because only thanks to real development, and not told, even the poorest will have an opportunity to play and a chance, at last, to start again together with the entire community to which they belong.

But I will go back to the debate, because I know that I have two colleagues, Mr Pavel Telika and Mr Marian-Jean Marinescu, who have done an extraordinary job. It is a major text that we are voting on, since it decides for the next ten years, until 2027, how Europe will finance its transport infrastructure. The next ten years will be crucial for the ecological and social transition, because we have no choice. Low-carbon mobility must be made clean and inclusive for both suburbs and rural areas. To these long-term challenges, I add another one, that of Brexit. We are in great danger, as we saw again yesterday, with the postponement of the British vote. The accidental risk of a no deal increases.

I would like to make sure that everybody hears that the EU will always stand up against such violence and protect democracy, which I dare to say that we have been able to develop at most in the world and we will continue to do so. I’d like to make a very strong statement that dialogue should always be our tool – to find solutions for differences no matter how big they are and no matter how painful the process of dialogue and negotiation is. This is what the EU stands for, and will continue to do so, regardless of the challenges that we have to face over and over again. But let me now focus back on today’s debate. I am glad that Parliament has clearly confirmed its support for a reinforced CEF (Connecting Europe Facility) programme in the next programing period, and today’s discussion has confirmed that we agree on many of the aspects that will allow us to deliver. This proposal is crucial to implement our ambition for Europe to complete the TEN-T network and move towards zero—fatality, zero—emission, zero—paper immobility solutions. It is also an essential instrument to deliver the gigabyte infrastructure required for a smarter and more innovative Europe. The forthcoming vote will be a significant step for European social and territorial cohesion, the European single market, and for Europe’s global competitiveness, allowing a strong Connecting Europe Facility to address connectivity needs across the entire EU. As regards the cohesion envelope, we have taken good note of the interesting compromise proposal tabled by the rapporteurs regarding Article 4(8). So far, the Council has not taken a final position on this specific subject. But let me stress one more time regarding the transfer: the experience of the transfer of the cohesion envelope to CEF during this financial period is extremely good. All national envelopes have been allocated in the first three years and projects have started on time and are well followed up. So we want to continue this – including the high co—funding rate proposed for the next MFF of 85% – to ensure that the entire TEN-T network is delivered by 2030, which is our common goal for already very clearly stated reasons. So, once all positions are known and the Commission will favour a solution that ensures the best possible management of CEF cohesion envelopes, including through higher co-funding rates alongside increased competition amongst projects. And here, let me stress again that we are paying special attention to evaluation. We proposed a common approach for all programmes to be included in this common evaluation model. This will ensure compatibility and compliance with the better regulation agreement. We agree with close monitoring. We are already doing it largely and plan to improve it even further. But I would ask for cautious thinking before we call for a fully-fledged evaluation every two years because this might be too costly and disproportionate.  Let me add additional comments on the Multiannual programming. Our proposal allows for the adoption of multi-annual work programmes and our intention is that the first work programme covers two to three years in order to provide predictability for project promoters. However, requesting a detailed programming for seven years would be too rigid and adds additional steps in the implementation process which we believe might not be necessary. So, let me conclude with saying that following the vote in plenary this week and the Council partial general approach adopted last week, the Commission will fulfil its role as a facilitator in the legislative process in order to quickly find an overall agreement on this proposal. As a final remark, let me express once more my deep appreciation for the work you have done and your proposals. I am confident that the position adopted by the European Parliament with CEF is a solid basis for the negotiations with the Council and I really look forward to a positive vote on your report tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 416, "date": "2018-12-11.json", "name": "Pavel Telička", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, I listened carefully to the Commissioner and I think we will have plenty of opportunities to explain the logic of some of our proposals, because clearly there are points that the Commissioner has difficulty with. On the other hand, I would have difficulty with a response, but we will have a dialogue and I am sure we will sort it out. I miss today some of our colleagues who have been very passionate in their contributions, those who have criticised the negotiations between the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteur, or Mr Dalunde, who made a very passionate speech on the environmental and climate aspects. It’s a pity that we did not experience some of that passion during the shadow rapporteurs’ meeting. Some of us are more passionate in the debate in plenary, in front of the camera, and less passionate – or, in the case of some of our colleagues, less present – during the negotiations. I have just a couple of brief remarks. First, on the climate issues: yes, we can always include, in every single provision, a question on, let’s say, climate proofing, or any other issue. But there is a clear—cut mention, it is there, it provides added value. What is not there is the definition of climate proofing, we are asking the Commission to look into the methodology and, of course, we will explore it. But is this legislation in which we should be defining, let’s say, climate proofing, which clearly belongs somewhere else? And there are numerous examples of such cases. I actually think we have gone quite a way towards meeting some of the expectations so that, even on the environment and climate issues, this is a very solid proposal that we have. A final remark, on public procurement, just to give you an idea of something that we also looked at. We know that our companies have a problem of access to China, for example, so we have stipulated, in a clear provision, how we will treat, in tender procedures, offers in which, let’s say, there is more than 50% participation of origin from a different state – we know which state we are talking about – and what we should do.

Democracy and Europe must have the capacity to defend themselves, both against those who attack it from the outside and those who want to move this external war into the interior of the Union.  As we know, armed conflicts continue behind the Union's immediate neighbourhood, beyond its southern and eastern borders. Unfortunately, the dream of eternal peace and universal disarmament must be postponed, and our most important defence partner, the US, is calling on European countries to step up their efforts to strengthen their defence capabilities.  The changing political context, as we know, makes the Member States of the Union see a need to strengthen cooperation on common security. Concepts such as Europe's strategic autonomy or the European army are increasingly emerging in public debate. President Macron and Chancellor Merkel have also talked about this in the European Parliament.  It should not be forgotten, however, that at this stage these are only ideas, concepts that are still very theoretical, and their implementation is very distant. European security still depends mainly on the union's membership of NATO, and European security and defence policy initiatives can complement and not replace it. However, we should act in such a way that this complement becomes more and more significant. It is therefore necessary to think about how to reduce member states' dependence on imports from outside the Union and to increase the competitiveness of the European defence industry on a global scale. One example of a Community approach to this issue is the European Defence Fund, the first comprehensive EU programme to finance joint research and development of defence technologies.  We have joined the work on the ITRE report with more experience from previous pilot programmes such as the European Defence Industrial Development Programme. The achievements of this document include, for example, the establishment of a minimum number of Member States participating in funded European projects, the opening up of the Fund to companies from allied countries outside the Union and the separation of mid-cup companies from the SME group. From the outset, we agreed for the most part that the eu's greatest added value for EDF should be greater efficiency in spending defence money by Member States, mainly by reducing unnecessary duplication of weapons produced. In order to increase the competitiveness of European defence industries, we have all signed up to the call to promote innovation, especially the so-called breakthrough technologies. I believe that, together with the shadow rapporteurs representing the various political groups, we have managed to reach a satisfactory compromise on the most contentious articles, such as the rules for participation in a fund of companies controlled by allied third countries. It was important for me to extend the definition of European companies to these entities, as they employ workers and pay taxes in the Member States of the Union. I regret that we have not found a satisfactory record of article 7 on ethical control of funded projects. Personally, I am pleased that a number of amendments that I have proposed in my preliminary solution have gained recognition in the eyes of the other rapporteurs. I am thinking of m.in. including among the objectives of the Fund the extension of forms of cooperation between European companies or the introduction of provisions increasing the flexibility of the research and development budget. I expect that we will have a period of intensive negotiations with the Council in the coming months, but I am optimistic that we will be able to reach a suitable compromise.

As rapporteur for the AFET, it is important to me that the strategic autonomy of the EU is not a question of whether, but of how. With increasingly complex weapons systems, it will be more difficult for each Member State to research, develop and ultimately procure and maintain such products on its own. The European Defence Fund promotes cross-border cooperation and jointly develops the next generation of defence assets, whether in land systems, new aircraft developments, naval projects or cyber.

So let me start by saying a few words of appreciation for your work on this initiative. We, all of us – but especially you – were under a very tight time schedule. We have reached a turning point in the support for Europe’s defence sector, and the European Defence Fund will be a game—changer. Our aim is, of course, to strengthen Europe’s defence industrial and Europe’s research base and this will contribute to Europe’s strategic autonomy. It will help Europe to be more independent with regard to key technologies and key capabilities in defence. The fund will we hope – we know – importantly trigger more and lasting defence cooperation. Our objective is to support the competitiveness of the EU defence industry. It is an ambitious fund with a budget of EUR 13 billion, as it was proposed by the Commission. It covers both research and development. We foresee EUR 4.1 billion for the research phase, and selected research projects can even get up to 100% financing from the EU budget. We propose EUR 8.9 billion for the development phase, and here in this part of the fund the EU budget can only co-finance collaborative development projects. This is because also we want a real engagement financially from the Member States and from their budget. The defence fund embraces the whole lifecycle of the development of defence products and technologies, and this is indeed something completely new. But we will not start from scratch, from zero. Such new direction is already in motion and getting momentum. We have launched two test programmes under the current budgetary period which are now in the implementation phase: the preparatory action on research and defence with EUR 90 million and the European defence industrial development programme with EUR 500 million. With the defence research preparatory action being in full swing, and the first calls for the EDIDP being launched next year, just from the beginning, we are really proving that cooperation in the defence sector is possible and we are proving that there is interest from industry to cooperate. I want to thank the European Parliament for your support on those two test programmes. But back on the EDF proposal, I’m happy this proposal has been equally supported by the ITRE Committee and the associated IMCO, BUDG and AFET Committees. Of course I will listen carefully to your discussion, but my plea to you and my call to you is to give a clear mandate tomorrow so that we can start the trilogue with the Member States as soon as possible. The Council also reached a partial general agreement, and I’m committed to having an open and constructive dialogue with Parliament and with the Council during upcoming trilogues. Let me remind you also that many of the important and sometimes difficult discussions have been held in the first part of this year during the EDIDP negotiations. This is, for instance, the case for the eligible entities rules. I’ve noticed that the European Parliament chose to follow the EDIDP rules on this subject. We welcome the course to continue on decided principles and work with you on any possible improvements. We also welcome the Parliament’s support to enhance cross-border cooperation of SMEs and mid—caps – this was really an essential part of the agreement on EDIDP. For the Commission it is very clear that the European Defence Fund is an inclusive programme open to beneficiaries from all the Member States and open to companies of all sizes. This is why it shall promote the participation of SMEs from different Member States in setting up of consortia in the defence supply chain.  On the ethical aspects, let me say only one word, which was also an issue that we discussed under the testing phase: I would like to make it very clear that this proposal will not lead to support for any action regarding capabilities prohibited by international law, and the EDF will be implemented in accordance with any ethical standards. I want to reassure you that we do recognise some of your concerns. This is why we have proposed ethical reviews of proposals under the fund, as we are already doing it for the preparatory action on defence research. So I’m looking forward to tonight’s discussion.

Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, while the regulation we adopted six months ago allows the first projects to be launched from the beginning of 2019, this $13 billion fund confirms the rise of our European defence. I would like to thank you, Mrs Bie-kowska, for your tireless motivation to defend this fund. Thank you also to our rapporteur for his work, I count on him to make Parliament's position heard on certain points essential to the proper functioning of this fund. In an increasingly unstable and dangerous world, we must ensure better security for our citizens, because they demand better protection from new threats. Do we want to depend solely on third countries, when the international situation is fragile and necessities freedom of action? Do we want to continue to multiply duplication, when Member States can no longer carry out major projects on their own? The technologies and equipment necessary for the proper functioning of our armies are increasingly sophisticated and interconnected. Cooperation is therefore essential. At the trilogue, the Council will have to face up to its responsibilities. This fund must be attractive to companies, it means financing, the eligible direct and indirect costs must be widely taken into account in order for the financing to be equal to investment and industrial risks. But it also requires clear, community-based governance. The European Commission, under the control of Parliament, must be the one that implements and manages this fund, it is the only way to guarantee a true Community approach. We also need effective ethical control that provides visibility to investors, as well as highly regulated eligibility requirements. It is indeed crucial to avoid the leakage of our technological know-how, we must reserve all the financing for European industry.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 430, "date": "2018-12-11.json", "name": "President. –", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  I started the stopwatch once again after your condolences and expressions of sympathy to Strasbourg and the families involved.

Instead, it is like a blank check where basically everything is allowed. Parliament has stated on a number of occasions that we do not want the Fund to be used to develop lethal autonomous weapons.

In this respect, the European Defence Fund (EDF) and its iterations on research, and the European Defence Industrial Development Programme (EDIDP) are credible capability development initiatives, expected to be strong enablers of closer European cooperation with a view to closing gaps, developing future-oriented capabilities, and thus meeting the agreed EU level of ambition. However, all these positive contributions to EDF, to closer EU defence cooperation, are not unanimously supported. Some, in good faith, believe we move too fast, with what they perceive as the result of militarising the EU. Others, in not so good faith, want to stop the EDF completely or saddle it with unacceptable conditions which will make it inoperable.

The European Defence Fund must not become a vehicle for financing bilateral cooperation with European funds. Hence the importance of allowing, within a good framework, the participation of non-EU actors, as well as companies based on European soil but controlled by third countries. Under certain strict conditions, these companies, with their know-how, can bring real added value to the research and development of new technologies. Finally, I would like to reiterate that we will continue to work to ensure that, under the guise of greater and more inclusive industrial cooperation in the field of European defence, the door is not open to funding for the development of any kind of lethal autonomous weapons. The trialogue phase will be decisive and will require a greater effort on the part of all the Member States, and we hope for a real unity of purpose and vision that goes far beyond the usual bilateral logics, which sometimes prevailed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 439, "date": "2018-12-11.json", "name": "Γεώργιος Επιτήδειος (NI).", "mepid": "125071", "text": "   Mr President, I too extend my sincere condolences to the relatives of the victims of the terrorist attack.

The citizens of the Union therefore expect, and rightly so, that it will take a much greater responsibility for security. This is reflected in the various proposals prepared by the European Commission in consultation with the EP. One of the most important is the idea of setting up a European Defence Fund, which is expected to have a €35 billion budget between 2021 and 2027. For the first time, therefore, the EU budget will include resources mainly for defence research and implementation and improving military mobility in Europe. I think this is the right decision. However, it will require detailed analysis and scrutiny by the EP so that additional, substantial financial resources improve the EU's defence capabilities rather than spilling over into the sea of needs signalling to individual EU countries. In particular, defence research programmes should be set up in detail and those that would eliminate the European Union's technological backing should be supported.

Horizon Europe must be a clear, simple and fast programme, ambitious enough to meet the challenges facing the Union. If we want to make the European Union a true leader in global research and innovation, the budget must be proportionate to the challenge. At least EUR 120 billion (constant prices) are needed. We cannot afford for the European Union to be behind its main competitors. Through science, innovation and fundamental research, Europe can become more competitive and remain at the forefront of global research and innovation by creating quality jobs. At the same time, significantly reducing the research and innovation gap at Union level, in particular by increasing the participation in Horizon Europe, compared to the previous framework, of Member States with lower research and innovation performance will make the Union maximise its research and development potential. I stress that the principle of excellence remains the basic principle in the selection of all projects, and I do not believe that excellence is only in certain parts of Europe. Excellence must be sustained and promoted throughout the Union. A key element is that at least 35% of the total budget of this programme is allocated to support the European Union's climate objectives, which will stimulate greener products with sustainable added value for end-users. It is also important to continue the instrument for small and medium-sized enterprises in form as close as possible to Horizon 2020. The new features introduced by the Commission and supported by Parliament, such as the EIC, the European Innovation Council, and the missions will have to contribute, on the one hand, to increasing the competitiveness of the European Union and, on the other hand, to tangible results for all European citizens. I would like to congratulate Commissioner Moedas and, at the same time, to tell him that the European Parliament has gone into the same idea that this revolutionary instrument that can make a difference for the European Union's status as a competitor in the research market is the EIC. I would like to ask the Commissioner to continue to take the necessary steps to ensure that the EIC is an instrument to finance non-bank projects, high-risk projects, and that there will be no bureaucratic obstacle, including through a clear and unequivocal wording; they will be able to be the instruments at our disposal for the subsequent financial framework. There is great hope, there is one thing that until now no one has had the courage to address at this level, and it is a shame not to carry this out, Commissioner, and the European Parliament has supported and supports you unconditionally, because this instrument, we believe, will be able to make a difference in terms of the entity with the best research performance – the European Union versus the competitors , the United States and others. At the same time, because we were talking about administrative simplification, please, Commissioner, to make sure that what you said and we argued – that there will be a real administrative simplification – will happen starting with the research framework afterwards. Horizon Europe must be an example of simple administrative procedures, so that anyone can apply without having to have an army of people working or deciphering documentation. Your goal is to have money at the disposal of those working in research and not to torment them to read hundreds of pages or to need an army of consultants when they want to apply for this program. I know that you are against it and I am convinced that you will make every effort to make sure that this does not happen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 446, "date": "2018-12-11.json", "name": "Christian Ehler", "mepid": "28226", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, when we talk about research, are we just talking about research or are we talking about, in substance, the basis of the well-being of this continent? We owe to the labour of our working population in Europe, but the basis of our well-being is innovation. We are just 10% of the world population but we are consuming practically more than 40% of social welfare expenditure. And the reason why we can do that is innovation. Labour costs are fairly high, we are in a global competition. The reason for the well-being of this continent relates, starting in the 18th century, to its ability to innovate. The historic legacy of the Enlightenment is very much related to that. I am referring to that because we are at a crossroads. We decided, and the heads of state decided, almost 10 years ago that we were going to spend 3% of our GDP until 2020 on innovation, just to keep up with the Chinese, the Americans and other competitors. But we failed. We are spending almost 2% of GDP but we have to catch up. That is the reason why the ambitious budget proposal by the Commission and the even more ambitious budget proposal by Parliament are so important. It’s not for soapbox speeches, it’s not for the sake of academic life – it is about the substance of the well-being of this continent.  I think what we are going to achieve with that programme is, first of all, going back and tackling the big challenges which are related to the ordinary life of citizens. We want to tackle children’s cancer. In terms of technology, we want to have a quantum computer. We are leading but we have to do something about that leadership and we want to have a quantum computer 10 years from now. I think what’s important to understand is that this is not just another programme, that it is one of the biggest contributions to the European economy, but also to the well-being of European citizens. That relates also to the fact that we want to have a programme which is open to the world. We don’t want to be copycats like China. We don’t want to have an ‘America First’ like the United States. This is the continent which is open to the world; we are not naive, but we want to ask the world to work together with us.  A second issue which is important and also an achievement for Parliament is that we are reflecting on the fact that we are living in an ever-changing innovation environment. It’s new, it’s fast, it’s ambitious, it’s driven by VC capital and it’s competitive. And we did that in the past in a top-down way, starting in the 19th century where the sovereign and then later the state or the Commission top-down decided on the issues. I think the fast track the Commission and Parliament are now attributing is an achievement because its bottom-up. If you’re a researcher, if you’re an innovator, if you’re smart, if you’re innovative, you can go to the Commission and say: ‘in the framework of what has been decided in the programme, do we get funding? Are we ambitious? Are we fast enough in the international context?’ And I think that is an answer. It’s a game changer that we have more of a bottom-up approach. I would like to refer also to revolutionary issues such as what we did in the energy challenge. For the first time, we don’t fight the fight between CO2 reduction and competitiveness, we just focus on energy production. What we are going to say is: yes, it’s not a contradiction both to do CO2 reduction and to be competitive, but we have to do something about that and that is to focus on manufacturing. We want to have CO2-free steel plants. We want to have more ambition but we want to align CO2 reduction and competition. So it’s a big programme, it’s a smart programme, it’s a progressive programme and I think we would like to see the Council acting as fast as Parliament. We did that in six months and we cannot delay that.

Let me thank you personally: Chair Jerzy Buzek and both of the rapporteurs, Dan Nica and Christian Ehler, as well as all their shadow rapporteurs. They have done an exceptional job, at political level by building such a large consensus with all political parties on 128 compromises, and at a technical level by doing it in a record time. They achieved such a positive result, both in the ITRE committee and in all the other eight parliamentary committees that contributed to the process. So, you have managed in the Parliament to address Horizon Europe with both quality and speed, and I hope that tomorrow this House will confirm this position by giving you the political mandate to start the negotiations. It really is a remarkable achievement, and I will quote Mr Ehler: this is about the wellbeing of people – innovation, science is about wellbeing, and this is the largest ever programme for research and innovation. We also have good news from the Council, which on 30 November adopted a partial general approach on the Framework Programme Regulation. Here, I have to take a moment to thank the Austrian Presidency for their commitment to achieving this important result. Let me also highlight the role of the opinions delivered by the Committee of the Regions, and the Economic and Social Committee. I am pleased to see that, broadly, we agree. Broadly, we agree on the key elements of the Commission’s proposal and with your comments. First, on an ambitious budget: you have proposed to raise our proposal to EUR 120 billion. The excellence principle as the cornerstone of this programme. The three—pillar structure that changes from this idea of sectors to an approach of clusters: cross-cutting, interdisciplinary, as science should be. The mission-driven science. The European Innovation Council. The new approach to partnerships, increasing the participation of newcomers in the rationalisation of the existing partnerships. As Mr Nica said, more simplification is the objective of Horizon Europe for the rules of participation, to make life easier for scientists and of course the earmarking of the 35% of the budget for climate—related actions. Finally, as you know there are a number of provisions in our proposal related to the MFF that depend on the progress of other sectoral proposals: the budget, international cooperation, and the synergies, and these issues will be addressed in a coordinated manner for all concerned. But, once again, I would like to thank the European Parliament for this important work.

I also welcome the fact that, among the imronta that Parliament leaves in the Commission's proposal, the positive instrument for SMEs will be recovered; gender is also introduced as a cross-cutting operational objective, because there will be no quality research and science if they are not given on an equal footing.  I also welcome the introduction of the social and humanitarian sciences, and, of course, climate reinforcement.  I also want to ask for one last effort in terms of agriculture.

I wanted just to make a very quick point on something that the Member of the European Parliament Marisa Matias brought on the innovation principle, because I think we have some misunderstanding here that is important that all the Members know. First, that the Horizon Europe proposal does not in any way establish the innovation principle or incorporate it into EU law. It’s referred in the recitals, but it’s not something that is in the proposal. Second, I think there’s a misunderstanding in between what the innovation principle is. We need an innovation principle as we need the precautionary principle. Both are complementary and both are important for Europe. That’s something that I’ve said, it’s something that was in the Council conclusions of last year, of the Competitiveness Council. Because if you want to protect people, and if you want to have rules that are future proof, you really need to think about innovation because technology changes every day. The innovation principle is about helping us future-proofing our rules and I wanted to be quite frank on that.  Second, I think that really, I want to call both on the European Parliament and also on the incoming Romanian Presidency. I think that we have such a great momentum. We have such an amazing energy that we can swiftly go and do it as far as we can and have an interinstitutional negotiation as soon as we can, and I’m convinced that there is still a window of opportunity to conclude the political agreement. That, I think, is the dream of everyone that is today in this room because we want to have that political agreement.

A lot of things have been circulated on the internet, and I think this clarification on your part is welcome, so that we know exactly what it is like with the principle of innovation. And for me it was a shock to find that, for five days, everyone has been talking about the principle of innovation, accusing that they want to poison the population of Europe, at least, if not globally. Secondly, I want to ask you one more thing: you have at your disposal a mechanism called technical assistance. I think it is important to let go of this mechanism, especially for the countries that are part of the widering mechanism, for better preparation and better explanation of Horizon Europe, and I believe that this should start, if I may, from tomorrow.

When the trips of scientists promote Europe's involvement in the best research in the world, that is a big plus. But more often than not, the Union irretrievably loses talent. On the other hand, the uneven migration of researchers within the Union leads to a concentration of talent only in selected centres. Brain drain is one of the causes of the growing innovation and scientific gap in Europe. The countries that joined the EU after 2004, which have been hit hardest by the brain drain, receive less than 5% of the EU's funding for science and innovation. Half of the EU therefore does not participate in the advanced research that we jointly fund and does not experience the market benefits that flow from it. Horizon Europe must change that! It is good that the programme includes a new part to strengthen the European Research Area and promote scientific excellence in countries where it is lacking. Parliament proposes €4.8 billion for these activities. I call for this budget to be maintained. At the same time, I warn against imbalances in the promotion of science and industry.
