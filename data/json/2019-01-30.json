Excellencies, distinguished guests, Mr President of the European Commission, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, Prime Minister, gentlemen of the Romanian Government, ladies and gentlemen, today we are celebrating Remembrance Day and commemorating the victims of the Holocaust: Jewish communities, ethnic minorities, such as the Roma and Sinti, homosexuals, the disabled and all those people deemed undesirable by the Nazi regime.  For the first time on Remembrance Day in the Hemicycle of the European Parliament during the plenary session. With this gesture, we are sending out a strong signal today more than ever: we must not forget; we don't want to forget. We renew our commitment to keep the memory alive and to fight non-stop all forms of hatred, discrimination and anti-Semitism.  Perpetuating the memory of the unprecedented crimes of the Holocaust is not just an act of commemoration: it is an essential stage in the process of personal and collective healing. The Holocaust must remain a perennial warning. We must no longer tolerate acts of violence and racial hatred. According to data from the latest Eurobarometer, 50% of European citizens believe that anti-Semitism is a problem in their own country. This is proof that, unfortunately, the anti-Semitism virus has not yet been eradicated. We must react firmly to any re-surface of the shoots of hatred. Our values and history are stronger than intolerance and violence. Europe has demonstrated this more than once. The European Parliament has been and will always be at the side of those who suffer acts of hatred and discrimination.  In 2016 we organised a high-level conference on the future of Jewish communities in Europe. In 2017 we adopted our first resolution against anti-Semitism. Together we must do more to defend the principles of the United Nations resolution that established Remembrance Day: to promote educational programmes, to reject any denial of the Holocaust and to unreservedly condemn any manifestation of intolerance on an ethnic or religious basis. Our message today is very clear: there is no place in the European Union for hatred and anti-Semitism. We will not allow the tragic mistakes of the past to be repeated: 'never again'. We will hear the testimony of Dr Charlotte Knobloch, President of the Jewish Community of Munich and Upper Bavaria. Charlotte Knobloch was only three years old when she was banned from playing with other children in her neighborhood. She was Jewish and that was her only fault.  She miraculously survived the Holocaust authorities thanks to a Christian woman who worked with her family. Charlotte Knobloch dedicated her life to a courageous fight against hatred and anti-Semitism. All our gratitude goes to you. I invite you, Madam President, to reach the lectern and to speak before the plenary of the European Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2019-01-30.json", "name": "Charlotte Knobloch", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   former president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany. Mr Tajani, thank you for your introductory, reassuring and excellent words; President Juncker, Excellency, Prime Minister Michel, students present, members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you very much, Mr President, for the invitation that I was happy to accept. Because a visit to the European Parliament is always something very special for me. Let those you regularly go in and out of this building say to me as a guest: it is an uplifting feeling to be here. This House is not a Parliament like any other. Certainly, each of you has been elected to this Chamber as a representative of your country and your party. They are all here to make policy in the democratic competition and to create a good future for the citizens of Europe. But that's not all. Behind this lectern and above the Bureau, you see not only a national flag, as in the national parliaments, but 28. In the middle, they frame the blue-yellow flag, which stands for the idea of European unity – an idea to which you, as Members of this Parliament, are committed. This semi-circle does not only create laws – it creates common ground. And it symbolises the values on which Europe still builds and on which European unification rests: freedom, democracy, human rights, openness, tolerance and the will to peaceful coexistence. For many of us – myself included – it was hard to imagine how these ideals today determine everyday life in Europe. Too oppressive and too comprehensive in my youth I experienced the rule of barbarism, which wanted to know nothing human and destroyed and murdered without inhibition. I lost almost everything at that time: many of my loved ones, my home, my primal trust in the world and in the people. More than once it was luck or chance that saved my life. For years I lived in a hiding place – under a false name and with a false identity. If I had been myself, it would have meant my safe death sentence. I can stand here today because, among all the many murderers, followers and indifferent, there were also people who risked their lives to preserve their humanity. I can stand here today because the light of humanity has never completely extinguished even in the darkest time in human history. But even against this background, one thing was quite clear to me: at the first opportunity, my godly husband and I would leave Germany and Europe. This continent seemed to spoil us at that time. Everywhere we wanted to build a new life – but not here. The birth of our children meant that we had to put our emigration plans on hold again and again. These children grew up in a country where insecurity and discomfort were the defining feelings for them and for the entire Jewish community.  In the early post-war decades, uncertainty without limited contact with the non-Jewish environment dominated. It was never known for sure who might have Jewish blood on his hands. The discomfort of continuing to live in this situation in the \"land of the murderers\" – that was our country at the time – was always palpable. Staying permanently in Germany seemed unimaginable to us in this situation. The fact that I am standing before you today is proof that – fortunately! – over the decades, much that would have been unimaginable before became possible. Who would have expected the democracies of the post-war period to prove so robust? Who would ever have thought it possible that centuries-old enmities could be overcome in Europe within just a few years? And who would have believed that after the unimaginable atrocities of the Holocaust, Jewish life would return to life in Europe, even in Germany? All this seems self-evident today. But, ladies and gentlemen, it is not. And the achievements are not always as stable as it seems at first glance. Unfortunately, this is becoming clear again these days. The post-war liberal and democratic order in Europe is now more than ever in jeopardy. I am not talking about the external threats to our cohesion. There is no doubt that the European idea would be up to them. What worries me far more is the attacks from within. Europe can continue to be \"united in diversity\" only if it is aware of its values and defends them, of course. (Applause) But this future is compellingly linked to the knowledge of the past. On 27 January, on the International Day to commemorate the Victims of the Holocaust remember the six million Jewish people murdered by Nazi Germany between 1933 and 1945. The liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, on whose anniversary the commemoration was scheduled, marked the 74th anniversary of this year. Fewer and fewer survivors can tell from their own view about the horrors they had to experience there. All the more important is the signal of the leading candidates of the Christian and Social Democrats for the upcoming European elections, Manfred Weber and Frans Timmermans, who travelled together to the memorial in Auschwitz after their nomination. Nevertheless, it remains a sad fact: more and more voices of memory are falling silent. The \"time without witnesses\" is imminent. For some, this circumstance leads to the misconception that the memory of the Holocaust and the memory of its victims are unnecessary today. Nothing could be more wrong. Nevertheless, we are seeing political movements gaining strength throughout Europe, which are firmly opposed to remembrance and to remembrance. What they propagate is a present without a past as a springboard into a future without memory. Unfortunately, it is no surprise that anti-Semitism is revived with such forgetting of history. We members of the Jewish community are already experiencing the consequences of this development. In Germany and many other EU states, Jewish life in public is only possible under police protection, and the sense of security of the Jewish population has been declining for years. It is true that the centres of Jewish life have returned to the cities everywhere; Synagogues and town halls were newly built as a sign of the new self-evidentness of coexistence. These buildings rest on a foundation of trust. I can tell myself from my own experience how long it took me to feel at home again in my hometown and birthplace of Munich after 1945. I only unpacked the proverbial suitcases for the opening of our new synagogue in November 2006. Today, however, I am constantly caught thinking that I might have been too hasty with these words. Trust among Jewish people is dwindling in many places. They had trusted that they would never be let down again in our country. They often suffer from hostility, verbal or pertancy – but they suffer even more from indifference, lack of understanding, lack of empathy. For wherever we look, everywhere the hatred of Jews raises its ugly head again today – in all social strata and in all areas of the political spectrum, from the political right to the radical left to deep into the middle; also in many Muslim milieus. Forces like the AfD, the representatives of the anti-Semitic BDS campaign and radical Muslims may have little in common – only anti-Semitism unite them all. Ladies present, of course, this is only half the truth. Fortunately, there are people all over Europe who are committed to memory and democracy and openness. Their voices are loud and numerous. In many, if not all, countries of the European Union, they make up a large majority of the population. But we must not rest on this numerical superiority. History has shown how difficult it can be for the majority to defend their ideals against a renegade minority. And so we see in contemporary European politics how quickly anti-Semitism spreads if it is not set limits in time. One of the most drastic examples of this development can be found in the United Kingdom today. The Labour Party, which has been a bastion of state-political reason throughout its long history, has become one of Europe's most blatant cases of political anti-Semitism in recent years, chaired by Jeremy Corbyn. Under the new leadership, Labour has far outstrowed the political centre. (Applause) It is clear that in the moral semi-darkness of such non-positioning, the most questionable political plants thrive. This example shows how quickly the departure from a policy of tolerance can take place when the omens are favorable. Labour under Corbyn is an example. Such developments cannot be explained solely by reference to the special political role of the United Kingdom – they are everywhere in Europe, and they show that something has slipped in our countries. Anti-Semitism is once again finding political and social space in many European countries. What has been smouldering for a long time comes to the surface today: Where hatred of Jews is not immediately and vigorously combated, it breaks Train. The latest anti-Semitism surveys have also shown this unequivocally. Mr President, you have already referred to this. Ladies and gentlemen, let me be very clear: a Europe in which 89% of the Jewish population complain of an increase in anti-Semitism in their home country has a problem. A Europe in which more than a third of the Jewish population has already seriously considered emigration has a problem. Hatred of Jews poisons the social climate as a whole. It makes a mockery of the fundamental European promise: freedom and security actually apply to every single citizen of Europe – or they do not apply to anyone. It fills me with sadness and sorrow that today, so many years after the end of the Holocaust, we have to deal with such widespread anti-Semitism once again and still. But it must be our duty to counter this development and to push it back. That is our responsibility. For the greatest tragedy in Jewish history took place here, in Europe. The cities that are now the centre of our lives were often the scene of the worst crime in human history, caused by the German government at the time, less than 80 years ago. Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioners for their excellent work. They are the ones who guide the fortunes of the European Union. I therefore call on you to press hard today and in the future, even after the forthcoming election of this Parliament, against the rampant hatred of Jews. I hope that this Parliament will continue to shoulder its responsibilities in the future. The freedom and democracy we enjoy today are always as strong as the democrats' commitment to them – and the willingness of the majority to defend them against a energetic, hateful minority. We must not let this hatred prevail. Not again. \"Never again\" must not become a \"Now again\".

As you know, last week, on the occasion of mass marches against the regime, the president of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, proclaimed himself interim president, relying on the Venezuelan Constitution. Soon, a large part of the international community, especially the States of Latin America, recognized it as such.  More than forty dead and nearly nine hundred arrests occurred during these protests. This afternoon, and next Saturday, the Venezuelan people will be back on the street calling for democracy, freedom and respect for human rights. The European Parliament in this parliamentary term has already ruled eight times on the situation in Venezuela. No other country had this attention. Unfortunately, the situation worsened and reached a point of no return. Maduro's regime has managed to get more than three million people to leave their own country. It is the most important migration phenomenon in the history of Latin America. If things don't change very soon in Venezuela, it will be compounded by disastrous consequences for the entire region. In the face of last week's events, the European Parliament cannot be silent. I spoke by phone with President Guaidó, our only interlocutor, to assure him of the support of the European Parliament. We have awarded Venezuela's democratic opposition the 2017 Sakharov Prize. We were the first institution to denounce human rights violations, to call for sanctions against the regime, to call for a regional strategy to help in the refugee crisis. Some countries are only interested in oil. We care about the people and suffering of the Venezuelan population.  (You can hear applause and a mocking laugh)  (Heading to the place where laughter comes from): \"Risus abounds in ore stultorum\". Ask for the Latin translation.  In speaking out, we should not only think about a peaceful solution and a democratic transition, but also reflect on the reconstruction of the country, so that people return to a normal life with food and medicine. Venezuela is going to need a lot of help and investment. The European Union must be at the side of Venezuelans.

This was just after having learned the outcome of the meaningful vote in Westminster, an outcome we cannot but regret. We were all hoping that at least this would have been a wake-up call, leading the UK government and the British Parliament to come out with a clear sense of direction and timing. From what I understand from yesterday’s vote, this is not the case and we face more rather than less uncertainty.  What are the alternative arrangements? Prime Minister May has now been instructed to negotiate with the EU. How can we reconcile the intention to discuss alternative arrangements with the clear EU position that the withdrawal agreement is the best possible compromise text achieved in the negotiations? I don’t want to speculate on how the various options on the table will unfold, but this is clear that this state of affairs makes a disorderly exit of the UK more likely still and its consequences more serious for all of us, but in particular for the UK. Economic operators are increasingly vocal about the impact of this uncertainty, in terms not only of direction but also of timing on their activities, investment and, therefore, jobs. It is also clear that this uncertainty and the tensions it leads to at sectoral and national level will further test our unity and resolve. It is, therefore, all the more necessary on the one hand to resist the temptation of bilateral deals and, on the other, to reflect our common purpose in the swift adoption of the necessary contingency measures. The responsibility for ensuring the UK ratification of the deal remains with the UK Government. Our determination to proceed should, however, comfort the UK Government in its effort to complete its part of the ratification process. In this respect, within the limits of our principles and positions, notably as regards citizens’ rights and the Irish backstop, one should remain open to talks and clarifications if this can help the ratification process in the UK. While we have been clear that renegotiation of the agreement is not on the cards, we should stand ready to act once the UK Government has clarified the next steps on its side.  In the meantime, we continue the ratification process in the EU, which, I understand, is also moving on in the European Parliament as well. Given the uncertainty I mentioned before, in terms of both timing and content, we have to continue our preparations for all outcomes, including a no-deal scenario. The Council and the Member States at national level are therefore intensifying their work on preparedness and contingency, building on the solid work already underway. This means, of course, new legislative activities at this late stage of the legislature, but we are confident that by working, together we can deliver. I’m encouraged in this respect by the agreement already reached on a few Brexit-related proposals.

I say to Mr Farage and others, this is a bad decision. Listen, listen.  Even as the Commission has defended the interests of the European Union, a spirit of respect and friendship has accompanied us at every step in these negotiations. The Withdrawal Agreement and political declaration agreed by all 27 leaders and the United Kingdom Government is the result of that. The Withdrawal Agreement remains the best and only deal possible. The European Union said so in November. We said so in December. We said so after the first meaningful vote in the Commons in January. The debate and votes in the House of Commons yesterday do not change that. The Withdrawal Agreement will not be renegotiated. Both sides have said loud and clear that there can be no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland, no slipping back into darker times past. I believe the Prime Minister’s personal commitment on this point, but I also believe that we need a safety net that secures us against this risk. We have no incentive nor desire to use the safety net, but at the same time, no safety net can ever truly be safe if it can just be removed at any time. Sometimes, from time to time, I have the impression that some hope exists that the 26 other countries will abandon the backstop and also Ireland at the last minute, but this is not a game and neither is it a simple bilateral issue. It goes to the heart of what being a member of the European Union means. Ireland’s border is Europe’s border and it is our Union’s priority. We know from yesterday’s debate that the House of Commons is against many things. It is against a no-deal Brexit, it is against the backstop, but we still do not know what exactly the House of Commons is actually for. The concept of alternative arrangements is not new. It was discussed in the negotiations. It is referred to in the political declaration and, in our letter to Prime Minister May, Donald Tusk and I committed to explore it further as a matter of priority, but a concept is not a plan. It is not an operational solution. Many in the House of Commons, both amongst those who voted for and those who voted against the amendment are aware of this.  I will continue to be in close contact with Prime Minister May, for whom I have the greatest respect, and I will listen to her ideas, but I will also be extremely clear about the position of the European Union that I have presented today.  Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs, laissez-moi vous dire clairement que le vote d’hier a accru le risque d’un retrait désordonné du Royaume-Uni. Nous devons continuer à tout faire pour nous préparer à tous les scénarios, y compris le pire. La Commission a commencé ses travaux préparatoires en décembre 2017 et ces dernières semaines, en étroite coopération avec votre Parlement, Monsieur le Président, nous avons accéléré nos préparations. J’ai envoyé une équipe dans chaque capitale pour aider les États membres à être prêts. Le Conseil européen a apporté son appui à ce travail depuis le début. Nous avons à ce jour publié 88 notifications montrant quelles sont les conséquences du Brexit dans différents domaines, ainsi que 18 propositions ou actes législatifs. Les trois dernières propositions portant sur le programme Erasmus, la sécurité sociale et le budget de l’Union européenne ont été adoptées et présentées aujourd’hui. Je voudrais d’ores et déjà remercier tous les membres du Parlement qui sont concernés, afin de garantir que nous parvenions à des accords rapides sur ces propositions et sur tous les dossiers urgents en attente. Il est plus que jamais important que l’Union européenne reste calme, unie et déterminée, comme elle l’a été tout au long de ce processus. Dans ce travail, nous devons suivre une règle d’or: nous ne devons pas reproduire les bénéfices de l’accord de retrait ou de la déclaration politique. I am still an optimist by nature, and a believer in democratic institutions by conviction. This leads me to believe that there can and will be agreement with the United Kingdom, so that we can move on and move forward together with our new partnership. We will work day and night to make it happen and to ensure that we are ready in case it does not. Whichever way, I will always ensure that this House is the first to know, and the last to decide.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Secretary of State, first of all, thank you, Mr President, for allowing me once again to speak here in front of you, in plenary, and thus, day after day, to consolidate with President Juncker the climate of trust, transparency and dialogue that we have built together with you, ladies and gentlemen, , and in particular with the Brexit steering group, Guy Verhofstadt and all the members of this group for the past year and a half, at the rate of one meeting almost every week. Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, for the first time, British Prime Minister Theresa May openly pleaded to reopen the withdrawal agreement. Even before the late-night vote, it distanced itself from the agreement that it had negotiated and which we had agreed to. The British Government subsequently gave explicit support to the amendment tabled by Sir Graham Brady, which calls for the replacement of the backstop that we have provided for in the Irish protocol with alternative devices, which have at no time been defined. At the same time, the House of Commons rejected the scenario of a no deal, without specifying how to avoid such a scenario. That is the situation we are in this afternoon. In the course of this very long and extraordinary negotiation, we are at a time, Mr President, whom I want to describe - as I was at the very first line alongside and under the authority of President Juncker, President Tusk and yourself - as serious and very serious. President Tusk last night, President Juncker at the moment reiterated that we share this desire of the British Parliament to avoid a no deal, and I agree with Theresa May: voting against a no deal as was the case last night does not eliminate the risk of no deal. For us, ladies and gentlemen, the withdrawal agreement is and remains the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal from the United Kingdom and to implement in an orderly manner the sovereign decision taken by a majority of British citizens, which we respect, to leave the European Union. And I believe, despite today's difficulties, that we can achieve this goal, provided we are both realistic and lucid, respectful and responsible. Each other, with each other. Ladies and gentlemen, the backstop, which President Juncker has spoken of, is part of the withdrawal agreement and this agreement will not be renegotiated. The conclusions of the December European Council, which are in full line with the european Parliament's declarations and resolutions, leave no room for doubt on this point. I would like to say a word about the backstop, so that everyone can see what it is. This backstop is not dogmatism, it is a realistic solution. Throughout this negotiation, under your control, we have sought solutions to the problems created, in particular but not only in Ireland, by Brexit itself. The backstop as it appears in the withdrawal agreement is the result of the extremely intense negotiations we have been conducting over the last two years with the United Kingdom, never against the United Kingdom. The backstop is a pragmatic response to the unique situation on the island of Ireland after the United Kingdom decided sovereignly not only to leave the European Union, but also to leave the single market and finally leave the customs union. It took two years to find this solution, which reconciles several requirements. The first requirement for all of us is to avoid at all costs the return of a hard border in Ireland, that is to say to preserve the conditions that have been there for 20 years of peace, stability and dialogue on the island of Ireland, especially since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. I would remind you that the United Kingdom itself, through the voice of its Prime Minister, has repeatedly confirmed its commitment as co-guarantor of the terms of this Good Friday agreement. And we ourselves have supported for 20 years, through the Peace programme, by European law, by European policies, by the European budget, by the good success of this cooperation between the different communities. The second requirement is the willingness and demand of the British Government to keep Northern Ireland and Great Britain in a single customs territory. The third requirement, of course ours, the one for which we are collectively responsible, is the preservation of the integrity of the internal market. Ladies and gentlemen, this last point is fundamental to us. The Irish border will become, by the British will, the European Union and the internal market. This will be our new external border. What is at stake, of course, is the protection of all consumers and businesses in the Union. I will say this more concretely: the British decision to leave the Eu,100 the Single Market and the Internal Market has a practical consequence, which is that every commodity, every living animal, every animal or plant product that enters Northern Ireland from Great Britain enters not only Northern Ireland and Ireland, but also the single market of your countries. The nature, the quality, the safety, the regularity of this product, the safety linked to animal protection - I say as a former Minister of Agriculture of my country - require checks, which we do at every external border, everywhere in the European Union: tax controls, health checks, veterinary checks, regulatory ones. We owe this protection to all consumers, 500 million today with the UK, and 22 million businesses. We owe this protection to all those who make the internal market work and live. Among those who today are calling for the removal of this backstop, there are British parliamentarians - I was listening to one more this morning - who have negotiated with us and who know perfectly well that this backstop is the solution we have found for what is - as Jean-Claude Juncker said - the heart, for us Europeans, of our obligations and our principles. , that is, the protection of the internal market in all its dimensions and the rights attached to it: social rights, economic rights, consumer rights, environmental rights and the protection of businesses and consumers. Ladies and gentlemen, when I listen to some of the people who participated in the negotiation, express themselves as they do, I find it difficult to accept frankly the game of reproaches to which they would like to play against us. (Applause) I would like to say, after President Juncker, that we will not do anything - it is as simple as that and I say it calmly - that would weaken the internal market. We will not do anything that will jeopardize the future of the European Union for the present of this negotiation. And as President Juncker has said, however, we are obviously open to the alternative arrangements that were mentioned yesterday by the House of Commons. The Irish protocol and the political declaration mention them, the letter from Presidents Tusk and Juncker has even made it a priority in future negotiations. We are ready to work on it immediately after the signing of this withdrawal agreement. But today, frankly, no one, on one side or the other, is able to say precisely, in a clear way, what the nature of these alternative devices would be so that they would be operational and that they actually fulfil the objectives of the backstop. That is why, I say it again calmly and clearly, at the moment, and with regard to this withdrawal agreement as proposed to you to be ratified, we need this backstop as it is. Ladies and gentlemen, rejecting this backstop as it is today is a sort of rejection of the solution that was found with the British, but the problem remains, as I have described it. On this point, and beyond the question of the alternative devices I have referred to, the European Council, like the European Parliament, have already repeatedly and clearly rejected the idea of a time limit or a unilateral exit from the backstop since such ideas would immediately distort the very idea of backstop, which is an assurance that we do not want to use - like you, your own insurance in your apartment or your house - but which is there if we ever in need. Finally, I would like to point out that the withdrawal agreement that we are talking about and which you know goes far beyond the question of Ireland. This agreement secures the rights of more than 4.5 million citizens. Mr Tajani, you have mentioned Parliament's priority, we have made it ours and, whatever happens, the security of citizens' rights, our 3.5 million compatriots, nationals of our various countries, who live in the United Kingdom and of course, reciprocally, the security of the rights of 1.5 million British citizens who reside in one of our countries, will remain our priority. This agreement protects all beneficiaries of the EU budget in the 28 countries. Commitments made at 28 will be met at 28. The agreement establishes a 21-month transition period during which businesses and governments on both sides can prepare for this future relationship and during which we will have time, a very short, demanding time, to negotiate this future relationship in a new stage of negotiation. This agreement is the prerequisite for building the trust we need between the United Kingdom, which will remain a friendly, allied, partner, and European Union country. A true partnership, solid and ambitious. I would just like to add that with regard to this future relationship, the Europeans are ready and will remain ready in the coming days to be more ambitious and to rework the nature and intensity of our future relationship, economic in particular. You know, ladies and gentlemen, that there are several models of economic cooperation with third countries. Each of these models obviously has its own balance of rights and obligations, but there are many models. I am simply saying that if the British demand were to evolve beyond a simple free trade agreement, on which we agreed in the political declaration, with a view to achieving any of these models, we are and will be immediately ready to discuss it and respond to a new British ambition with our own ambition. This has already been said both by yourself in your resolutions and by the European Council. Ladies and gentlemen, I was talking earlier about realism and lucidity, as you did, Madam Secretary of State, less than 60 days before the date of the UK's exit. In the absence of a positive majority in the House of Commons today for a solution identified and acceptable by the European Union, it is, as President Juncker has said, urgent and necessary to prepare ourselves for all scenarios and to put in place all the necessary emergency measures than ever before. This is the work that President Juncker has entrusted to the Secretary-General and all the teams that work with you, with your committees and with all the Member States. Thank you for your attention and for your trust.

A good example of cooperation! And this also leads to our great awareness that we continue to support this negotiating strategy.  Yesterday we saw votes in the House of Commons in which all constructive proposals such as a new referendum, a customs union, were rejected. It has only been agreed that Mrs May will now come for the third or fourth time to talk to Brussels about the backstop again – nothing new.  I think it is important now, before Mrs May comes here, that you finally talk to each other. It is a scandal that the leader of the opposition and the head of the government have not been talking to each other for three years. When you leave, you should know what you want before harassing others. Please come with your own position! Talk to each other! Please talk to each other. Come to a constructive idea and come back to Brussels. That might be an important question. Talk to each other. We are united. You are not united within the government, within the Tory Party, within the Labour Party. That's the main problem. We see here that we have a negative majority, which is made up of different groups, ranging from the hard Brexiteers to the Remainers. And here we can negotiate and propose what we want: those who want a hard Brexit will not agree, and those who still hope – with which is my heart, but no longer the mind – we will have to see that they will reject anything that is not a referendum. And as long as that is the situation, nothing will happen. Negotiations can be held with Mrs May on a new type of backstop, which will also be rejected for these reasons. And you have to see one thing: Ireland is a member of the European Union. It is largely thanks to the European Union that the Good Friday Agreement has been concluded. I remember our old friend and colleague John Hume, who did this out of this House with many others.  (Interruption: Rubbish! Rubbish!) We will defend this. We will defend the peace programme. We don't want a hard border. And the British government has also said it does not want a hard border, having repeatedly signed that it wants a backstop – the first time in December 2017. That has to be clear.  We will defend Ireland and try to get a soft border. But you have to have the willingness of the other side. And the backstop we have today with this customs union is a British invention, that was the British proposal. The European Union has made other proposals on this. In other words, you now want to negotiate something that you yourself have proposed. I think that's a great number that's gone. And that's why: talk to each other! They need to talk to each other in London and make this clear among themselves.  With the Withdrawal Agreement, we are getting a transitional arrangement in which we can regulate the many things, such as a free trade area or further ones – Norway, Switzerland, we are all open to it. But we don't need the backstop. It is clear to everyone that 99% of the time when we reach the transitional period, the backstop will not be applied at all. So it is not a question of regulating the matter, but of not wanting an agreement, for the various reasons I have presented. And I would ask you to put that right, to make that clear.  That is why it is certain that we are now implementing preparedness legislation. It is important that, when a proposal comes along, we are prepared to talk openly and to reach a solution. I welcome the fact that the House of Commons has said we don't want hard Brexit - we don't want that either. I don't even want Brexit at all to make that clear...  (Applause) But that is the British decision to do this, we have to accept that, and we must minimise the damage to both sides.  There is only one thing that is clear to me, and the British people must know this: the damage to Britain is always the greater. The European market is fourteen times the size of the UK. Companies will deduct. All those who produce for the European market will leave the UK. It will be a bitter hour for Britain. It will be a damaging hour for us, but a bitter hour for Britain. Let us come together and talk sensibly, and that means: that the British side must first have its own constructive position.

The House of Commons has voted, it rejects a no-deal Brexit, which is good, but at the same time it has asked to replace the Northern Ireland backstop with alternative arrangements, which is clearly not a workable option. We have seen with surprise the same Prime Minister who just a few days ago said that the best backstop was an essential part of the best deal possible, now calling for its replacement. This might have temporarily united a political party but it has not provided any positive solution to the Brexit deadlock. We have therefore to explain again why this Parliament and the European Council in their mandate to the EU negotiator have made clear that an operational and legally binding backstop is an essential pillar of a withdrawal agreement, and that we will not give consent to any deal without it. Preventing a hard border in Ireland and protecting the peace process is not a partisan position, and the single market integrity is a non-negotiable free principle for the European Union. The backstop is a guarantee, an option of last resort. It is necessary to ensure that if an agreement on the future EU-UK relationship is not concluded by the end of the transition period, the minimum essential safeguards will be in place to keep the border open while safeguarding the integrity of a single market. It is worth recalling that the backstop was modified at the request of the UK Government and it was not an easy concession from the EU’s side. We did it to allow Northern Ireland to remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK, avoiding tariffs, quotas or checks on rules of origin within it, and we did this notwithstanding the fact that our original proposal of backstop was simple, fair and did not impose any material border in the Irish Sea. The only positive message from yesterday’s vote is that the UK parliament rejects a no-deal Brexit. This is welcome: a no-deal would be bad for everybody but a disaster for the UK. It is right that MPs made clear that this is not acceptable. So what’s next? We have always said, and we repeat today, that we want to see as close a relationship as possible between the United Kingdom and the European Union. It is the UK’s red lines that have made this impossible so far. This means that for us the only alternative to the backstop is a closer EU-UK relationship. If you want to ensure that the backstop is never used, build a positive majority for a more ambitious relationship: a customs union and at least a closer alignment with the single market. We are now less than two months away from the UK leaving the EU. We urgently need to see a positive proposal from the UK on how to break this deadlock. If their parliament is unable to do this, then it should be put back to the British people. If the UK needs more time, we are open to it, but we need a clear plan or proposal on how it will help resolve the issue. We cannot allow more time for bluster or false promises. We are united – strongly united – calm and firm behind our negotiator who will continue to follow the clear mandate given both by the European Council and the European Parliament. So it is right that on the basis that is unity, we have to be worried but we can also be optimistic.

But I’m sure you will all have noticed that this very Withdrawal Agreement was rejected two weeks ago in the House of Commons by an overwhelming majority, so now is not a moment for rhetoric but for reflection. It was never going to be easy to disentangle the United Kingdom from the European Union but there is now a clearer road ahead, if we choose to take it. I know there are some here – Elmar Brok – still hoping that the UK will stay in the Union and are taking positions based on that hope. But this is not going to happen. It would be wrong in principle to ignore the referendum result and, in practice, it is clear there is no majority in the House of Commons in favour of such a course. The amendment designed to secure a second referendum was withdrawn as it had so little support. The British Government and the House of Commons wants to leave the EU in an orderly manner and with a deal, and to achieve that we need to change how the protocol on Northern Ireland operates. We must do all we can to support the Good Friday Agreement, but it is a paradox that the backstop, whose purpose is to avoid a hard border, may in just 58 days’ time be the cause of creating such a hard border in the island of Ireland. Let me repeat, the backstop in its current form will not prevent a hard border, it will create it. Let us all pause to consider this: it may be very easy to sit down to great applause today for a rigid defence of an existing position. History may not be so kind. Because as things stand, we don’t have a deal. There is no deal until both sides have approved it according to their law. And it is simply not good enough to repeat ad nauseam that the deal cannot be amended. That leads to no deal, and that leads, as the Commission confirmed last week, to a hard border between the United Kingdom and Ireland. So it is my hope that even at this late hour changes or additions can be made to bring a deal safely home. As Mr Barnier said: ‘in the event of a no deal the EU would find an alternative operational way to carry out checks and controls without putting back in place a border’. That’s a quote. Let us look at that now. Let us consider whether time limits and exit mechanisms offer a solution. Let us proceed with good will, remembering that flexibility and generosity are not signs of weakness but of strength. For what is at stake is not just the draft agreement. At stake is the future partnership between the European Union and the United Kingdom. Let us ensure that we can construct a long—term relationship to promote our common values and our shared interests in an uncertain world. Let us find a way to move forward together.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 37, "date": "2019-01-30.json", "name": "Guy Verhofstadt", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Madam President, after the vote yesterday, Ms May announced that she will come to Brussels and for my part, I have to tell you very honestly that she’s always welcome – certainly here in this European Parliament. It would be good if she were to come once to the European Parliament as we requested already more than a year ago.  But the question today is naturally, for what? For what? To do what? Is it to change the red lines that the British Government has used from day one? That could be a breakthrough, I think. That could change effectively the outcome of this whole process.  Or my second point: what will her mandate be? Because, for the moment, as I must say to Mr Fox, I have not seen, and this includes yesterday, a parliament that gives a clear mandate to Theresa May. We have seen a vote against a number of things: against the deal; against no deal; against the backstop. But until today, for more than two years the House of Commons has not voted one proposal in favour of something, in favour of a relationship between the EU and UK – never!  The last two months, I have to tell you, have been very exhausting, and not only on the other side of the Channel but also here. Endless debates, long lists of amendments, amendments going in all directions, selected by the Speaker, and then won and lost with a teeny-tiny majority.  I give here the list: the Grieve amendment, that was on 4 December. That was a Remain amendment – won by 22 votes. The Cooper amendment, also a Remain amendment. That was on 8 January – won by 7 votes. Then another Cooper amendment, that was yesterday – lost by 23 votes. Then the Brady amendment, which was more a Leave amendment – won by 16 votes yesterday. And then again a Remain amendment, the Spellman amendment to take the no deal from the table – won by 8 votes! Is that the way to solve a problem of this magnitude? Is that the way to do that? Is that the way you do that? That is, every day changing your opinion? And in any way creating uncertainty, instability, instead of concluding a real, new relationship between the EU and the UK. I have to tell you that I look at that and I cannot understand how what started as a catfight inside the Conservative Party is today an existential problem for the whole of Britain. Take yesterday’s voting for example: the Spellman amendment with a majority of eight votes saying the no deal is off the table and then the Prime Minister comes back five minutes later saying ‘No, no, we just did that as a joke, a no deal is still possible’. I have to tell you that we cannot go any further like that. There is a lack of clarity and a lack of stability and I hope one thing, that at this moment, as we speak, a meeting is happening between the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Corbyn, and the Prime Minister, Ms May. I hope that they will decide or that they will discuss content, and that it is not just eating biscuits and drinking tea this afternoon, because it could be the solution to this problem if they start working together on a cross-party approach so that we know what the position of the UK is in the future.  (Applause) Because we don’t know it. Putting in fact, country before party. Telling us how they see that future relationship between the EU and the UK and not using or abusing Brexit, as happens now, to get rid of each other. Because that is what’s happening today.  If that is the spirit that emerges in Downing Street this afternoon, then Prime Minister May can come – has to come – to Brussels to tell us what this broad, stable majority cross-party wants as a future relationship and I think there too is the solution for the backstop. Because if there is a close relationship – deeper, as Michel Barnier has indicated – then the backstop will still exist but it will not be necessary to use it. It will be a theoretical insurance that it is, in fact, not necessary to apply.  Again, we are ready to go in that direction. Michel Barnier has indicated this. Jean-Claude Juncker has indicated this. It is time the political class in Britain is also ready to go in this direction, as fast as possible, because you will be the first to pay the price for this lack of clarity.

The internal contradictions of Brexit were laid bare last night. Brexit was never anything more than a bunch of slogans. It could never be turned into a coherent negotiating position. As we play out the end-game and the Brexit fraud is revealed, its supporters dream up fantasy deals so that failure can be blamed on Brussels. But we must hold our nerve through this Westminster chaos. A majority of UK citizens know that the best future for our country is inside the European Union. Here we can continue to be part of the world’s most successful peace project, and together we can tackle the huge cross—border issues we face, most notably climate change. We are now the majority and, as young people reaching voting age want to join us in improving our continent in mutual friendship, so our numbers grow. Now that MPs have rejected no-deal, the clear choice is still between the deal negotiated between the UK and the EU, and remaining in the EU. This choice must be given back to the people. The hostility of the supporters of Brexit – as we see here – to such a democratic check proves that they are running scared because they know, as I do, that the will of the British people has changed and has turned against them and their Brexit chaos.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her We have, of course, also discussed today in our group how we intend to deal with the current situation in the light of yesterday's vote. It is quite clear to us as a group that we stand by the negotiated withdrawal agreement as the achievable solution. It is not the best one could wish for future relations – as a basis for developing future relations between the EU and the UK – but it is obviously what has been worked out with a great deal of effort, with a lot of resources and with a lot of loss of nerve over the last two years, a year and a half. At some point, you have to decide whether you can achieve what you can achieve together, then stand by, or whether everyone from your side tries again – I want to pick that out, I want to do something again – and then ultimately massively endanger the common foundations. I would like to take this opportunity to remind you – and I would also like to say this with regard to my colleagues in the House of Commons – what we have achieved as the European Parliament, Less than two years ago, when we formulated the mandate for the negotiations, it is that we were able to influence Mr Barnier's mandate and that, in this discussion, we were also able to make clear, among other things, how important it is to regard the rights of EU citizens in the United Kingdom, but also of British citizens in the European Union, and, on the other hand, the whole issue of stabilising the peace process in Northern Ireland as red lines in these negotiations. It was not about our own interests, it was about the issues of peace and stability throughout the Union. I took a very close look at the debate in the House of Commons at the beginning of January and also yesterday, and I had the impression, in part, that our British colleagues are not taking us seriously. They also do not understand certain processes, and they debate as if they could vote on the changes on their own. No, ladies and gentlemen in London, you must also talk to us about this, you must also take note of our position, you cannot pretend that the British Empire also applies in the European Union. We have our own democracy here. You have been part of this democracy so far. I have always respected and appreciated what I knew about British diplomacy and democracy. I am horrified by the spectacle shown to us. I think it is important to go back to the basics of what we actually want to achieve in the end, and not just wall ingenuate. Let me be quite clear: the only hope I still have is that in the conversation between Corbyn and Theresa May there will actually be a bit of movement in the negotiations with the EU, and then there can be a lot of talk about it. We are open to developing more relationships, for developing clear relationships. But what we are not going to do – at least not from my group, and I am very glad that the other groups, most of them at least, see it in a similar way: we will not allow anything to be reversed in terms of employment rights, environmental standards and consumer protection standards. We will not allow the Good Friday Agreement to not be respected in all its parts. We will not allow a hard border to be crossed. We will not allow EU citizens to ultimately be considered third-country nationals in the UK on 30 March and will ultimately have to face a process that is discriminatory to them, that takes away all their rights.

Even when the Prime Minister actually gets a majority behind her and, alright, I accept she made a dreadful mistake by signing up to the backstop. You summoned her. At 4.15 in the morning, she left Downing Street, she went to meet the ultimatum that you’ve set her, she signed up to something that has proved to be a disaster. She signed up to something that no country – unless it had been defeated in war – would have signed up to. We now realise that mistake and actually, the House of Commons, the country, is overall looking for a deal, but do you know something? Before the referendum, no one knew who the European Commission were. That Maoist Barroso was a complete unknown. You guys are now household names and what we’ve seen is an appreciation in Britain that unelected bureaucrats in Brussels have been talking down to and humiliating the Prime Minister of our nation, and we don’t like it and even when she comes back, trying to be reasonable, saying let’s renegotiate, you’re not prepared to give an inch. The reason that a no-deal Brexit has got a little bit closer is because of the sheer language and attitude, not just from the Commission, but from many in Parliament towards the United Kingdom. I think public opinion will be very, very angry that there is no give today from anybody in Brussels whatsoever. I think many will say, ‘we’re simply dealing with fanatics who are not prepared to be reasonable or make any sense of compromise’. Of course, Theresa May has made compromise after compromise, way too many compromises in my view, so I think we are beginning to think that the public will come to a view that no deal is better than the backstop, and that’s a big problem. It’s a big problem for all of you, who want to get re-elected in a few weeks’ time, because no deal means no GBP 39 billion and your voters will be coughing up the money. No deal means the hundred million bottles of Prosecco we buy every year from Italy will become more expensive, as will three quarters of a million German cars.  So why don’t we all prepare sensibly for a no-deal scenario? Why don’t we prepare to go to the World Trade Organisation, use Article 24 so that we can, after we leave on March 29, have a two-year period of no tariffs, no quotas, no restrictions of any kind, no problems or difficulties with Ireland whatsoever? Brexit will have been delivered, you will have protected for at least two years your voters. That, ladies and gentlemen, right now, is the only possible constructive way forward.

In our democracies political debate can sometimes be fierce – even very fierce – but resorting to violence or inciting hatred is never acceptable. Politically motivated murders, physical or other acts of hatred are shocking and directly contrary to our very core European values. Earlier on today, this House already paid tribute – and let me join that tribute – to a fighter for freedom and democracy, the mayor of Gdańsk, Mr Paweł Adamowicz. For 20 years, he stood for those values. He dedicated his life to the service of his city and wider society. While I’m speaking about this subject, I cannot but also recall the death of a Member of the UK Parliament, Jo Cox, who was a passionate defender of the rights of everyone in society, including new arrivals from abroad, and indeed of the European Union. We need to recognise that that sometimes individuals can be drawn to acts of violence – radicalised, if you like – by conspiracy theories, polarised debates and more radical ideology. There can be no free and fair elections across Europe if there is a climate of hatred and threats of violence against candidates and those holding democratically elected mandates. Unfortunately, we’ve seen that even Members of this Parliament are not immune from violence and abuse because of the views that they express, and we must deplore that. Earlier this year, Commissioner Jourová spoke at the inaugural meeting of the European cooperation network on elections. This network is a concrete step forward in implementing the Commission’s election package from last autumn. The package recommended deeper cooperation within and between Member States to jointly identify and counter threats to our democratic processes and protect the integrity of our elections. We’ve had several exchanges over the last year on threats to electoral processes, including at an event in April, ‘Democratic Participation on Electoral Matters’, a Conference in October on ‘Election Interference in the Digital Age’ and in November, the Colloquium on Fundamental Rights. At all of these exchanges one message comes through: one way a climate of hatred and threats of violence can be created is through disinformation and smear campaigns, often spread through the social media or accelerated through the social media. There have been coordinated disinformation campaigns which aimed to discredit and delegitimise elections around Europe, sometimes conducted by third countries and sometimes by private interests from within our countries that do not have citizens and our democratic processes at heart. Responding to this effectively is a challenge. These threats don’t respect borders or jurisdictions. They do not fit neatly into how we’ve dealt with regulating elections and political speech in the past. A group can misuse personal data to target online disinformation or to attempt to intimidate voters through threats. Other aspects, such as the often widely diverging rules on donations and contributions, and the opportunity that the online environment creates to get round existing electoral rules make it even more of a challenge to deal with this. That’s why we need to collaborate together to ensure that we can bring together the resources and expertise needed to strengthen our readiness to respond to and to resist and mitigate this kind of challenge. Within the framework of the European election cooperation network, we are discussing what works, such as good ways to reach out to citizens to build their awareness and to retain their trust. And media literacy, an effort that has been pursued in Sweden, before their last election was a good example. We consider new ways to involve citizens in securing the democratic process itself, as Latvia recently demonstrated, by inviting citizens to give examples of political ads which were thought to break national rules directly to the regulators. And we discuss how best to make use of existing tools, from data protection to financial supervision, and how best to close gaps which may have opened up as new technologies and their use and abuse have come into this electoral space. We will look to see where we can deploy European institutions’ – our institutions – influence and competences to support and help the Member States’ efforts. In particular, this means working to ensure that the internet platforms, the big social media platforms, live up to the commitments that they have signed up to as part of our various codes of conduct and good practice, the Code of Conduct on Hate Speech and the Code of Practice against Disinformation. As you may have seen, we presented the first of what will be a series of monthly reports on the progress the social media platforms are making in tackling disinformation yesterday. On the subject of hate speech, we need to keep in mind that hate speech is not free speech. It should be an unwritten duty of all democratically elected representatives to condemn hatred and to refrain from incitement to it. In accordance with the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, states may sanction, or even prevent, all forms of expression which spread, incite, promote or justify hatred based on intolerance. In today’s society, online hate speech poses a societal threat, which not only affects the safety of immediate victims, but has a more general chilling effect on the freedom of expression and debate, not just online but in our societies. Our core objective should be to ensure that authors of illegal hate speech are effectively prosecuted. We must ensure that all Member States implement the Framework Decision on Racism and Xenophobia. The challenges that European electoral processes face are too complex to be solved by any one authority, Member State or even private-sector service provider acting alone. Indeed, no one should be left to act alone in this space or indeed to hold all the cards and make all the judgments. Rather, a comprehensive approach is essential to ensure electoral security and legitimacy, while preserving an open democratic debate, a level playing field and the security of all those involved in our democratic processes. We must never lose sight that all our efforts need to be fully rooted in protecting and promoting the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights, in particular the freedoms of expression and association, which after all is what we are fighting to defend in our democratic processes and elections.

We have just honoured the memory of the victims of the Holocaust. This debate is, above all, not only, but above all, a reaction to the assassination of The President of Gdańsk Pawel Adamowicz, my friend. The knife was inserted into a person who can not feed feelings of hatred even towards his enemies, in Gdansk – a city marked by multiculturalism, bad and good history, in the finale of a great charity event, so unique that it mobilizes the good energy of millions of people.  But it is not about diuding what it was today, but, according to the will of the family in Parliament today, it is about drawing conclusions for the future, because the problem is European, not just Polish. Before Adamowicz was mentioned Jo Cox – England, 2016, Theo van Gogh – Netherlands, 2004, Anna Lindh – Sweden, 2003 Previously Olof Palme, but also Daphne Caruana Galizia in Malta and Jan Kuciak in Slovakia. Too much of this politically motivated death in the 21st century, in which we should know everything about how to protect ourselves from the misfortunes of the 20th century, namely the misfortune of wars and totalitarianism, because they fed on hate speech. They fed on this language, which was the language of Nazism, Bolshevism, all totalitarianism. It is a language of contempt, which insiling people with human dignity, excluding them from the community either as enemies of the people or as enemies of the homeland.  Unfortunately, this comes back in alliance with the anonymity of the internet. Old demons wake up. In a particular case Polish hejt was nationalized, inflicted on the public media, which once a century lynched President Adamowicz. It was tolerated when the perpetrators of the \"hanging\" of MEPs on the market in Katowice were tolerated, since the proceedings against the perpetrators of symbolic death certificates issued to the mayors of those cities who agreed to accept refugees were discontinued. These are the hallmarks of the disease of our democracy.  But hate speech knows no bounds, it washes the European Union from different sides, because the European Union supports itself on the basis of completely different values: respect for the human person, diversity, openness and dialogue. May the death of Pawel Adamowicz be a wake-up call and a sobering one. If we doubt the self-limitation of the political class, in the various codes of good practice, voluntary and permanent, it means that we need to improve the rules, also enforce these laws, consistently prosecute hate speech, especially in the abyss of the internet, because it is the most dangerous there, it is anonymous.  The law proposed by german minister Heiko Maas may be a model. We have recommendations from the Polish Ombudsman, twenty recommendations on how to combat hate speech, also on the internet. Then and only then can the evil that has happened be turned into good. Then and only then – according to the wishes of Pawel Adamowicz's family – his death will not be in vain.

They compare her to a slave, they want her raped, and they send her to her country.  In Hungary, public television security guards physically tackled opposition MPs, and Laszlo Varju ended up in hospital for his injuries. The Fidesz party is behind the attack. Nova 24tv and Democracy, a Slovenian media funded by the SDS party with money from Hungary, regularly refer to me as a notoriously far-left, fascist, Sorose's mercenary, a blood-his-head killer, a traitor to the homeland and the like. When I alerted them to the untruth of statements and criminal liability, they said I was offended. Dear colleagues, I'm not offended, but we have a serious problem. Such statements and actions in a democratic Europe should not be without consequence. Coming out of your mouth, under the feathers and hands of politicians and the media. And not ordinary citizens.  Three months ago, I organised a conference on hate speech in Ljubljana. It drew attention to a few phenomena that we should be discussing very seriously if we want to address and cover this problem: What is the role of the media, which is facing human rights defenders and racists in ensuring objectivity? Is it or is it not the media's job not to let the voices of hatred and intolerance into public debate? On the left pole, in the spirit of advocating values, we were just tolerant of the impatient in the sense that we were trying to explain to them, through rational arguments, why homophobic outbursts were inappropriate. Now, when it comes to it, the right is defending the freedom of expression, which she has tailored in the spirit that anyone can say anything, but he is not punished for it. On the other hand, opponents are physically punished by what we have seen in Hungary. Hate speech is organized and funded today. It is guided and has the purpose – to sow fear, to pervert people and to open the way to power. The Slovenian opposition party SDS received funding from abroad, specifically Hungary, during the last campaign to finance its advertisements. Like nationalist ideologies, the outpouring of hateful feelings and primitive words in times of crisis is offered as an escape. It is mainly exploited by people who feel socially disadvantaged. However, we must be concerned that politicians such as Salvini, Orban, Janša are exploiting these people for their agenda. The authors of hate speech once hid in anonymity, but today they reveal themselves - and this is mainly because of the politicians who give them support and image. So it seems like hate speech is becoming something very normal, and that's why its power is growing. Yet, respected colleagues, hate speech, violence – mentally or physically – is not and should not be something normal. Inciting any hostility, both against politicians, officials or other citizens, is destructive and counterproductive. We Europeans do not deserve this, Europe does not deserve this.  I would therefore like to remind all those who are promising political gain from this that this will be very short-term, and on behalf of the Socialists and Democrats, I call on us to turn on common sense.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 53, "date": "2019-01-30.json", "name": "Ryszard Antoni Legutko", "mepid": "96796", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, I must say I would be rather cautious about regulating this so-called hate speech problem and what you call the political climate. It’s a very elusive, vague term and it’s usually used by politicians against their enemies. It is always ‘them’ that are hateful creatures. It is always our opponents. ‘They’ are bad people. You had a very good example: you had two interventions before mine, and in each of them it was ‘them’. It’s never ‘us’, even in this Chamber. This is a highly partisan and highly political institution. Whenever we hear offensive language – and we hear offensive language quite often – when somebody from this part of the chamber says something offensive and insulting then he’s usually punished or reprimanded, but when somebody from that part of the chamber says something awful and disparaging... well, it’s free speech. So the problem is, of course, who defines the rules and who will execute those rules? If I think of those two interventions, I say to myself well, if this is the language of love and tolerance then we don’t need hate and intolerance anymore. Let me state the facts. A couple of weeks ago, the mayor of Gdansk was assassinated by a man who we know was a convicted criminal, with a long psychiatric record and immediately – immediately – after the murder, the political opposition in Poland put the blame on the Polish Government, on the public media, making something utterly non-political a monstrous, horrendous act of murder, but it was absolutely non-political. They made a huge case against us. If you can think of the most immoral, vile, repellent, foul, wicked, disgraceful, outrageous example of political cynicism that is it, you have it, and you heard it here, you heard about the media lynching the late president. Is that the language of love? Should it be punished? Or should my EPP colleague get away with it if I say that they lynch me? Probably the authorities would not be as tolerant, but never mind. So the problem is that even this tragic death does not prevent some of you from using this death to pursue a political agenda. This is political cynicism incarnate. There are no inhibitions, no sense of shame, really! When, some years ago, Mr Schäuble was attacked by a lunatic, we didn’t talk about the political climate, and that was a good decision. When a couple of years ago a member of my party was killed and another gravely wounded by a completely sane man who wanted to kill the leader of my party, Jarosław Kaczyński, the reaction here was a sad reflection on human folly. Nobody talked about hatred or hate speech. I can’t remember any reaction from the European Commission – you were not there Commissioner so nothing against you. Probably they suffered from sudden fit of aphasia, I won’t exclude it. So I have lived long enough to see people fall and behave abominably, but in cases like this I always say to myself, my God is it really possible that people who could be called or considered civilized, is it really possible that they say such things, that they can fall so low?", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 54, "date": "2019-01-30.json", "name": "Ana Miranda", "mepid": "24942", "text": "  verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, in recent times extremist forces have succeeded in introducing hate speech into political debate, which attacks the survival of democracy.

Meps Eleonora Forenza and Judith Sargentini know this well; Jean Wyllys, brazil; or the murdered Jo Cox and Marielle Franco, among many others.  We know this well who defend plurality from democratic political choices and are attacked on the street or in communication networks day after day in the exercise of our public office.

Elected officials insulted by sexist, fascist, bigoted, degrading and tolerance-undervaluing words also know this. Therefore, we cannot stand by while this happens and we must demand that our ideas be free.  And in this Parliament we must also have a huge responsibility.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioner for his work and for the way in which I am grateful that we have this debate that I have requested on the agenda today. The many examples show how necessary it is. The mood in society is getting more and more heated. Too often, it leads to physical violence against elected officials. I am thinking in particular of the mayor of Gdansk, Adamowicz, who was the victim of a disgraceful attack. Mr Lewandowski has said everything about this. Rest assured: the concern extends far beyond Poland. Let me be very clear: we must all consistently condemn all forms of politically motivated violence. However, while – and I must criticise this – far-right violence is quite rightly outlawed, far-left violence is unfortunately often trivialised. German Social Democrats are fuelling this thinking: SPD party member Stegner believes that violence is not left-wing. His party colleague Martin Schulz – well known in this House – even claims that the left and the use of force are mutually exclusive. A look at the history books would do these gentlemen a good thing: the black books of socialism and communism fill thousands of pages. And far-left violence is also a problem of the present. Consider the aggression of the left-wing terrorist Antifa. Representatives of my party are now facing detailed calls for murder, including myself. Of course, it should be a consensus in this House to condemn Antifa for its excesses of violence. But quite the opposite! There are even members of the German Greens in this House who proudly show themselves in the Chamber with antifa flags, who are therefore basically committed to far-left perpetrators of violence. One of them has even made it to the group chairman of the Green Group, namely Mrs Keller. I ask – she is not here, so I am asking as an example: Mrs Keller, are you not really ashamed of this? \"When fascism returns, it will not say, 'I am fascism'. No, he will say, \"I am anti-fascism\", that is what Ignazio Silone prophesied. Antifa stands for this return, and large sections of the left do not even manage to distance themselves from it. No, they even show solidarity with this batting squad. And that, if I may say so, is pathetic! When left-wing violence is played down in such a way, one need not be surprised that bombings are being carried out on the offices of my patriotic party and members are being beaten to hospital. That is precisely the difference: we will always stand up for the right of the left to represent any nonsense, no matter how great. The left, on the other hand, wants to silence us.

This is true in France but also in almost all Western European countries. Alleged experts are stealing from increasingly contested governments and spitting out their hatred of all those they scornfully describe as \"populists\" in order to prevent any democratic debate. This is particularly the case today in Germany. I did not hear any very strong protests when our colleague Beatrix von Storch had his car set on fire in October 2015. And we are still waiting for strong condemnations against the attack, as violent as it is cowardly, which targeted the Member of the Bundestag Frank Magnitz.

The last time we discussed the situation of the rule of law in Hungary was on 11 September last year. The next day, Parliament adopted its resolution triggering Article 7(1) of the Treaty procedure against Hungary. As I explained then, the Commission shares an important number of concerns expressed in the reasoned proposal of the European Parliament, in particular, as regards fundamental rights, corruption, the treatment of Roma and the independence of the judiciary. Today, I would like to update you on the developments which have occurred since last September, including the developments in the Council.  First, as I already said in September, unlike the European Parliament, the Commission has a right under the Treaties to launch infringement proceedings and, in the case of Hungary, has launched many value-related infringement proceedings. The Commission is determined to make the best use of this power.  Last week, the Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion to Hungary concerning the so-called ‘Stop Soros’ legislation. This legislation criminalises activities that support asylum and residence applications and further restricts the right to request asylum. The Hungarian authorities now have two months to address the Commission’s concerns; otherwise, the Commission may refer the case to the Court of Justice. Furthermore, last December, the Hungarian Parliament adopted a new law on overtime, amending the Labour Code. As you know, this new law has provoked large street demonstrations in Hungary in recent weeks. The Commission is currently analysing the conformity of the new law with EU law, notably, the Working Time Directive, and sent a letter to the Hungarian authorities seeking further clarifications. In the light of the response received, the Commission will decide on potential next steps.  Also in December, we heard that the Central European University has now been forced to relocate its US-accredited academic programmes from Hungary to Vienna. Having a university forced to leave an EU Member State because of governmental measures and systematic pressure is unprecedented in the history of the European Union. It is sad and very worrying that this can happen in the EU, despite the Commission’s pending infringement procedure and clear warnings from many, many stakeholders. Another development in December relates to the merger of more than 400 media outlets into one single holding controlled by a board whose members are affiliated with the governing party. The situation has been aggravated by the subsequent Government decision to exempt this merger from the scrutiny of both the national competition authority and the media authority.  The Commission is also, through the European Semester, monitoring the functioning of the Hungarian justice system, including the regime for the appointment and promotion of judges, the organisation of the prosecution service, and the envisaged setting-up of a new administrative court system. In December last year, the Hungarian Parliament adopted two laws establishing an administrative court system envisaged to become operational as from 2020. It is regrettable that the Hungarian Parliament did not wait for the opinion of the Venice Commission, which is scheduled for March this year. The Commission is currently assessing the new laws in view of their compatibility with EU law and European standards. The opinion of the Venice Commission will feed this assessment.  In addition to infringement proceedings, the Commission is using other instruments, including audits and investigations relating to the use of EU funds and actions through the European Semester, the EU annual cycle of economic policy coordination. The Commission is also monitoring and assessing the implementation of the country-specific recommendations relating to the need to reinforce the anti-corruption framework, to strengthen prosecutorial efforts and improve transparency and competition in public procurement.  As regards the ongoing Article 7 procedure, I regret that, so far, the European Parliament has not been given a genuine opportunity to present its reasoned proposal to the Council. The Commission has made very clear that, whatever position the Council will be taking, it must ensure a fair handling of the reasoned proposal tabled by Parliament. This, I think, is part of the way European institutions should show respect for each other and each other’s role. Let me inform you that in November, following a request made by the Austrian Presidency, the Commission presented to the Council a factual overview on its actions as regards Hungary, in particular, the values-related infringement proceedings. These relate, in particular, to asylum and assistance to asylum seekers, civil society and higher education school segregation of Roma. Most of these cases are already pending before the Court of Justice.  As you know, the Hungarian Government already provided their reply to the reasoned proposal.

Because there is a question of fate that has dominated the lives of the people of Europe for decades, in which the overwhelming majority of Hungarians, regardless of party affiliation, want something very different from you. This is a matter of immigration. You, the left-wing majority in the EP, regard mass immigration as a fundamental right and support it. They want to introduce migrant visas and legalise illegal migration. You expect migration to solve europe's demographic problems. In order to support immigration, they want to take away the rights of border protection and asylum procedures from the Member States. You financially support the illegal activities of NGOs organising illegal migration. You want a quota system for resettlement and resettlement. They want to determine who we are obliged to live with in our country, and you are threatening, blackmailing, punishing countries that reject immigration.

This was necessary because we have carefully and thoroughly examined the information available and weighed all the pros and cons responsibly. In September, Parliament adopted the report by a qualified and very clear majority. In fact, one could have expected an appropriate response from the Council and Hungary. By no means.

It refuses to debate, it has chosen to ignore not only all the concerns and objections of its European friends – indeed, we are friends – but also the protests of large sections of the Hungarian population. Hungary is increasingly becoming a facade democracy, where the press is on an equal footing, the judges are put on a short leash and non-governmental organisations have to fear for their existence. Academic freedom is under threat, and conspiracy theories replace political analysis. Against this background, it is more than surprising that the Council has still not taken any serious steps to move closer to Parliament's decision.

At the same time, corruption is on the rise and Hungary refuses to join the European Public Prosecutor's Office.

This money is doing a lot there: a constant improvement in living conditions, i.e. fewer unemployed people and rising incomes. That's how we actually imagined it.

Hungary has a problem with fraud, with sham legal tendering procedures, with corruption and with judicial authorities who do not want or are not allowed to prosecute these offences properly, because perhaps people who are wanted to protect are also involved. The budgetary controllers also have a problem with the fact that the Hungarian Government does far too little and sometimes does nothing about it.

First of all, those who are saying, ‘there’s nothing to see here, nothing’s happening, it’s all a political game’, let me just refer to what I said in my introduction. We are looking at very specific issues and we are asking questions and if we believe that the answer to those questions does not deliver compatibility with EU law, we will proceed. I mentioned the so-called Stop Soros law. We will have questions about that. The relocation outside of Hungary of the US-accredited programmes of the Central European University – somebody here said ‘nothing’s changed’. Well, something has changed, very drastically, and we have questions about that. The merger of more than 400 media outlets without the competent authorities even being allowed to check whether this is in line with legislation. These are all very concrete things. The adoption of two new laws establishing an administrative court system – we have very concrete questions about that. The adoption of the new law on overtime – a lot has been discussed about that. We have questions about that, whether that’s compatible with EU law and this brings me to the point of principle I would like to make about this. Always, democracy is then invoked as justification for not complying with EU legislation. That’s not the nature of democracy. That’s not the nature of how this European Union works. Hungary chose, fortunately – and it was a wonderful choice – Hungary chose – it is a sovereign choice – to become a member of the European Union. It was a choice and it was ratified by Parliament and confirmed in a referendum by the Hungarian people. If you choose to become a member of a treaty-based organisation like the European Union, you – by that choice – say you will follow the rules of that Treaty. The European Commission has been given the task of looking into whether Member States follow the rules of the Treaty, and the rules of the Treaty are very, very clear on many issues and, especially, the rule of law is very clear. Article 2 and Article 19 of the Treaty stipulate very clearly the separation of powers, the independence of the media, etc., etc. That’s what we’re looking at.  This is not about a fight against countries who do not want migrants. This is not about attacking the democracy of a Member State or the cultural diversity within the European Union. This is about holding countries accountable for something they chose to do without any pressure from anybody else, a sovereign choice of countries to join the European Union and that is the beauty of this organisation – that this is a sovereign choice. By doing that, Hungary also had a lot of benefits, a lot of benefits. Many other Member States showed, over the years, huge solidarity with Hungary so that it could catch up with the rest of the European Union and prosper as every Hungarian citizen deserves. But membership doesn’t come with only rights; it also comes with obligations and the obligations are stipulated in the Treaty, and I think it is the duty of EU institutions – the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission – to hold each other accountable as far as the application of EU law is concerned. That is what we’re doing in the case of Hungary, like in any other Member State, nothing more and nothing less.

Haro on Hungary! This has been the Commission's watchword since Viktor Orbon bluntly signalled his rejection of the mass immigration imposed by Brussels.

It is not a matter of sounding, but of Viktor Orban's ability to respond to a fundamental concern: immigration, which 52% of Hungarians consider to be one of Europe's greatest civilizational challenges. In this, they are also supported by a majority of public opinion which, from Washington to Rome, via Brasilia, places the European Union a little more against the meaning of history. All the more so because by stigmatizing a legitimate concern, Brussels risks permanently alienating so many Eastern European citizens, quick to turn to more laughing horizons.

You can't stigmatized him for that.

The crisis unfortunately is worsening by the day and it risks destabilising the entire region. Millions of people have already left the country and many more are fleeing in these very hours. It is urgent to find a peaceful and democratic way out of the crisis, a solution where the people of Venezuela have the chance to determine their own future. Free and fair elections are the only way out of this crisis.  On 23 January, the people of Venezuela called massively for democracy. Regretfully, these demonstrations have been met with indiscriminate violence from the authorities, leading to numerous deaths and many more injured and arrested.  In these days, the European Union has made its voice constantly heard, with two statements by my dear colleague the High Representative, on behalf of all 28 Member States, and through regular contacts with our Latin American and international partners. We have called for the urgent organisation of free, fair and credible elections to allow the restoration of democratic and constitutional order in the country. By free, fair and credible elections, we mean that all political forces should be able to participate without any obstacles. We mean that a national electoral council should be established with a balanced composition. We mean also that international observers should monitor the whole process – any aspect of this process. The presidential elections last May were neither free, fair nor credible. As a result, they lacked all democratic legitimacy. The country urgently needs a government that truly represents the will of the Venezuelan people. In the event new presidential elections are not announced, we Europeans will take further action, including on the issue of recognition of the country’s leadership. The European Union fully supports the National Assembly: right now, it is the only legitimate political body that has been democratically elected by the people of Venezuela. The powers of the National Assembly need to be restored in line with the Constitution of Venezuela. The prerogatives and safety of its members must also be respected, starting with its President, Juan Guaidó. His personal and political freedom must be guaranteed. The priority now is to prevent a military escalation and to create the conditions for a peaceful and democratic solution to the crisis. With this aim, our High Representative is in constant contact with European capitals but also with our international and Latin American partners, as I already said.  Yesterday, the High Representative met with the Foreign Ministers of Bolivia and Ecuador. Since last weekend, she has spoken with UN Secretary—General António Guterres, and with the Vatican’s Secretary for Relations with States, Paul Gallagher, with Argentinian President Mauricio Macri, with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and with the Foreign Ministers of Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, Mexico, Peru and Norway.  With all of them, she discussed our proposal to create an international contact group. We believe it is important that regional and international actors work together to open up this space for a political process inside Venezuela. It should be clear to everyone that military intervention would only make things worse. The solution to this crisis must come from the people of Venezuela. At the same time, the conditions are not ripe yet for a dialogue between the different sides inside the country. So the contact group will not engage in a direct dialogue with the two Venezuelan sides, but we believe that an international initiative can help build the conditions that will eventually lead to relaunching a political process inside Venezuela, and to free and fair elections with all the necessary guarantees. We want to restart meaningful talks at the international level as an intermediate step and a precondition for talks inside Venezuela. The preparations for the contact group are ongoing and the High Representative will discuss this tomorrow with the 28 EU Foreign Ministers at Gymnich.  At the same time, the European Union is maintaining its position as set out in the Council Conclusions of May last year, with restrictive measures on the top brass of the Maduro regime. Allow me a final word on our humanitarian work, because the situation inside Venezuela, unfortunately, especially in the humanitarian field, is really deteriorating moment by moment, minute by minute. We remain committed to helping those in need in Venezuela and the host communities that have welcomed the many Venezuelans who have fled their country. In December, I remember, in Strasbourg, I announced an additional EUR 20 million in humanitarian assistance only. This brings total EU support for last year only to EUR 55 million for the Venezuelan people both inside Venezuela and in host communities, and sometimes our humanitarian partners provided assistance really behind the scenes, in very dangerous ways. Federica Mogherini met in December with Eduardo Stein, the Joint Special Envoy of the UN Agencies. We expressed our willingness to work closely with him to address these challenges and we very much support a regional response to the current crisis. We care about Venezuela and its people. Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans are also European citizens or have family in Europe.

Its mandate has a unique and clear purpose: to lead Venezuela towards free and democratic elections in the shortest possible time; nothing more and nothing less.  Since then, many states, including major Latin American democracies, including the United States, Australia, Canada, Israel, have recognized the interim presidency of Guaidó. The question is: what is Europe waiting for? The whole of Europe is looking at us; all of Venezuela is looking at us, and what do we do? How long, dear colleagues?  Those who will be demonstrating today on the streets of Venezuela are not Europeans, it is true, but they fight for the same values that we fight for. They are not Europeans, it is true, but they struggle to have a dignified life like the one we have. They are not Europeans, it is true, but they fight for peace and freedom as we fight. They are not Europeans, but they fight to keep their children not in Maduro prisons, but in colleges and universities as ours are. They are not Europeans, it is true, but they fight so that more than two and a half million Venezuelan refugees or exiles can return to their country with dignity and with their heads high as we did after the war. They are not Europeans, but they fight so that the deaths of so many thousands of innocent men and women in these 19 years, 11 months and 29 days of tyranny have not been in vain.  They are not Europeans, but they are Europeans, because we too are Venezuelans, because when it comes to freedom, democracy, equality, dignity in the world, there are no borders. We ourselves could not, we would not have the right to call ourselves Europeans if we did not act today as if we were Venezuelans. When it comes to defending human rights, freedom and democracy, Europe cannot be neutral or equidistant. Europe is not just a place. Europe is also an ideal. Europe is an aspiration.  How many violent deaths, how many sick people died from lack of medicine, how many pregnant women without nutrition, how many elderly, how many helpless children will die from lack of food? How much longer does it have to happen in Venezuela for us to understand what's going on there? That is why we are asking this House, this Parliament, for three things. First, let us recognize the National Assembly and Acting President Juan Guaidó as Venezuela's only legitimate powers. Second, let us demand that the Venezuelan armed forces ensure a peaceful transition of powers loyal to the Constitution and the Venezuelan people. And thirdly, let us make available to the new authorities a first urgent aid package to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. If Maduro is a tyrant, we can't give him a deadline to call elections. If Maduro is a tyrant, we can't ask him to talk. If Maduro is a tyrant, we cannot expect him to rectify, because to expect him to rectify a tyrant is to give the tyrant a chance.  Tyrants don't call elections. Tyrants don't talk. Tyrants don't rectify. They're tyrants, they're not country flowers. Tyrants are dangerous and with tyrants you can only act with the head high and with the principles by flag, with severity.  That's why let's do Venezuelan history today, even though we're Europeans. Let us recognize the democratic and legitimate power of Venezuela; let us be as the European Parliament the first European institution to recognise Venezuelan democracy.

The international community did not recognize last year's May elections and has therefore not recognized Mr Maduro as President of Venezuela as of January 10. Mr. Guaidó, President of the National Assembly, has declared himself president of Venezuela and we have a country in a situation of enormous crisis and volatility.  I am going to start by defending Europe, Mr González Pons. I believe that Europe has established a reasonable criterion, which is preferably to establish an agreement between government and opposition; between the government that has, say, the electoral apparatus and the new president declared under the Constitution, which has 30 days to call elections. An agreement that allows elections to be held with guarantees. And you have set a deadline and told Mr Maduro: if you do not fulfill this purpose, I will recognize Mr Guaido, and you are doing so. And, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, with the agreement reached by the political groups, this House is going to do so. And the Member States of the European Union will do so in the following days. Yes, they're going to do it. And this is the consequence that a legitimately reasonable development of this situation has not been possible.  Our agreement — which we are going to vote on tomorrow, ladies and gentlemen, all political groups - also includes the rejection of any kind of intervention that may occur from a violent or armed point of view, and I think it is important to highlight this because we must reject and condemn any attempt or proposal involving violence - military escalation, the Commissioner said - or the use of weapons for an alleged solution to the Venezuelan crisis. But also, our group believes that we must give enormous support to the contact group that the European Union is creating. Because this is political, ladies and gentlemen, and the European Union wants to play a role, not exactly like that of the United States — which is its own, I do not dispute it now — but ours is the role of facilitator, mediator, controller, of ensuring that the democratic process and the electoral solution are the only peaceful and democratic solution to the Venezuelan crisis. In any of the scenarios, in any of those that come—that maduro elections be called; that they are called by Guaidó, or not called by anyone—the European Union, with its contact group in the key countries in the region, must continue to establish a peaceful and democratic exit to Venezuela, ladies and gentlemen. It is the European Union's proposal.  Of course we're going to say that Guaidó is president, yes. Are we going to recognize him? Yes. Are we going to help the people of Venezuela and their opposition? Yes, as we have always done; but having the political hand to act on the political stage.  We have long been declaring— the Socialists in particular — that socialism is freedom and that there can be no left against democracy. I would like to reiterate this again here and I want to say it loudly against Mr Maduro, and that is why I would like to reiterate an agreement reached by the political groups to strike this balance between our proposals, so that there may continue to be important political action by the European Union, in order to give a democratic and peaceful way out - I repeat, peacefully - to Venezuela, on the basis of the political action that we Europeans can take.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 111, "date": "2019-01-30.json", "name": "Charles Tannock", "mepid": "4521", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, with Venezuelan inflation at a staggering 10 million percent, with three million people having fled the country and the security forces under Maduro’s direction employing ever more authoritarian tactics, the recent developments can hardly come as a surprise.

The EU’s turn is next. The presidential elections held in May of last year have been wholly discredited, marked by a distinct lack of political pluralism, democracy, transparency and the rule of law, as was highlighted by the High Representative at that time. Such is the strength of opinion across the region that the Secretary General of the OAS, Luis Almagro, has gone further, openly accusing Maduro of perpetrating crimes against humanity and the violation of fundamental human rights, noting that, whilst diplomatic actions should be the first priority, we shouldn’t rule out any action. Diplomatic efforts and dialogue sadly have clearly failed and the recognition of Guaidó is the first step in moving to a more assertive set of actions by international actors. I now welcome the decision of the Bank of England in my country to prevent Venezuela from accessing USD 1.2 billion in reserves held there.

Well, three million votes for that referendum—according to Lenin, with which I agree as a reference.  Still. Maduro is the de facto power based on fraudulent elections and is only based on the power of brute force, the capacity for repression, supported by the Cuban intelligence system. It is the antipodes of freedom, the antipodes of revolution and the antipodes of an idea that to me is noble and called socialism.  Venezuela's rightful president, the constitutional president, is Juan Guaidó. Just read article 233 of the Constitution: it ceased to be President Maduro when he called an election, ended his deadline and were perfectly fraudulent. Therefore, asking a president who is not president to act as president and, depending on that supposed presidency, calling an election is not only a surrealism worthy of Salvador Dalí: it is simply Marxism, but in the Groucho Marx version.

We Europeans have immediately confirmed where we stand: we want to encourage dialogue between mainland China and Taiwan, and we regret that cross-strait relations have remained frozen in the past two years. We maintain our ‘One China’ policy. This means that we recognise the government of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, but at the same time, we have an interest in developing closer relations with Taiwan. Our cooperation and dialogue with Taiwan are getting more intense on a broad range of issues – and this is because we very much respect Taiwan’s system of governance. It is a system based on democracy, the rule of law and human rights. In many ways, the European Union and Taiwan are like—minded. So we have always encouraged Taiwan to be an active player in international affairs. In short, we do engage with Taiwan even in the lack of diplomatic recognition. We Europeans have a strong interest in peace and security in Asia. We are very distant geographically, but we know that tensions in the Far East can only have a negative impact on our own security, as well as on our trade and our economies. Also for this reason, we keep following closely all developments around the Taiwan Strait. In recent years, both sides have taken a tougher stance on the possibility of a cross-strait rapprochement. Beijing has cut high-level channels of communication. Since 2016, China has increased the diplomatic pressure on Taiwan to limit further its international space and to convince Taipei’s diplomatic allies to switch recognition to Beijing. On their side, Taipei’s leaders have explicitly refused the formula of ‘one country, two systems’. At the same time, economic and trade relations between the two sides have been flourishing – and mainland China is now Taiwan’s main investment destination and trading partner. Against this backdrop, we Europeans have asked both sides to avoid actions and words that may increase tensions around the Strait. We have always encouraged mainland China and Taiwan to engage constructively with one another, and to restart dialogue between them. We are willing to support all initiatives aimed at promoting dialogue, cooperation and confidence-building between the two sides.

With the adoption of the joint statement from last July by President Juncker and President Trump, we entered into a new stage in our relationship with the US, our first investment and trade partner, and we identified a focused and positive trade agenda. Since then, I have met with my American counterparts many times in an effort to implement the joint programme that we identified last summer. We have identified future avenues on voluntary cooperation with the US and a number of regulatory sectors of major economic importance, such as pharmaceuticals, medical devices and cybersecurity, and the progress achieved so far has been reflected in a public report that we released this morning and is available for all of you to read. We will continue to engage with the US in order to respond to the global challenges, notably the WTO reform and the need to update rules to respond to the challenges posed by state capitalism.  Trends: trade in liquefied natural gas and soya beans are developing in line with expectations expressed in the July joint statement and have contributed to EU energy security and provided our farmers with protein at competitive prices. Two weeks ago, the Commission adopted two recommendations for opening negotiations, one on industrial tariffs and one on conformity assessment. The one on industrial tariffs is quite self—explanatory and it does not include agriculture, as agreed in July. The proposed mandate on conformity assessment maybe deserves a little explanation.  Both the EU and the US have in their respective practices of conformity assessment the purpose to ensure that manufacturers can only place a product on the market when it meets all the applicable requirements to ensure that unsafe or otherwise non—compliant products do not find their way to unsuspecting consumers. In some cases this requires mandatory third-party certification. Differences in approaches to conformity assessment can result in significant additional costs without improving the safety of the products. So our aim with this recommendation for negotiations on conformity assessment is to reduce the unnecessary costs while making sure that we fully maintain our respective levels of protection. The two recommendations thereby fulfilled the commitment that we took in July. They recognise that progress with the Trump administration is at this stage only possible with individual projects agreed on both sides. So I believe that the various strands of work we have initiated together through this process since July will add to a significant agenda with benefits from both sides. We can make every effort to project a positive trade agenda with the US on its own merits and also it is important not to fall back into a destructive cycle of trade restrictive measures and counter actions. At the same time, we must be very clear that any thought of going beyond the joint statement and negotiating a comprehensive and all encompassing trade agreement with the US is neither feasible nor advisable at this time. The US is also not ready to negotiate on its sensitivities, such as public procurement by American maritime services, or geographical indications.  In addition, one of the important lessons that we have learnt during the TTIP negotiation is that the regulatory agenda with the US is best developed in full transparency, but outside the context of FTA negotiations. Furthermore, there are differences in some important trade-related rule areas where opposition will be very difficult to bridge.  So our efforts are more likely to bear fruit if we seek to cooperate with the US in reforming certain multilateral trade rules that are ripe for an update. We are of course remaining vigilant and we will be ready to respond firmly in case the US would no longer respect commitments given in July and would adopt further restrictive measures vis—à—vis the EU, but this scenario would not be of our choosing.  I’m looking forward to the debate.

From the continued push to include agriculture products to downright hostility on the protection of geographic indications, the American negotiating objectives at times seem geometrically opposed to what Presidents Juncker and Trump agreed on in July last year. Nevertheless, we should not forget that, while we are talking, we are not escalating the trade war. President Juncker stopped the devastating downward spiral of tariff upon tariff. Our negotiators should be ambitious yet stay within the confines of the joint statement. That means categorically that agriculture cannot be up for discussion.

Nonetheless, given the current circumstances with global trade tensions, I welcomed the July EU-US agreement not to impose further tariffs on each, whilst both sides scope out the room for negotiation. And the ECR continues to support the Commission’s action to begin negotiations with the US. Having two separate agreements with the US – one on tariffs on industrial products and another on conformity assessments – provides a clear structure to negotiations.

Donald Trump has made a very simple and very obvious proposal – and since everyone in this House is basically in favour of lowering tariffs and only in principle and now and then against it: he said, let us cut all tariffs, let us all eliminate them!

What we are doing and what was the purpose of the meeting in July was that, despite those differences, we tried to find a common agenda, a positive platform in the trade area and to avoid further escalation, which would be bad for us, for them and for the world. This was agreed in July and what we agreed upon was published immediately. What we do now is that we are respecting that agenda, and it is also following what the European Council unanimously concluded in their Sofia meeting in June. There was unanimity on proposing this to the US. We have been talking with the US during this six months in full transparency. I have many times in the European Parliament Committee on International Trade (INTA) to report on this, and as I said, the full report on what has been discussed in all areas here has been online since this morning – you can read it. What we are asking the Council for is two mandates: one on conformity assessment and one on industrial goods. It is industrial goods, all industrial goods including the car sector and fisheries, that are included here. It is common in the WTO context that you include fisheries and industrial goods together, and it makes for a WTO-compliant agreement. This is all and there is nothing else; there’s nothing hidden. This is what we propose. Nothing more, nothing less. This is not a free trade negotiation that we are proposing. A full FTA would, of course, include everything that you have mentioned – difficult issues for the US on public procurement, on geographical indications, on maritime services – difficult issues for us on agriculture, and a few other things. These things are not included. And furthermore, we would, of course, have urged our partner to be a signatory to the Paris Agreement. But this is not a free trade agreement. It’s very limited, albeit beneficial for us and for them. We’re talking about billions of euros from both sides if we were to eliminate tariffs on this. That is why the mandate is short, because this is what it is: nothing else. It is also clear that this agreement cannot be concluded unless there is a solution to the steel and aluminium issue. The tariffs have to be gone, as was said here, and it would not go ahead if the US imposed other tariffs, as is being discussed right now. So this is also clear and it is also reflected in the mandate. That was not funny, that is very serious.

First of all, I’m very thankful to the colleagues who have been working very swiftly to get this regulation through. It sets new standards and simplifies the administrative procedures connected to the running of the .eu domain name. In line with the objectives of the digital single market strategy, this regulation will do its part in further strengthening the EU as a digital market by providing a digital EU platform for companies and cities, for example, and especially encourage EU citizens, regardless of their country of residence, to obtain a .eu domain name. With this regulation we ensure that we can keep up with the rapid evaluation of the top—level domain name market and the dynamics of the digital landscape that require a future—proof and flexible regulatory environment.  The existence of a specific domain name for the EU is very important for the EU online identity. The .eu domain name provides an opportunity for institutions, companies and citizens to have the possibility to access a .eu TLD. They will therefore be easily identified as part of the EU community, sharing the same set of values and standards.  In Parliament we accepted the structure as proposed by the Commission but wanted to provide for additional safeguards, such as for the respect of users’ privacy and security, consumer protection and human rights. I am especially glad that we could strengthen the text on safeguarding human rights and the rule of law. Parliament also wanted to have better control on the establishment of the criteria and the procedure for the designation of the registry by using delegated acts. I am glad that during the negotiations we were able to secure this.  The Commission proposed to delete the limitation that the registry can only be a ‘not for profit’ organisation, and Parliament endorsed this. However, this was a strong and important point, pushed by the Member States. What we could secure is that the Commission should do a specific review on this point and if needed propose changes.  I’m also glad that we could manage to push for action to secure EU agencies, such as EUIPO, playing a bigger part in preventing cyber—squatting and simplifying administrative procedures. Once again, this is a regulation where the EP has made a difference and secured important points and it would not have been possible if not everyone involved – staff and Members – had been so committed to the task.

The Commission fully supports the agreement. This concludes what has been a very fast—track process since the adoption of the Commission proposal for a .eu regulation in April 2018. The political agreement of the co—legislators strengthens the regulation on a number of important points. In particular it clarifies that the legal framework for the .eu top—level domain respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in particular the protection of personal data, the freedom of expression and information and the protection of consumers. It provides for additional safeguards against the abusive registration of .eu domain names, including an assessment of how the registry may operate as the European Union Intellectual Property Office in the future. It applies swiftly, six months after the entry into force of the new regulation, a new eligibility criterion, which will allow all EU citizens to register a .eu domain regardless of where they live, be it inside or outside the EU. Today the .eu domain is available to 500 million people and to businesses across the 28 countries of the European Union as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

This is a small but important piece of the puzzle in developing the digital single market.

However, the credibility and trustworthiness of the .eu domain can also be abused by those who seek to undermine the legitimacy of our democratic system through cyber—attacks, disinformation and domain squatting. This is happening all the time and at all levels. That’s why it’s important that we look upon our digital infrastructure as a critical infrastructure, which needs to be resilient towards outside pressure and attacks.

The dissemination of a safe but flexible area, aligned with European rules and accessible to citizens, is very important. But we have to dare go further. The strengthening of a network of access and sharing of services with unique authentication, as foreseen for example in the WIFI4EU initiative, opens a line of differentiation from the European approach to the digital society, making its economy more competitive, its knowledge centres more robust, its public services closer to citizens and its people more connected to the opportunities created by technological development. It underlines some structuring aspects of the assessment regulation: the management of the domain by a non-profit organisation is maintained, the European digital identity, its values and the internal market are promoted, citizens are allowed to register regardless of their place of residence, the registration of companies and companies located in the European Union and the European economic area is allowed, registration is allowed in all languages and alphabets , clear rules are created for the management of the domain by users and for the prevention of the inappropriate use of this resource.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her As rapporteur for the competition report, I can also report that Parliament has worked very constructively together, has pulled together in a very uniform manner. It is a pleasure to work on competition policy, in this Parliament, at this time, because the Commission takes very clear decisions, which are very comprehensible, are very well documented and, even if details are discussed, are supported and approved in Parliament. What was interesting about this competition report was that we discussed four areas more intensively: the general enforcement of competition law, digital developments, environmental developments and finance, the banking industry. It turns out that, although competition law is a sharp and functioning weapon, a sharp and functioning instrument, we need to think further in the future, especially in the digital sector. There was also a great deal of agreement among the shadow rapporteurs that we need to develop here. Digital companies, which hardly demand sales from end customers, offer services for free and then sell advertising that try to build market power over the years without making a profit, cannot be judged on traditional competitive conditions, not on sales, not on profits, not just financial figures. You have to respond to the market power of such companies in a very different way and adapt to it differently. This is where we need to develop. In the digital sphere in particular, we must also consider whether we are either developing competition law or developing something similar when it comes to protecting democracy. If we have a well-functioning instrument to protect the market from too much power from companies, then democracy should also be worth it in principle. You will understand when I say, as a Green, that the environment must also be worth it: externalities which are not to be accounted for in price, not in the pure market behaviour of companies and which must be examined under current competition law. We should at least think about developing these instruments. As I said, in this report we are dealing with the work of the Commission and not yet with the task of developing it, but I have heard a willingness across all the groups here to continue to work on this issue and to develop it further in the future.

Mr Reimon, I will be happy to give my colleague, Margrethe Vestager, your positive message and your positive assessment of the cooperation with her. The report shows why competition is at the heart of politics and will be part of the debate in the upcoming European elections. We all buy in the marketplace every day. We want to be confident that companies are giving us a fair deal, and if we are in business we want our factories to grow, not to be squeezed out by a dominant player or by a rival getting unfair subsidies. By keeping markets open we give everybody a fair shot at success. That goes to the heart of our democracy. At the Commission, we will continue to do our part to ensure that every business pays its fair share of tax. For us, the state aid rules are clear. EU countries cannot give some companies a selective tax advantage that others don’t get under the normal rules. The Commission has taken eight decisions on selective tax benefits for multinationals. The decisions have ordered the recovery of more than EUR 15 billion in unpaid taxes from more than 40 companies, most of which are European.

In parallel, the EU and its Member States need to continue their efforts to reform their corporate taxation framework to make it both fairer and more efficient. Only better taxation rules will close loopholes that are available to everyone. The Commission is also reflecting on our digital future. This month in Brussels, Commissioner Vestager hosted a conference with leading experts on technology and competition. They discussed our digital world and what it means for competition. In the conference, as in the more-than 100 written contributions the Commission has received, some issues kept coming up: access to data; threats to competition when big businesses buy innovative start-ups and dodge the disruption they once caused to others; and the possibility for platform businesses that are also users of their own platform to deny rivals a chance to compete. The Commission will reflect deeply on all these issues because if competition fails, if prices go up and quality falls, we lose that fundamental promise of our digital world that tomorrow’s technology will be better than today’s. Your report makes the important point that markets should also deliver for our environment. We agree and the Commission’s decision to approve the Bayer—Monsanto merger was taken only after the companies committed to sell Bayer’s seed and pesticide business to a new rival so that farmers keep a choice of supplier, and competition drives the businesses to deliver novel products that are safer for the environment. Within the boundaries of the Treaty, we will make markets work for our climate and for our environment. As this Parliament says, openness and fair competition benefit our entire industry. We need European champions, but we need the right ones. When companies compete, and are crowned champions because customers choose them to win, that benefits not just consumers but also other businesses – small and medium enterprises, which are the backbone of our economy, and large companies alike. For every company that wants to see a merger there are many European industries that buy their inputs, such as steel or cement. European business customers rely on open competition so that they can get a fair deal, and also so that they can grow on global markets.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 192, "date": "2019-01-30.json", "name": "President. –", "mepid": "28115", "text": "  Thank you, Commissioner.

Firstly, companies with new technologies, including the digital sector, and competition, often unfair competition, outside the European Union. I am referring, for example, to the takeover of European companies by foreign companies, especially dangerous ones in sectors important for public security. Secondly, the question of transport. We are increasingly seeing more and more efforts to distort competition, not only from the company versus the company, but also from the Member States that restrict this competition. Thirdly, the issue of small and medium-sized enterprises. Unfortunately, bureaucracy continues to distort competition between small and medium-sized companies and large companies.

Competition policy is very much at the core of the European Union – not because the European Union is about competition but because we are open to new ideas, innovations, new alternatives, new products, new services and new entrants. Competition policy means allowing consumers to be the masters of the market and that means we will ensure not only that no one can abuse market dominance but also that we can always have new entrants in all sorts of markets; not only maintaining pressure on prices but also ensuring we have dynamic development of our economy. That’s why we need legal certainty and the rule of law, and that’s why my political group and I are sceptical about naming and shaming from this Parliament, or politicising how the Commission implements the competition rules.  We must have the rule of law and fair competition, and that also means we need to consider the energy union and big, dominant operators such as Gazprom.

The annual report on competition policy 2107 has been enriched with a number of forward-looking elements in the inter-parliamentary discussions between the Commission. For this reason, I would like to express my sincere congratulations to all my colleagues and officials involved in the preparation of this report. It is gratifying that this report also focuses on issues that significantly improve the quality of life of citizens, and let me give an example of some, such as the very serious emphasis and the increasing urgency of caring about accelerating the need for energy supply and decarbonisation in Europe. That's what happens in that report. The case of the elimination of geoblocking is also given due prominence in investigations. Data protection and transparency issues are also a very important part of this report. And what I am very pleased about personally is that there is also a very strong emphasis on issues relating to making the digital economy consumer-friendly. But obviously, a competition policy report cannot be idle if it is a question of value analysis from other economic areas. Thus, to contribute to taxation and, above all, to the principle that taxation must be carried out by making value creation a reality. Moreover, there are also plenty of challenges within the EU, such as issues relating to the ethic of calls between countries within the European Union in the field of telecommunications, which are the same as local calls. In the same way, the competition report still abounds with the spread of the fifth generation and the guarantee of free bank current accounts.

The rapporteur did not have a problem in identifying specific US companies, but when it comes to European tax pathologies, it is sufficient to say here that some governments, jurisdictions – luxembourg, the Netherlands or Ireland, for example – had a kind of special immunity in this matter. Similarly, in terms of energy competitiveness.

All discussions on competition policy in europe will at least be about three different poles: firstly, preserving europe's global competition against strong forces outside, secondly, preserving competition within its borders and, thirdly, ensuring that businesses pay their taxes and, firstly, creating a reasonably equal level for both small and large companies.  Getting these three different aspects to always go together is not always a very easy operation. When we preserve europe's competitiveness against global adversaries or global competitors, it can sometimes be at the expense of small businesses and the ability of national companies to cope. If we try to keep small businesses out in the national Member States, we may at the same time be a little hindering our international competitiveness. This is therefore not always in balance, and when it is at the same time in a technological development that is breathtaking, we may face major challenges. During the discussions with the rapporteur and the other shadow rapporteurs, we have been particularly pleased with the effort made by Commissioner Vestager in this area. She has shown that women in a responsible position in the European Union are capable of things that men cannot always do. I would also like to thank Mr Reimon for his good cooperation.

We defend public intervention in the form of aid as an instrument to be put at the service of majority and should not be seen as a problem, but as a solution. Unfortunately, competition policy does not.  It is therefore paradoxical that public aid is given to the financial sector, which is primarily responsible for the crisis and which nevertheless appear to be outside the sanctioning capacity of competition policy, especially when these banking aid has served as an excuse for cuts precisely in the public sector.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has done Unlike previous reports, this report on competition policy has a very special focus on two areas, namely digitisation and harmful tax practices – and for good reason, in my view.  Digital and Internet companies in particular are facing completely new challenges in competition policy. Not only because technological development is progressing rapidly, but because the definition of new criteria and competence thresholds is necessary. And this is what the report points out: on the one hand, it is the amount of data as an indicator of the existence of market power and the proposal not to fix the thresholds of competence for triggering EU merger control on turnover. I believe that both are very sensible proposals.  With regard to tax policy, the report calls for greater harmonisation of corporate taxation, including a common consolidated corporate tax base. More transparency and simple rules are good, but fiscal policy should remain separate from competition policy. Competition policy is not a suitable instrument for harmonising fiscal policy.  With regard to this aspect, which is mentioned in the report, I would also like to mention the following: in the planned merger of the train divisions of Siemens and Alstom into the second largest train manufacturer in the world, the Commissioner has endorsed the rapporteur's critical attitude. A decision is due by February 18. I hope that there will still be an opinion on the Commissioner.

Gunnar Hökmark has already said the essentials from the point of view of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. That is why I would like to add to a point that Mrs Kappel has just mentioned at the end. I believe that enough has been said about digital companies and how competition law should be applied there, and has already been applied in part by the Commission.  In the area of fiscal policy, I think that the Commission has done an excellent job of simuging the inconsistency of the behaviour of the Member States. However, the key issue we are faced with in competition law and, above all, in the area of merger control, is how we include the larger, the large economic regions of the world with the existing market structures there in our decision-making. I am not deliberately mentioning any countries now, because it is leading the debate on the wrong track. In the long term, however, it is dangerous, of course, if we try to enforce competition rules that are strict, which may actually bring together all the relevant criteria on a case-by-case basis, but then large players in the world do not care about these rules at all and simply ignore them. This makes no sense to us as Europeans in the long term.  I believe that we need a new idea for the coming years of how we can use not only the customer markets in the European Union to assess market concentration, but also the subcontracting markets, which are often located in the Far East and which present us with difficulties that we do not manage today.

We want the European budget, with its limited resources, to be able to reach its full potential and for all the money, projects we want, programmes that we need, to be able to serve the promotion of the economy, society and our fellow citizens.

It covers most of the important aspects, it also criticises the Commission, including OLAF, where this is justifiable or even necessary, but it also highlights many of the activities of the Commission and our services in a positive way. Thank you very much for this fair evaluation of our work. Parliament and the Commission have jointly made considerable efforts in the fight against fraud in recent years, and we have made progress. Last year, we presented our multiannual financial framework, where the implementing rules also make it more difficult or impossible to make fraud, corruption and infidelity impossible. And we have incorporated a proposal for a new anti-fraud programme into this budgetary framework. If the rule of law in the Member States is threatened and there are deficits and can increase, thereby increasing the risk of harming the European Union's financial interests, we must take action against it. Our proposal on conditionality and the possibility of cutting or cutting budgetary resources when the rule of law is no longer fully respected was accepted by A European Parliament a few days ago in Strasbourg by a large majority. Thank you very much for this support on the way to a consultation and adoption between the Council and Parliament. 2018 was a year of intensive work to establish the European Public Prosecutor's Office – a joint effort by my colleague, Mr Jourova, who was just sitting here, and by myself, by your services and by OLAF. We have now appointed an interim administrative director. It has the power to implement the budget and to recruit staff so that the European Public Prosecutor's Office can start operating at the end of 2020.

As part of your efforts to improve the European Union's response to fraud, we have also presented the proposal to amend the OLAF regulation to you and to the Council. In this way, we want, above all, to ensure close cooperation between OLAF and the European Public Prosecutor's Office and the effectiveness of OLAF investigations. This reform should, if possible, be taken forward in the coming weeks. OLAF and the European Public Prosecutor's Office will cooperate closely within their own competences. We must ensure full complementarity in the overall response to illegal acts to the detriment of European finances, fill all the gaps, avoid duplication of effort and optimise cooperation. This is a common objective of ours – Parliament and the Commission – and Mr Marinescu's report underlines this, and OLAF and the strengthening of OLAF's powers in a number of important areas are also highlighted. Indeed, EPPO is a partner of OLAF, but EPO must not weaken OLAF, but OLAF must move more into the future from this joint work. This Commission proposal is on your table, and I am counting on your support so that this dossier gets the attention it deserves. It is important to have the adoption process as rapid as possible so that THE start of EPPO at the end of 2020, before that the modernisation of the rules and the reorganisation of competences between OLAF and EPPO in the European code, takes place. I would like to thank Mrs Gräßle, who, as chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control, presented a comprehensive report yesterday, which was based on the Commission proposal to amend OLAF Regulation. It is very comprehensive and ambitious. I believe that Mrs Gräßle's report must be incorporated in two stages in Parliament and the Council. Stage one: the small reform to rebalance OLAF and EPPO. Stage two: in the new mandate of Parliament and the Commission, a major reform of OLAF so that Mrs Gräßle's ideas can be taken into account at the latest. I would like to warn against one thing: if we approach too ambitiously, I think a decision is possible in Parliament, but not in the Council. And nothing would be worse than to approach this year with great ambition and then to have nothing at all next year and to see unresolved competences between OLAF and EPPO in the operational business at the launch of EPPO. We should avoid this. A final point that was and is important to Parliament: illicit tobacco trafficking. Here, too, I can report significant progress. The new anti-cigarette smuggling treaty, the so-called FCTC protocol, came into force in September last year. It has been ratified by the European Union and now by 47 countries. The European Union has always been at the forefront of this, and our joint efforts are now paying off. Thank you very much for your expectations and support. In December last year, a few weeks ago, we adopted a new action plan to combat the illegal trade in tobacco. It builds on the old but good strategy of 2013 and on the analytical progress report presented two years ago. All these are activities and proof of continued commitment to the fight against fraud. I am pleased that Parliament is fully uptosining its task of monitoring and controlling us, criticising us and supporting us. This is also shown by the Marinescu report.

I think I could dissect the individual points, but unfortunately I do not have 8 min like you, I only have 1.5 minutes, so I will focus only on the last point, and that is the point of cigarette smuggling. I returned to this again 4 and 3 years ago, this was the topic of smuggling cigarettes from Belarus towards Poland. There, the Commission took some steps in conjunction with the Polish Government and the problem began to be addressed. But where this problem has not been addressed at all is France. Every day, a boat with smuggled cigarettes arrives in Marseille from Algeria. I have repeatedly pointed this out, even published my article in Le Monde, where I actually say how the process is going. Europol has repeatedly pointed this out here, OLAF has repeatedly pointed this out, but France rejects any greater cooperation with OLAF. Here is the question for you, Commissioner: Isn't it time not just to pay attention to the Member States of Central and Eastern Europe and to systematically start paying attention to France? Isn't it time to force France to really stop underestimating the trade in illegal tobacco and cigarettes?

This measure, which may seem apparelful, is nevertheless also a measure to combat fraud, although unfortunately there are some countries where it still resists.  I welcome the fact that this report for 2017 also shows that the number of cases of fraud has been reduced, thanks to work between all – OLAF and all systems, both at national and European level – by more than 20% compared to 2016. We have also managed to save a very large amount of millions of euros; However, in the case of the VAT gap we still have a lot of work to do. I must also take into account that my country, Spain, is noted for being above average in 2017 – almost double the average – in relation to fraudulent and non-fraudulent irregularities; but the truth is that there are still elements of improvement and the objective of the current Government is precisely the direct fight against fraud.  I am also pleased that in the agricultural area — when farmers are so often denigrated - complaints and fraudulent situation have been reduced by almost half in the field of rural development, but we have problems related to direct support again, and I hope that Mr Hogan and the new CAP reform will also take these problems into account. We welcome in a very special way the current efforts to parallel and without duplicates the OLAF Regulation with the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's Office, to whom we give a pre-eminent role in this fight against fraud.

Furthermore, under the guise of combating fraud and protecting the interests of the Union, there is support for the Commission's controversial proposal to link the Union budget to the rule of law in the Member States.

The picture is very mixed, although we have adopted the PIF Regulation, including VAT within its scope, we have adopted the provisions for the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) and we have started reform of the VAT system in the EU. But the EPPO will include countries only on a voluntary basis; the Commission has abolished the bi—annual Anti—Corruption Report; the EU is still not a cooperating member of the Group of States against Corruption (GRECO).

It is clear what we need right now. We need the Commission and the Council to be firm on corruption.

However, despite the positive trend that has been going on since 2014, it is clear that the level of fraud in EU funds still remains very high – we have heard this: almost three billion euros in 2017 – just as corruption cases remain high.  Much remains to be done: several Member States, for example, do not yet have specific laws against organised crime, even though the participation of criminal groups in cross-border fraud against the Union's financial interests, such as cigarette smuggling, currency counterfeiting or carousel fraud, is constantly increasing. Furthermore, despite the recent adoption of important legislative measures, such as the PIF directive or the Regulation on the European Public Prosecutor's Office, I believe that not enough has been done in terms of preventing corruption or in recovering funds that have been the subject of fraud.  It is precisely for this reason that the Commission's decision not to publish any more specific reports on corruption continues to give cause for concern. It is true that this issue is included in the Governance Document of the European Semester, a document which, however, only considers the economic impact caused by corruption, leaving aside its negative effects in terms of civil coexistence and public confidence in public administration.

Also, this necessary administrative and financial burden must not fall on the backs of SMEs, which could be an unbearable burden.

And the fact that fraud appears to be decreasing by up to 20% and in the amounts let down cannot be related—right?—to the fact that detection or investigation is failing. Because the European Public Prosecutor's Office is still six states short. Some of them have historically been characterized by their opt-out of European criminal law and the area of freedom, security and justice. But there are two who distinguish themselves by having the highest levels of fraud and corruption in the management of European funds.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. I would like to address key issues, but I would also like to thank you for the expertise you have shown and for the commitment you are putting forward here, together with the Commission. This supports and strengthens us very much.  The case was mentioned in which illegal tobacco imports, cigarettes, reach Europe, namely the port of Marseille. Indeed, it must be clear that corruption, fraud, infidelity, illegal trade is not an issue for some Member States. It is an issue for the whole of the European Union. In some Member States this is more, in others less, but no Member State, no region is free of it. There is no East-West divide, no south-north divide, and OLAF, with its officials and expertise, is investigating this French case, this presumption that a ship from the Maghreb reaches Europe via Marseille every day. We will inform you about the progress.  Secondly, the so-called VAT fraud, VAT fraud: the current OLAF regulation is not entirely clear in its text. Are revenue from VAT own resources? Are they and the control of OLAF's competence, or is it not? Some Member States dispute this. The country in which I was at home also denies this, which is why, by amending the OLAF regulation, we want to clarify exactly this, thereby removing any legal uncertainty. The lower limit of EUR 10 million will also no longer exist. We want OLAF to have or have full competence to investigate abuses and frauds on the important VAT revenues, at least whatever the legal situation may have been, that it will be indisputable in the future. Several colleagues have raised the question of why the Commission is no longer presenting an anti-corruption report: this is true. We are no longer presenting it as our own report. Why? The fight against corruption is important to us. It is a feature of our assessment of policy and conditions in the Member States. That is why we have integrated this anti-corruption report into the guidelines of the European Semester in a separate chapter. The European Semester is our general ledger to define the situation of the Member States on strengths and weaknesses, criticism. There you will find our assessment on the freedom of corruption, the fight against corruption in the Member States, and we can also go through our country specific recommendations, sanctions are also legally possible on the basis of legal.  When it has been said that there is a lack of a written strategy to combat fraud in many Member States, in many Member States, this too is true. Unfortunately, there is no legal obligation for the Member States to present an anti-fraud strategy. Some do this, others don't. We encourage all Member States. We are pushing them, but without a legal instrument. We also advise them. We are sure that more and more Member States are presenting an anti-fraud strategy for their work and as a template for European work, also in their own interests. Best practice is added as motivation.  A final speech has deplored the fact that only 22 Member States are involved in the European Public Prosecutor's Office, for which my colleague Mr Jourova, who has returned for the next item, and myself, are responsible for the drafting and now implementation. In fact, there are six – or soon five – missing, but when we presented our draft law for EPPO to Parliament and the Council, the enthusiasm was much less: we started with 14, 15 Member States, and that the path from 14, 15 to 22 before THE start of EPPO's work and EPPO will not start work until next year. , actually makes me rather confident. 22 of 28 - or 27 - is very, very much. In the coming months and years, we will do everything we can to ensure that, in the end, the European Public Prosecutor's Office is responsible for all countries and for all criminal proceedings in the event of corruption, infidelity and fraud in the European budget. In this respect, an important step, a good start, not yet the result. But I believe that in the next few years we will move from 22 to the target that you too expect.

It is clear that the detection of fraud and the recovery of fraudulent money, both of these activities are extremely important and must strengthen and continue if fraud decreases to 0.1% of the budget. For this - just as OLAF said - the European Public Prosecutor must be given very clear responsibilities and tasks, to work together, to have a divergent activity, and OLAF must also be able to take the necessary levers to act on this. The European budget is an investment budget, investment brings growth and it is very important that this budget is spent properly, but it brings a lot of results. That is why I think it is very important, at the same time, to spend the money and spend it in the right direction. I believe that we should find some levers, so that at Commission level they simply require the Member States to use everything that means digitally, electronically, so that the contact between those who check and those who decide what happens to European funds and those who benefit from the funds, who submit tenders, is as small as possible and , at the same time, the control is very simple, very easy to do and the evaluation is just as well done.

This is fraud against the Eu ropean Union budget, just as fraud in the single budget is the fraud perpetrated with regard to European funds. But the case studies are much wider.

The figures that emerged are ambiguous at first reading as, compared with an 18.7 % decrease in the number of fraudulent irregularities in 2017, there is, however, a 19.4 % increase in the financial impact compared to 2016. In other words, this means that irregularities, fraudulent and not, actually decreased in 2017 as a number, but are actually increased as a total value, as individual cases can involve large sums of money. This makes the number of irregularities reported a partial indicator, as it is only indicative of the amount of irregularities and not of their financial impact.

In doing so, it is not clearly established whether the decrease in fraudulent irregularities is actual or is based on shortcomings in the investigation of that activity. Fraud prevention and effective detection must therefore become an obvious part of all policies, together with effective cooperation with Member States. Preventing fraud can be the publication and punishment of detected fraud. Fraud, together with corruption, their insufficient and lengthy detection and investigation are detrimental to the financial interests of the Union. At the same time, they increase the distrust of the population towards the authorities and institutions of both the Union and the Member States. Compromised trust in the rule of law and democracy allows extremist forces to grow, which are increasingly using the themes of fraud and corruption to their advantage.

May I begin by recalling our common objective to promote Roma inclusion at European Union level. This is an objective commonly agreed and which sets the basis for launching a broad and sustained push for action at European level.  Eight years ago the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council joined forces to set up the EU framework for national Roma integration strategies. We did this in order to act, to prevent and discourage any discriminatory action towards this group of vulnerable persons. We are all aware of the difficulties and challenges faced by Roma citizens in our societies nowadays. From this perspective, we need to ensure the required instruments for properly addressing them. It will take determined efforts by a whole range of stakeholders to see concrete results on the ground within Roma communities and in our societies. It is indeed a challenge that would not be solved overnight but that requires a continuous political will and support from all Member States and European institutions. It is precisely for this reason that the Council, the Commission and the Parliament agreed on the need for a strategic approach. A sustained strategy is the only way to heal long—neglected communities, to stamp out discrimination and to bring real opportunities to all, including the poorest. In pursuing this vision, we are guided by our common European values and we are supported by the vigorous actions of the Commission. And it fits perfectly with the political priorities that will guide the Romanian Presidency of the Council of the EU which runs under the motto ‘Cohesion: a common European value’. Let me thank the European Parliament for taking up this important subject on the EU agenda. In the turbulent times we live in today, a great many social challenges require our attention. Against the loud shouts of populism it is not easy to speak up for the voiceless and the unpopular. Yet we must speak. Social policy should not be at the mercy of headlines, trends and electioneering. Social regeneration takes time. Deeply—rooted disadvantages cannot be wished away in an instant. The list of challenges that we have sought to address in our common strategic framework spans the whole range of fundamental social needs: employment; housing; health; and education. These four things are the building blocks of a decent life. The deprivation faced by this community is so comprehensive that it seems to defy description. And yet it can be summed up in one word: poverty.  According to the EU Fundamental Rights Agency, the overwhelming majority of Roma, some 80%, live in poverty, but Roma are also one of the groups at greatest risk of discrimination, and these two facts –, poverty and discrimination – are interlinked.  We already have legislation in Europe that outlaws racist discrimination, but as everyone knows legislation is not enough. Rules must be implemented in practice and attitudes must change. I therefore thank the European Parliament for insisting on this aspect, for leading the call for more action to stamp out racism and discrimination and hate speech. The Council has also highlighted this issue, recognising anti—Gypsyism as a root cause of the social exclusion and discrimination suffered by Roma.  In this context I am pleased to announce that the Romanian Presidency will be hosting a high—level conference on the EU framework for national Roma integration strategies in Bucharest on March 4 and 5. We look forward to welcoming representatives of the Parliament, Member States, civil society and Roma organisations at this event.  The Commission has recently evaluated the effectiveness of our efforts under our shared strategic framework. Our conference will give Member States and other stakeholders the opportunity to reflect on the results of this evaluation and on the best way forward.  To highlight just one topic in its evaluation report, the Commission notes that education is the field in which most progress has been seen. More Roma are now benefiting from schooling. This is encouraging. However, I am sure we all agree that progress has been slow and must be stepped up in all four key areas: education; employment; housing; and health. The added value of cooperation at EU level is very clear. The Council has already called on the Commission to propose a post-2020 strategy. Therefore, let us here today renew our commitment to end marginalisation and exclusion. Together we can make a brighter future for Roma and a better society for all citizens.

It has confirmed that the four priority areas – employment, education, health and housing – continue to be key to Roma inclusion. At the same time, anti-Gypsyism has increasingly been recognised as a root cause of Roma exclusion. The evaluation found that a specific non-discrimination goal and a stronger focus on the suppression of anti-Gypsyism would make the framework stronger. The report notes that the framework achieved positive EU added value by putting Roma inclusion on the EU and national agendas. It facilitated the development of new structures and increased consistency between the EU policy, legal and funding instruments that have been mobilised and aligned in pursuit of Roma inclusion. These include the European Semester, the Racial Equality Directive and the European structural and investment funds. The framework provided flexibility for Member States to adapt their objectives to specific national contexts. The evaluation found that this tailored approach also contributed to fragmented implementation, reduced effectiveness and limited progress towards EU-Roma integration goals. The framework, however, had limited capacity to deal with diversity among Roma. It did not pay sufficient attention to targeting specific groups such as Roma women, youth, children as well as EU-mobile Roma. The evaluation showed that the EU framework is the beginning of a process which, despite many limitations and taking into account the massive task involved, has demonstrated some positive results and an initial change in trends, education, especially, being the area that has seen most progress. It also shows that continued commitment is still needed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 234, "date": "2019-01-30.json", "name": "Lívia Járóka", "mepid": "28141", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank you for your support. I warmly and warmly welcome the Council and I am very pleased that you have taken such a courageous step. We thank Romania, and I think it is very important that they participate in this new three-phase Roma strategy period. We are talking about three periods here, the first period of the European Presidency is now the Romanians, who we expect the existing financial resources to be better used by the Member States. Therefore, let us sign with them in the Partnership Agreements specific, clear, paper-invested figures, for example, in terms of job creation, I think roma unemployment could be reduced by 5% per country. We have now succeeded in Hungary. Similarly, very good results can be achieved in other fields and in education, housing, employment and health care. In 2010, when the European Parliament first produced a serious report on this, we already had seven points that we would have thought very important to be taken over by the Commission and the Council. And we believe that, since those points have not been taken from parliament's report, the Roma strategy is not fully functioning now. Therefore, what we would like to propose in our report tomorrow and in the LIBE five-party report for February plenary are the following points that we would like to put back in the document for the next planning period. What we want the Finnish Presidency to do is think seriously about whether, in the case of a European poverty of 120 million People, the 16 million Romanians could extend the issue from the point of view of economic integration to other poor groups in Europe. And then we would like the Croatian Presidency, in the context of the European Roma strategy, to be able to turn on the poor in the Balkans, so that if we join in 2025, there should not be so much consternation about how poor these Roma and poor people in the Balkans are. In these settlements, only a third of the poor are Gypsies. Today, only 16 million out of 120 million in Europe. Five years ago or seven years ago, that was 43 million. While poverty is rising in Europe, it is decreasing in one or two Eastern European countries. That's why I'm asking you to consider the following things. My first point would be to have clear targets in signed partnership agreements and for countries to meet them. This, of course, requires some kind of legal basis to penalise those who do not understand that the demographic surge is causing future generations of labour to be born in Europe in the poorest settlements. So this is not a humanitarian issue, but a very strong economic and development issue for the European Union. It is five times cheaper to integrate the poorest than not to integrate them, but to pay social assistance. So thank you very much, your decision is very, very important, and the European Parliament is in favour of the Romanian Presidency in everything, so that we can put a very serious document on the table. We had a strong document a year and a half ago, Soraya Post wrote, and it really does address issues that the \"race directive\" could make a difference to anti-Gypsyism.

We want to end the unacceptable apartheid that so many Roma live under in our otherwise emancipated societies. But in order to achieve this, we need to continue the EU framework after 2020, and we need to do it in an approved format. We need to have a strategic EU framework, with a wider set of priority areas, clear targets, timelines and indicators for monitoring. Following the 12 pages of demands and recommendations in my anti—Gypsyism report, the fight against anti—Gypsies has to be horizontal and Roma participation has to be safeguarded from the very start of the process. For that, we also need to work on trust building through a true recognition and reconciliation process. This is crucial. We have to mix the communities and we have to create trust.

In future, we in the European Parliament must also commemorate the Gypsies on this day of liberation.  Anticyganism is still part of European society. This racism is the reason why Roma are still discriminated against to this day. In Hungary in particular, under the fidesz regime, which feels well taken into account by the Conservative and EPP Groups, Roma are still racially discriminated against. In the fight against anticyganism, a change of perspective must take place. We need an inclusion strategy.

To this day, the widespread and systematic discrimination faced by Roma people is one of Europe’s greatest shames. The social issues faced by Roma and Sinti people, such as unemployment, poor access to education, health and housing, come from a particular form of racism called anti-Gypsyism – essentially this is a human rights issue. It’s time to stop ignoring the problem and focus all our efforts into combating discrimination and stigma, taking positive measures to support and uplift our Roma siblings. It’s also necessary to tackle multiple discrimination that many face, such as Roma women, who are marginalised because of their ethnicity and also because of their gender.

It was a touching moment: we saw the pictures drawn by children from the ghetto of Terezin, which is in my country, and the records of the children’s lives ending with the number 1944. It is always shocking when we see these things and when we hear survivors, the direct witnesses.  One would like to say ‘This happened 75 years ago.’ We heard from Dr Knobloch, who spent her childhood hidden in the cellar – her way of surviving the Holocaust. We heard from her the list of people who were Holocaust victims and inhabitants of concentration camps – Jews, Roma people, LGBT people, people belonging to other minorities, handicapped people, people with some kind of ‘otherness’. And I realised that, yes, this was more than 70 years ago, but it brought me back to the immediate present. Honourable Members, next week I will get from the big IT companies, starting with Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and others, the data they acquired through the exercise that we call the Code of Conduct, through which we want them to delete hate speech from their online sphere and from social media. I call this data – which I can identify to specific Member States – either a ‘map of hatred’ or a ‘map of evil’. I have already seen the previous data – I will see the fresh data next week – and it’s shocking. We have obtained again the same list of groups of people who are affected by hatred, by verbal violence which could have the potential to spill over into real violence in the real world. Today we have some additional groups – refugees, people with political opinions, in some Member States we have judges, everywhere we have journalists – who are the targets of the hatred that has occupied this space, this easy, comfortable space, in the online world. One thing is really worrying. When we look at the sources of this hatred, at who the authors of this production of dirt are, we are not talking about extremists. We are not talking about the members of some semi-prohibited parties or some strange communities. We are talking about Europeans –honest Europeans. When such cases come to court, when some of the people who send these hate messages – which are covered by criminal law – try to defend their actions, they say ‘We were not aware of the responsibility, we are honest people.’ And there are honest people there, with good jobs and a good education. So, we have a problem in Europe and we will have to find the right way to address it. As the Minister said before, and many of you repeated it, we have to speak out. It already requires a lot of courage to speak, but now there is a further task out there. Some years ago, defending fundamental rights and anti-discrimination might have been termed ‘business as usual’. But now it requires real political will and political courage to speak in defence of minorities, including Roma – to speak against the anti-Gypsyism which is clearly seen in online spheres.  There is a lot to be done and I very much appreciate the Romanian Presidency for organising this high-level conference. I would say ‘the more such events the better’, but we have to be careful that it is not a matter of the same people always speaking to the same audience. We have to be careful that everything we say at such conferences will reflect in real life. And that reflection, I have to say, must happen at a local level. Our task is to create the right conditions for local politicians, local organisations and the Roma people themselves, because our policy will never be successful if it is ‘for Roma, about Roma, but without Roma’. We have to create the right conditions and we have to keep repeating that we mean it seriously. This is a problem we have to solve.  I know I have spoken for a long time, so I will add just a last few comments regarding the possible future strategy, which I am committed to preparing for my successor in this position. There will be a lot of proposals repeated from the current strategy: the things which are inevitable, the things which we have to continue doing to improve the situation in education, housing, and the world of work, which has not improved over the past few years of growth. I don’t understand why, still, we have a high unemployment rate among Roma people in a situation in which we have workforce needs in all the Member States. We need to improve too, by traditional methods, the situation in health.  However, as I see it, we now have to add two big new things. We need to do much better on explaining how to use public money, something about which Ms Járóka spoke. We are doing something wrong here. A lot of money has been invested and the results are very limited. We have to be objective and reconsider the methods and the channels – how we distribute the money – and encourage more the people at local level to come forward for the money. We have to simplify the rules. I think that the first steps have been taken here, because in the Financial Regulation a lot of simplification has already been proposed.  The second thing: we have to reflect the digital revolution, because when you realise how difficult it is for many Europeans to keep up to speed with technological changes, and how easily a gulf could open if you do not help communities like the Roma to do this, we risk making a fatal mistake. We have to help children and young people, especially young Roma people, to go digital and not to lose this opportunity, because it is a fantastic opportunity. As I said, if we miss this moment it will be a horrible and fatal mistake. We will have to reflect on the new things. We will have to drop the things which do not work – which are only a waste of time and money – and we must do better, not just with talk but with action. I am ready to do this until the end of my term of office and I count on your support and the cooperation of this Parliament, because it has always been very encouraging.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 259, "date": "2019-01-30.json", "name": "Melania Ciot", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, thank you for this useful discussion.  In closing, I would like to stress three points. The first is purely economic. As we all know, the Roma community numbers some four to six million EU citizens. It is our largest ethnic minority. However, Europe’s Roma are not only a minority but also our fellow citizens, deserving of the same opportunities as everyone else. Exclusion is economically inefficient. Europe cannot afford to waste the potential of so many of its people. Promoting integration is both socially fair and economically sensible. Secondly, let us not forget that women and girls make up half of this enormous community and their situation is particularly difficult. Our policies should be gender sensitive. This is an issue that the Commission has highlighted in its recent evaluation report. The Council and Parliament have also acknowledged this aspect and I wish to reaffirm it here today. Thirdly, we must never forget the importance of involving the Roma themselves in our strategic efforts. Social change can never be effective from the top down. We must empower Roma communities and work together with Roma decision makers, including, of course, the esteemed colleagues who sit in this House. In 2019 it is unacceptable that anyone should be born into deep poverty and condemned to a life of rejection, hopelessness and discrimination. The deep poverty that continues to exist in our midst harms the social fabric, betrays our values and damages our common future. It will take time to put this matter right: more time, more effort and more commitment. That is why both the Council and the Parliament have called for the strategic efforts to be continued beyond 2020. We have already planted the seeds for a better future but we must plant more seeds and we must nurture the plants that are growing.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 260, "date": "2019-01-30.json", "name": "Przewodniczący. –", "mepid": "124891", "text": "  I close the debate.

Our main task was to look again at our rules, two years after the big rules revision that we adopted two years ago. Some things needed tidying up, some things hadn’t worked so well – there was the question of this new device of interpellations, which I think we adopted by accident in plenary, and which didn’t sit very well with some of the other aspects of the rules. We’ve tidied all that up. But there are three big issues that have caused some controversy.  The first is how to deal with the fact that Parliament lost the court case that Mr Korwin—Mikke brought against the European Parliament when he was censured and fined by the President for using quite violently inappropriate language. The Court ruled that the balance in our rules between the right of Members to express themselves and the protection of Parliament and the public from hate speech and defamatory speech was not quite right. So we have very carefully, with the help of our Legal Service, rewritten that rule so that the emphasis now is on the use of offensive language, not so much on the content but on the intent to offend. We have defined that very carefully and we’ve even got a reference to Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights so that it covers a wide number of ways in which people may well feel offended by hate speech. We think we have that balance right, and I hope all groups accept what we have done there.  The second interesting subject is that of transparency, where we’ve been quite modest but we’ve wanted to increase the transparency in our rules where Members are dealing with lobbyists. At one level, for all Members, we say that Members ‘should’ only meet lobbyists who are on the transparency register and they ‘should’ publish their meetings online. The word ‘should’ is different from ‘shall’. It is not an obligation. It is more a recommendation. But it is an important recommendation for Members. We go further, though, for rapporteurs, where we say that rapporteurs, shadows and committee chairs in dealing with a report ‘shall’ – in other words, they have to – publish a list of scheduled meetings that they have had with lobbyists and interest representatives. ‘Shall’ but it’s only scheduled meetings. If you happen to bump into somebody on a train or in the corridor, you don’t of course necessarily control that as a rapporteur, but when you have arranged a formal meeting, it should be reported and it should be transparent.  Remarkably, the PPE Group has, I understand, asked for a secret vote on transparency. You couldn’t make it up really. It does seem to me a bit bizarre. Perhaps it’s not too late for my PPE colleagues to reconsider.  The final issue difficult issue we’ve tried to grapple with is the question of fake groups – political groups that have no political affinity as required under our rules. We had this, you may remember – some people will remember – some 15 years ago when we had a technical group composed of a political party from the far right and one from the far left. They had no political affinity. They were creating a group simply to avail of the resources that you get from Parliament – staff, money, speaking time – to use that, but were not acting as a political group within our rules. That may be a situation that repeats itself after the elections. We should protect ourselves and have a mechanism for making sure that affinity – if there is a doubt about it and we are very careful in our wording there to say that Parliament normally need not evaluate political affinity – but if there is manifest evidence, then Parliament as a whole, by an absolute majority – that’s a high threshold as a safeguard – can decide that a group has not been properly constituted. I think that’s not unreasonable.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 263, "date": "2019-01-30.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the Commission welcomes the fact that, in line with the framework agreement between our institutions, the European Parliament has sought the opinion of the Commission on amendments to the Rules of Procedure which affect us. We have set out our opinion in the letters addressed by First Vice—President Timmermans to Ms Hübner on 9 October, ahead of the committee vote, and to President Tajani yesterday, ahead of the vote in plenary tomorrow. I will not repeat in detail now what you will all have seen in writing, but I will flag just a few points. We welcome several amendments, such as those on the transparency of intergroups, the abolition of minor interpellations, the improvements to public hearings and the ‘unfinished business’ rule as concerns citizens’ initiatives and the threshold for the verification procedure for citizens’ requests under the statute of European political parties. We remain concerned that some of the amendments on parliamentary questions could reduce the efficiency and quality of this important means of democratic accountability, in particular with regard to the removal of the limit on the number of questions and the introduction of very tight target deadlines for replies. With regard to the transparency—related amendments, the Commission looks at this issue from the angle of the negotiations on the draft interinstitutional agreement on a mandatory transparency register. The objective of the Commission’s proposal is to make the register de facto mandatory for interest representatives through a conditionality principle, requiring that decision makers in all three EU institutions meet only with lobbyists who are registered. Unfortunately, so far the European Parliament and the Council have put forward only voluntary approaches. Tomorrow you will consider the amendment that would provide that Members shall adopt the systematic practice of meeting only those interest representatives who have registered in the transparency register. The Commission would welcome such a move in the context of our negotiations on the interinstitutional agreement. By contrast, we are concerned about another amendment which would weaken the existing provision in the Rules of Procedure. Other amendments seek to increase the information published about meetings with lobbyists. The Commission would like to point out that they solely concern the publication of meetings and so fall short of applying the conditionality principle: not on the register, no meeting. The Commission will assess the consequences of the outcome of your vote tomorrow in preparation for the new political meeting on the proposal for an interinstitutional agreement, which we hope will take place in the margins of the February plenary session.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 264, "date": "2019-01-30.json", "name": "György Schöpflin", "mepid": "28135", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, there are two issues that I would like to touch on. First, the reform of the Rules of Procedure will give this Parliament a much stronger connection with the European Citizens’ Initiative – it has already been mentioned – so that whenever there is a successful initiative, Parliament will be in position to discuss it in plenary. Now this represents a major improvement in the process and will give initiatives much greater visibility. That, in turn, will enhance the relationship between citizens and the EU – something that is badly needed.  The other issue is evidently much more contested. How are political groups in this Parliament to be constituted? On paper, those who launch a group do so because they are linked by a political affinity; they have enough in common, politically, to act together. Hitherto, affinity has been taken on trust and mostly it has worked, but this the system can be gamed and it has been, by the EFDD, for example. Wholly divergent actors say they are linked and, thereby, they come to enjoy the rights and benefits of being a parliamentary group. Through that, they claim to represent the citizens, except as such divergent groups, they cannot and do not and that, of course, makes Parliament looks absurd – hence this reform, which is overdue.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which I would like to thank Richard Corbett and the working group most warmly for the immense work and balanced report that has been presented here. There have been far more radical proposals, but sensible compromises have been made here. Transparency is the mantra of this parliamentary term. We have promised that our work will become more public and comprehensible, and with the amendments to the Rules of Procedure we are doing our homework here in Parliament. In fact, Members have a free mandate, we cannot be forced not to meet anyone. So we are free to meet anyone who has a concern. But we also say that lobbyists must register, and that when we meet them, we will, if possible, communicate it to the public ourselves. We have now realised that this is not compulsory for Members. This required a law and not just the Rules of Procedure. But it is very much possible to ask officials here in Parliament to put their meetings with lobbyists online. That is precisely the point of this regulation now. I cannot understand why we should vote on it in secret – so, as Richard Corbett said, voting on transparency in a non-transparent manner is a piece of the madhouse here from the history of the European Parliament. This will also go into the annals, if it is so tomorrow. Then I want to talk about the formation of political groups in my time. I know that some of them are still intervening here. So a political group, as the name suggests, must have some kind of political affinity, otherwise it is not a political group. We cannot simply come and say that we are going to come together to reach the figure, then we will have all the advantages, but we will not meet together, we will not vote together, we will not have a common programme. This is not a political group – there is still so much to protest about – that is against the meaning, really also against the seriousness here in Parliament. I hope that tomorrow this will get a majority, because we could indeed run the risk of having more than one fake group here after the next election, which then does not make sense and does not promote the work.

Such a fundamental attack on the right of association has not yet been seen. The question is which way we go. When, for example, will the European Commission decide whether the electoral committee in elections is based on logical conclusions or not, because it does not like it? We are really going in a very dangerous direction. The fundamental rights on which the rule of law is based are called into question, and it is by the Authorities of the European Union who like to declassify them.

Time and again we see policy proposals being eroded by lobbyists. The committee has a good and balanced compromise proposal on lobbyism, which means that it should be done openly, not in secret. For example, if an energy politician only listens to the gas lobby, and never to the environmental movement, the voters should know. The proposal encourages politicians to listen to both sides, and the transparency of this proposal means that the playing field between those who have a lot of money and those who have good arguments is more even.

A chetichella revision: a debate as crucial as the one on the composition of the political groups that you have never raised either in the working group or in committee and which comes with three last-minute amendments from three Members of what I can now call the ancien régime, which put the decision on the survival of opposition back in the hands of the majority. The exact opposite of the profound meaning of the word democracy.  Tocqueville would have agreed with me: this is a tyranny of the majority.

There can be no censorship in Parliament, no European censorship, no other censorship. The groups are to confirm that they will pursue the objectives of the Treaties. And why? If citizens want to change the objectives of the Treaties, then Members have the right to do so.

I think we are making progress, too, on that other front you mentioned, on the work on the transparency register. This is, I hope, not incompatible with that, but rather complementary. However, there are certainly some misunderstandings. These issues were discussed at the committee stage – they have not suddenly come out of the blue. We had quite long discussions. And, Mr Sośnierz, we’re not saying that no groups can propose changes to the Treaty. Of course, they can propose changes to the Treaty. But mostly there seems to be a high level of support for most of the proposals in my report. The controversial one, it appears to me, is the secret vote, and I’m glad some PPE Group members are not going to support that. On this question of political groups, there is already a requirement in our rules – there always has been – that political groups have to have affinity, as they do in most national parliaments. We have already, on one occasion, dissolved a political group because it did not have political affinity. That case went to the Court. The Court ruled that Parliament was right to dissolve such a group. So it’s not unreasonable to check that this existing provision is actually applied properly and that we have a procedure for dealing with it. In those cases where there is serious doubt, we have to have the possibility of examination – where there is serious doubt and it warrants investigation. Creating a political group in the European Parliament is much easier than in national parliaments. You only need just over 3% of the membership. If you have that you have access to significant resources: you can effectively help yourself to taxpayers’ money. If you’re not really a political group – if you are a fake group set up just for that purpose – then it’s right that we defend the taxpayer against abuse. This Parliament gives equal rights to all its Members as individuals, but the right to create political groups in any Parliament is intended to facilitate the work of the Parliament, so that people can speak on behalf of large numbers of other Members, to improve the work of the Parliament – so that you, Mr President, have an easier time giving the floor to different people, and every view can be expressed in a coherent way.

It has been confirmed that the European Parliament, even with its politically diverse composition, can contribute to the defence of religious freedom in the world.

It is currently led by Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš, our colleague from the EPP faction. But how often do we, those sitting here, in the plenary committees and everywhere we talk about third-country nationals being involved in elections, fit into our processes in Europe, something putin, the Kremlin is trying to do. But Krišjānis Kariņš is a U.S. citizen! Imagine this situation, colleagues. A US citizen is currently leading the government of a Member State of the European Union! And it's all right!

I really welcome this initiative, I think that the Commission can also act much more effectively and effectively, and it has my full support on such a serious subject. However, I wonder how the legislation responds to what precedes this spread of terrorist content, that is to say, to hateful ideologies, to dangerous manifestations that reflect or originate in religion, in political ideologies. In the Czech Republic, we have a specific case of a previously wrongfully convicted pensioner who felled trees on railway lines and claimed these acts of terrorism as the actions of Muslims. I think this is precisely the example of radicalisation, which is dangerous and had its origins, a reflection in its favor with the extremist parliamentary faction in the Czech Republic.  I think that we need not only to focus on the dissemination of terrorist content on the Internet, but also on the causes, on the undershooer. I would very much like us to focus on these very topics as well.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 306, "date": "2019-01-30.json", "name": "Michaela Šojdrová (PPE).", "mepid": "124710", "text": "   – Mr President, today we celebrated International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Allow me to give this speech in memory of my grandparents, who survived the concentration camp in Terezin. It is an important time to recognise the still-present issue of anti-Semitism in Europe. On 30 January – this day – in 1933, Adolph Hitler took power in Germany, in silence and without protests from democratic forces. Nobody could imagine where his populism would eventually lead. Anti-Semitism was deeply rooted in Europe at that time and it has not disappeared yet. Since 2013, almost 90% of the Jewish communities in Europe say that anti-Semitism has increased. Almost 40% of them state that they have considered emigrating. Therefore, hatred against Jews and racist prejudice belong not just to the past: Jewish people, like other minorities, face them every day in various, and sometimes hidden, forms. Honourable Members, the European Union’s key values are humanity, dignity and respect for everyone. The European Union is a true home for the Jewish people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 307, "date": "2019-01-30.json", "name": "Przewodniczący. –", "mepid": "124891", "text": "  I close the debate on this point on the agenda.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}]
