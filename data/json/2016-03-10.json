Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the Zika virus epidemic began in May 2015 in Brazil and has since spread to forty countries. The virus has infected about four million people in South America. On February 1, 2016, the Emergency Committee of the International Health Regulation declared that the Zika virus outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international importance. Experts agree that it is highly likely that there is a causal link between zika virus infection during pregnancy and microcephaly in newborns, although this has not yet been scientifically proven. Unlike the much more dangerous Ebola virus, which needed contact between people for contagion, the Zika virus is transmissible through mosquito bite.  These premises have led us to call for this debate and for debate in this House with the European Commission. The subject of our oral question is the request for an overview of the current situation with regard to the outbreak of the disease and the incidence of microcephaly in the Union, as well as the real risk of transmission of Zika virus infection in the European Union. In this regard, we know that the vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito,, is currently not active. But we also know that in the summer, and already in the spring, if we think of the countries of Southern Europe, it will become active. In addition, we must consider the presence of the Olympic Games in Brazil, an event that, due to the already planned displacement of large numbers of people, will generate and could generate the multiplication out of proportion to the spread of the virus. In addition, when the Rio 2016 event begins, there will be, as a result of climatic conditions, the greater development of mosquito populations, which are precisely the vector of the disease.  In view of this, the Commission, ENVI intends to ask the Commissioner what action has been taken to prevent the spread of the disease on European territory and whether the necessary measures have already been put in place to deal with a possible emergency, should it also occur in Europe. I would like to ask whether the Commission, for example, intends to advise the HEALTH AUTHORITIES of the Union to cooperate with the transport sector in order to ensure the disinfection of the cargoes, cargo carriers, cabins and passenger compartments of aircraft coming from the areas affected by the virus. If it also considers spreading the use of insecticides and if it is tried to sterilize, as has been proposed, mosquitoes to avoid their production through the so-called sterile male technique.  With regard to the financial part, I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he considers the sum of EUR 10 million made available to meet the scientific challenge of the virus and its neurological complications to be sufficient, as well as the need to develop diagnostic tests, vaccines and treatments for the disease.  Finally, we know that the EMA has organized a task force of experts specializing in vaccines and infectious diseases, to provide pharmaceutical companies with scientific inputs and regulators for the development of medicines or vaccines against the virus. On this issue, I would like to ask the Commissioner where we stand with the study of the vaccine, whether we are making progress and whether we can expect positive results in the short and medium term.  As you can see, Commissioner, a number of issues are being put to the Attention of the Commission in order to prevent, because we know that prevention is the best strategy to avoid damage to the health of European citizens and, above all, to reduce the possible effects of an infection such as that of the Zika virus.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-03-10.json", "name": "Jonathan Hill", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, Mr La Via, the Commission fully shares Parliament’s concern on Zika and we agree that we need to have a forceful response to this outbreak. The Zika virus is a model example of the threats that we face in today’s globalised world. Suddenly it made its way around the world and reached the Americas and the Caribbean. And as always when a virus is introduced in a new area we can see some unexpected symptoms and effects. While the uncomplicated Zika infection causes only mild symptoms, this virus seems able to infect unborn children in utero, potentially causing microcephaly. In the light of this, the World Health Organization has rightly declared a public health emergency of international concern and in the European Union we have mobilised our structures of cooperation with the Member States. The epidemic has arrived in Member States’ overseas territories; in continental European Union we so far only have cases in travellers returning from the affected areas.  So that is why the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has developed information for travellers and for EU residents in the affected areas, and that I know is one of the points for action mentioned in your resolution. We have also shaped advice to health authorities to help Member States increase awareness amongst clinicians, something else that your resolution stresses. It is likely that more infections will occur in Europe. We must be prepared for local transmission of Zika as temperatures rise, building on our experience in controlling the spread of mosquitoes, which is being brought together by the ECDC. We are already gathering knowledge from countries with experience in mosquito control, as you rightly call for. We are ready to address Zika by using tried and tested systems under our legislation on serious cross-border health threats, which gives us the mandate to coordinate the response to a threat together with Member States. As regards surveillance of the epidemic, we are on track and we are working with Member States to reinforce laboratory capabilities for early detection and diagnosis based on the ECDC risk assessments. It is the Health Security Committee which is the structure we have in place for risk management to cross-border threats. This committee has so far met three times to review the Zika situation and we are constantly exchanging information on Zika through our early warning and response system. As regards another important point you raised, the disinfection of ships and airplanes, we have developed specific advice to Member States on this, again based on ECDC risk assessments. We share your concern at the fact that there are no vaccines or medicines to protect people from the Zika virus or to treat them, and that is why we are stepping up our efforts in this area. The European Medicines Agency has established a task force of experts to advise on scientific and regulatory matters related to the development of medicines against the virus. The Agency will also contact companies planning to work on vaccines and offer advice. We are making available an additional EUR 10 million of emergency research funding for Zika-related research. These are only the first steps in our response. We will continue to support the EU Member States and the affected regions in close cooperation with the World Health Organization and today’s debate and Parliament’s motion for a resolution come, I think, at the right moment to focus attention on the urgency of the situation. This is particularly true as in the coming spring and summer mosquitos may pose a danger for the introduction of the virus in Europe, so we need effective vector control measures. Let me assure you that the Commission is ready to address all aspects of the Zika virus challenge and is ready to deploy all available instruments and means to this end.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2016-03-10.json", "name": "Annie Schreijer-Pierik", "mepid": "125030", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – A question to the Commission: have you ever seen a photo or video of a baby born with a small head? That's microcephaly and according to the WHO probably caused by the Zika virus. According to the latest reports from the American study, the virus can also damage the nervous system. It is therefore important that we get to work on this.  The virus is drawing a trail of misery through tropical countries. Infections have already surfaced in Europe. And therefore the question: what is the state of play now? Do you agree with the WHO? The ECDC is more critical. What is the risk of infections in Europe? What measures do you intend to take? You have mentioned several: planes, ships, etc. But what else are you up to? You have committed EUR 10 million, or is it EUR 65 million? Is that enough for the enormous challenge of developing a vaccine for this virus, if it is the cause and to really protect the world's population? In Europe alone, 5 million women are pregnant every year. Together with hundreds of millions of other women worldwide, they are waiting for an approved vaccine.  In their interest, we call for more research into the Zika virus and for more precautions. Because be aware: a single bite of an infected mosquito can plunge mother and child into misery for life.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has We postponed this debate because we in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Social Affairs had a quiet discussion about what a resolution should actually look like, what must actually be done, because we did not yet have the information. The information is sparse. Since 1 February 2016, we have had the state of emergency declared by the World Health Organisation in connection with the Zika virus. I would again be interested to know what the financing should look like. In total, according to who figures, the fight in Central and South America will cost up to EUR 50 million by June this year. The European Union gives ten million. Are the Member States giving extra money on the spot? After all, the call for the European Union to get involved is always very quickly there. But we are mostly chronically underfunded. In this respect, I would be interested to know what the Member States are doing and how other regions of the world will be involved in the fight against this terrible virus. Much has already been said about the transport sector. We live in a globalised world, and we must, of course, also see what travel flows look like. But Zika has really spread around the equator; Within 40 days, this virus has actually gone around the world. What is the situation in the Member States? We also have regions of the EU that are in crisis areas. What about dissemination and what are the preventive measures in the respective regions where the EU is responsible at the end of the day? What is particularly important here, in the very context of the Zika virus, is important to mention – we have been talking about pregnancy, about the malformation in infants: what about the whole area of women's rights?

Like many people, until a month or so ago, I had never really heard of Zika. When I started to read about it I kind of assumed it was something very new and I was quite surprised to find that actually Zika has been around a long time. What is new is the rapid spread. So it is surprising that we have, in fact, so little information about how it is spreading and, indeed, so few inroads made into research, into preventing that spread, into a vaccination, etc. So I am delighted to hear that we are going to be speeding that process up.  So my question really is: how will this ongoing information – we have heard about the work that is going to be done, and I am sure we will hear more – be transmitted to Parliament, and will the Commission be setting up a mechanism for regular reporting, be this via ECDC or not, to Parliament, and also to Member States, because we would very much like to be kept updated?", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2016-03-10.json", "name": "José Inácio Faria", "mepid": "125101", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is very worrying that we have been following the news about the Zika virus outbreak, which has been spreading rapidly in different countries, especially Latin America, and which could spread to the European continent and which has become a real global health emergency. According to the World Health Organization, this virus could affect about four million people on the American continent alone in 2016. News of this outbreak is increasingly alarming and there are high suspicions that this virus could cause birth defects and neurological syndromes. At the moment, there are already cases of travellers who have been infected with the Zika virus in third countries and diagnosed after returning to Europe. Fortunately, for all of us, the disease has not yet spread to the European continent.  However, with spring and summer, the risk of this spread in Europe will necessarily become greater. In countries where the Aedes aegypti mosquito is present, such as Portugal - more specifically in the outermost region of Madeira - there may be a serious risk of spreading the Zika virus. The lessons learned during the Ebola outbreak indicate that we need to act more quickly and effectively in global health emergencies.  As Commissioner Hill said, Member States must and can cooperate scientifically and operationally with each other, also with the Latin American countries most affected by the virus. It is left to establish the best measures to prevent, control, diagnosis and possible treatments against the disease, as well as to share information about research that is being carried out. It is essential that these studies include the possible links between the virus and congenital malformations and neurological syndromes.  However, it is also necessary to analyze possible alternative causes for these malformations and not exclude any hypothesis before due proof and scientific investigation. I am referring in particular to the possibility of a causal link between the cases of microcephaly found and pyriproxifen larvicidal added to drinking water. So, ladies and gentlemen, we can find answers that contribute to a final solution to this very serious problem for global public health.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2016-03-10.json", "name": "Martin Häusling", "mepid": "96752", "text": "  Mr President, For better, I would like to make a name for my free Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has When you hear the figures, you are very frightened: four million people, 40 countries are now affected. The WHO said again yesterday: the spread has not stopped, it will continue. That is why all the measures that are now being taken – including the declaration of an emergency – are imperative if we do not fall into the same trap as Ebola, that we respond too late to an almost global threat. Nor do we need the very last proof of whether the tiger mosquito is now responsible. Action must now be taken, although other matters must, of course, continue to be examined. The fact that there is a connection with skull malformation, with microencephaly and also with Guillain-Barré syndrome due to the spread of the mosquito is, I believe, now undisputed. Now the question is: what are we doing? Do we not react until Europe is affected? I believe that we must now also support the countries concerned in taking precautionary measures, in hygiene measures and in improving waste water disposal;  for example, where the mosquito spreads, usually the conditions are not correct.  We must also remember that, of course, we will continue to press ahead with the spread of the mosquito if we do not finally do something about climate change. We do not have to wait until it becomes a problem in Europe. It will eventually become a problem in Europe, we will not be able to stop it. What I do not think we need now is for us to shoot at the mosquito with large chemical cannons. We cannot eradicate it - we have to live with it. I can only warn against the fact that genetically engineered mosquitoes are now being used. That, too, will not solve the problem, but we may be creating quite different problems, which may be more serious.  That is why the central question is: is EUR 10 million really enough? I believe that we need more, and we need a joint effort by all the Member States so that we can really make a difference.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2016-03-10.json", "name": "Piernicola Pedicini", "mepid": "124844", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the end of this epidemic, many issues still remain unclear.

It seems clear to us that diagnostic tests have yet to be developed to reduce misdiagnosis due to the presence of dengue, and it is not yet clear whether transmission of the virus can also take place by sexual means or by blood transfusion.  Yet, with all these undeniable uncertainties, the usual vaccine is being developed, although we know that full vaccination coverage would not debelle a virus that can be transmitted, changing from mosquito to mosquito and knowing that the time to test it is, in any case, too long.  Therefore, let us avoid making these pharmaceutical companies enrich these pharmaceutical companies again and unnecessarily with a vaccine that is not a response to this epidemic, and instead look at alternative strategies, such as the sterile mosquito technique, which would have a real and efficient effect on the spread of the virus.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 9, "date": "2016-03-10.json", "name": "Joëlle Mélin", "mepid": "124765", "text": "  on behalf of the ENF group. Mr President, on 1 February, I had asked, on behalf of my group, Europe of Nations and Freedoms, for the Zika epidemic to be included in the agenda. The presiding officer had refused me this on the same day that WHO declared it an emergency. The debate therefore begins six weeks later. In our view, the wording of the oral question is a good, acceptable basis for questioning the Commission. Indeed, the urgent, comprehensive and maximum assessment of this potentially pandemic viral epidemic is one of our prerogatives, but above all one of our obligations. It is the apprehension of maximum gravity, which we must identify under the principle of medical and scientific precaution, which we owe to our fellow citizens and especially to our fellow citizens. It does not matter whether the current state of knowledge of the virus, its complications, its cofactors is piecemeal or even debated. It is a true reproducible protocol for any epidemic that we must encourage. Our financial assistance must be proportionate, controlled and evaluated. The centralisation of international data - medical, technical, biological - should be a priority as early as this spring, in Europe overseas, in the Mediterranean and around the world, depending on the areas of expansion of the mosquito vector. The least toxic means of mosquito prevention and eradication in places of life and transport must be multiplied, screening kits, vaccines, for which research is three years behind, and preventive and curative treatments, must be developed.

Measures to respond more faster to emergencies are needed.  But we must not lose sight of long-term solutions. Although different in many respects, there is one link between the Ebola virus epidemic and Zika. Both are mostly and at least for now diseases of the poor and marginalized. The health systems of the affected countries in West Africa in case of Ebola are weakened, and in the case of Zika, the lack of access to adequate sanitation in vulnerable Communities of South America has been an important factor for the spread of the virus.

Currently, the danger to Europe is relatively small, but with the arrival of warmer and wetter weather, there is a chance that mosquitoes will start spreading the virus in our part of the world.

I would like to start with two points. One of them has already been mentioned many times today, namely the right of women to their own bodies and thus all questions of reproduction. This also means having to make or be able to make the decision to have a child or not to have a child, and to use all accompanying measures for this, that is to say, investigations. However, when a judgment is made in the sense that one knows that the child has been harmed, then one must also be accompanied in the decision that one makes afterwards. That is one point. The second point, which is very important to me, is the fight against the virus. I believe that we must focus on research into prevention, prevention and then treatment. However, we must now, in prevention, ensure that excessive, uncontrolled use of biocides does not in fact have the opposite effect – that, on the one hand, it may reduce the risk of the Zika virus, but on the other hand it generally brings new risks through the biocides, not only for the health of the individual, but also for our biodiversity in general.

There really needs to be a follow-up of women to see if or not they can have children with microcephaly, which is not obvious, because it is often detected at birth, but not during pregnancy. Then there is prevention. I find the example of Reunion on dengue fever quite interesting. The population has been informed and mosquito populations have been reduced. We now see that there is research on natural insecticides, that there are fish, etc., that can kill the larvae. On research, Barack Obama has pledged to spend 1.6 billion euros and you say 10 million.

As it happens, when a virus, a well-known virus, a virus that has been well known for decades, suddenly begins to cause strange diseases, then I think there are other things to watch out for. In particular, suspicions have been raised, and there have been reports from several places that residues of a certain insecticide from a certain multinational company can be found in the water that people normally use as drinking water at certain points.

It seemed to me that there were some recurring themes, themes of urgency, of comprehensiveness, and the importance of coordination, prevention and information all playing a vitally important role. I can say, on behalf of the Commission, that we will certainly take all of those into account as we continue our action to address Zika in the months to come.  I do believe that our experience of past epidemics and the structures that we already have in place stand us in good stead to make an effective and swift response to developments. Right now, as many honourable Members have stressed, we need to focus on preparing for the summer and on finding effective vaccines and medicines, both to prevent and to treat Zika virus infection. So far as the question about the sum of the money that we are able to make available is concerned, one part, as I have said, is to mobilise EUR 10 million from the EU budget. This call for research has been approved by the Member States, is expected to be launched on 15 March and will address several knowledge gaps that we have regarding the Zika virus.  Most importantly, it will examine the potential link of the virus with the epidemic of congenital brain malformations and other neurological complications observed across Latin America and French Polynesia.  Additionally, it will allow for diagnostics development and the testing of potential treatments and vaccines. That is going to be done in cooperation with the World Health Organization and other agencies, including the CDC. I think that this research should provide evidence to public health authorities on the best prevention and clinical management strategies, particularly for pregnant women, which is another of the themes that we have heard today.  This call for research will be complemented by other open Horizon 2020 calls on vaccine development with a budget of EUR 40 million euros, on vector control infrastructures with a budget of EUR 10 million and by continuing projects, including on dengue. I was asked particularly about the sterilisation of mosquitoes. My understanding is that the issue is still at the research stage, but it is one of the options on the table. So I think I am happy to pledge the Commission’s full support in addressing the challenges posed by Zika virus infection and raised today. We will of course want to keep Parliament informed.

A single supervision and a single resolution involves a significant transfer of responsibility from euro area Member States to the European institutions. This is necessary to ensure stability and restore confidence in our banks and in order to reduce and share risks by enhancing financial integration. Such a transfer or responsibility requires, however, an appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny, of which this report represents the first concrete expression. I would like, in this regard, to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation, as well as the secretariat and all the staff for their work. I also appreciate the transparent and open dialogue we had with the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) and the Commission. The report considers the establishment of the SSM a success, both from an operational point of view and in terms of supervisory quality. At the same time we identify some problems and margins of improvement in both areas. In particular, we underline the importance of effective coordination between micro and macro-prudential policies, as the SSM is fully part of the EU macro-prudential framework, the need for stabilisation of the supervisory and regulatory framework, as well as improving the comprehension among banks of a common supervisory approach underlying the concrete individual micro-prudential measures. We stress also the need for proportionality.  The markets need clarity and predictability on the setting of capital requirements; this has not been the case with the maximum distributable amount (MDA) threshold. The report says that the legislation’s lack of clarity on this point should not prevent the SSM from using a margin of flexibility in order to avoid too-rigid solutions that can negatively affect the AT1 bond market. For this reason, we call for a legal clarification of the MDA and the function of pillar two, which is to address only ‘bank specific’ risks. We welcome the note provided yesterday by the Commission in order to start the review process, and we think that the SSM should take it fully into account, in particular where it makes a distinction between pillar two capital requirements and capital guidance. We support the revision of options and national discretions in order to achieve a homogenisation of practices and standards. We make also some specific comments on some of the issues which have been put into the consultation.  Further steps are necessary to reinforce supervisory scrutiny of banks’ financial activity, in order to improve the capacity to look beyond credit risk to all forms of bank risks, including an in-depth analysis of financial portfolios, especially level 3 assets. The report supports the bail-in principle and its implementation. At the same time we recommend that the various choices at the disposal of the Board on the basis of the EU legislation be assessed carefully, including different resolution tools as an alternative to the liquidation of the bank, and to apply always the appropriate proportionality, fairness and flexibility which is in-built in the legislative framework, keeping in mind the importance of safeguarding financial stability and maintaining confidence in the banking system. Finally, the report calls for the completion of the Banking Union, guarantee of deposits and a common backstop. Parliament welcomes the recent package from the Commission, the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) proposal on the one hand and the commitment to work on risk-reduction on the other. On the former, we are working in the appropriate legislative procedure format; on the latter, it is important to emphasise that risk reduction is a broad concept which refers to a number of different possible measures. On the most controversial, related to sovereign exposures, we take note of the work of the Basel Committee and consider that any possible change should carefully be assessed and, in any case, should be done in the medium-terms in the framework of international bodies (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision) and should not affect the financing capacity of Member States and financial stability.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 30, "date": "2016-03-10.json", "name": "Jonathan Hill", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank Roberto Gualtieri very much for this report on the banking union. I think he gave us an excellent reminder of how much has been achieved as we have worked to overhaul Europe’s regulatory and supervisory framework in recent years. The banking union is absolutely central to this new architecture. The Single Supervisor and the Single Resolution authority already feel very well established, and it is easy to forget now that the transition of supervisory tasks from national authorities to the SSM only took place one year ago, or that the Single Resolution Board only became fully operational in January this year. So we have taken big steps forward, delivered in record time. We have helped make Europe’s banks stronger and better capitalised, and Europe’s taxpayers better protected. I would like to thank members of this committee, and also my predecessor, for the part that they have all played in this. The report covers a lot of ground, so I will just highlight some of the main points raised by Mr Gualtieri.  We agree on the need, both at EU level and of course within Member States, to tackle the non-performing loans that continue to weigh negatively on parts of the banking sector. I very much agree that we must check that our legislation is proportionate, that it is sensitive to different business models, and that it avoids unnecessary compliance requirements, particularly for the smaller banks. That is what we will look at in our review of the CRR. I also agree that we need to do everything we can to support lending to SMEs and long-term investment in infrastructure projects. So far as strengthening the banking union is concerned, here the main focus is on our proposal to create a European deposit insurance scheme (EDIS) by 2024, and that is a key part of the broader plan to deepen economic and monetary union. It will give the banking union the third leg that was always intended. We have sought to come up with a balanced approach, an approach that seeks to reduce risk as well as to mutualise it. It is vital that we pursue both sides of this equation in parallel. We need to keep up the pressure to ensure that the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive and the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive are fully transposed into national legislation. We are nearly there on that. We will soon consult on the key differences in insolvency and early restructuring regimes across the EU and we will come forward before the end of the year with a proposal to apply the total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) standard in a way that works for Europe.  Mr Gualtieri highlighted a moment ago in his remarks his concerns about the Pillar 2 capital requirements for banks and their relationship with the capital buffers. We know that there are differences in how these rules are applied by supervisors and that is why we have now started the process of reflecting on this with Member States and here in the Parliament and with others, so that the legislation can work as it was originally intended. There needs to be a clearer difference between the goals of Pillar 1 requirements that apply to all banks and Pillar 2 requirements that are institution-specific and depend on the level of additional risk that banks bear. I am very grateful for what Mr Gualtieri said and I look forward to continuing the discussion on this very important issue.  So these were just some of the areas that struck me in the report. I share the view that we have got strong foundations on which to build and, overall, I am optimistic about the opportunity we have to refine our legislation so that we can continue to meet our prudential objectives while also supporting growth and investment in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 31, "date": "2016-03-10.json", "name": "Eva Paunova", "mepid": "98341", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, a stable banking system means growth, jobs and stability. Recently, we have seen the largest financial institutions in some Member States experience financial turbulence. This shows that we still have a lot of work to do. This report sets the right tone and direction for reforms in the banking sector. Importantly, it calls for further risk reduction measures, which will prevent moral hazard. We clearly state that if the costs for bank failures and insolvencies are to be mutualised, the risk must be contained to the maximum extent possible. I would also underline that risk reduction should not be seen as a vague concept; there are concrete steps that can be taken. This is why we encourage the Commission to propose such measures, and the Member States to implement existing rules. The consolidation of the banking sector must come with legal certainty. This is why we also ask for clarification of the existing Maximum Distributable Amount (MDA) legislation, making it clear banks need to comply with both level I and level II capital requirements. But the key role of this report is providing a clear incentive for reducing sovereign exposure and a balanced approach towards the third pillar of the Banking Union.

The banking union is absolutely essential for the stability of the single currency and the European financial system and it is this awareness that justifies the fundamental involvement of this Parliament. The so-called Common Rule Book, the equal rules, the single supervisory mechanism, and the single resolution mechanism were finalized with extraordinary success before the deadlines.  But let's be clear. This is an original design, it is a high risk project, it has to be refined in its details and depends on mutual trust. Similar systems we know only two, the FDIC in the United States and the German system. Both are based, as a starting point, on deposit guarantees as an essential condition of financial stability. If we do not quickly implement the stabilisation components of the banking union, in particular the third pillar, the common guarantee of deposits, at least in the version already very diluted but which we thank edis, but also the revision of the ISM, the constitution of a backstop and a common credit line, we will run serious risks of dismantling what we have already built , because in an incomplete architecture the existing pillars become dangerous factors of imbalance and not stabilization.

This is an extremely important subject on which we can finally have an overview - I thank Roberto for the clarity of his work - of what has been done in recent years. This is probably the only issue on which Europe can boast, in the last two or three years, of having taken a considerable step on extremely sensitive subjects. I'm not going to go back on what was done. I too would like to focus on the issue of the deposit guarantee system (EDIS), of which I am one of the shadow rapporteurs, to tell you a couple of things that I think are important. The first is that we urgently need to rebuild mutual trust, because this text touches on sensitive issues - the relationship of savers to their money - and, personally, I do not want to be nationalised. There are no countries in which it would be important to protect the savings that are placed in the banks and others where it would be less important. It is a matter of common interest. Health in our banking sector is also a matter of common interest. Within the euro area, the links are close enough that we are extremely vigilant. Nor should risk proposals give the impression that, overnight, we will make a difference. So we're going to have to work on trust and the conditions we can bring. In this regard, Commissioner, from my first discussions on these subjects, I note that we must guarantee that the Commission is really ready to play this role of guardian of the treaties, to provide for conditions that will be respected in the texts. Thirdly, of course, we will also be able to play on the calendar, because I believe that we need to do a good job, that this work will take a little time and that, again, for it to be a success, we have to have restored trust between us.

Mr President! When the big banks were rescued during the financial crisis with taxpayers' money, it was because the banks had become too big and too important to go bust. These were the so-called 'too big to fail' banks, which would draw the rest of society with them if they had gone under. A first step towards protecting taxpayers from future banking crises is therefore, of course, also to prevent banks from growing so large that taxpayers are forced to bail them out if they go bust. But the banking union does nothing about that problem! Eight years after the financial crisis, the European banking sector has become even bigger and even more concentrated, and there is still no legislation that actually addresses 'too big to fail' or looks at scaling down banks. Banks can continue to grow bigger and bigger under the banking union's false assurances that we will never have a banking crisis again. This first annual report on the Banking Union was an obvious opportunity to put \"too big to fail\" on the agenda. Unfortunately, Parliament has not seized this opportunity. Nor does the annual report raise any criticism of Mario Draghi's membership of the G30 Group. It's a special lodge for the banking world's top executives.

It is not a question of taxpayers being liable for deposits. It is not a question of taxpayers being held liable when banks are wound up, but rather the banking union is precisely to protect taxpayers by making creditors liable in the future and by putting the principle of the market economy back in place.

This still exists. No separation was made.  Strong powers have been heard and so we now have a second pillar that introduces the concept of the current account as an investment.

When the insolvent banking system fails, bank customers will be trapped and will have to pay the final bill for the bailout with their savings. This disastrous \"bank resolution\" directive (DRB) is the theft by the European Central Bank of the banking sovereignty of the Member States and the establishment of a genuine financial totalitarianism to save, again, your euro. The deposit guarantee system, the third pillar of the banking union, planned in eight years, is a democratic decoy that will never see the light of day, because Germany does not want it. We have already seen in 2015, with the bankruptcy of the four Italian regional banks, what small savers bear when a bank resolution applies: the majority of customers are ruined and some commit suicide. The European Union is subservient to an ultraliberal ideology, that of the banking lobby. In the face of this democratic danger, the only solution is to put an end to the scheme of universal banking.

It makes it clear that there are still construction sites in all three existing pillars of the Banking Union.  But before we continue to build this banking union, we must first finish what has been done so far. First and foremost, the Member States are called upon to implement and apply them. Here, however, the Commission must also monitor better and put pressure on the Member States. Because if the foundations of the banking union are not stable, every house we build on it will end up being unstable. I am very concerned to see that voices are growing in this House, which are already calling for more flexibility in the rules and more communitarisation of risks. We must first enforce the rules that we have adopted. The requirements for creditor participation are not fair-weather rules. We have adopted it because the citizens should no longer be liable for the risks of the banks. We need consistent application of creditor participation. We need a strong bail-in instrument. We want to protect the taxpayer; That is what our group stands for. We call on the Commission to implement its announcement in the communication on the Banking Union. We believe that further risk reduction in the banking sector is absolutely necessary! We are also asking you, Commissioner, for legislative proposals on this.

And because the glass is half-full the Commission’s regulatory review that is planned must not be seen as an invitation for regulatory rollback, but rather as a review that will help us to fill our regulatory glass properly. In the area of banking the challenges are obvious: the problem of non-performing loans has not yet been fully dealt with throughout the Banking Union. Capitalisation remains uneven and in particular for systemic banks not always fully satisfactory. And of course that is one of the reasons for recent market turmoil. The Commission’s proposal for bank structural reform needs to be properly implemented rather than watered down beyond recognition. Sufficient levels of MREL need to be implemented so that the 8% bail-in requirement will not be disruptive but will truly protect taxpayers. A workable European deposit insurance scheme needs to be implemented while taking into account national specificities and making certain that this goes hand in hand with further risk reduction in the banking system. One important element of this will be a credible strategy to reduce sovereign exposure of banking.

You can see where that leads at the moment. While equity ratios have risen across Europe, lending, especially in southern Europe, has declined.  The second point is that large banks and small and medium-sized enterprises must meet the same conditions. This was not planned from the outset, but it is now a practice. What this bureaucratic burden leads to, for example, is shown by the Ana loans, according to which every loan from EUR 25 0000 onwards is to be reported to the ECB – one can only shake one's head. There is no risk-based valuation for government bonds – and this has not been sufficiently appreciated in the report. Mr Giegold has ridden his favourite horse: he wants a level playing field for financial services and insurance benefits, even though they are very different and we have decided something completely different in the legislation.

What we see is the lack of growth, lack of investment, and in that perspective to hinder banks from market-making, investment-making, from creating liquidity would be to create even bigger problems because there is no regulation that can compensate for the lack of growth or unemployment.

Mr President, the single supervisory mechanism set up within the banking union to supposedly contribute to the stability of the financial system has proved not to be sufficient to reorganise banks. As a result of the economic crisis trillions of euros of public money has been allocated to rescue the banks by burdening the public debt of the states, all at a time when the funds allocated to unemployment are scarce. In Greece there were three recapitalisations of banks that increased public debt and socialized the losses of banks. In fact, the third memorandum again sold the banks to private individuals and crows instead of a lentil plate, resulting in the state being damaged by thirty billion euros. And as if that were not the case, the banks, after being rescued, are now selling the red home loans to for-profit funds and crows preparing to hammer the houses of the Greeks.

There has been some time to adapt to these changes but they appear not to have been fully assimilated yet.  The immediate challenge is therefore to communicate better on the new regime to investors and other market participants. In particular, I believe retail investors, who are likely to be the most vulnerable, should reach a better understanding of their rights and obligations under the bail-in regime. We can see also wide divergences today in the way the BRRD has been implemented, in particular as regards the provisions relating to the order in which the creditors of a bank in resolution are repaid.

I remember when you were appointed and we had this conversation. Without the third pillar, the union is not just lacking, it is biased against small banks and small Member States.

The banks, the financial industry, are there to serve the real economy. This has been forgotten a bit after the scandals in the banking crisis. A great deal has rightly been created of new regulation. Commissioner, I am also very grateful to you for wanting to turn your gaze back in the direction of how we can strengthen the financial sector in such a way that it is once again more able to serve the real economy unbureaucratically.

It is, moreover, significant, that this banking union should proceed before the promised restructuring of the banking system with a pseudo-separation which represents another scoff.

It has been an extraordinary project – the mandate of the previous Parliament – but we should always be prepared to change what we have if it is not working. My final remark is this, Commissioner: it is all about the lending environment. We see too many banks still not in a position to lend to SME growth and development across Europe and across the eurozone especially. It is important that we keep capital reserves, that the new architecture on SSM is correct, and that the new stress tests are right, but we have to make sure that the final high street banks actually start delivering real growth to the European economy.

I think it is worth reminding ourselves, as Mr von Weizsäcker did, of this question of whether the glass is half-full or half—empty. I think it is a good opportunity to remind ourselves of how far we have actually come and to think of the process, for instance, of the stress tests and the fact that our banking system is stronger, more resilient, better capitalised than it was before this work started.  In terms of the question that was raised about trust, I think this lies at the heart of how we are going to be able to address the work we need to do on Banking Union if we are to go forward. I think that underlines the approach we have taken with the EDIS proposal and the associated Risk Reduction Communication, because we are going to have to build trust and take both sides of the equation forward together.  I agree with the points that were made about the importance of implementing existing legislation and honouring commitments that have already been entered into. As I said before, there is progress being made on the transposition of that regulation. We return to it regularly in the Ecofin Council every time we meet and the Member States are nearly there with that.  On the question of sovereign exposure, which was raised by Mr Gualtieri in his remarks, I concur with the prudent line that I think was set out in his report on possible prudential treatments of sovereign exposures. Our approach should be part of a coordinated effort at the global level and that issue is currently being discussed at the Economic and Financial Committee and in the Basel Committee. Any future Commission action would obviously be informed by those discussions.  The important issue of the backstop was also raised. Member States agreed on an approach for bridge financing and have agreed that there needs to be an appropriate backstop by 2024. That issue was also mentioned in our Communication on risk reduction measures.  With regard to the question of shadow banking, I will make a couple of points on that. Firstly, the Securities Financing Transaction Regulation came into force last year and that is a big step forward for monitoring shadow banking. The MiFID legislation will also play a role. I hope that we will be able to make some more progress on the money market funds file in the Council where I think we have greater prospects of progress. Obviously, I will stay alert to any emerging risks that there are on the shadow banking side.  Finally, one of the recurring themes there has been from all sides of the House is points made about proportionality and that does lie behind the thinking for having the call for evidence and wanting to look at the effect of the legislation that we have already passed, not to bring the architecture of that legislation –architecture like the Banking Union – into question , but to ask ourselves, as Mr Hayes said, whether we have got everything right and whether the legislation is working in the most effective way to encourage investment, make it possible for businesses to lend, make it possible for capital to flow to businesses that want to invest and grow. That issue of proportionality will be looked at as part of that call for evidence. It will also be looked at as part of our CRR review and I think the need that we have to balance micro- and macro-prudential requirements is one that I have very much in the forefront of my mind.  I am very grateful to Mr Gualtieri and the shadow rapporteurs for the report and for the work they have done for this debate. I look forward to future reports and I hope that we will be able to demonstrate more of the progress that I know colleagues are keen to see and that we keep up the pace on strengthening our banking system.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 86, "date": "2016-03-10.json", "name": "Roberto Gualtieri", "mepid": "96892", "text": "  Rapporteur. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it has been a lively debate, which has touched on many aspects, which obviously should not make us lose the fact that the main characteristic of the report and its fundamental purpose was to analyse in great detail and precisely the various aspects of the actual exercise of this first year of single supervision, to identify what worked but also the one that worked least well and that must be corrected. In this respect, there are many specific proposals, as Sven Giegold mentioned, and we naturally expect the Commission, the SSM, the SRM – which we would also like to invite to a special meeting of the ECON Committee – to give us precise answers on the points we have raised.  Then, of course, I understand that the SREP methodology, the optionals and national discretions, the MDA threshold – I very much appreciate what the Commission has said – the need to maintain the support factor for SMEs are issues that may be less passionate about a debate in this House than the major ideological disputes about bail-in, bail-out, the separation of banks and all the issues that we should be discussing. , although this debate should be based on reality, facts and a little less ideology.  Therefore, we must not lose sight of the fact that the report states that the rules must be respected but that, at the same time, the rules fortunately also contain the possibility of taking measures that do not have a negative effect on financial stability, and this flexibility, which Mr Balz mentioned, is positive. What is happening in Germany is a good thing, where an institution is being set up that can prevent bail-in and in some cases also provide refreshments for bondholders. That's a good thing.  We must welcome the intelligent use of the rules we have set ourselves, because I believe that financial stability is a primary asset.

The European Union has been at the forefront of calling for an improvement of the situation, and has consistently raised issues related to freedom of expression in its bilateral discussions with Kazakhstan.  The European Union is concerned at the increasing pressure on the independent press. Over the past two years a number of publications have been shut down or have received disproportionate fines. We believe that this not only has an impact on the publications concerned, but also leads others to exercise self-censorship. There are also limitations on freedom of expression online, most recently seen with the arrest and prosecution of a number of bloggers for statements made on social media. We welcome the fact that three of these bloggers were recently released, though we deplore that they were released with restrictions imposed on their movement.  Our concerns focus not only on specific individual cases, but also the legislative framework which provides for criminal sanctions, for defamation, denigration of honour and dignity.

The torture and death of this young Italian PhD student in Cairo is not only a personal tragedy for all who knew him, but an unacceptable tragedy for the entire European Union, for the institutions and for the people. I think this has been expressed by all the speakers today.  Vice-President/High Representative Mogherini has personally raised Giulio Regeni’s murder twice with Egyptian Foreign Minister Shoukry and stressed the need to conduct a thorough independent and transparent investigation in close cooperation with the Italian authorities in order to shed full light on the circumstances and to bring the perpetrators to justice. The case was also raised by the EEAS and Commission officials in Cairo during bilateral talks with the Egyptian authorities in February. The High Representative and the External Action Service are following this case in close cooperation and consultation with the Italian Government.  The European Union attaches great importance to the protection and promotion of human rights in each and every country, Egypt included. To mention just one other recent example, we made a number of interventions over attempts to close down the El Nadim Centre which treats torture victims.  The protection and promotion of human rights, democracy and the rule of law are guiding principles of the Union’s external action and policies. In 2015 the European Union revived bilateral relations with Egypt in the framework of the Accession Agreement which had been on hold since 2010. The objective was to re-engage across key areas including democracy and human rights and to establish cooperation in fields of mutual interest. In November last year in Cairo we resumed the political and human rights dialogue with Egypt, the first such meeting for five years. The Commission and EEAS officials maintain regular contact with civil society organisations and human rights organisation and defenders, and Vice-President/High Representative Mogherini made the point of meeting these organisations in her visit to Cairo four months ago. We are also currently working with EU Member States on a statement on the human rights situation in Egypt to be delivered at the UN Human Rights Council on 15 March in Geneva. The European Union Special Representative is planning to visit the country in the coming months so as to continue engaging actively with Egypt on human rights matters. I can assure you that we will continue to do what we can, together with the Italian authorities, to ensure that the full truth comes out, and that those responsible for Giulio Regeni’s brutal torture and murder will face justice, but we are also working to prevent such unacceptable prejudice in the future. We will continue to call for and support a full implementation of the 2014 Constitution, reforms in the area of governance and rule of law and progress in the human rights situation in view of the aspirations of the Egyptian people for democracy and stability.

The DRC is a vast country of immense challenges, not least those of poverty and security, including gender-based violence. As Sakharov Prize Winner Dr Denis Mukwege has told this House, women’s bodies have become a true battlefield. It is true that the Democratic Republic of Congo has experienced a protracted humanitarian and security crisis. The fragile peace in Eastern DRC depends on what has become the largest UN peacekeeping operation ever. Monusco is still facing a highly volatile and insecure situation.  Since the constitution and elections of 2006 there has been some progress. The economy expanded, some armed groups in the east were defeated or restrained, and there was an effort with much work still ahead to build viable regional institutions, but the DRC is now approaching a critical milestone in its evolution. 2016 should be a presidential election year, but the opposition and civil society fear that the constitutional deadlines will not be respected. A political consensus is urgently needed on a focused set of steps to deliver inclusive and transparent elections within the framework of the constitution.  This does not mean that government and opposition have to agree on every policy challenge facing the country, but it does mean they should find a common understanding on a roadmap leading to the ballot box. Getting the right political climate for democracy to work is also important. Unfortunately, protests and peaceful dissent have been met with repression in some cases and fundamental freedoms seem to be at stake. State security services are accused of involvement in human rights abuses and in a number of cases the judiciary has been disproportionately severe.  The EU issued for this reason a statement in Kinshasa on 8 March reminding the government of the need to respect its obligation. The stakes are high, the economy has been hit by falling commodity prices and an inability to expand domestic revenue, and public services suffer. This recipe for public alienation and discontent deserves our full attention. The EU has invested heavily in security, humanitarian aid and development. We are committed to a long-term partnership with the DRC.  It is not only material help. We have deployed intense political and diplomatic activity in support of peace, stability and reconciliation in active partnership with African regional actors and with the rest of the international community. In our comprehensive approach we have placed human rights first and we recognise the crucial role of the UN as well.  Working closely with the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office in the DRC we monitor and support human rights defenders, we contribute to fighting impunity and we look to the longer term with support for security sector reform and conflict prevention, as well as human and social development. We also seek engagement with the authorities in political and policy dialogue. In conclusion, we believe that it will only be possible for the DRC to move from fragility to resilience in a political culture of constitutionalism, rule of law and respect for human rights. The DRC’s future belongs first and foremost to its citizens. Their voice must be heard in civic discourse and at the polls and the European Union will use the range of its instruments to make this happen.

It was concluded that a specific regulatory framework should be established adapted to the specificities of the veterinary sector. The current legal framework has raised problems, such as the lack of veterinary medicinal products (especially in small markets), regulatory burdens, the functioning of the internal market and, of course, the phenomenon of antibiotic resistance. The Commission would like to draw up a list of very important antibiotics for the treatment of humans only. The European Parliament supports this idea if only this list is based on sound scientific criteria. The European Medicines Agency has made excellent recommendations in this regard to be followed. Finally, contrary to what the Commission proposes, the online sale of antibiotics (and veterinary products subject to prescription in general) should be banned as it poses a serious risk to public health. The Commission also proposes to simplify the use of medicines for human use without a marketing authorisation for the treatment of animals.

Reducing the use of antibiotic medicines without specific authorisation does not, however, mean dismantling our equipment of veterinary medicines; the new regulation aims, on the contrary, to facilitate access to these medicines within the Union, creating more favourable conditions for their circulation thanks also to better authorisation procedures, more effective pharmacovigilance and lower administrative burdens.

The text approved by the Committee on the Environment prioritises the problem of the availability of veterinary medicinal products, which can be tackled by strengthening innovation. The market for veterinary medicinal products is small and highly fragmented, so industry players have little motivation to innovate and introduce new products to the market. Compared to the current legislation, the draft contains a number of important advances for hungary. Taking into account the characteristics of the veterinary sector, the new legislation encourages the extension of preparations already authorised to other animal species. New antimicrobials and preparations for so-called less important animal species will enjoy enhanced data protection. The report prioritises drugs authorised for bees, giving them a 20-year privacy period. The changes can help the emergence of new antibiotics in veterinary medicine and improve the availability of preparations in sectors of particular importance in Hungary, such as beekeeping.

Nevertheless, the report calls on the European Commission to draw up a guide in this regard, which I believe is heading in the right direction. I agree with the report that there should be much more ambitious provisions on the fight against antimicrobials, which can be achieved, inter alia, by inserting the definition of different types of treatment (healing treatment, mass treatment and preventive treatment), by prohibiting the prophylactic use of antibacterial agents and by using alternative non-antibiotic drugs.

I particularly welcome the elimination of the administration of antibiotics to farm animals for prophylactic or metaphylactic purposes. Antibiotics do not replace decent living conditions for animals, although all too often farmers use them precisely in order to save on the costs of running and increasing yields.

The aim of the new proposal is to regulate the authorisation, manufacture, placing on the market, distribution and use of veterinary medicinal products throughout the life of medicinal products. The text approved by the Committee on the Environment prioritises the problem of the availability of veterinary medicinal products, which can be tackled by strengthening innovation. The market for veterinary medicinal products is small and highly fragmented, so industry players have little motivation to innovate and introduce new products to the market. Compared to the current legislation, the draft contains a number of important advances for hungary. Taking into account the characteristics of the veterinary sector, the new legislation encourages the extension of preparations already authorised to other animal species. New antimicrobials and preparations for so-called less important animal species will enjoy enhanced data protection. The report prioritises drugs authorised for bees, giving them a 20-year privacy period. The changes can help the emergence of new antibiotics in veterinary medicine and improve the availability of preparations in sectors of particular importance in Hungary, such as beekeeping.

The Aim of the SRM is to create a community fund to pay for the restructuring of the banks in need. However, since it is much more likely that southern eurozone banks will need help, the SRM will lead to a de facto redistribution of funds. The common deposit guarantee also leads to redistribution and thus to savers in the northern Member States taking on the risks of southern Europe.

In addition, no details were given on the resolution of the crisis for systemic banks. Beyond a balance sheet of 30 billion euros, the resolution is the responsibility of the ECB and not the MRU.

We are taking up an important question because the problem is extremely difficult, which is very visible on the agricultural market for pigmeat in the European Union, which is very much felt by pig producers. We know that global trends are such that food prices have been falling for four years. In 2015, this reduction in world prices reached 15%, but one advantage, the value of the common agricultural policy, was to stabilise agricultural markets, to stabilise farmers' incomes, but also to stabilise the supply-demand relationship. We know that these achievements of the common agricultural policy are appreciated by the people of Europe, that they are also appreciated by farmers, but the situation has become extremely difficult and complex. We are aware that the common agricultural policy is increasingly dependent on the external dimension – on what is happening on world markets. I am referring to what I have mentioned: world-class food prices. I go to formulate a question that is familiar to you. Russia's continuing embargo on food imports has closed the EU's largest market for pig farmers to the pig sector, which has become an additional major problem alongside those mentioned earlier. This leads to strong down pressure on prices, going beyond normal cyclical developments in the pigmeat sector. So-called pig cycles are normal, but what is happening exceeds the crises that have occurred before. The average value of Class E pig carcasses fell by 9% in December alone. Let us remember that December was a pre-Christmas period, and therefore a time of increased purchases also on the market. Many Eu farmers produce pigs below the cost of production. Interest in the latest private storage aid scheme is much higher than in previous programmes. However, private storage support may not be enough to stabilise prices and strengthen the market. Future pressures on the market may arise and will probably occur when products start to leave the warehouses where they are collected, for which we pay for storage, and therefore there will be an increased supply to the market. This could again lead to another fall in prices and an even more difficult situation for producers.  The Commission therefore asks the following questions: does the European Commission intend to take further action in this situation after the private storage aid scheme? Secondly, what impact does the Private Storage Programme foresee by the Commission in terms of market impact and price stability (as I have already mentioned, because it is pork that will come back from stock, even if we keep it there now, paying for its storage)?  Will the Commission take steps to ensure that the available funds from the private storage aid scheme go primarily to farmers, I repeat – to farmers who are experiencing so much difficulty and need help – will they once again end up in the farmers' environment, to operators, to intermediaries? We know that in this field-to-table food chain, the farmer is the weakest link and usually all the problems and problems associated with falling prices move from trade through producers, intermediaries to the farmer. What action will the Commission take in the context of the Russian embargo, particularly with regard to the ban on pig fat, lard and offal products? We know that the introduction of the embargo had political overtones, it was not linked to the situation on the agricultural market, it was not the farmers who were at risk. And the situation we have is that the costs are borne by farmers, and the embargo is also politically uneasy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1404, "date": "2016-03-10.json", "name": "Johannes Hahn", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Mr. The Commission. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. The European pig sector is indeed in a very tense situation. The main cause is a significant increase in production over the last two years. The disappearance of Russia as an export market has exacerbated the situation, but it has not ultimately caused it alone. The Commission has responded to this situation within the framework of the common organisation of the market by aid for private storage of pigmeat, and in January this year 90 000 tonnes of pigmeat were stored with a budget of approximately EUR 27.6 million. The purpose of this measure is to withdraw meat from the market at short notice in times of low prices at the beginning of this year and to return to the market in doses after the seasonal price increase in early summer – since the barbecue season is in full swing. This also explains why the Commission can only use this market measure for a limited period of time. If the stored quantity is too large, the negative effects exceed the market effects of outsourcing the frozen products. The recent stockpiling halted the seasonal fall in prices in January and thus had a direct impact on agricultural incomes. So the safety net worked. Let me also make it quite clear that measures of the common organisation of the market, such as private storage, cannot and should not replace market forces either. However, they can support the necessary market adjustments. We are currently seeing clear signals that the market is reacting. In addition to direct market support measures, the pig sector benefits from the Solidarity Pact adopted by the Commission in September 2015. This includes the possibility of targeted measures in the livestock sector for a total volume of EUR 420 million. As regards Russia's sanitary trade restrictions on fat, bacon and by-products, the Commission initiated wto proceedings back in 2014. Although no official WTO decision has yet been taken, all preliminary information from Geneva points to confirmation of the EU position. This will undoubtedly strengthen the Commission's negotiating position on market access.

This situation is intolerable, given that the price of meat on the shelf has not undergone correlative changes, asking us, not just rhetorically, who do farmers work for? Certainly not for consumers! The commission's recent measure to support this sector, namely private storage, even if it is superior to previous schemes, is not sufficient to stabilise prices and help pig farmers. Moreover, in some Member States this scheme has proved to be ineffective, whether we are talking about France or Romania, given that there is simply not enough space for private storage. The Commission should identify new support mechanisms for this sector and ensure that the money allocated really gets to the right place. I also call on the European Commission to reconsider its position towards the Romanian pig, which has been reared in a territory free of classical swine fever for almost eight years and to allow free trade with it in the European area.

We need to open up alternative markets as the weed- weatherga. Japan is a good example of this.  But the most important thing is that we focus on structural solutions. The position of the pig farmer in the chain needs to be improved, for example through producer organisations. European pig farmers need to invest heavily to meet strict animal welfare and environmental requirements. These investments should be able to recoup pig farmers from the market. A level playing field in the EU is of unprecedented importance.  In some countries, money from Brussels is used to further increase pork production, while there is a surplus.

Today, pork buying prices are at their lowest in the last decade. They decreased by an average of 13 % per year. True, in shops, the price decreases much more slowly if at all it decreases. We all know that many pig farms have taken credit for modernising production, implementing animal welfare and environmental requirements. Therefore, low buying-in prices raise the question of: can pig farming in Europe survive? What is the reason for it? The reason is twofold. On the one hand, the global supply of pork has increased. On the other hand, we need, but costly, animal welfare measures in Europe. The behaviour of traders and the outbreak of African swine fever do not always play the last role. What can we do? Let us start with the unification of the conditions of international competition. Why do we force our farmers to comply with animal welfare requirements, but we allow imports of quarter-cheaper meat from countries such as the USA or Brazil, where animal welfare standards are virtually non-existant. In addition, we have the knowledge that there, butchers are fed with GMOs. I call on the Commission to take measures to restrict meat imports from third countries which apply animal welfare standards below European standards. It would be even better if the Commission took real action and proposed, at world trade organisation level, high global standards for the welfare of animals for fatmeat. Secondly, let us take measures to ensure a fair distribution of value added, to limit the arbitrary value of traders, to manipulate shelf fees. Thirdly, I recall that farmers are very much looking forward to real export promotion mechanisms. I am thinking, in particular, of the export guarantee system. And to the end, but no less important, is African swine fever. This disease, which has spread in some Member States, including my country, Lithuania, is damaging the reputation of EU pork and restricting export opportunities.

Mr President, the European pork sector is now going through a major crisis, which is a direct consequence of the sell-off of our agriculture organised with the complicity of European and national political leaders. First, the Russian embargo, as a result of European sanctions, is ruining many producers in Europe and France. It is more than urgent to raise it, which will have a direct impact on prices. Then there is an imbalance between supply and demand. In Europe, production will increase by 3% this year, i.e. an additional ten million pigs on the European market. For example, French producers are direct victims of German or Spanish producers, who practice social dumping by hiring seconded workers paid 4 or 5 euros an hour, in the case of Germany, or by applying fewer charges and standards, as is the case in Spain. In France, the government has proposed a floor price of 1.40 euros per kilo, a price that served as a small price for French farmers to survive. Industrialists and supermarkets obviously considered this minimum price too high in the face of foreign competition and boycotted the national reference market. The fight by quality, in respect of animal welfare, and in particular the 2008/120/EC directive on the protection of pigs, should not penalise French producers in relation to certain States that have little regard for standards or the importation of pork meat from non-European countries, whose social, health or environmental standards would not be identical to ours. How can one think that the European Union really cares about the fate of farmers when it refuses to suspend the negotiations of the transatlantic treaty, which will expose our breeders to competition from American breeders whose costs are 40% lower than their own or when, under pressure from the Commission, France renounces to impose labelling of the origin of meat.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1414, "date": "2016-03-10.json", "name": "Norbert Lins (PPE).", "mepid": "124808", "text": "   Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has I would like to express my sincere thanks for the urgent debate that is taking place.

The long-term low-price phase is causing income and liquidity problems for our farmers. With a slaughter price in my region of about EUR 1.30 per kilo, no pig farmer can survive permanently. Due to the persistently difficult market situation, new action is needed. In the short term, as in 2015, we should put together a new aid package spread across all Member States. Only 1 550 out of 25 700 processing companies in Germany will be able to benefit from the current programme. In the long term, we need to promote and open up new markets.

The situation of Flemish pig farmers is dramatic. Currently, each pig brought to the slaughterhouse yields less than 1 euro per kilo, while the breeder needs 1.30 euros to get out of his costs and 1.50 euros to earn his living. The price the grower receives for his meat is not sufficient to cover the rising production costs caused by higher food and energy prices. Pig farmers are forced to sell at a loss, while sales at a loss are prohibited in all economic sectors except farmers. With its ultra-liberal vision and its commitment to conquering new markets, the European Commission is heading for catastrophe. With its proposals, which are intended to deal with the crisis, it has at no time succeeded in bringing the situation under control. Commissioner, I have repeated it several times in this House, the price has to be set taking into account the cost of production and should never be lower than these costs. The urgency forces action. We need concrete measures to limit supply. We must also urgently set up a monitoring centre for pork prices to gather information on the price, production level and number of slaughters, inseminations, profit margins, stock and evolution on the market.

Many pigs are neutered without anesthesia. Tails and teeth are cut off when the animals are less than seven days old, even though this has been banned for 20 years. The problems are not due to the collapse of the market in Russia. There is simply more supply than there is demand.

Europe must no longer allow itself to be put at the forefront of the livestock industry by growing this animal-unfriendly, environmentally polluting and sickening industry against will and thanks.

Nevertheless, this issue is important, because in the Netherlands and in the other Member States, the water is on the lips of many farmers because they can no longer even pay for animal feed, doctor's fees and manure disposal and go bankrupt. Often there is also no more money for the household.  Since the Russian boycott - and hopefully it has been resolved quickly - supply and demand have been completely out of balance. While European pig production is still increasing, prices are falling. At the same time, the cost in the Netherlands has increased enormously in recent years due to the stricter application of environmental and animal welfare standards, Mrs Hazekamp. As a result, farmers in the Netherlands have an extra 20 euro cents in costs per kilogram of slaughter weight compared to 7 cents in Germany and Denmark. The pig market therefore completely lacks a single European level playing field.  The EUR 10 million granted by the Dutch Cabinet from the additional crisis pot of EUR 500 million to pig farmers is a small consolation. The money does not end up in the farmer's wallet to pay the costs. We also need to help those who want to stop moving forward.

At this point, Latvian farmers are suffering very heavy losses, and in fact it happens that the agricultural sector is the most regulated in the European Union, but what can we do with our own regulations? They are powerless. So it is imperative that we open the Russian market back to Eastern Europe, my country, Latvia, because Russia is a traditional market for the European Union. It is to be welcomed that sanctions have actually been removed from Belarus, and perhaps European pork farmers could also enter the Belarusian market, but be aware that this will not happen tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

It is therefore necessary to further compensate our producers and, in the short term, to increase support for private storage and to support efforts to attract outlets in third countries in the long term.

Next Monday, in the Council of Agriculture Ministers, market issues will be high on the agenda. Commissioner Hogan will comment specifically on the situation in the field of animal production. Both the Member States and this House have set a clear legal framework with the common organisation of the agricultural market. This provides for a safety net, and the Commission is making use of it. A strong rural area requires economically stable farms, and it is in everyone's interest to support them in difficult economic times. However, we must not forget that, as we all want, the common agricultural policy has transformed into a market-oriented agricultural policy as part of several reform steps. The European Parliament has always supported this development. An agriculture that produces past the market is not socially consensual. However, market orientation also means that market forces act and influence production structures. This is a logical process that is particularly clear in times of crisis, but which is also continuous under normal conditions.  However, anyone who denies this structural change is not honest either, and we want an honest agricultural policy. Whether pork, milk or whatever agricultural product, the Commission will responsibly use the room for manoeuvre set by Parliament and the Council when it comes to cushioning difficult market situations, in the sense of a sustainable and competitive common agricultural policy.

Croatia's production has not recovered, while meat imports have continued.
