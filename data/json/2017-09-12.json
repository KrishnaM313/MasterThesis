Today, digital transformation is an absolutely unstoppable process and history teaches us that letting technology decide the future of societies has never been successful. We have to decide the future of technology and, above all, we have to determine what with this technology we can make happen in order to have a more decent, fairer, safer, more sustainable society, with more opportunities and with higher quality of life. life for people and that choice is a challenge that we can involve, we must involve, European citizens. This is an opportunity to motivate these citizens to participate in the re-foundation of European society. It is an opportunity to reconnect them with the European project. The WIFI4EU Initiative is an important step towards achieving this reconnection goal and to realize this vision. Providing all Europeans with free and unrestricted access to high-quality Internet on public sites is a measure of great symbolism that has a lot of political strength and has great transformative potential. It is, moreover, a measure with such force that the President of the European Commission used it, last year, in the State of the Union speech as one of the anchors of his intervention. From the challenge launched at that time, the most noble moment of the Commission's accountability to Europeans, we did a stimulating work of mobilization and negotiation that allowed us to get here. Networking with regions, companies, civil society, institutions and governments, which allowed us to reach the legislative act that we are discussing today. The proposal under consideration guarantees neutrality in Internet access. It also ensures the selection of the best technology to be applied in each case. It guarantees access, regardless of geographic location and also users' income. It does not discriminate against anyone or any territory. It has a simple application system and a unique validation and, therefore, WIFI4EU is the embryo of a competitive and inclusive European Gigabits Society. It is, moreover, the embryo of a European digital identity that will result from the inclusion of our common values ​​in the new digital society. I therefore thank all those who worked with me on this draft report. I am grateful to the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, which from the outset have worked in concert with the European Parliament and the Commission and the Council. I thank the European Commission and the Council for their convergence in the constant search for good political, economic, technical and financial solutions. I am particularly grateful to all my colleagues in the European Parliament, and particularly to the shadow rapporteurs, for the strength and enthusiasm they have put in their active contribution. I am grateful to the technical and political secretariats, who are always available for a job that was not easy, but that brought us to a successful conclusion, opening up new opportunities for people. I therefore call for the adoption of the legislative act under discussion. It is important that this year the first applications take place and the roots of WIFI4EU start to spread throughout the Union. In conclusion, WIFI4EU is a small step. It is a small step for us, but it is a big step for the European Union to have a leading role in the development of an inclusive, open, transparent, creative and people-friendly digital society. Let us connect with this idea, for a better future for the European Union and the world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Mariya Gabriel", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "member of the Commission. - Madam President, indeed, this is my first plenary debate in my new role as Commissioner for the Digital Economy and Society. The emotion is all the greater since it is once again the citizens who are at the heart of this debate and who constitute the priority common to all of us. Ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Zorrinho. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs as well as the rapporteurs of the BUDG, TRAN and REGI committees for their work. In general, the Commission would like to thank the European Parliament for the political agreement obtained following a single trialogue last May. To begin with, let me quote President Juncker, one year to the day after his State of the Union address: “Everyone should benefit from connectivity in public spaces all over Europe, regardless of their location. where she lives or how much she earns ”. The WiFi4EU initiative is a concrete and decisive step in this direction. Over the next three years, it will provide Internet access to residents and visitors of 6,000 to 8,000 local communities across the European Union. Over the next three years, I would also like to say that the European Commission welcomes the European Parliament's agreement on the importance of providing high quality internet access to our citizens. The Council, the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee also share this approach. I would like to refer to three main elements of the initiative, which have been debated and for which Parliament's contribution has been decisive. Firstly, funding will be allocated ensuring a geographical balance in the countries of the Union and, in principle, on a \"first come, first served\" basis. When the vouchers are distributed, the principle of subsidiarity applies in its entirety. Municipalities will thus be free to choose what they consider to be the main centers of their community: a public library, town hall, local health centers, a square, parks, etc., while doing so by doing so. so as not to distort competition with private operators. It is therefore excluded, within the scope of the initiative, to duplicate existing networks with similar characteristics. We will also ensure that user connections remain free and without discriminatory conditions. Second, access to broadband connectivity will be easy. After a one-time registration, users will be able to automatically connect to all WiFi4EU hotspots in Europe. In addition, thanks to a very useful amendment introduced by Parliament, the initiative will also be open to existing public networks, so that any local authority in Europe will be invited to join the WiFi4EU network. Finally, this initiative also covers content. We want to promote the development of more and better digital services by local players. I am thinking here of e-tourism, e-health and e-government. Once again, I would like to thank the European Parliament for the work done on this WiFi4EU initiative. Thank you for your attention and look forward to the discussions to come.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Claudia Țapardel", "mepid": "124793", "text": "Committee on Transport and Tourism. - Launched a year ago in this plenary, WIFI4EU is a project that demonstrates that the European Union has a visible, direct and positive impact on the lives of citizens. In line with the vision set out in the Digital Single Market Strategy, access to the Internet and, consequently, to information are becoming essential conditions for ensuring Europe's long-term competitiveness. The digitalisation of each economic sector represents the future of Europe, ensuring the development of each community, including from a social point of view, if we are to focus only on the impact on education or the functioning of local public administration. From a transport and tourism perspective, the integration of digital services is becoming vital for meeting connectivity objectives and improving the quality of European services, which we have also emphasized in the opinion of the Committee on Transport. The installation of free wireless hotspots will help to better contextualize mobility patterns, as the data collected can be used to evaluate public transport policies. Public authorities will be able to create safer routes and reduce the inconvenience caused by traffic by optimizing and making transport routes more flexible. At the same time, for tourists, the possibility to be able to connect to the internet when visiting a city will mean extra security and a more pleasant tourist experience. But how can we maximize the impact of WIFI4EU and ensure that it does not remain a success on paper alone? First, by making sure that there is indeed a fair geographical distribution of financial support. European funds must be used where they are really needed and where they will really make a difference in people's lives. Secondly, the European Commission needs to launch an information campaign on the availability of this support and the benefits. Last but not least, financial support is extremely important.The WIFI4EU project must be compatible with other regional and national programs, and possible synergies will be identified with them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Anne Sander", "mepid": "24594", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, dear Commissioner, I am happy to meet you for your first debate in this Chamber, there will be more. We always wonder what Europe is actually doing for its citizens. By funding the deployment of free wifi networks in public spaces, the WiFi4EU initiative, which we will vote on tomorrow, is precisely an example of a Europe that is visible and useful in the daily life of Europeans. For me, all citizens should have access to the Internet, whatever they earn and wherever they live. Still too many rural villages do not have a good connection. Worse, almost half of the population of the European Union does not have sufficient digital skills. The aim of the text is therefore to favor rural areas and those which need it most. While the allocation method will be on the basis of the \"first come, first served\" principle, we wanted a balanced distribution according to the regions. The system must be as simple as possible to avoid the red tape often associated with European funds and allow small municipalities to participate. The financing will therefore be through vouchers of 20,000 euros, with lighter control conditions. The budget negotiation was difficult. We have secured 120 million euros, but we know that this is not enough to cover the needs of hundreds of thousands of European municipalities. However, with the creation of a single sign-on system for each user, WiFi4EU can become the catalyst for the deployment of free European wifi in all public places. Internet connectivity is not an end in itself. It is the prerequisite for the digital transformation of our economy and our society. With WiFi4EU, we promote this connectivity to allow everyone to fully benefit from the digital revolution.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Dan Nica", "mepid": "124784", "text": "on behalf of the S & D group. - The digital single market can also be achieved by reducing the digital divide between Member States, between different regions, categories of European citizens and various industrial sectors. Investment and digital innovation will ensure the growth of the digital economy and provide opportunities for development of new industrial sectors. I congratulate our rapporteur, Carlos Zorrinho, on his work and on the agreement he has reached on this regulation, which will ensure access to high-quality wireless connectivity throughout the Union. The WIFI4EU initiative will have a strong impact on around 6,000-8,000 municipalities in all Member States for which € 120 million will be allocated to fund equipment for free WI-FI services. I emphasize that the available budget should be allocated to projects in a geographically balanced manner between Member States, including allowing for a more active participation of applicants from Member States where the use of grants or other forms of financial assistance has been comparatively low. The WIFI4EU initiative contributes to overcoming the digital divide and complies with EU rules on data protection, network neutrality, supports state-of-the-art equipment and ensures IT security. Importantly, the commercial use of data obtained through the initiative is prohibited. Improving access to high and very high speed broadband internet and therefore to online services, especially in rural areas and remote areas, will increase the quality of life by facilitating access to services such as e-health, e-government. , and could promote the development of local small and medium-sized enterprises. I believe that an important commitment is also the joint statement of the three institutions that, if the increase in the amount earmarked for the package for the implementation of the Mechanism for the Interconnection of Europe in the Telecommunications Sector from EUR 25 million to EUR 50 million cannot be fully secured, the Commission could propose reallocations to facilitate the full financing of the EUR 120 millionOf euro.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Anneleen Van Bossuyt", "mepid": "117491", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. - Today is a sad day, I think, for all hard-working Europeans. Today they are going to suffer from the wastefulness of the European institutions. A year ago President Juncker was indeed here, as has already been mentioned, and in his State of the Union he launched the idea of ​​free Wi-Fi for the citizens. Now EUR 120 million in tax money will be released to give a free Wi-Fi station to about 7,000 municipalities. I have three specific objections to this. Firstly, I think it is naive to think that we will start a digital revolution with this project. I think we can invest the money much better in crucial new technologies, such as 5G, and in superfast internet. Secondly, the seniors and the average tourist, two target groups that are explicitly targeted, will hardly use a free hotspot. I don't see any seniors, who are not very mobile, suddenly go to the market square to check their e-mail. Now that we have free roaming, tourists won't leave their spot on the beach to check their Facebook. Third, the plan will also lead to the extension of the transfer union, as well-performing regions will be punished.

We have also heard now somewhat reluctant words. I would say the truth is somewhere in between. It is an opportunity: the programme itself has certain elements which are relatively new. I think they definitely cut the administrative burden, which is already a precedent for, let us say, other initiatives in the future.  Secondly, it is a carrot in the telecom package. I think it is a carrot which can create impetus, and that is important. Of course, whether it be four, six or eight thousand communities, it will not be a revolution. But we all know that in a number of Member States, in some remote areas, the culture is relatively low in this respect in terms of developing in this field, and that is what I understand the initiative to be: to create an impetus that would really make a difference. If I were a mayor of a village which has not applied, and I see that in the next community they have applied and they have received their contribution and WiFi is being engaged, I might see people from my community suddenly leaving for the next village in the evening for entertainment or something else, but that is an added value. What I am looking for is a spillover effect, and that is why the Commission should be very careful and very pragmatic in terms of evaluation of the effect that will have.  Promotion will be absolutely key, so if we really want to achieve what we are aiming at – and I see a number of positives: single authentication, low administrative burden and a relatively speedy approach – then I think that gradual implementation and the permanent engagement of the Commission is crucial. A final remark on the budget: I find the horse trading, whether it is EUR 95 million or 120 million, a bit of a disgrace bearing in mind what the objective is, what the money concerned is, and what we are really looking forward to. I hope that we will comply with the statement that is existing on the table and that we will increase the budget.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Νεοκλής Συλικιώτης", "mepid": "124689", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Zorrinho for the good cooperation we have had. The initiative to promote free WiFi in local communities is very important, but we must ensure that it works for the benefit of citizens from all walks of life, achieving the maximum possible public benefit. We also need to ensure that it is free and there will be no charge. Our priority must also be to take advantage of wireless connectivity, especially in less developed countries and regions, islands and mountainous remote and inaccessible areas. We welcome these positive reports included in the final text, improving on the Commission proposal. Equally important is the addition we have made that the available budget must be distributed in a geographically balanced way. The Commission's proposal to submit the budget to the Member States, usually in the order of receipt of the proposals, 'fist come, first served', is in our opinion wrong: instead, a comprehensive action plan should be submitted which ensure that all states benefit according to their needs.

Even if the decision is very good, there are several points that can now be done very well or very badly in the implementation. If 6,000 to 7,000 European municipalities can apply for free WiFi and access is regulated via applications and the order of applications, then this can mean that large municipalities, efficient municipalities apply first and this money does not go there, where we actually wanted it, namely in small, structurally weak regions. It will be the task of the commission to motivate the small and weak municipalities in particular to apply as quickly as possible so that they too can get a chance. Unfortunately, this is now a question of implementation; we couldn't put it in law. There is also a second thing that we will have to expand over the next few years: We can only offer powerful free WiFi where there is already powerful Internet. Therefore, there is no point in offering WLAN in a public place if there is no powerful network behind it. We will also need a program so that there is an efficient Internet in structurally weak regions in the first place, otherwise we will have a bottleneck here. Unfortunately, that was not discussed. That may cost a lot more than EUR 120 million in the next period. One last point: a tremendous amount of importance must be attached to data protection.

I would therefore also like to thank the rapporteur for bringing us all together well - I was the shadow rapporteur - and for achieving this result, which I believe will be highly symbolic. After all, up to 8,000 municipalities are to be equipped with free WiFi in the next three years. This benefits both a growing need for connectivity and digital networking.

The EU finance ministers have already agreed on this, and the first funds are due to be distributed later this year. The WiFi4EU initiative bears the costs for the equipment and installation, and the requesting public body, i.e. the municipality, pays for the network connection and maintenance for a period of three years. The municipalities should also be encouraged - and I think this is particularly important - to offer more digital services such as electronic health services or government services and also to develop corresponding apps.

I congratulate colleagues Zorrinho and Sander for the work they have put into bringing this forward. Internet access for all citizens is crucially important and this means that nobody should be excluded, particularly because they happen to live in rural areas. Rural growth is dependent on increased connectivity, and WiFi4EU will help in this regard and perhaps be a blueprint for similar bigger initiatives.  With this initiative, we take one of the needed steps to reduce the digital divide by putting wifi terminals in public spaces. This simple and fast financing mechanism can deliver high-quality internet quite quickly and I welcome its potential to revitalise rural communities.  As a representative of the Ireland South constituency, this is particularly relevant to me. Parts of my constituency still see some of the lowest broadband speeds in Ireland, with our average speeds being around half of those found in Dublin. Examples can be seen in places like Murroe in Limerick, Dromahane in Cork, Clonmore in Carlow and Cahir in Tipperary, all of which have to put up with internet speeds that are way below what is acceptable. While the WiFi4EU is not the ultimate solution for such areas, it would at least be a help.

The initiative we are discussing today is an absolutely timely and excellent initiative, and I think it was also very much completed, compared to the initial proposal, by the precious work of my colleague Zorrinho. It is an initiative of which I just want to highlight two aspects, as other colleagues have also done. The first is that in this way Europe affirms that the Internet must be in some way democratic, that is, it must be potentially accessible to all: it must not be a further discriminant in our society but, if anything, help to break down, to reduce the differences between the opportunities it can offer to those who cannot get there alone. So this aspect, let's say, symbolic, as well as concrete, I consider it very important and I also consider it important - and I recommend to the Commissioner and to those who will concretely follow this initiative - that the image of Europe is not lost: Europe does many things but when the citizens arrive at the municipalities, Europe disappears. Here we must make it clear that Europe has made a symbolic and concrete gesture to get closer to people and communities and to offer them something useful.

We have set the goal that by 2020, all Europeans will have a comprehensive broadband connection and half of them will have an ultra-fast connection. At present, we know that only 70% of EU citizens have access to high-speed internet, and that this is much lower in rural areas. In order to achieve those common goals, it is estimated that we will need to invest around EUR 500 billion in the coming years, specifically in high-speed connections throughout Europe. It is an important precondition for us to be able to create a digital economy and digital services in Europe. The WiFi network initiative now being presented is an important part of this. In particular, the aim is to bring WiFi networks to rural areas, public places, for the use of residents. That is welcome and important. At the same time, however, it must be remembered that, above all, we need private investment to accelerate Europe's development into a digital union, and it is important for us to create a market-based environment that encourages companies to invest in connectivity. A good example of this is my own country, Finland, which has invested very heavily in mobile technology, and Finns use ten times more mobile data than the European average, because we have very good mobile connections and the prices are low thanks to competition. Therefore, it is also important to remember that we need to have a technology-neutral approach.

For us, this means that we have to work extremely hard so that there will be this fast Internet throughout Europe. There are still so-called white spots - especially in rural areas. There is no internet there at all. What used to be streets and electricity, where the public sector has invested a lot of money, is now called the Internet, and we have to spend a lot of money on it. This WiFi4EU is a signal to do this. We have to make these efforts so that the digital agenda, which we have made a big difference, is realized.

It is key for government to provide online services to serve citizens better at lower cost and it is also essential for job creation and support for tourism that is very vital for these small communities. There are hundreds and hundreds of companies that provide internet connections, but their focus is on large communities. In small places, for economic reasons, they do not do it because the investments are not matched by the revenues and, as a result, people there do not have access to services and this will undermine development of their communities.

Because rural territories - and it is more the local elected representative who speaks today in front of you - are also living areas where people have to work.

This is also a clue for negotiating the next elements of our energy package. If we want to get a good or very good result, we also have to be flexible, because our citizens may not understand geopolitics, but they feel when their homes are turned off gas in winter. One country can cause such a crisis, but one country will definitely not solve it, hence this regulation is so important. I will tell you about three things that have been dealt with thanks to the flexibility we have shown. First, the legally binding solidarity mechanism in the event of serious gas supply problems and the list of protected customers. This is the first time we have reached such an agreement. Secondly, regional cooperation that did not exist before, i.e. risk assessment, preparation of preventive actions, emergency plans, the introduction by Parliament of so-called emergency supply corridors - this was a response to the concerns of several countries about mandatory regional cooperation, which remained together with those emergency corridors. And finally, more transparency gas contracts. Please remember that in this regulation we are talking about external supplies, which constitute definitely more than 50% of the European Union's gas needs, so it is these external contracts that determine our security within the European Union. The most important contracts will be available for inspection by the European Commission and national institutions, and in justified cases, the European Commission may also see other gas supply contracts. This is important if we are to feel really good on the European Union scale. I would like to mention once again that we have had help in this regard, in principle, from the entire European Commission, and not only from certain specialized services. We are also accompanied by Director Ristori, who was in the hall during all the negotiations, for which we would like to thank you. I would also like to mention the Maltese Presidency, which is now over, but its contribution to a good solution has really been solid, and these are our conclusions for the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 47, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Miguel Arias Cañete", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I warmly welcome the ambitious and well-balanced agreement reached between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission at the last trilogue in April on the review of the Regulation on Security of Gas Supply. It is a major political success on which we have worked hard together in record time. This is also thanks to you, Mr Buzek, and I congratulate you on your excellent work and thank you and all shadow-rapporteurs for your commitment in this file. The review of the Regulation on Security of Gas Supply is an important milestone in rolling out the Energy Union Strategy. This agreement now completes the Energy Security package proposed by the Commission just last year, in February 2016. One of the Energy Union objectives is to ensure secure, sustainable, competitive and affordable energy supplies for European consumers – for households and for businesses. Europe’s energy market is changing rapidly and significantly. While the current Regulation on Security of Gas Supply of 2010 has already significantly improved Member States’ preparedness for a gas disruption, it was clear from the stress tests conducted in 2014 that the instruments available under that Regulation needed substantial improvements. The new Regulation that is subject to a vote today brings a step change, enhancing and making operational the necessary instruments to prepare for and mitigate potential gas disruption: regional cooperation becomes real and operational;  better transparency on gas supply contracts will help improve the risk assessment; the spirit of solidarity is for the first time translated into concrete action and cooperation between Member States so that no household in any Member State remains in the cold during a gas supply crisis. I am very happy that the most important elements of the Commission proposals have been preserved or even strengthened during the negotiations. Let me just highlight some of these elements, starting with regional cooperation. The current Regulation includes only an optional cooperation between neighbours. In the new Regulation, regional cooperation becomes mandatory and will take place in the risk groups created on the basis of the assessment of major transnational risks, drawing also on insights from European Union-wide simulations done by ENTSOG (the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas). The regional and national risk assessments will provide a sound basis for the national plans, with regional chapters containing meaningful cross-border measures. The spirit of solidarity is a cornerstone of the new Regulation, ensuring that all households will receive gas supplies even during a crisis. With the new processes laid down in the Regulation, for the first time, solidarity is not only a political declaration but an obligation and a concrete way to help. Finally, transparency. Information exchange and the transparency of gas supply contracts is also significantly strengthened and will allow for a more complete and in-depth assessment of risk to security of supply. First, the companies will provide contractual information to their national authorities. If the national authority has doubts about possible risks for security of supply related with the contract, it will notify the contract to the Commission. The notification threshold of 28% for all gas supply contracts – existing and new – is well balanced. It is important to note that at any time the Commission retains the power to ask for any contracts if it is concerned that a given contract is relevant for the assessment of the security of supply. And confidentiality will be guaranteed. The information on gas supply contracts will be sent to the Commission in a non-aggregated but anonymised form. Energy efficiency will be taken into account throughout the Regulation, in particular when designing preventive measures. With the new Regulation, cooperation on gas security of supply with the Contracting Parties of the Energy Community will become much closer and stronger. All the instruments provided through this new Regulation will make the Member States, and the European Union as a whole, better prepared for a gas crisis and better equipped to mitigate a gas crisis should it arise. On this basis, I am confident that the vote in plenary today will give a strong backing to the important agreement that we have achieved together.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 48, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Ruža Tomašić", "mepid": "119431", "text": "rapporteur for the opinion of the REGI Committee. - Madam President, the gas supply crises we have witnessed several times in the last 15 years have hinted that the European Union, if it wants energy security and long-term stability, will have to change its energy policy, but also the rules of conduct in a crisis. This proposal is an important step in the right direction. Any kind of crisis in the Union causes the same pattern of behavior in the member states, and that is self-closure. In the event of a future energy crisis, it is important to ensure that cross-border gas distribution is not interrupted, and this is well addressed in this proposal.

Commissioner! In any market, a level playing field is important for everyone. The gas market is no exception. It is very important that if we want to increase security of gas supply, we must also strengthen the market. What is important in this regulation is that we have not only found out how the Member States will help each other, but we are also significantly increasing the so-called transparency - what is happening with gas contracts between a European consumer and a third country supplier. Specifically, what is it about? We have a huge asymmetry in Europe. We buy a third of our gas from one supplier, Russia, but there is one monopoly export company, Gazprom, on the Russian side. One company. On the European side, we are divided: 28 Member States and many more gas companies. They have all the information, not on the European side. They have price control, not the European side.

This Regulation is extremely important because it lays down provisions aimed at ensuring the security of gas supply by ensuring the proper and continuous functioning of the internal market in natural gas, allowing exceptional measures to be applied when the market is no longer able to supply the necessary quantities of gas, including a measure of last resort solidarity. Responsibilities between natural gas undertakings, Member States and the Union are clearly set out, both in terms of preventive action and the response to actual supply disruptions. This Regulation also establishes transparent mechanisms, in a spirit of solidarity, for coordinating the planning of measures and responses to emergencies at national, regional and Union level. Parliament has succeeded in improving the text - and we congratulate Mr Buzek and the shadow rapporteurs here - so that it better reflects the principle of solidarity, while protecting fair compensation for natural gas companies. This is an important step towards strengthening the European Union's energy security and, in the event of a serious gas supply crisis, EU countries will have to help their neighbors, without neglecting their protected consumers, in order to prevent European citizens from remaining without heating in cold weather. We must emphasize that solidarity only applies to citizens and to services such as hospitals, schools and so on. The principle of transparency is a key element, as Member States will have to notify new contracts or changes immediately after their conclusion.

The situation on our eastern border is changing rapidly and is becoming more and more worrying. This regulation, which aims to ensure the security of gas supply, is therefore a good step in good time. The essential elements of this regulation are the facilitation of two-way gas flows, increased exchange of important security of supply information with the European Commission and national authorities, and enhanced cooperation with the energy community. This will enable a more coordinated response to future threats. While I believe the adoption of this regulation is a step in the right direction, the European Union and its security of gas supply are facing a new challenge, namely Nord Stream II. This geopolitical project undermines European solidarity and is against the spirit of this regulation and one of the main goals of the Energy Union, namely the diversification of gas supplies. In the spirit of this regulation, we must therefore act consistently in order to deal effectively with this problem.

We have already spoken today about regional cooperation, solidarity among Member States, protected customers, and transparency of contracts. I would also add – something that has not been mentioned – that we have also included fair compensation, so we are still primarily market—based, and we are of course talking about last resort. All that is key because from now on our citizens, my compatriots, should feel that there is more energy security and that contracts are not being concluded somewhere by someone where we do not know exactly what is in them and whether it will affect us or not. We should be in a position where the Commission will eventually be assessing the implications of that. So major progress has been made and I think that all that you have said today, all the positive elements, are absolutely legitimate and valid.  On the background to that, I would like to draw attention to one important element. We have been speaking for a couple of years now about energy union and a functioning energy market – all those elements that I have mentioned and that you have mentioned – but those of us who participated in the negotiations know how difficult it was and that it was quite often horse trading about the percentage, about real transparency and about solidarity. To those who spoke quite often two years ago about the crucial importance of the energy union, I must say that in the Council those were quite often the bottlenecks of these negotiations. I do not think that it is coincidental that we had a very difficult round of talks on transparency, because some Member States still feel that they would do it better, and that, if they had the possibly to negotiate on their own, they would be better off. So let us remind ourselves that Parliament has played an important and crucial role with good interaction with the Commission, but the idea and the objectives of the energy union are not yet deeply rooted in the Member States. So let us make sure that we implement thoroughly what we have managed to negotiate.

Natural gas has, the truth, little natural. Rather we should refer to it as dirty gas or fossil gas. According to scientific studies, this gas has a global warming capacity eighty-six times greater than carbon dioxide, making it actually a strange way to fight climate change. With the argument of the risk of new cuts in the supply of Russian gas, the European Commission takes the opportunity to extend new infrastructures and new connections to third countries, despite the fact that the existing infrastructures for imports are used at 58% of their capacity, despite that gas consumption declines year by year and despite the fact that the Commission inflates its gas consumption predictions year by year. The only way to avoid gas risks is to reduce gas consumption, and now we have a fantastic opportunity with the revision of the Directives on renewable energy and energy efficiency. However, the European Commission has only proposed a 30% target, knowing that an additional 1% would reduce gas imports by 4% annually, up to a possible target of 40%.

I am happy to see Mr Arias Cañete, but also Mr Ristori, whose services helped us a lot.  What did we achieve here? This is concrete solidarity. We now have a solution for one of the biggest divides in Europe, which was that Gazprom and Russia could abuse not only markets, but also gas, to put political pressure on eastern Europe.

So I think it was a good job, which resulted in a result of consultation with all the parties. We know the contents of this plan, so I just want to briefly make a reference, speaking with the Commissioner and colleagues. We all know that the common energy policy was born precisely in the face of a supply risk: crisis at the beginning of the 2000s, Ukraine and Russia, coincidentally, even then ... And therefore Europe found itself discovered, it has understood that addiction was a risk and that addiction without solidarity was a double mortal risk. And this also gave rise to this need not only to address the issue of supply but also to create, even before the legal bases of Lisbon, a union, a common energy policy. So, I hope this push is just one step towards really moving towards an Energy Union.

It has been rightly said before that it does not mean that a third country is actually a supplier of 1/3 of the gas of the 28 Member States of the European Union. This is also offensive to the European Union itself. We must use our own strengths. I, from my own experience, suggest that we take advantage of the Eastern Mediterranean. Cyprus with Israel and Greece, as well as Cyprus with Egypt and Greece, have concluded tripartite agreements on energy issues that can be exploited by the European Union. The European Union can also take advantage of the opportunity that Cyprus has to invest in a liquefied natural gas terminal, which, due to its economic potential, Cyprus is unable to do so. To invest, Commissioner, with EU funds of 10 billion so that not only Cyprus and the region, but also the whole of the European Union can have energy security and self-sufficiency, not only for the Eastern Mediterranean but for all areas where the European Union has the potential to invest directly in its energy security.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 73, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Csaba Molnár (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124722", "text": "- Mr President, we are discussing a very, very important piece of European legislation today. This debate here in the Chamber of the European Parliament is about how we can provide gas to people in Europe in a cheap and safe way. The price of natural gas in Europe has fallen by almost half in recent years, but the Hungarian people are still paying the same price as three years ago. The difference between the two prices went to Swiss off-shore accounts. Under the heading of overhead lies, Fidesz pays a HUF 23,000 surcharge for gas to each Hungarian family each year. If it were not for this corrupt pricing in Hungary, every Hungarian family could save a monthly heating bill every year. The reality, however, is that this cannot be done in Hungary. Fidesz businessmen and their Russian friends have made HUF 50 billion in extra profit last year alone due to corrupt gas pricing. It is unacceptable that due to such unfavorable gas price contracts, the price of gas in Hungary is much higher than it could be in reality. If we really joined the European Energy Union, we would not have to turn off the gas in the homes of hundreds of thousands of Hungarians every year.

Since then, the Commission and the Member States have been carrying out investigations and taking all necessary measures to protect consumers. It is now clear that the residues result from an illegal use of the product. While the overall responsibility for the investigations and protective measures remains with the Commission and the Member States, the Presidency of the Council has been following developments closely. On 5 September, at the informal meeting of the Agriculture Ministers held in Tallinn, Commissioner Andriukaitis provided the Ministers with an overview of the state of play and of the further actions planned. After this presentation, Ministers held a discussion including, among other things, the need to ensure an efficient circulation of information in such cases.  Indeed, since the first contamination cases were reported, concerns have been raised, including in Parliament, regarding possible weaknesses in the EU’s rapid alert system and the speed of information sharing. The question of how we can strengthen cooperation and the exchange of information between countries in order to deal more efficiently with such crisis situations will be further discussed at the High Level Ministerial Meeting organised by the Commission in Brussels on 26 September, and we are grateful to the Commission for taking this initiative.  The outcome of that meeting will be presented to Agriculture Ministers at the October Council session on 9—10 October this year. The ongoing investigations and follow—up discussions should give us a clear overall picture of what precisely happened and why, what went wrong and what can be improved. We will need this full clarity for our future debates.  The Council has consistently acknowledged the importance of food safety, high—level protection of public health and the prevention of food fraud. In its conclusions on the role of law enforcement cooperation in combating food crime adopted in 2014, the Council encouraged the Commission to continue its work on the fight against fraudulent and deceptive practices along the food supply chain and to develop any further action necessary for high-level protection of public health.  Furthermore, during the negotiations leading to the adoption of the new Official Controls Regulation that entered into force on 27 April this year, Parliament and the Council agreed to reinforce the legal provisions to fight such practices. Those reinforced provisions do not just include general rules. They also provide for the designation of European Union reference centres for the authenticity and integrity of the agri—food chain, reinforced administrative assistance and cooperation mechanisms between Member States, and enhanced coordinated assistance and follow—up by the Commission.  As I already mentioned, it seems clear that the present fipronil contamination is the result of fraudulent activity. There should be zero tolerance for such fraud. However, the infestation of hens by red mites is a real problem for many farms. Therefore, we must also make every effort to ensure that legal and efficient ways to prevent and treat that infestation remain available.  Let me conclude by calling on all of us to support and encourage the actions taken by the Commission and Member States to ensure the safety of our daily food, to avoid these types of fraud and to resolve them efficiently whenever they occur.

Let me begin by assuring you that public health and food safety are always considered a top priority for me and are treated as such by the Commission. Coherently with this approach, the Commission took immediately very seriously the fipronil issue. The situation continues to evolve, but I think it is important to clarify right from the beginning the succession of events. In November 2016, the Dutch Food Authority was informed of the illegal use of fipronil in poultry but since there were no analytical results indicating the presence of fipronil in eggs or chicken meat, and also no danger to public health, the source of the problem was not established. Tests on samples kept from September 2016 that revealed the presence of fipronil were done only recently and are under investigation by prosecutors from three countries – Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium – to check these historical samples to assess what was known, when and by whom. Prosecutors will help to answer these questions. On 2 June 2017, following self-controls by a Belgian food business operator, the Belgian authorities were notified of the presence of fipronil in eggs and started initiating an investigation to understand the source of the problem. As a consequence of this investigation, on 6 July the Belgian authorities initiated a request for information from the Netherlands in the Administrative Assistance and Cooperation System. This is a different system, related to RASFF.  This system allows Member States to liaise bilaterally or multilaterally to confirm rapidly suspected cases of fraud and is only actively monitored by the Commission when a ‘European Commission coordinated case’ is created. Belgium initiated a normal case, not a European Commission created case, which means that the Commission was not an addressee of the notification and no follow-up was expected by the Commission. Once the Belgian authorities had identified the source of fipronil in eggs and the possible extent of the problem, they notified the European Union Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) on 20 July 2017.  Therefore the Commission was only informed of the fipronil contamination on 20 July. But as soon as the issue was notified through the RASFF system, the Commission took control of the situation, focusing on managing and minimising the consequences of the contamination. Having said that, I want to start by stressing two points. Firstly, that the risk to human health remains very low and has been successfully contained thanks to the measures which have been taken at European Union level. And secondly, this incident is clearly the result of a criminal act resulting in food fraud. This is not to minimise the incident, as it relates to illegal use of an unauthorised substance, which is totally unacceptable, but this is not about a health risk issue. All contaminated eggs have been withdrawn from the market and the eggs from the few farms with acute risk levels have been recalled from consumers. So all in all, consumer safety has not been compromised. Nevertheless, it appals me that the criminal actions of a few could jeopardise the integrity and reputation of our entire food chain. Those criminals must be investigated and punished. So where are we now, today? The situation evolves every day, as you know; 26 Member States and 23 non-EU countries have been affected by the contamination. Since the very beginning of this criminal situation I have been systematically in contact with my counterparts in the Member States most concerned. I have also asked for certain gaps in information to be verified and for detailed analysis and common views to be presented to me. I spoke with ministers for Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria.  In response to the finding of fipronil the Commission requested that specific measures be taken at national level; in particular we have instructed via RASFF that the following measures be taken. First, on 31 July we shared information on applicable maximum residual levels and the measures to be taken as regards illegally treated farms. Second, on 7 August Member States were requested to be vigilant with respect to the possible use of other unauthorised substances used to control red mites in poultry establishments. Third, on 16 August we reminded all Member States that any past distribution of contaminated eggs, egg products or chicken meat had to be timely notified to RASFF in order to ensure the appropriate follow-up by the authorities of the country of destination. Apart from the immediate risk management actions, the Commission has also taken additional important steps.  On 21 August, a note on fipronil contamination was shared with our global partners to ensure transparency. The Commission has also been in direct contact with a number of non-EU countries in order to limit the impact on the EU’s export capacity. On 30 August, we organised a meeting of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed, which agreed on an EU-wide monitoring exercise to investigate the possible use of illegal substances, including amitraz, in egg producing farms. I personally informed the European Union ministers of the situation, collectively and bilaterally, in the context of the informal meeting of the Agricultural and Fisheries Ministers last week in Tallinn. Finally, to avoid any potential side effects on the food chain, we are asking the competent authorities to ensure that contaminated food or animal bypass products do not find their way into animal feed and thus back into the food chain. Let me assure you that my services are working hand in hand with those of Commissioners Malmström and Hogan to ensure that the Commission’s response remains coordinated, comprehensive and forward-looking. We also met with both the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, where I was yesterday, and their suggestions, alongside yours today, will inform the ongoing response.  Now however we need to collectively examine what lessons can be learned and how we communicate and exchange information. This issue will also be discussed by the Chief Veterinary Officers who will meet later this week, on 13 and 14 September. In addition the JRC will organise proficiency tests for official control laboratories in September. With this in mind, the Commission is organising fact-finding missions in early October to the four Member States where the original contamination occurred to gather information on the actions taken. This incident highlights the fact that we need to strengthen the way the European Union networks dealing with food safety and food fraud are used. It is precisely for the reason of providing follow-up at political level that I have taken the initiative to call a High-level Ministerial Meeting on 26 September where we can reflect and agree on, first, how best to strengthen the way the EU networks dealing with food safety and food fraud are used, and second, how to improve coordination between the Administrative Assistance and Cooperation System and the European Union Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed. Bear with me now a moment while I touch on the EU’s Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed which has been subjected to some misplaced criticism of late. The system was created in 1979 in response to the import of oranges contaminated with mercury. Since then, RASFF has ensured that the Commission and Member States were able to respond effectively to several crises, including crop contamination after Chernobyl in 1980s, mad cow disease in mid-1990s and the more recent detection of e-coli bacteria in sprouts in the summer of 2011. RASFF has identified hazards involving mycotoxins, heavy metals, allergens and pesticide residues. When it is used correctly and when it is fed with clear, rapid and reliable information by the control authorities of the Member States, this system works. In practice, the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed is mobilised when a Member State notifies the system of a danger to public health. As the system’s manager, the Commission verifies the notification and immediately communicates it to the other Member States, and this is precisely what happened in the current situation. Indeed, the use of RASFF, in combination with food traceability provisions, has allowed us to quickly find and destroy the relevant food products in the EU. Affected farms have been blocked and will remain so until Member States are certain that their production is safe.  Let me be clear therefore, thanks to RASFF multiple food-safety risks have been averted before they could harm European citizens. In 2016 alone almost 3 000 original notifications were transmitted through the system. Many of these were alerts requiring and resulting in rapid actions. The original fipronil notification has led to nearly 600 follow—up alerts.  While it is true that every system can be improved, it is worth stressing here that our analysis should focus more on the efficient use of, and interaction between, RASFF and the Administrative Assistance and Cooperation System rather than on their reliability. With this goal in mind, the Commission is developing a common platform for these systems and exploring the possibility of a single network of Member State authorities. Now that we have a new official control law, I think this will help us to be more effective. Let me finish by emphasising once more that close coordination and the steady flow of information between all parties is essential, especially in this case. We have constructed the European Union’s food system and food fraud systems and networks together; now we must work collectively to maximise their potential and safeguard the highest standards of food safety for European citizens. Parliament will be important in this regard and I am keen to hear your views on the matter today.

The cause of this egg scandal was the illegal use of prohibited substances - criminal machinations which must be fought and punished with all severity. Even the best law does not seem to deter enough to actually stop this criminal energy and fraud. Nevertheless, we must not become incapacitated and we must come to terms with the fipronil scandal. The discussions in the Agriculture Committee, yesterday in the Environment Committee and today in the plenary show the seriousness of the subject. The Fipronil scandal has shown that the previous Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed - RASFF for short - is not fast enough and efficient. A European rapid alert system should, however, keep exactly what its name promises: it must warn immediately and across Europe. Commissioner, if I now listen to what you have said, you will see that in the end it was not the system that failed, but the stage before it: the notification of the Member States. It is frightening, however, that the responsible authorities in an EU country knew for more than six months that this insecticide was being used without permission and that the report was then made so late. The consequences would be consumer insecurity, deceived agriculture, which has suffered enormous economic damage, and a lot of negative press. All farms have to pay for and bear this loss of confidence.

This crisis calls for a system change and not for technical measures and symptom control. Fipronil is not only harmful to humans and chickens, but it is also disastrous for bees and other insects. And yet fipronil is still permitted as a pesticide in European arable farming. The Commissioner said yesterday that a ban on fipronil is impossible and that it would spell disaster. But, Commissioner, do you really believe that a ban on fipronil is a bigger disaster than the one we are in now?

Second, the case has been going on for much longer than 20 July, when Belgium raised the matter with the rapid alert system. Commissioner, you said that there were already traces in September 2016. There are even invoices circulating that show that the Belgian criminal who is at the root of the whole case, already bought fipronil in May 2016, 3,000 liters; later another 5,000 liters; later another 10 000 liters.

So, Commissioner, I expect you to come up with proposals on 26 September to amend the food regulation that governs the entire rapid alert system.

First, what is the reality of the threat to human health? The mere fact that something is prohibited tells us nothing about the severity of the threat. Nor did the discussion in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Are we talking about potential organ failure or would you have to consume such vast quantities that, in reality, there may be a technical hazard but the risk is minimal? We do need to know. Controlling red mite on chickens is a very big animal welfare issue and there must be a sound reason not to use the best materials.  Secondly, this is demonstrating a failure of the single market. Although used on British cats and dogs, this material cannot be used by British egg producers because it has not been allocated a Health and Safety Executive number. Meanwhile British consumers eat imported EU eggs whose producers benefit from the competitive advantage that fipronil brings.

As I told the Commissioner yesterday, France now has 39 products, so far sold in supermarkets, in which the quantity of fipronil exceeds the maximum authorized. However, the World Health Organization classifies this insecticide as moderately toxic to humans. While consuming an isolated food containing traces of fipronil carries limited risks, regular consumption of these products can seriously damage your health. The fipronil scandal is all the more resounding since the identification and indication of the origin of countries concerning egg products is particularly ill-conceived. We know that the illegal use of fipronil dates back to November 2016. However, the European Commission justifies itself by asserting that Belgium only gave the alert on July 20. Brussels assures that it was not the recipient of the notification from Belgium to the Netherlands under the system of administrative assistance and cooperation. If it had any suspicion about activities which appeared to be in breach of the law, the Commission could always carry out inspections or ask the state concerned to intensify the checks. It is surprising to say the least that in eight months the Commission has not heard of any information on the fraudulent use of fipronil in several countries. Regarding the traces of a second insecticide - amitraz - found, again, in several European farms, the French authorities say they have not received any communication from the rapid alert system for food.

The free movement of goods allowed these insecticide-contaminated goods into the human food chain in the same way that horse meat from eastern Europe turned up in supposedly beef products.

Commissioner! Speaking about the scandal related to the contamination of eggs and poultry meat from farms in the Netherlands and Belgium with fipronil, I would like to point out that eight months have passed between the appearance of the first threat and the response of the relevant authorities of these countries. Well, in the Netherlands, as early as November 2016, an investigation was carried out regarding the illegal addition of fipronil to the Dega 16 preparation, and yet it was not decided then to control the content of this substance in eggs and chicken from poultry farms where this fipronil-assisted preparation was was used.

Look at Member State level. Either they are agencies or they are operators. I looked at the example of France: out of 15 billion eggs, there are only 600 checks. So it's really a needle in a haystack. And, when I looked at the controls, there was no fipronil, because fipronil is moderately toxic, as the WHO says.

Some of you made political statements. Of course, I agree that the Commission is responsible, as Ms Gosiewska said. I am responsible, I am personally responsible. It is a big test for me – and for you also, for all of us, because the situation is very delicate.  On the one hand, we know very well that we need to have facts, arguments, scientifically-based criteria and, of course, reality and fact-finding checks, not just talking generally. Because dissemination of mistrust, dissemination of fear, dissemination of misleading information also affects consumer perception. We need to understand balance and to see how to move forward together. This is not the time to name, blame and shame.  It was a big test for me on 20 July because I faced for the first time such a big challenge and we decided, on the one hand, to be very active, very precise, to communicate with governments, to discuss with ministers, and on the other hand, to manage information, to provide information for consumers.  You mentioned failures of the Rapid Alert System. No, this is not true. Only the Rapid Alert System allows us to understand where we are, how many countries are affected. The European Union produced 360 million eggs per day – please, calculate that per one week and then, can you imagine it, we withdrew 20, 40 million eggs from this big amount. It shows that our Rapid Alert System and tracking and tracing system is effective. That is true. Another question is: how are we using information, how are we acting, especially in using two different systems with different tasks. A criminal investigation in one hand, the food safety issue in the other. How to build a coherent approach? It is our task to move forward and to enforce our situation. Let me start with some concrete questions. Ms Dalli, Mr Agnew and Ms Rivasi raised questions on public health. As regards a possible risk to public health, eggs from only three farms exceeded the acute risk level. I would like to provide you with this real information. Only three farms exceeded the acute risk level. This means that the consumer would need to consume several eggs from these farms in a short period of time to exceed the acute reference dose.  As regards the chronic risk, long-term exposure to fipronil via eggs and egg products should not exceed the acceptable daily intake. From the analytical results available, the majority of the eggs are below that level. This is why we once again draw your attention to this. The risk to public health is really very low. This is not to minimise the incident, as it relates to the illegal use of unauthorised substances. So all in all, consumers are safe, as I mentioned. Talking about action in the future: Mr Belet, Ms Dalli and Mr Demesmaeker raised those questions. After managing the consequences of the incident and having taken the necessary risk management measures, we now have to move on and understand what lessons can be learned from this situation.  On 30 August, a meeting of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed discussed the situation at a technical level and I asked Member States – France, the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium – to provide a coherent approach and to present their views and, of course, a thorough assessment and also proposals on how to deal with those issues together.  This means that I will organise a high-level ministerial meeting on 26 September because we need to address all the issues and questions which were raised today. I will collect your questions and will see how to include your questions on manure, zero tolerance, compensation issues. We need to understand the situation and we will present our conclusions to the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in October, because this is a sequence of problems. Speaking of delays by the Member States, we have to look at this from two angles: the functioning of the system itself, and the use of the system. The system as such, as it was designed, is working well from my point of view. Once it has been put into the system, information has been flowing very well, but how to react quickly is another thing.  I fully understand the situation of the competent authorities because they have difficulties in deciding. First of all they must understand the source of the problems, then the extent of the problems, and then see how to react quickly because it was detected in a completely accidental way. This is very important once again. There are a lot of questions so perhaps I can collect those questions and answer them in written form, as I know we are pressed for time. Speaking about compensation, the priorities for these coming weeks is for producers, business operators and Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure a high level of consumer protection and for the Commission to ensure harmonised enforcement of European Union rules in Member States.  The economic impact of this situation needs to be assessed before starting talks on potential compensation because the situation is not yet at an end. We need to assess the situation considering both the impact on producers and consumption levels in the long term, as well as the ongoing criminal investigation. But we must be sure that our compensation is not going into the hands of criminals. This is clear; we will look at the real picture. We will compensate those who were not involved in criminal activities, but those who were involved in criminal activities should be punished, we should not allow them to use our compensation.  Speaking about animal welfare issues, I agree: we need to discuss animal welfare issues. It does not matter what kind of farming – organic, non-conventional, and so on – but I think we have a good opportunity to use the animal welfare platform and to debate those issues, speaking about those questions.  On manure, as I mentioned, we need to understand that zero tolerance is very important, but of course I will ask my services, my advisers, scientists, to see how we may discuss those issues in more detail because it is a very technical question.  I spoke earlier about the collective responsibility that we bear for safeguarding higher standards of food safety and public health. I am heartened therefore that this House has taken such an active interest in this issue and I have listened closely to the debate today. Let me reiterate: we are determined to improve the use of, and coordination between, the Rapid Alert System and the Administrative Assistance and Cooperation System. However, we cannot and should not place the responsibility for the situation exclusively on these systems. They simply cannot function if they are not used correctly.  I feel that our dialogue today demonstrates the value of effective and continuous communication and we will do our best and we will present to you later our outcomes after 26 September and after the Council conclusions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 136, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Izaskun Bilbao Barandica (ALDE).", "mepid": "96922", "text": "- Mr President, silence everyone, because we are making real efforts to listen to a commissioner who is trying to put solutions on the table - and in the face of a problem that greatly concerns us.To those who do not want to listen, please invite them to come out, but remain silent in this plenary session, because this is also part of the image of the European Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 137, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Matti Maasikas", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, honourable Members, I have listened to the debate with great attention – a debate that was carried by deep concern about public health in Europe.

The first priority is the clear need to investigate how insecticides and plant protection products are generally used in food production. To what extent can we be sure that such substances have not been used illegally in the EU and in the process of obtaining other essential foods such as meat, milk and dairy products, etc.? Controls on the use of these substances or measures such as stricter purchasing rules can prevent future cases of contamination of food with dangerous chemicals, making a major contribution to protecting the health of citizens. The other priority is the need to rebuild EU consumer confidence in food producers. Several cases of fraud have severely affected a sector of the food industry; we are talking about economic costs borne by innocent producers, as well as confusion and suspicion among consumers, who no longer know which products are safe.

When I was elected in January, I thought it would be good to wait a bit before sharing my vision with you. It will be a brief speech. This has enabled me to better appreciate the weight of the responsibility which is mine, as President, but also of that which is ours, as an institution and as Members of Parliament. We have less than two years to go before the elections and we have some daunting challenges ahead: terrorism, illegal immigration, jobs, climate change and Brexit. Our fellow citizens ask us to meet their expectations. They come to us because, at European level, we are their only direct interlocutors. In March, I had the honor of signing the Rome Declaration on behalf of Parliament. Our commitment consists in constantly ensuring that the objectives that governments and the European institutions have set for themselves do not remain statements of principle, but translate into concrete responses for our fellow citizens. We adopted, in record time, important and complex files such as the EFSI, the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EEDD), the “data protection” package or the European body of border guards and guards. -cotes. Since the beginning of the year, we have already done a lot. We have stabilized the financial markets, strengthened European venture capital funds and European social entrepreneurship funds, approved the CETA agreement with different positions and eliminated roaming charges. We will vote in a few minutes on measures to ensure the security of the gas supply. Much remains to be done. We want results in the digital single market. We need to modernize our trade policy in order to protect our strategic industries. We need to strengthen the social dimension of the European Union. We need to find an agreement on reforming the emissions trading system and ensuring that the transition to clean energy becomes a reality. The new Terrorism Committee will soon consider how to improve the fight against this scourge. We must work on the \"defense\" package and further strengthen industrial policy. The most complex task that awaits us remains the “asylum” package. We know the delay is from the Council. However, this does not release us from our duty to do our best to conclude this package before the end of the mandate. Tomorrow we will have the opportunity to discuss all this with the President of the Commission, during the State of the Union debate. Colleagues, we are an extremely complex legislative machine and yet I must say that it works quite well. I am delighted that we can count on a competent, professional and dedicated administration to do this. I will do my best to preserve harmony and good collaboration between the different organs of the House, because on this ultimately depend our efficiency and our capacity for action. Our performance also depends on our working conditions. That is why I pay special attention to the latter. However, colleagues, we do not pass legislation just to be able to announce that \"we have done something\" in this or that area. We have an obligation to make the right decisions and to make the right choices, because the legislation we pass will affect the lives of 500 million citizens for decades to come. The legislator must be able to discuss in depth all aspects of the legislation under consideration and must take the time to listen first and foremost to our fellow citizens, but also to our conscience. Certainly we must also avoid this resulting in unnecessary lengths and unnecessary delays. I will ensure that the \"dead times\" in legislative procedures are reduced to the strict minimum. Parliament must contribute to the adoption of quality legislation which aims to solve the problems of our citizens and not to create new ones. But citizens also expect us to defend in Europe and in the world our values ​​and our principles: freedom, solidarity, subsidiarity, human rights and the rule of law, equality between women and men and the social market economy. I am convinced that the political forces represented here are driven by the sincere desire to help improve the situation of our fellow citizens. Dear colleagues, we are also one of the two branches of the budgetary authority. We must perform this function with responsibility, as we have always done, but also with vision. We are about to start discussions on the multiannual financial framework. I am convinced that the new budget must be a political budget, which departs from distributive logic and which is based on clear objectives. We must first make political choices and only then decide on the budgetary means to achieve them, and not the other way around. This Parliament has to express itself several times on the need to establish new own resources. I am personally convinced of this need and I urge to continue thinking and discussing it within our House, as well as with the other institutions. Dear colleges, look at this House. In this hemicycle sit colleagues who come from all regions of Europe, from the most remote corners of our continent and from the outermost regions. Here all the peoples of the European Union are represented. Parliament is the heart of Europe. This Parliament is the only place on the continent where directly elected representatives can openly discuss continental issues. The only place where they can confront each other, get to know each other and work together to solve common problems. In this Assembly, the heads of state of the member countries and of the whole world spoke, eminent personalities, great figures of our time. This gives our Institution a dimension which goes well beyond the role that the treaties confer on it. This dimension must be reinforced. On this occasion, I would like to remind all heads of state of the Union that they have a standing invitation to speak to the plenary. Dear colleagues, in this House we have an invaluable wealth of political sensibilities, opinions and ideas. We all want \"a Parliament where people talk\", but always on the basis of ideas and mutual respect. We are a living Parliament and I will ensure that all the energies and ideas in this room can be expressed and contribute to discussion and reflection. As I always say, I want to be the Speaker of Parliament, not a Prime Minister. Parliament must put itself back at the head of the reflection on the future of Europe and provide the political impetus that the Union constantly needs. Europe must be changed where it is necessary, but we must move forward. The President of the Commission - whom I thank - has submitted to us a reflection paper on the future of our common project. I know that all political families have led this reflection. The time has come to exchange our respective conclusions, for example during a large open debate in plenary. We will therefore still need to exchange views with the main European players that we should invite here. This will be an opportunity for Parliament to position itself at the center of the debate and to fulfill its proper role as a political discussion forum. Dear colleagues, during his speech investiture, my illustrious predecessor Simone Veil recalled that \"democratic control is the first function of any elected assembly\". We therefore have a duty to be demanding in exercising this control over the executive. The practice of “Spitzenkandidaten”, inaugurated during the last European elections, further strengthens the bond of political trust between Parliament and the Commission. This development must be consolidated. For the Union to work, the Commission must be able to count on the confidence and support of Parliament. However, this trust is not automatic and must be earned every day. Finally, I advocate good understanding between institutions, mutual respect and loyal cooperation. Our unity is our strength, let us never forget. Our history shows that strengthening the Union has always been accompanied by strengthening Parliament. I remain convinced that the battle to obtain the right of initiative is crucial in this regard and must continue. Strengthening the parliamentary dimension of the Union also requires increasingly close cooperation with national parliaments. Europe will be democratic or it will not be. Let me stress, Parliament is the living heart of democracy and gives the Union democratic legitimacy. Without this Parliament, the Union would be nothing but a congress system, supported by a cold and distant bureaucracy. Parliament ensures and embodies the primacy of politics over bureaucracy. Dear colleagues, Parliament is the real \"sounding board\" for the expectations of European citizens. We must listen to them, establish a permanent, open and transparent dialogue with them. We are the most open Parliament in the world. My effort throughout my mandate will be to ensure that our doors are open to citizens. Each Member is called upon to play a fundamental role of link between citizens and the institutions of the Union: he is not only a representative citizens to the Union, but also a representative of the Union to citizens. It’s a lot of work, which keeps us busy every moment of our day, including weekends. This is why it must be said loud and clear that MEPs are not just a finger on the voting system or a hand raised in plenary: they are the representatives of the peoples of Europe and deserve to be respected and listened to. They are their voice and they must be able to express it. (Applause) This is my vision and I will do everything in my power to ensure that the dignity of Members of Parliament is preserved and their role enhanced. We must be proud of who we are. I, as President and colleague, am proud of your work, here and outside this Chamber. Thank you for what you do behind the scenes, in the committees, in the political groups, in the various organs of the House and, above all, in your constituencies. I say thank you for the energy you spend every day in meetings, discussions, negotiations, conferences, contacts, meetings with citizens and civil society.

Respecting the time allocated to discussion, I will be very concise in my remarks. First, on behalf of the Council, I wish to emphasise, and be very clear about, the facts. The Council is bringing forward a draft budget that, both in commitments and payments, proposes increases compared to the 2017 budget. In detail, as follows: an increase of EUR 990 million – 0.6% – compared to the 2017 levels for commitment appropriations and, respectively, an increase of EUR 9.9 billion, or 7.39%, for payment appropriations. Second, the Council attaches great relevance to the fiscal stance of the Union and has therefore moved to increase the contingency margins for next year. We need the EU budget to provide flexibility as much as we need predictability. On this basis, the Council and the Presidency will strive to reach an outcome on next year’s budget that will take the Union forward. The Council seeks to emphasise the expenditure on areas which have the highest European added value and stem from the political priorities of the Union: stimulating growth and jobs, strengthening security and tackling migration. I believe that these priorities are shared by Parliament. At the same time, and respecting the budget process as outlined in the Treaty, the Council sees room for savings and re-sizing of estimates in the initial budget proposed by the Commission without endangering the effective implementation and execution of EU programmes. Having said this, please allow me to take a quick glimpse inside the draft budget and its guiding principles. Sustaining growth and job creation remains one of the Council’s most important priorities. For 2018 the Council wants to support smart and inclusive growth with EUR 76.5 billion in commitments and EUR 66.4 billion in payments, up by 2.1% and 17.5% respectively compared to the 2017 levels. With regard to subheading 1a – Competitiveness for Growth and Jobs – the Council acknowledges the importance of this policy area, which shows implementation rates. I would also wish to highlight that the Council proposal suggests growth for the main programmes in subheading 1a as compared to the available benchmark, the 2017 budget. The Council decided to endorse the Commission’s proposal for programmes like COSME, Erasmus+ and nuclear decommissioning. We also retained financing to core areas of Horizon 2020, a research and innovation programme, to the initiatives protecting Union financial interests, the energy projects, to aid economic recovery, the completion of former programmes, and pilot projects and preparatory actions. The Council also accepted the level of appropriations as proposed by the Commission for new initiatives like WiFi4EU, the European Solidarity Corps, as well as the European Fund for Strategic Investments, including an amount in the reserve for its extension. In some budget lines, however, under subheading 1a, the growth rate has been adjusted downwards, mostly due to the expected realistic absorption capacity and reviewing the scope of administrative expenses. Moving forward, as for subheading 1b – Cohesion Policy, the core instrument of the European Union for creating growth and jobs – the Council maintains the level of commitment appropriations as proposed by the Commission while targeted adjustments are being suggested in payments appropriations. The second priority for the Council is to ensure a high level of security and grant adequate financing for migration and related external policies. With this in mind, as regards heading 3, Security and Citizenship, the Council accepts the Commission proposal and continues to provide resources for the programmes and agencies related to migration. The Council also supports the Commission’s proposal to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument to cover the priority needs under this heading. Under heading 4, Global Europe, the draft budget largely based on the Commission’s proposal shows a reduction of appropriations compared to 2017 due to last year’s exceptional contribution of EUR 750 million from the EU budget to the facility for refugees in Turkey. Now allow me to address the issues of headings 2 and 5 in a few words. Under heading 2, Sustainable Growth and Natural Resources, the Council proposes some adjustments mainly affecting the first pillar of the common agricultural policy. The adjustments anticipate the upward revision of agricultural assigned revenues in the forthcoming autumn forecast. Some additional savings were identified under the annual actions of the sustainable fisheries partnership agreements based on past under—implementation. As regards heading 5, Administration, the Council, after a very attentive scrutiny, set the budget of the relevant institutions at what we deem to be an appropriate level, taking into account the specificities of institutions. The Council carried out targeted savings and increased the standard flat-rate abatement on salaries for most institutions and offices. Moreover, the Council adopted a statement about the efforts made to reach the 5% staff reduction target over the period of 2013 to 2017 by Union institutions and EU bodies. There is still some improvement possible in order to fully achieve the target by all institutions. The Council considers that the level of staff needs to be kept under continuous monitoring to ensure that the savings achieved are consolidated. I would like to draw to a conclusion by iterating the following points. The moderation of expenditure growth in the 2018 budget, as compared to the 2017 in certain areas that the Council is suggesting, have been put for your consideration after serious scrutiny by the Council. The guiding underlying principles of the prioritisation were: first, limiting budget growth of some programmes in order to increase flexibility through bigger margins under the MFF ceiling, and secondly, seeking savings in the administrative expenditures whilst reflecting the progress of the programmes and their past execution rate. Further, no reductions were applied to the completion lines of the 2007—2013 programming period in order to maintain a successful path for phasing out the backlog of unpaid bills. No reductions were applied to the core activities of humanitarian aid. Having said this, I am very conscious of the next steps in the budget process. I intend to weigh the forthcoming position that Parliament will adopt with earnest and serious deliberations in exactly the same vein as the Council was serious and deliberative while formulating its position. On those premises and thanking you for hearing out the rationale of the Council position, I hope we can move towards a reasonable and sustained budget for 2018 that will bring maximum benefits for our European citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 189, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Günther Oettinger", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "Member of the Commission. - Mr President, Mr Minister and ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Council Presidency, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen!

We have no differences in the structure of the budget. We are equally convinced of the goals we want to pursue: growth and employment, doing as much as possible for Europe's competitiveness, managing migration financially, and organizing external and internal security at a high level in the interests of our citizens . The Commission proposal has done everything possible to demonstrate economy in terms of administrative expenditure on staff and material resources and investments.

Now, if the Council's position is to propose another 1.5% cut in spending, we have certain concerns that we need to address because further downsizing would jeopardize our services and job performance capabilities. What I want to say about the cohesion programs is that we continue to assume for next year that the cohesion programs and requests for funds will have reached full speed. We are late, in 2014 and 2015 we didn’t co-finance nearly as much, thereby triggering investments in infrastructure, as it would actually have been possible and desirable. However, in the next year, when we have reached full speed, we want to avoid having outstanding bills in Brussels and that we get a payment backlog. That is why, also in close coordination with the member states, we are convinced that these funds will be used as a need for next year. As the Commission, we are pleased that smaller but important projects such as WiFi4EU or the founding of the European Solidarity Corps are being adequately financed in this start-up and implementation phase and that the Council supports this accordingly. For today I just want to announce that we want to use the deliberations in the trialogue in the next few weeks to convince you of our projects, especially in the future, in the field of research, in the field of competitiveness, in the field of innovation. I am concerned that the Horizon 2020 commitment appropriations are cut by half a billion euros. The Council, Parliament and the Commission decided a few years ago: We want to invest three percent of our gross national product in research and innovation. We're at two percent. The more we talk about it, the less we achieve the goal. Research is the basis for future competitiveness. We Europeans should actually invest 150 billion more annually. To cut half a billion now seems to me to be going in the wrong direction, especially since we only want to finance large-scale research projects in which European added value can be demonstrated. For example, after the cuts, we have to reject three out of four applications in the field of digital technology. We're not catching up with Silicon Valley and the Pentagon and China. Or health research projects - cancer, Alzheimer's, rare diseases, personalized medicine. Cutting back on the health budget means that we are making somewhat slower progress in research into health. In the quantum technology, which I pursued in my previous portfolio, we have taken a flagship initiative with important institutes, industry and the Member States. If we Here, too, if we cut the budget of 130 million by 32 million and at the same time see how Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft are investing billions, we are sending the wrong signal. We are therefore not fighting for theoretical appropriations, not for the general budgetary dimension. Savings are necessary and possible, but I want to convince you of the projects. And cuts can lead to the cancellation of projects or the delay of projects. Take the cuts at Connecting Europe, at Galileo, at ITER, at Copernicus: you can cut the funds, but then we will finish later. What we don't invest in 2018, we have to invest in 2020, 2021 or 2022. I think we should rather keep the financial resources or even increase them so as not to shift expenses into the future and implement these projects later than the Americans or Asians. And then we will have to look closely at the geopolitical challenges - security, migration - and discuss with you - because you are on site - whether and where cuts are justifiable and which approach is realistic. All in all, when I look at the next financial framework, reaching a compromise in 2018 will be a piece of cake. That is why we could even consider doing without some of the meetings for October and November. The faster, the more tightly we advise, the more time we have to thoroughly prepare the next financial period, where there are billions in gaps. In this case, I don't foresee that for 2018.

We are now entering a decisive phase in the procedure to agree on an EU budget for 2018. We have spent the first half of the year agreeing on political priorities, and we have done important work together in agreeing that growth, jobs and the safety and the security of citizens have to be the political priorities of the budget of the Union for next year. These are the right priorities because this is what the citizens of Europe expect the Union to deliver and these are exactly the areas where the Union adds value. Now, we need to deliver on the promises which we made together in the first half of the year. We are simply not credible in saying that we want a more innovative European Union and at the same time cutting EUR 491 million from innovation and research programmes. We are not credible in saying that we want infrastructure in Europe to be better: energy, digital, highways, railways and at the same time we cut EUR 111 million from the Connecting Europe Facility and EUR 99 million from large infrastructure projects. The total cuts proposed by the Council are EUR 1.7 billion. Let me be very clear: what the Council is proposing here is a budget for a weaker European Union because less investments today means a weaker European economy in the future. The Commissioner has outlined this with examples from the digital area in a very convincing manner.  The European Commission has understood in the very first half of the year that growth, jobs, safety and security have to be our priorities, and they have put together a very meaningful budget. This is why I also support allocating most of the resources that we have for research, for SMEs, for infrastructure projects, standing by the side of farmers, particularly young farmers, and fulfiling our commitments when it comes to the Cohesion and Structural Funds. The low absorption rates in the first year of this financial programing period for the Cohesion and Structural Funds does not mean that the absorption rate will stay low in the years to come. On the contrary, it means that now projects will be at full speed and the money is needed over the next years. There is no worse signal that the Union can give to SMEs, to citizens and to NGOs than not being able to pay its bills.  This is why I am calling on all sides to come together in the upcoming weeks to put forward a meaningful budget for the Union in 2018 – a budget based on investments, supporting research, innovation, SMEs and important projects – to put money in the good projects that apply for EU funds, to stand by the side of our immediate neighbourhood, be it south, be it east, be it the Western Balkans, improve safety and security, and make use of the agencies of the Union which we have and which are there to improve the safety and security of the citizens of Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 191, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Richard Ashworth", "mepid": "28132", "text": "  rapporteur. – Mr President, in April this year this House agreed to an increase in the Parliament’s annual budget of 2.3%. Bearing in mind the level of inflation, I thought that was a realistic proposition and I recommend it be taken as a benchmark for the other institutions. So, I am happy to report that the majority of the other institutions accept that point, and I am happy to say that they have made similar proposals.  There are three exceptions that I would mention to the House. First, the European Data Protection Supervisor has been tasked with expanding his activities, and of course this would involve an abnormal expenditure on his part in 2018. Secondly, the European Court of Auditors are faced with a large increase in workload, and this too I accept as a legitimate and a reasonable demand. Finally, the European Court of Justice makes a very strong case for increased funding, both because of raised activity levels and increased translation costs, and for addressing some significant security issues. Faced with these extra costs, therefore, it is my judgement that the Council has cut some of the funding levels too far, and I recommend to this House that we reinstate some of those levels. Nevertheless, to keep the overall level of budget expenditure under control, we need to achieve further savings. In part, I propose to meet those additional costs through efficiency gains, and here I am happy to report that the Court of Auditors have gone some way to meeting us in that respect. But in part two we have to exercise budgetary discipline, and in so doing we will have to redistribute some of the funding.  To that end, I propose to freeze the budgets of the Committee of Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee for the year 2018. I am also conscious that the European External Action Service faces significant rising costs – in part due to increased staffing levels, but also partly due to the cost of the strategic communications programme.  Most of this cost should be absorbed by the EEAS from their current budget, but I do accept there may be need for a small upward adjustment when we have the precise figures.  Mr President, I ask this House to bear in mind that, if you agree with me that the figure agreed for this Parliament of 2.3% is a reasonable and responsible increase, and if we are to apply that to the other sections, then there will be tough, difficult decisions to be made. I look forward to discussing my proposals with the shadows in the coming weeks, and I hope for their support.

Let me just comment with a very few words. Commissioner, your case made especially for research is compelling, and I can assure you that the Council has a sympathetic spot in its heart about that. We will take that back to our Council colleagues and we will certainly discuss that going forward in the budget process. It is an excellent point and it is a point to be considered, as you said, thinking about the long-term competitiveness of the continent. Thank you very much, Mr Rapporteur, dear Siegfried.

As I have said, I fully respect that the European Parliament may have – and probably will have – a different take on the proposed budget for the year 2018. I can assure you that we will work hard with you after you have formally adopted your position. We know that we can count on the Commission and on you, Mr Oettinger, in helping to converge our positions and suggest skilful and balanced compromise solutions. I wish also to thank Mr Arthuis (even if he is absent), as well as Mr Mureşan and Mr Ashworth, the rapporteurs, for our interaction to date and going forward. Europe as a whole needs a budget which is responsive to citizens’ requests, even if that is a constantly moving target.

I would like to begin by thanking all the shadow rapporteurs for their good cooperation. Even though we do not agree on all the details, I understand that we have a great consensus that control of arms exports must be strengthened. We have different political orientations, but when it comes to the issue of preventing weapons from falling into the wrong hands, we agree. Arms export control is an important part of our foreign policy, but it is also becoming an internal political issue as we have witnessed more and more terrorist attacks around Europe carried out by supporters of Daesh, who we know have access to European weapons. Following the terrorist attacks in Catalonia, the focus of the discussion was clearly on arms exports. We had then read in the Spanish media that the king would go to Saudi Arabia to promote arms exports - Spanish arms exports. After the act, the debate came to be about just that. \"We want peace - not to sell weapons\", was the message on the streets of Barcelona. The connection was arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia pays for mosques in Europe. Well-integrated young people are radicalized in mosques and commit terrorist acts in Europe. But Saudi Arabia not only supports the financing of radical mosques in Europe but has also systematically re-exported European weapons to the war in Syria, where terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda, the Nusra Front and Daesh have also seized arms. We can never accept that European weapons end up in the hands of terrorists. We have a comprehensive and clear common set of rules in the common position with its eight criteria. It is a strong regulatory framework that could make virtually all arms exports to conflict regions or countries that grossly violate human rights impossible if strictly applied. With the result in hand, we can now state that the Member States' risk assessments have not been satisfactory and that several of the common position's criteria should have stopped exports to, for example, Saudi Arabia. But since it is up to each country to check that it complies with the regulations, the countries can in principle break it without hindrance. But even if the common position has been followed, we are now in the situation that countries that in peacetime bought weapons and other military equipment from us for their own defense today actively participate in wars of aggression in other countries or provide combat groups in other countries with weapons. Then a number of questions arise. Why do some EU countries continue to grant new licenses to countries at war? Can we stop the follow-up deliveries? Can we stop weapons from ending up with other end users? The last two questions do not help the rules with us at present. What we have previously proposed by Parliament is an embargo on Saudi Arabia. Today we propose that the embargo be used in more situations. Embargo is the only effective system we have for stopping exports that is no longer compliant with the regulations. Developments also show that our long-term risk assessments must be so much better. We would need to look not only at what the equipment is to be used for but at the situation in the recipient country as a whole when a permit is granted. We must also ask ourselves how it is possible that 40% of our total arms exports go to the powder keg in the Middle East and only 15% to other European countries, which is our second major market. And is it reasonable that we in Europe have such an overcapacity in weapons systems that we are forced to export so that our activities do not collapse? The arms industry was created to cover the needs of its own defense, but many times jobs are claimed as a basis for continued support. However, I would like to remind you that, according to Article 10 of the common position, labor market reasons are not a basis for export authorizations. In this year's report, we set out a direction and come up with a clear message: The regulations must be followed. The EU should not close its eyes when European weapons are used in violation of our own rules. We also makes some recommendations for changes, including tightening up reporting requirements to enable better scrutiny, the possibility of imposing sanctions on countries that break the rules, and not least, we hope that Federica Mogherini will take the initiative to actually use the embargoin cases where countries violate international humanitarian law.It is not just international peace or the image of Europe that is at stake, but it is also about the security of our own citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 198, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Matti Maasikas", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, speaking on behalf of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Mrs Mogherini, I welcome both this opportunity to join you today and the preparation and discussion of the report prepared by Ms Valero. This is a testimony to parliamentary scrutiny of arms exports, which is a sound follow-up to transparency applied at EU level on arms export issues. Interaction channels on arms export issues with Parliament and civil society, including NGOs, the academic world and the industry have developed considerably over the years. This is an invaluable achievement and it illustrates that transparency and dialogue can fruitfully take place without prejudice to the respective responsibilities of national and EU stakeholders. At a time when we advocate further transparency worldwide, notably via the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), we believe it is important to ensure that transparency does not run counter to national and regional security. The EU framework governing arms exports mainly revolves around the EU common position on arms exports adopted in 2008. This framework is unique. It is based on the national responsibility of EU Member States on arms export licensing decisions, together with well-developed information-sharing between the export control authorities of Member States. The risk assessment criteria laid down by the EU common position are comprehensive and far-reaching, notably in terms of respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, the risk of diversion and the impact on internal and regional stability. Their daily application by national licensing offices is supported by the so—called user’s guide that was revised in 2015, notably in order to align it with the Arms Trade Treaty. Against this background of national responsibility exercised with common risk assessment criteria, the overarching objectives of the EU common position are to promote responsible arms export policies and the convergence of national arms export policies. In support of these objectives, the Council and the European External Action Service provide an information-sharing platform which is the dedicated Council working party on arms exports, and an IT platform enabling the exchange of information relevant for risk assessment, including details on license denials. Like the EU guidelines, these information-sharing components have been recently overhauled and updated as a result of the review of the EU common position achieved in 2015. This has contributed – and continues to further contribute – to the convergence of arms export policies as they are being put into practice. Briefly widening the picture outside the EU, in our close neighbourhood a number of third countries have aligned with the criteria of the EU common position. To assist them in their daily operational implementation, the EU has had in place since 2009 an outreach programme funding technical cooperation. The latest phase, covering the years 2016-2017, will come to a close in December, but steps are already being taken to continue the work with a new Council decision for the years 2018 and 2019. Secondly, and moving to an even larger picture, I would like to refer to the Arms Trade Treaty. This Treaty sets unique and widely-accepted standards to achieve greater responsibility and transparency in the arms trade. The ATT entered into force in December 2014 and so far, 130 states have signed it and 92 countries are state parties, including all 28 EU Member States. Of note, however, is that some of the largest arms exporters and importers, such as Russia, China, India and Pakistan, have not signed or ratified it. All diplomatic opportunities are used to encourage countries that have taken no steps towards the Treaty to join it by providing the EU assistance programme where needed and requested. The arms trade is becoming more and more globalised. It is our duty to lead by example when it comes to arms exports from the EU. It is equally our duty to encourage and support other arms manufacturers and traders to apply the ATT standards.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 199, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Tunne Kelam", "mepid": "28424", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I would like to thank colleague Valero for her commitment, openness and readiness to understand different points of view, some of which are still there. At the start, I am satisfied that the report clearly confirms the right of every sovereign state to self-defence. Consequently, states also have a legitimate right to acquire military technologies for the support purposes of self-defence.  The common position of eight criteria is a strong commitment by the Member States to systematically control and verify exports of the products of national defence industries. Issuing export licences is based on clear principles. There are several problems with the implementation of the common position, and therefore we support a more demanding and coherent approach. However, the PPE sees no need for extra new criteria or new specific structures or sanctions to enforce control. The first task for us is to secure full and strict implementation with existing commitments. What we need most is more timely and systematic exchange of information on export licences and actual exports. Member States have different ways of acquiring information. Sharing relevant information quickly and regularly is important when other governments have to decide whether to grant an arms export licence or to refuse it, and I welcome the Council’s approach to these problems – especially providing, for example, info-sharing platforms, etc.  Diversion of arms remains a major concern. We fully agree with it. We need to address this problem efficiently through joint strategy and action, both by Member States and the Commission.

We should not underestimate their importance. Five European countries are among the world’s top ten arms exporters. Like our armed forces, the arms industries of European countries are well regulated and responsibly controlled. We have export control regimes, primarily to ensure that, as far as possible, weapons and key components do not get into the wrong hands, and by that I mean our potential enemies, rogue states and terrorists. We don’t want to impose more regulation on our own national industries merely to advance the cause of EU political integration, and I should mention that my own country, the United Kingdom, already has a robust and comprehensive arms export control system irrespective, by the way, of EU activity. While there is much in the Valero report we can agree with, we also take issue on a number of points. Most of these concern the constant effort to enhance the role of the EU over its Member States. I very much hope the Parliament will reject any suggestion of sanctions against a Member State not complying with a common position, and similarly, we don’t see the necessity, in these times of budgetary pressure, for the establishment of EU funds to be used for capacity-building among licensing and enforcement officials in Member States.

And the reality - not the rhetoric - is called, for example, Yemen, where hundreds, thousands of people are being bombarded with products made in Europe, and this is a shame. And, consequently, what cannot be said is that what is happening now in the European Union has to continue to happen because the blood business has to keep flowing for the reality of our defense to exist. Do not prostitute my legitimate defense with the obscene business of the blood of others. Consequently, if we have approved the eight criteria, it is to maintain them. If there are penalties for issues of overproduction of milk, for example, it is obscenity that there are no penalties when weapons are sold outside of the eight criteria. And it is a reality that leading export countries are violating the eight criteria. Consequently, either we comply with what we approved or let's be honest: let's eliminate the eight criteria and, in that sense, let's say, cynically, but at least with honesty and honesty, that we are dedicated to selling to whoever buys us because what matters is business and not ethics.

In Germany, for example - and we're not talking about Russia today - studies show that in 2015 alone over 4,000 export licenses in 76 countries violated these criteria or were classified as problematic. In many other EU countries it could hardly look better. So what we urgently need are three things - unfortunately the report only makes detailed proposals on the first aspect and remains somewhat vague on the other two: what is needed is a uniform and finally complete and rapid reporting obligation on the part of the Member States. It is necessary that compliance with the 8 criteria is verified by an independent body, and sanction mechanisms are necessary for countries that notoriously violate the regulations. Without these measures, EU export regulations will continue to be full of holes like a fishing net and European weapons will fuel wars and conflicts around the world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 206, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Ulrike Lunacek", "mepid": "97017", "text": "on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group. - Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen!

A striking example is precisely the export of arms to Saudi Arabia. This Parliament requested, already in February 2016, the arms embargo to the European Union due to the criminal war of aggression against Yemen and could talk about many more aspects and the case of Saudi Arabia cannot deny the other cases, but it is a case. The transfer of arms, regardless of the nature of the importing regime, fuels conflict and repression, with disproportionate effects for civilians, threatens global security and our security, the European one, because arms exported to third countries re-enter the European Union through the trafficking of weapons and can end up in the hands of terrorist groups, as was seen in France, by the way. It is essential that we create an independent supervisory authority and a standardized verification and notification mechanism for Member States with sanctions.

In this matter, it is easy to become popular or maybe I should say populist. It reads something like this: \"Weapons are terrible, they kill people and therefore we should ban arms exports.\" However, the export of munitions is ultimately a matter of defense and security policy. In defense and security policy, there are rarely any simple truths. Which defense industry companies are allowed to sell what, to whom and when, must be assessed individually, and this changes very often over time. But what this issue is really about is something else. It is about who should decide on this. In Sweden, few politicians would probably say that they want something other than that \"in Sweden we decide on Swedish arms exports, on Swedish defense and security policy\". In this vote, however, I believe that very many, especially the red-greens, will learn to follow Bodil Valero's position, which means that we must have the common position that must be followed by sanctions.

It is clear that these data reflect a profoundly changed, unstable and constantly evolving international context. The time has come, however, to introduce a new criterion in the common position, a criterion that takes due account of the risk of corruption and diversion in the export of arms, avoiding that European technologies end up fueling conflicts that we ourselves have an interest in. to solve.

It has again become clear that arms exports is a field paved with extremely complex sets of issues: humane, moral, economic, geopolitical, political and so on. I will not go into these issues here, but I want to support what Michael Gahler said earlier in this debate, namely that, of all arms exporters, the EU has the most robust system in place for oversight and reporting, with criteria in place, probably in the whole world. That is perhaps not something that can be appreciated by everybody, but it is at least a fact that must be acknowledged by everybody, including in this House. There were two more specific sets of questions, the first concerning arms exports to the countries in the Middle East region, more particularly to countries like Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Yemen. I was referring to the criteria, and criteria No 2, the human rights criteria, was used as a reason for denial of an export licence 72 times in the year 2015 and 89 times in the year 2016. You may say it is not enough, but it is also a trend to be observed. As for the calls to issue an EU arms export embargo for any particular country in the world, it must be known for that that the unanimous support of all EU Member States is needed.  Now let me thank you for this very useful exchange. One of the main achievements of the EU common position relates to increased transparency across the EU on arms export issues. Our discussion today demonstrates that detailed information is regularly made available at EU level and open for parliamentary and public scrutiny. The fact that national decisions on arms exports are reported, and therefore questioned, in turn supports the responsibility of the competent authorities and fosters their accountability. This nexus between transparency and responsibility is the essence of the EU common position and, at the larger global level, of the Arms Trade Treaty.  The EU common position specifies very clearly that licensing decisions remain at the national discretion of EU Member States. Against this background of national responsibility, the EU common position supports greater convergence through a number of common elements and information sharing. As such, convergence remains, by definition, always a work in progress. The improvements decided as a result of the review of the EU common position have supported further convergence. Undoubtedly, greater parliamentary scrutiny at the national and the EU level, as called for by the present report, can further incentivise convergence. Let me close on this note of truly shared interests and by signalling once again my appreciation of Parliament’s role in keeping this important issue on the agenda.

I would have liked to have answered Geoffrey van Orden, who complained that we are not talking about the rest of the world at this stage, but it is in fact the case that we are talking about European export controls. That is why we are talking about Europe's exports, not other countries' exports. As I said earlier, we are not talking about stopping all arms exports. Nor are we talking about countries not having the right to defend themselves. However, it seems that there is an opinion from some here in the house that this is what we are saying. Then I would like to urge them to read the report again before they vote tomorrow. I mentioned that we have a common position, and that is a very good set of rules. I completely agree that it is a good set of rules if we really use it. Now it turns out that we mean that these criteria are violated in many different cases. According to a study that has been done, they are violated - according to COARM's study. Nevertheless, Member States consider that they have a stricter regulatory framework than the common position actually is. Then I have to ask myself if this is really the case. I just heard that France has the strictest regulations. I have previously heard that the British have the strictest regulations. In my country, we say that we have the strictest regulations. However, it is not about who has the strictest regulations, but it is about us following the common rules that we actually have. We have agreed on this - we will follow this. Then we can have stricter rules than the common position, but we can not have less strict rules and refer only to national law. We also have the Arms Trade Treaty, where there is an article that we do not have either in the common position or in Swedish legislation, and it is about gender-based violence. It is also something that we read into human rights, but that is a criterion that we do not include.We will also have that at some point in the future, I hope.When we then discuss where the level should be, I mean that we must always focus on having the best possible practice and not the worst possible practice.We must reach high, not aim low.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 236, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "La Présidente. –", "mepid": "96952", "text": "The debate is closed.The vote will take place on Wednesday, September 13, 2017.

I would like to thank the Hemicycle for the opportunity to debate an issue that has not often been on the agenda of our work here in the European Parliament but has been very much at the centre of our European Union work in diplomatic terms in the last years. I would also like to start by thanking the UN Security Council and all its Members for the new resolution on North Korea that was adopted just hours ago. I believe that in tough moments like this – the level of threat posed by North Korea to the region and the world is quite clear and unprecedented – only a united international community can help build effective solutions. This is needed because we are still far from the goal of a complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. Yet the international community did the right thing a few hours ago – strengthening the pressure on North Korea while calling at the same time for a peaceful solution to the crisis through a meaningful, credible, political dialogue; strengthening economic pressure – sanctions – and keeping the door of dialogue open, encouraging a meaningful, political diplomatic solution – a peaceful solution to this crisis. This is the way that the European Union has advocated in a very consistent manner over the months that are behind us, with all our means, through the European Members of the UN Security Council, in what has been a perfectly coordinated approach. We always highlight where Member States differ or where the European Union is not united. Let me tell you that this has been an excellent exercise of unity of our Member States and an excellent exercise of coordination of the European Union Member States that are Members of the Security Council, but also through our contacts with all our global partners and all our regional interlocutors. I spent part of August in Asia discussing with the Foreign Ministers of the United States, China, the Russian Federation, the Republic of Korea, Japan, exactly how to do this, trying to prevent a further escalation of the tensions, trying to open a political track, increasing the economic pressure but also keeping the political door open. First and foremost, our points of reference are the regional players. Our partners, our strategic partners in the region – the Republic of Korea and Japan, but also as I mentioned, China, the United States, the Russian Federation – and sometimes we are among the few to mention them, but they are key players in what is for us the fundamental global non-proliferation regime: the relevant international organisations, the ones that constitute the backbone of the non-proliferation regime globally. I met just last week with the director general-of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mr Amano, and the Executive Secretary of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization, Dr Zerbo. We will meet again next week in New York. The European Union is also strongly united and active in this field: support to the organisations on a daily basis for the technical work, allowing the international community to work on non-proliferation. To all of them I have expressed the European Union’s willingness and readiness to seek international unity and stronger economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea, also to avoid the risk of a military escalation. Through all these contacts, and the work also of our European Union delegations on the ground that I would like to thank for the tireless work they have been doing over the summer, we could count on the unity of all our Member States on our request for maximum pressure and critical political engagement. Last Thursday, just a few days ago in Tallinn, I met joined the meeting of the 28 EU Member States’ Foreign Ministers and we agreed to support together calls for the United Nations Security Council to take further measures in terms of economic restrictions on North Korea, including on the import and export of crude oil. I also invited ministers to consider new additional autonomous European Union sanctions. So, three elements to this work of pressure. We will now implement the new UN sanctions, as we have always done before. Second, we will work to make sure that all our international partners do the same, to ensure the maximum level of efficiency for the economic measures. And third, we will continue the discussion we launched last week on additional European sanctions to complement the action decided by the Security Council and put maximum pressure on North Korea. Of course, sanctions are not a goal in themselves, but an instrument to open the way for a political process to start: a way that today, unfortunately, is not working. Our objective is not the pressure alone: our objective is to open the political path for a solution to the crisis. For us – for the Europeans – economic and diplomatic pressure are always aimed at opening channels for credible, meaningful and fruitful dialogue. Our goal of a denuclearised Korean Peninsula can only be achieved through diplomatic and political means. There is no military way out of this crisis. We have said it loud in the European Union from the very beginning, and I was glad to see that the UN Security Council reaffirmed this in its discussions and deliberations a few hours ago. A military attack would be useless and harmful, as it could easily spiral into a large-scale conflict. The consequences would be totally unpredictable and certainly dramatic for the people of the Korean Peninsula, for the region, and most likely for the entire world. We will continue to work to open a credible political path towards the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. It will be one of the core issues also on my agenda in New York next week at the UN General Assembly’s ministerial week, and to all my interlocutors I will express the EU’s unity, determination and readiness first of all to assist our partners, to ensure North Korea engages in a credible and meaningful process, in a credible and meaningful dialogue aimed at the peaceful, verifiable denuclearisation of the Peninsula. On top of that, we will also continue our work for non-proliferation worldwide. We believe this has to be part of the credible united response the international community can put in place in these difficult months: the support we give to the IAEA, the support we give to the CTBTO, and clearly, the support we give and continue to give to the full implementation of the Iran nuclear deal that has shown to the world that, with patience, perseverance, diplomacy and political will, nuclear non-proliferation is indeed achievable.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 240, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "David McAllister", "mepid": "124806", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, as we have just heard, the recent developments in North Korea are very alarming. The latest nuclear threat – I guess we all agree – was another major provocation, and this is a huge threat not only to regional security, but to our international security. Moreover, it is also a direct and unacceptable violation of the country’s international obligations. We should therefore welcome that the United Nations Security Council on Monday unanimously adopted a US-drafted resolution to impose new sanctions on the regime in Pyongyang. It is a strong message that the international community is not willing to accept a nuclear-armed North Korea. In my capacity as chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I participated in last week’s EU foreign affairs meeting in Tallinn, chaired by Federica Mogherini. What I observed is that there was a broad consensus among the 28 foreign ministers and our High Representative that we have to strengthen our diplomatic efforts to persuade Pyongyang to abandon its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programmes in a complete, verifiable and also irreversible manner. In this respect, I believe the European Union could develop a more proactive policy, undertaken hand-in-hand with our strategic partners: South Korea, Japan and the United States – and, as the High Representative just pointed out, of course the roles of Russia and China are key. The 2015 Iran nuclear deal might be a blueprint for a process in which the EU and some Member States could play an active part.

What the DPRK is doing is playing with fire or, I should say, with nuclear fire, and we need to do everything we can to stop an escalation that could bring devastating consequences not only to the Korean Peninsula, but also to the wider region and to the entire world. The latest tests launched by North Korea, against provocations, against South Korea, against Japan, against the United States, are a clear and blatant violation of all UN Security Council resolutions. It is time for all forces both within and outside the UN Security Council to come together. The S&amp;D Group welcomes your efforts, Ms Mogherini, to have a concentrated approach but regrets the reluctance of the UN Security Council to adopt yesterday heavier sanctions, including a ban on oil imports.  The EU must make use of its diplomacy, as you rightly mention, to add additional economic pressure and autonomous sanctions against the regime in North Korea. At the same time, it is necessary to have a firm and convincing stance by regional actors like China and Russia, which are aware of the consequences they would face in the event of nuclear escalation, which obviously knows no borders. We have the positive example of the cooperation on the Iranian nuclear deal, which was reached in different circumstances but which shows that by acting seriously and all together, denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula can become a reality.

Decades ago we sat down, talked and found a way to peace and reconciliation in Europe. This is what the EU is about. In Asia, astonishingly, the Korean War is not over. For the last 64 years we have failed to get out of a state of war and sign a peace regime. Because security and prosperity in the EU is closely linked to peace in Asia, together we urgently need to bring the Korean Peninsula from an armistice into a post—conflict phase through a peace regime. Nuclear weapons are now a part of the Korean regime’s self-identity. It considers them as essential to its survival, not only as deterrent weapons – it has learned a lesson from Gaddafi and Hussein – but also as legitimacy weapons. This must be made a transitional position, and denuclearisation must remain our medium-term objective. Violations of the UN Security Council resolutions inevitably lead to sanctions: that is a given. Yet sanctions alone will not lead to denuclearisation nor to peace. Sanctions must come with optimistic diplomacy. Optimistic diplomacy believes that we all want – including the North Koreans – to live in peaceful coexistence. I am now happy that President Moon, Chancellor Merkel and many European leaders recognise the importance of diplomacy, a course of action I have been urging for the past three years, having had 42 meetings with North Koreans, South Koreans, Chinese, Americans and Japanese.

Through its nuclear program, Pyongyang seeks to balance the technological superiority of its main opponents, avoiding possible attempts at regime change and, at the same time, trying to impose its status as a nuclear power on the international community. A tightening of sanctions will hardly be enough to undermine this strategy.

Furthermore, the North Korean regime, paradoxically, makes proliferation the guarantee of its survival. The problem is that this time he has gone too far and is calling into question the credibility of his main interlocutor, China, and China's relationship with the United States. I agree with the diagnosis of the high representative: a nuclear and conventional escalation in the Korean peninsula must be avoided at all costs.

I fully support the approach that we need additional sanctions, and as has been mentioned today, a total ban on oil exports to North Korea and freezing the assets of the North Korean leadership. They would have some effect. But I think we need to pay attention to the loopholes. The first problem is China, which takes in more than 90% of North Korea’s exports and which has interest in keeping the regime going, seeing it as a useful tool to push America out of China’s sphere of influence. The second problem is Iran. North Korea is not alone. In fact, we face two extreme fanatic dictatorships that are complementary. They collaborate, supporting each other.

Now it would undoubtedly be a global scenario and requires global actors. The United Nations Security Council resolves sanctions with the difficulties imposed by three globally relevant actors: the United States and its understanding or disagreement with China and Russia. But the European Union cannot be entrusted to the two European states that have a permanent seat on the Security Council, nor to those who have an elective seat.

There is rationality in the North Korean leadership, despite the signs, and each power is primarily concerned with its own survival, so if it sees it in danger, it may be willing to change.

First of all, increasing the economic pressure. I have seen that all of you are very much aware of the fact that when you do not have a situation where political will is expressed in a credible manner, or in any way at all, there is the need for more pressure to be put on the economic and political side, and here the key is the unity of the international community.  This is why the vote in the UN Security Council yesterday night was so important because it sent a message to North Korea that the unity of the international community – from China that, yes indeed, plays a crucial role, to the Russian Federation, to the United States, to the European Union, to all the other members of the UN Security Council, so the entire international community – is strongly invested in this path.  More pressure to open diplomatic channels: North Korea has to feel the diplomatic pressure of a united international community.  The European Union will now do two things. On the economic path we will implement the UN Security Council resolutions, as we have always done, in the most strict and complete manner. We will also do a second thing that is very important because, as you know very well, the economic relations between the European Union and its Member States on one side, and the DPRK on the other, are not so relevant that they will have an economic impact that is, let us say, particularly impacting on the regime.  So we will work to make sure that others implement the UN Security Council resolutions, because some of you asked the crucial question that would probably come for later but it is also useful to put it on the table now: how come we are today in the situation where we are, in terms of developments in the DPRK’s nuclear programme, under what is quite a severe regime of sanctions from the UN system?  Here we have, together with our partners in the international community, a responsibility to work towards all third parties to make sure that the UN-based decisions, the UN Security Council sanctions, are implemented by all on the international scene.  And third, as many of you supported, work will go on in defining together in the European Union additional sanctions or additional autonomous measures that could complement the ones adopted by the Security Council.  But I think that the message the UN Security Council sent powerfully yesterday night was also the choice of diplomacy and of the political way rather than that of military escalation. And on this too the international community was united. And on this too, the European Union brought its weight, its proposal, to bear; this was our line from the beginning: economic pressure also as a way to prevent the risk of a military spiral. On the diplomatic side then, what are we going to do as the European Union from today onwards?  First of all, work to keep international unity. This is essential. Many of you referred to the risk of having to face a third world war. Well, the unity of the international community, the unity of the P5, the unity of the UN Security Council is somehow the best guarantee we can have that that tension, that crisis, will not develop in that direction. The UN system is our point of reference; we have to prove that we trust the UN system to prevent too major wars from happening. So first, we will continue to work with all – with all – to keep the unity of the international community. And again, when I say all, I mention the United States, I mention Russia, I mention China – with whom we have been working very well in the past and with whom we have constantly in these months worked at my level with their foreign ministers in New York, and locally – to think together about how to open diplomatic channels.  Not diplomatic channels – because diplomatic channels, including with the DPRK, are open; we have seven Member States that have embassies in Pyongyang. We have humanitarian programmes run by some Member States in Pyongyang and in the DPRK. When I say diplomatic channels, I mean a system of mediation of diplomatic talks that can guarantee a credible engagement, because talks for talks are not necessarily a good idea.  What we need is to create the conditions in the international community with all our partners, including with the European Union, for credible and meaningful diplomatic negotiations.  This is the second thing we will do. Coordinate with our partners, starting with China, Russia, the United States and our regional partners – the Republic of Korea needs to feel ownership and to lead the way somehow; the President has shown wisdom and determination, and I think we have somehow a privileged access and channel of exchange, we have regular contact with the foreign minister and again we will continue this very frequently – and with Japan, to make sure that there is a concerted, united understanding of how best to open this credible diplomatic path.  Many of you referred to the experience, the knowledge that the European Union has in this kind of a situation. We have obviously quite a deep knowledge and know-how and experience when it comes to nuclear negotiations, nuclear negotiations linked to sanction regimes. We have been running the Iran negotiations for quite some years with a successful result.  There the unity of the international community was key. But there was another element there that was essential and that we do not have at the moment in the situation of the DPRK, which is the political will. You cannot mediate or offer the goodwill of an honest broker unless you see real determination, a real political will to engage in negotiations. That door, that little space still needs to be opened and this is where we need the unity of the international community to push for that little space to be opened, then we can definitely work for a diplomatic negotiation that might take a lot of time, but is always possible.  Again I do not particularly like the parallels between the situation in Iran and in the DPRK. The political systems are very different, their histories are very different. The two countries are completely different and I do not think it is a good service to the reality of history and of the current situation to make a parallel between the two, but yes, the confidence, the know-how, the skills, the experience of the European Union in this field are ready to be used to accompany such a process, provided we start to see an opening in the political will to engage seriously to find a peaceful solution to this tension.

I believe we have a serious responsibility as Europeans to look at the facts. Many times, in particular when electoral debates get heated or when political confrontations turn even more heated than electoral debates, we have the tendency to say a lot, without necessarily looking at the facts, and I would start with two facts.  First, that there are no shortcuts when we deal with the issue of migration. It is a global massive phenomenon that does not relate only to the European Union. It is a global phenomenon, with more movement of people within continents like Africa or Asia than towards the European Union. There are no shortcuts; there is a complexity that needs to be faced as it is. The second fact is that the measures we have – finally – started to put in place are starting to show the first results. I believe that we must never forget the starting points, the fundamentals, and we should go back to basics, which is the human dimension of the phenomenon. Behind every number that you hear on TV there are people: men, women, and children. People with names, stories, hopes, fears, expectations, and sometimes terrible stories to tell when they manage to tell them. The starting point for us is their continuing suffering and death. Men, women and children who have left their homes in search of a better life. I have heard myself — and I believe many of you have done the same — stories from detention camps in Libya; when we speak to migrants or aid workers in Lampedusa you hear things no one should hear, and no one should live through. I have seen for myself the images of men and women marked like animals by the human smugglers. We have to realise that this is a new form of slavery and we are facing with this a tragedy that not one of us can underplay or ignore.  At the same time, the work we have been doing over the last two years – and I say ‘finally’ because we have come too late to act as Europeans on this issue – finally the things we have put in place in the last two years are starting to bear fruit. Hundreds of thousands of people have been saved from death. Let me be clear, even one that is not saved – even one – is too much, but the fact that we are starting to see the results of some policies that we have finally started to put in place, and that are starting to save lives and protect rights, is positive.  Thousands have received food and medicines, thanks to our cooperation with the UN agencies and first of all, I would like to thank the IOM, UNHCR and UNICEF for the work they have started to do with us. They have always been doing this work, but we have developed a new partnership with them, reinforcing their work, providing political support, financial resources, access in some places to which they did not have access before.  This partnership is for us the guiding line of our action. Thousands were given the opportunity to go back home in a dignified, voluntary way and to begin a new life, thanks to the European Union. We have, I believe, a responsibility to also look at these stories and continue with more determination on this path that we have finally started to walk. There has been a considerable reduction in the number of people crossing the Mediterranean and the desert. The number of migrants risking their lives in the central Mediterranean has gone down by 17% compared to last year. The number of people crossing through Niger has dropped from over 330 000 in 2016 to less than 40 000 so far in 2017. These trends reflect the work we have done over the last year and more recently, together with Member States, international organisations and in line with immigration compacts and the Action Plan on measures to support Italy.  Dialogue with our partners in Africa and beyond is progressing fast and well. This year alone, some 4 000 people returned voluntarily from Niger. The number of people returning from Libya has almost tripled, from 2 500 last year to over 7 000 this year up until now.  Reducing the number of crossings goes hand in hand for us with a renewed effort to fight effectively against smuggling and trafficking; fighting the business model, fighting the forms of organised crime that arranges this slavery in new forms.  Operation Sophia continues its anti-smuggling operations at sea and the training and capacity building of the Libyan coastguards. Before the summer, the Council amended the mandate of Operation Sophia. It also set up a monitoring mechanism for trainees so that we can ensure the long-term efficiency of training the Libyan coastguards, monitoring the way in which they operate after we have trained them.  This is essential, not only in terms of efficiency and the control of the seas. In terms of anti-smuggling activities, this is also a fundamental element for us to control the standards of human rights respect that are part of the training of the Libyan coastguard and which we want to see fully implemented. As for Libya’s borders, our border assistance mission is planning for a possible training and advisory mission inside the country. Our engagement with the Libyan authorities is increasing already, particularly on border management, law enforcement and in support of the criminal justice system. Most recently we have launched a EUR 46 million programme to help manage the southern border of Libya, run together with the Italian Ministry of the Interior.  To the south of Libya, we are present, as you might know, with three European Union military missions in the Sahel and with our support for the creation of a G5 Sahel joint force. We signed a contract with EUR 50 million just two months after our partners in the G5 countries had asked for support, establishing for the first time ever a joint force among them to better control the territory – which is very difficult territory to control: desert, long borders – with the precise aim of fighting and preventing terrorism and radicalisation but also smuggling and trafficking of all kinds, including the links between human smuggling and trafficking, arms trafficking and drug trafficking.  We know very well there are many connections there that need to be broken, and they can be better broken by the local actors who know the territory, know the people, know the economies, know the communities. Our work is to support them doing this difficult work for their own sake and also for the sake of those that put their lives in the hands of criminal organisations. In parallel, European Union agencies such as Europol and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency have greatly strengthened their capacity and improved their cooperation with our military missions and operations. In Asia alone, 101 alleged smugglers have been brought before the court. Another 79 have been arrested and 74 vehicles and motorcycles have been confiscated. This is the result of the work of our joint investigation teams together with our EUCAP mission and the authorities of Niger.  This is the partnership approach: defining the needs, working with the local authorities, setting the highest possible standards when it comes to human rights’ protection and putting the right resources at the disposal of those that know the local situation better. An initial success story that we now want to replicate at regional level, linking up countries of origin, transit and destination with the support of these UN-EU agencies. And yet our commitment goes well beyond border management. I believe that the time when we had the illusion of managing migration flows only through border management has gone. We have now finally understood not only that we need to act as Europeans all together but also that we need to act on what we usually define as the root causes: poverty, climate change, lack of democratic spaces, violations of human rights, opportunities for life. With our migration compacts we are discussing directly with our partners in Africa – governments but also local authorities, civil society organisations, international agencies and NGOs that are present on the ground – how to best invest in the sustainable development of these countries, of these communities, because in one single country, you can have areas where support in this respect is not particularly needed but maybe a few tens of kilometres away from there, you have a community that is completely exposed to the trafficking and the smuggling.  So you need to diversify the approach, developing a partnership that is oriented to deliver results on the ground. The EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa has with this approach already mobilised almost EUR 2 billion and our investments are meant first and foremost to create jobs, create skills, and create better security conditions for growth.  I can share with you an anecdote that maybe I told you before, about the first time I visited Agadez. Agadez is on the main route into Libya, north of Niger, in the middle of the desert, a beautiful place. I landed at an airport that is now basically closed, and the first thing I heard from the local community is ‘Here, we have always welcomed tourists’.  Then the security situation deteriorated, the terrorist threat increased, tourists are not coming any more, the economy reconverted on smuggling and trafficking. So if you want to develop alternative economies, to offer alternatives to the youth of these communities, to stop the criminal organisations and to invest in sustainable, good economies you need also to work on the security side of the territory, otherwise a normal, strong, healthy economy would have more difficulties to take root.  This is also a way of addressing the root causes of the migratory flows as well as is – and I have mentioned this here many times, and I think I have the full support of this Hemicycle on this – our constant and determined work on climate change. So many people leave their communities because of the consequences of climate change, especially in the areas of the desert.  The External Investment Plan, on which this Parliament has worked so well – and I would like to thank here the three committees that have worked in a really remarkable way jointly and I know that many were sceptical about three committees working together on such a complicated measure – the External Investment Plan is now ready. It will mobilise unprecedented levels of private resources in the most fragile areas of Africa and our region, with the objective of implementing the Sustainable Development Goals, but at the end of the day the two agendas coincide, because if we had the Sustainable Development Goals fully implemented, there would also be a clear impact on the migratory flows. No one invests as much as we do in Africa. I know that some argue about the need for a Marshall Plan for Africa. I often mention the amount of euro the European Union and its Member States invest in different forms, from development to humanitarian security, in Africa. That is EUR 20 billion every year. The External Investment Plan is going to mobilise even more, aiming at raising EUR 44 billion in private investments.  We definitely need to use this money in a sense of partnership with our African friends and I believe that the next EU-African Union Summit in Abidjan at the end of November will be exactly this: moving from the concept of aid to the concept of partnership. Working together and facing together common challenges and taking advantage together of common opportunities, and also working together on common issues we have close to our hearts: multilateralism, a certain way of understanding security and peace, climate change and the multilateral agenda.  While we have initial steps forward that we need to recognise on migration, I think we have to keep very firmly in mind that we still have a very long and a very difficult way to go. I said at the beginning that there is no shortcut. We have internal contradictions in the European Union and I am sure you will hear more from President Junker about this tomorrow – it is not my fight – but it is important that we never close our eyes to the unacceptable conditions that so many human beings are still facing on the route.  Let me start with the detention centres in Libya. As you know I do not hide the difficult topics, on the contrary, and let me tell you it is exactly because I heard the stories of those who were escaping from those detention centres and arrived in Lampedusa that I keep a constant eye on how we can better protect and save lives. If you hear those stories once, believe me you do not forget them.  Our line here is clear: detention conditions at the moment fail to meet any basic condition of decency. Detention centres in their current form should be closed. This is something we keep discussing in all our meetings with the Libyan authorities. As long as these centres do exist inside Libya, we are working with our international partners on the ground to guarantee they have access to these detention centres – a very difficult discussion to have and a very difficult thing to do given the security conditions inside Libya – with the aim of improving the living conditions of the people that are currently in the centres, and I would like here to thank the courage and the determination of the IOM, the UNHCR, UNICEF, and their staff for the incredible work they have started to do.  They have now developed a work inside Libya, and that is the result of the common work we have started. We are supporting financially, politically and logistically, whenever we can, their work inside Libya exactly for that purpose, because we see that things are unacceptable in these centres. But still, too few international staff are currently present in Libya and we do want to see an increased international presence in the very short term. I will personally stress this point once again during my meetings in New York next week. While the humanitarian conditions of detention are our top concern, second comes the need to provide durable solutions for the people stuck inside Libya because we have to realise that if detention centres were to be closed tomorrow – and as I said, we believe that under the current conditions we see in the detention centres that they should be closed or the conditions should be radically changed – but if they were to be closed tomorrow, thousands would be trapped and lost in a country that is in difficult security conditions and where they do not want to stay.  So when I say there is a complexity of the phenomenon that needs to be tackled seriously, with no shortcuts, that is what I am talking about. And this is why we have chosen to invest in our partnership with the international organisations that have the knowledge and the highest international standards for human rights to help us in tackling this issue, for us and our partners, the authorities of, in this case, Libya but it is also true for other countries.  So we need to be ready to offer two clear paths here: for those in need of protection we need safe and legal avenues, including to Europe and this is a debate that inside our own Member States, in our national parliaments and probably also in this Parliament – you know very well it is a difficult debate. But let me stress this. Those in need of protection need to have safe legal avenues, including to Europe.  Second, for those that are not in need of protection, we need to offer them a dignified safe way to go back home and restart a life in a community that has probably invested everything they had to send them away to look for a better future and send back remittances. Going back means being accompanied back and this is where we come in also. We follow all along the way to offer ways to restart a life, a small business, a different kind of future once people are going back. Last December, we started a programme with the IOM that is showing first positive results. We intend to offer a safe way out to over 10 000 people by the end of the year, from Libya.  Last but not least, we need to provide an alternative to local communities that rely on smuggling for their daily subsistence. I can think here of the many communities – I mentioned one just a few minutes ago – of northern Niger or south of Libya. In this field, we have launched massive investments to create jobs and provide training, but as I said, this is a work that we need to do together with the local communities, together with the local authorities and guaranteeing at the same time support for a better security environment in the region.  Ultimately, I think we can summarise this approach in one sentence. We need to replace the illegal economy of human trafficking and smuggling, the new slavery, with the regular system of opportunities and channels to safely reach Europe and elsewhere for those in need. Remembering one important thing which is, I know, very unpopular in our political domestic debates but which is the reality of our economy. If regular migrants in Europe were to disappear tomorrow morning, entire sectors of our economies would collapse. It is something to keep in the back of our minds.  It is clear that the European Union cannot do this all alone. First of all we need to have the entire European Union backing this approach. We need consistency and coherence, we need Member States to invest in this approach consistently and with coherence – I was glad to see that many of them are now realising how important it is to invest in these partnerships – and we have to build global alliances to manage this phenomenon.  One year ago, two years ago, it was all about the European migration crisis. I think that today we have managed – again, finally, and we are just starting to see the results – but we have managed to put in place some elements of an intelligent policy based on partnership that our African partners recognise as useful, that our international partners, starting with IOM, UNHCR and the UN system recognise as right.  We need to increase the work on the global compacts for migration and for refugees. Next year we will have an important process leading to this. In the UN system the EU, I believe, has the responsibility to build this partnership approach based especially on our EU-African partnership that we have developed over the last year, and we will relaunch even more strongly at the Summit in Abidjan.

It is an issue that must be addressed – indeed that can only be addressed – by sincere cooperation between the European Union, countries of origin and countries of transit. Papering over the cracks without taking the tough decisions necessary to deal with the issue in the long term must no longer be an option. The joint statement touches on a number of important points, and I welcome the renewed focus that it gives to the issue. This means that we have to work hand in hand with countries, particularly in Africa, not only to help build up their law enforcement, the judicial systems and border management, but also to help with their education systems and entrepreneurship and ensure a future for people closer to their homes – something this Parliament has long called for. But we need more. We need to move the debate away from emergency solutions and emergency funds and start talking about long—term proposals and proper investment and economic cooperation strategies. We have to keep putting our money where our mouth is. It is not only about aid, but it is now also becoming about encouraging our companies to invest in Africa. Significantly, I welcome the focus on improving the conditions for migrants in Libya. The horror stories we keep hearing make it impossible to ignore, as we have just said. At the same time, within Europe we must ensure that those who are not entitled to international protection are returned to their countries of origin. This is essential if we are to direct our resources to give protection to those who need it. In conclusion, the reality on the ground is that, where there is no hope, the people will continue to look for any avenue to flee, irrespective of the risk to their lives. We must think long term and we must ensure that traffickers are not allowed to fill the void and exploit the most vulnerable. The European Union has a crucial role to play on the world stage and in giving the issue more traction. We need to continue to move from statements to tangible concrete results.

This is in The Gambia and we have been there with the Human Rights Commission, a village where there is no work. Are fewer young people actually leaving there? Where are your proposals to achieve that, the real poverty reduction?

I agree on one thing: you told us about internal contradictions in the European Union. And, I add, also a great hypocrisy within the European Union. We talked about humanitarian issues, we talked about violence, torture, we talked about people who are extremely vulnerable and in need of protection. But we note a strong internal contradiction in the European Union between an ideal model, a Union made up of solidarity, cooperation, protection of fundamental rights, and a real model, which is visible to all, of the European Union: a cynical model, a ruthless model, a model that is ready to continue to follow the trend already undertaken with the agreements with Turkey and, therefore, to give money, whatever the cost, as long as the arrivals of migrants in Europe cease. So, if we have to look at the facts - I take your invitation - let's look at the facts: we see that the European Union has allocated EUR 46 million for Libya. However, we have an investigation by a news agency, the Associated Press, which was picked up by the main newspapers across Europe and around the world, which tells us about an agreement between the government of Tripoli and the militiamen. An agreement that seems to have even been supported by the Italian government: it seems that Italian officials were present. So, this is unacceptable to us. I ask you, Vice President Mogherini, as Vice President of the Commission and as an Italian, to ascertain whether what emerged from this investigation is true. Because it would be completely unacceptable for a European Union that advocates for fundamental rights to allocate EUR 46 million to fundamentally pay militiamen, fundamentally to pay for traffickers, who were previously paid by desperate asylum seekers, ready to do anything to escape from war situations e of persecutions; today we have traffickers who are probably paid with EU funds to block those same landings. Then we must shed light on what is happening, because otherwise it is useless to continue talking about compassion, solidarity, cooperation. We must face the facts: this is not the European Union that looks after the protection of fundamental rights. We want a European Union where there is real cooperation, where there is real control over where these funds that are allocated go. We need to see if this money goes into the hands of the traffickers. We have the recent ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union, which rejected Hungary's appeals for the failure to relocate migrants. Here, then, we want a European Union in which the rules and principles, the values ​​contained in the treaties, are respected. We want solidarity, we want cooperation, we want respect for fundamental rights, we want the management of migratory flows not to be entrusted to traffickers but there are legal and safe ways of access for those who have the right to international protection.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 296, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Mario Borghezio", "mepid": "21817", "text": "on behalf of the ENF Group. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the accusation of hypocrisy is partial, because there is another one: it is that of duplicity, because you in this House thanked the NGOs, but you forgot to say even one word on the shadows that are gathering over the work of some of them and, above all, in claiming the blocking of landings for the European Union, he did not spend a word to defend Minister Minniti, of whom I am an opponent in Italy, but that he was a gentleman for his honesty, publicly declaring as a minister that he had decided to take a tough action to block the landings, because Italy's democratic holding was threatened!

I would like to begin by thanking you, Madam High Representative, for today's speech, and I would like to highlight a few positive things that deserve attention. Firstly, the good news is that many aspects of the crisis are gradually improving, whether it is effective identification procedures, the introduction of new security features, the functioning of Frontex or bilateral agreements with Turkey and Libya. All of these things are gradually mitigating the effects of the crisis, and we see that the European Union is taking steps in the right direction and must continue to do so. However, this is the imaginary tip of the iceberg of the whole migration crisis, because there are also many negative phenomena that the entire European Union must deal with and, for example, help to address the countries most affected by the economic crisis, namely Italy. It is, for example, the cooperation of some non-profit organizations with smugglers, which has been pointed out by the Italian authorities. The biggest shock, however, is that a number of renowned organizations are on the list of these revealed non-profit organizations, which proves the depth of this problem. There is an exploitation of refugees and migrants, it is not just about the financial profit that these organizations get from it. I mentioned this last night and I am happy to repeat it, it is necessary to mobilize forces to combat this business and it is necessary for the European Union to help the Italian Government to force these organizations to stop this business with migrants. And now to a technical remark: can you, Madam President, tell me, according to which rule is not a blue card granted to someone who has speaking time in the debate? And the second question is, why do you selectively repeatedly deny me blue cards when I want to respond to someone in plenary?", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 299, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Die Präsidentin.", "mepid": "97017", "text": "- Mr. Zdechovský!That is one of the possibilities that we have here from the Bureau, when we are very advanced in the time, that we declare that those who are either still talking in the same debate or those who have already spoken in the debate,no longer get the floor over a blue card.I didn't come at the beginning of the debate, I came a little later.You then asked for the floor.After looking at the passage of time, I have decided, and will now say this again, that no one who is still on the list, but also no one who has already spoken, like Mrs in 't Veld, who is now giving you a blue oneWanted to ask a card, I gave the floor.I hope you can accept that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 300, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Elena Valenciano (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "4334", "text": "- Madam President, the truth is that I believe that without foreign action there is no possible migration policy, and in my group we have always defended that the management of migration requires a global perspective, which is what the high representative defends. I want to thank you, Mrs Mogherini, not only for all the work that she does, but for her commitment, her dedication and her responsibility to this Parliament, to which she is always accountable. My colleagues have said many things that I would also repeat, but it is a shame, because time here is money. It seems to me that what is happening is that the short term - which is what the Council practices - is undermining the long-term solution. Foreign action is deployed to go to the root of the problems, above all. Because if we don't go to the root of the problems, we are simply not solving the crisis, which is not a crisis, because it is a structural problem. But as the Member States want immediate solutions, as the message that is being sold is that we must try to prevent migrants and refugees from reaching our borders, all the work that is done in the long term is damaged because the European Union appears, also, as the one that does not respect international law - we are talking about children, we could talk about women - as that unit that, in reality, is fractured and does not respect its own commitments.

One of the realities of course is in particular: What are the Member States of the European Union actually ready for when we talk about aid? I have the feeling that this is permanently neglected here. There is a representative here for every country, there are many representatives. But we also have to have the courage to decide and say: To what extent can we help? Because reality means that we cannot plan anything in the dark that we cannot then realize at all. It is precisely this topic that requires us to be very sensitive on the one hand, but also to say in clear words what is feasible and what cannot. I have absolutely no understanding that we are now only referring to the humanitarian aspect. We all agree: Of course we want to help, but we cannot help indefinitely!

I would like to start with a statement which, if misinterpreted, may sound quite provocative. I am of the opinion: Africa needs more capitalism. However, not in the sense of the often assumed exploitative expression of the word, but in the sense of the possibilities to offer incentives for individuals to be innovative, to invest and to create added value. As long as Africa's population grows much faster than its economy and the governments put their own power interests before the well-being of the population, people will always emigrate and flee, and each one of us would do that too. Development aid must therefore always go hand in hand with building sustainable political and economic structures. I therefore believe that we need to focus on specific projects at the local level. The Committee of the Regions' Nicosia Initiative is a good example. Unfortunately, it is underfunded and not well known. But if we find 1,000 European cities that enter into a partnership with 1,000 cities in Africa and cooperate there from building and operating a hospital to garbage disposal or agriculture, we will achieve tangible improvements for the individual. At the same time, we should create a kind of European Fulbright system. African students should come to the European Union for a year or two and then return to their home country.

Still, I do not think that you, Federica Mogherini, respond to that criticism. You pretend it barely existed. The EU today is associated with deportations to war and conflict, to dirty deals with Erdoğan and now with Libya, to a continent that is forcing people to remain in completely inhumane conditions in Libya. Those who save lives in the Mediterranean are even accused of collaborating with smugglers and stopping their activities. How low should we sink? Criticism of this policy is growing. In Sweden, we now have a popular movement that demands that \"Fort Europa\" be stopped and that deportations to Afghanistan, for example, be stopped.

The objective of European refugee policy is clear: With the relocation of the European external borders far into the African continent, as many refugees as possible should be prevented from reaching the EU's external borders. The idea of ​​introducing European asylum procedures in African countries is not new. A German interior minister campaigned for this back in 2004. At that time, the contradiction between isolationist interests and human rights claims in favor of the human rights of refugees emerged. Today the outsourcing of the European asylum procedure to Africa is simply announced. Breaches of international law and violations of international conventions are becoming more and more a matter of course, from the EU-Turkey agreement to deportations to war zones. Breaches of the law, broken words and the mantra-like repetition of false claims and political errors shape the European refugee policy and that of many member states. Instead of making migration possible in a regulated manner, one makes oneself dependent on dictators, promotes the militarization of unstable regions such as currently in the Sahel belt and favors mafia militias.

Now the Visegrád countries have been forced to become multicultural or at least receive thousands of migrants. Do they want it? No! Did they vote for it? No, they do not. The ruling elite and the various leaders in Europe's countries are constantly finding new solutions. In September 2015, there were mandatory quotas. In May 2016, there was a permanent redistribution mechanism. You talked a lot about distribution keys last year. Now it's hotspots that apply. Macron and Merkel have already bypassed the EU and want to conclude an agreement on this themselves, but what if they set up a system of hotspots at the same time as we have a distribution mechanism? Should Sweden be forced to accept migrants through this mechanism as well? New ideas are constantly being put forward on how to force this migration on the people of Europe, and this shows that they are not trying to solve the root of the problem but only making mass migration to Europe a permanent state. Will it be a modular house in Bratislava now? Sitting strikes in Budapest? It remains to be seen, but the voters in 2019 may ask themselves whether they should trust us who have warned that migration is not the solution to all problems or those who have recently realized this.

The Agreement with Turkey has slowed migration flows avoiding deaths in the eastern Mediterranean, but the problem has moved to another dangerous route between Libya and Italy, where traffickers have made the market in human beings their way of life. I therefore welcome the Commission's measures to assist Libya in border management and immigration, and also the extension of the Sofia military mission to combat human trafficking in the central Mediterranean. The answer to the migration challenge is to collaborate with the countries of origin and transit in matters of return and border control. But if we continue without solving the causes that cause people to have to emigrate, such as war, terrorism and extreme poverty, our effort will be useless. Nobody leaves their land, their home and endangers the lives of their children, if it is not because death is on their heels. Those are the refugees that I have seen in Greece, in Italy, in Lebanon, all with the same look of hopelessness. Looking for an answer that does not arrive, because there is a gap between what is said and what is done. Relocation mechanisms are slow, and we must step up the pace of reception. Relocation is not a choice, it is an obligation for all Member States. The security of the external borders must be strengthened, because it is the best way to preserve the free movement of people, which for me is one of the greatest advances in this European project.

The second is a common rule of law that is actually aimed at all member states. It does not work when Hungary and others say: Let the European Court of Justice decide what it wants, we will not do it, and then we will pretend that the Commission is to blame, because it does its humanitarian work from the start could have been.

Pending this happening, we need to accelerate on the issue of relocations, which have now reached 17% compared to the original plan. That is why, in line with what this Parliament proposed in its resolution of 18 May, the deadline must be extended beyond 26 September in order to ensure that the 160 000 asylum seekers are relocated.

Secondly, it was the wrong policy to tell every illegal immigrant from all over the world \"You are welcome on the European continent\". Third is the ongoing unreasonable policy of forcible resettlement of illegal immigrants in European Union countries. Let me remind you, colleagues, that there are countries in the European Union that do not have a colonial past, that there are countries that are not responsible for damage, genocide caused on the territory of other nations and on other continents, and it is absolutely unreasonable to force these nations , despite the will of their nation states to accept quotas from illegal immigrants.

I therefore hope that the recent judgment of the European Court of Justice can give an extra push in the right direction. However, we cannot sit back.

I believe that this Parliament, in addition to being a European Parliament, is also made up of women and men who have political roles, within political parties, in the Member States. Then perhaps we also need a reflection on how to ensure the political coherence of the Union's work. Because it is true that there is still a lot of work to be done on coherence, solidarity and not closing our eyes to the fact that this is a phenomenon that will remain with us, as Europeans, for a long time. To close oneself in the illusion that we can raise a wall and only postpone the solution of the problem will remain outside. What we can do, instead, is to act together, sharing responsibility, which also means sharing hospitality, and as Europeans we can manage it: we are the richest continent in the world, we are the continent that guarantees rights more than anywhere else of the world, we are the continent to which it is recognized today, as opposed to a few years ago, a possibility and a capacity for leadership on the way it is It is possible to build partnerships to manage a complex problem together. I believe that if we recognize this need, if we recognize the reality of the facts, we give ourselves more tools to respond to the problems of our citizens as well. Denying them is usually not a good starting point for trying to fix them. I would like to conclude by quoting the words of Pope Francis. Gianni Pittella remembered him: I think he used very important words. I am always struck by his ability to keep his heart together, but also his rationality, common sense, the ability to call each of us to reasonableness as people, as citizens, as part of a community. And Pope Francis, in thanking also and above all Italy and Greece, which are the Member States of the European Union who have undertaken an enormous job, initially in solitude, and which I believe today deserve the recognition of a weight that have brought in the name and on behalf of the whole of Europe, and to whom we must offer support and solidarity and whose proposals we must listen to, because they know the phenomenon more than many, who perhaps refuse to put into practice European proposals or measures, and then when asked: \"But exactly, how many irregular migrants from the Ivory Coast are there in your country?\" it turns out there is one, maybe two. So let's also listen to the proposals that come from countries that are at the forefront, because they are the ones who know the reality of the phenomenon and how it can be managed together in a sustainable way. Here, together with the word \"management\" I believe that there is the word \"sustainability\". I said that Pope Francis thanked Italy and Greece - and I believe that we as Europeans have a duty to do so - because they have kept our hearts open and I believe that this is an appeal to each of us as servants of the institutions: I don't think is do-gooders; I believe that if politics and institutions lose the sense of their humanity, they are unlikely to be able to serve their own citizens. There is a human element that guides political action, otherwise politics loses its meaning, and I believe that this is the common basis of our working together; as Europeans we certainly have our common root in humanism. But the Pope has indicated a sort of action plan, which I think very beautifully reflects a large part of the things that we have tried, we have begun to implement in recent months and years. First: welcome and integration. This concerns the internal policies of the Union and not only the Union, because it is not only the European Union that has to manage this phenomenon: let us think of the United States, which has chosen another path at the moment; let's think of Canada; let us think of some countries in Latin America or Asia, which are facing similar phenomena with different policies and with different responses. First, I said, welcome and integration, which are linked to each other and I believe that, with great realism, Pope Francis recognizes that the only limit of hospitality is the capacity of each country to integrate and give a future. Second: work to improve living conditions in the fields in Libya and the Sahel. Here I would like to be very clear: this is exactly what the European Union, together with the United Nations agencies, is trying to do. Are we succeeding? Very partially. Too little. But we are starting to have results. Someone earlier said that UNHCR and IOM are not present in Libya. This is not true: they are present in Libya, thanks to funding from the European Union and a work being done, with the Libyan authorities, to give UNHCR and IOM access to the camps, check health conditions, offer protection , distribute food and water: this is a minimum, a minimum of first response. It's enough? No. Is that what we want? No. But we are the only ones, the only ones, who are asking themselves the problem of how to help the migrants they are in right now they are trapped in Libya in the hands of traffickers. And I can tell you that our African partners, whose nationalities are present in these camps in Libya, are thanking us. And these are people who in some cases we are helping to return voluntarily, with assisted returns, to their countries of origin. Because it's also about saving lives. So, I go back to asking: is our action enough? No, but I believe that a responsible European Union is a European Union that sees the problem, confronts it and tries to solve it, even when the solution is not one hundred percent satisfactory. We could improve, of course, but at least we are taking on a problem. And it's not that a year ago, two years ago or seven years ago this problem didn't exist: those who are Italian know it very well. The stories heard in Lampedusa five years ago were the same. Third: work for the growth of the African continent: economic growth, social growth, democratic growth. And I believe that this is truly the great turning point of our joint action. Partnership with Africa: not only and not so much with governments, but with the people; the growth of potential, the young people of Africa, the women of Africa, a partnership that looks not only at economic investments, including private ones, but also at participation, democracy, respect for human rights. I therefore believe that our task is to continue doing what we have finally - too late perhaps, but for the first time - undertaken: to increase the level of coherence and common responsibility within our Union; to show pride in what we have finally managed to put in place, including saving lives, but also to be very clear on how to be European, because there cannot be part-time Europeanism; one cannot think of being European on some policies and national on others. The European Union has many things to improve, to change - President Juncker will say many tomorrow - but I believe that we need this basic element of common solidarity.A family helps itself when one of the members is most in difficulty;on another case, on another theme, on another policy, solidarity can be reversed.This is the meaning of being together.I believe that this is also the basis for giving an effective and effective response also to internal management with regard to reception and integration.As you know, the Commission is also working on the Dublin regulation plan: Commissioner Avramopoulos has spoken to you about it many times and it is not from these banks that the problem can be solved.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 343, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Die Präsidentin. –", "mepid": "97017", "text": "The debate is closed.Written statements (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 344, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Kinga Gál (PPE)", "mepid": "28150", "text": "in writing. - In his introductory remarks, Frederica Mogherini, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, reported that the number of returns of illegal migrants had increased, that they were stepping up their efforts to curb human traffickers and assisting the Libyan coastguard. I all agree with these measures, but at the same time they are incapable of solving the current migration crisis on their own. There can be only one solution, and that is to separate economic migrants from real refugees before they enter Europe. This approach has been outlined by the Hungarian Prime Minister in his ten-point Schengen 2.0 action plan for more than a year and a half. It must be made crystal clear that only real refugees and only legally can enter the territory of the European Union. At the same time, the EU must finally acknowledge that no mandatory quota distribution program is suitable for tackling the migration crisis, as it is interpreted by illegal migrants as an invitation and an encouragement to human traffickers. Even the Member States that support and accept the migrant quota have not relocated the migrants imposed on them, so it may be that only 25% of the target was relocated a few days before the decision expired on 26 September.

Once again, we must point to the instability and ongoing military conflicts in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East as the main causes. The complexity and scale of the crisis require a joint and coordinated effort by all Member States and pan-European solidarity. In fact, it is precisely the ineffective individual actions of the Member States on migration that make EU citizens feel incapable of coping with the crisis, and this generates xenophobia and intolerance.

On many crucial issues we disagree with our Turkish interlocutors, from freedom of speech to the rule of law. Academics, journalists, civil society and critical voices have come under increasing pressure. The detention in July of another 10 human rights defenders, including EU nationals, was the latest in a long series of extremely worrying episodes. We cannot, we do not, and we will continue not to ignore these current negative developments. In our dialogue we insist that Turkey respect the highest democratic standards it has committed to as a candidate country to the European Union and as a member of the Council of Europe. This was the spirit of the meeting between Presidents Tusk, Juncker and Erdoğan on 25 May, and this is the spirit of the High Representative’s regular meetings with her counterpart, Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu. The same applies to my encounters with the same Minister Çavuşoğlu, but also Minister Çelik, the European Minister of Turkey, and other members of the Government. Turkey is also our neighbour and a key player in a strategic region for the European Union. We are partners – difficult partners sometimes – but we work together on many different files that are fundamental both for the European Union and for Turkey, from counter-terrorism to migration to Syria, to name but a few. Our dialogue with Turkey on all these files is essential for all European citizens, for all Turkish citizens and for our entire region. Our dialogue is open, frank, critical, sometimes constructive, sometimes very difficult. Most recently at our high-level political dialogue on 25 July in Brussels, the High Representative and I made it clear to our Turkish counterparts that there is an urgent need for the current trend to be reversed if we want our reciprocal engagement to be sustainable. This goes for the domestic situation, with continued dismissals, suspensions and arrests, but equally so for bilateral relations between Turkey and some EU Member States. A month ago we agreed with our Turkish counterparts that we should all talk less about each other, and more to each other. Everyone could benefit from a more constructive attitude. At the same time, we must not lose sight of the long-term and, perhaps even more importantly, of the many people in Turkey who are also concerned, as we are, with the current trends. Let me end by noting that in our dialogue with Turkish opposition members, human rights defenders and journalists, the majority of them urge us to continue our dialogue with Turkey. Let us keep this in mind as we reflect on the next steps in our relationship. Meine Damen und Herren!

When I say \"political developments\", I am referring, of course, to the constitutional referendum and above all to the numerous attacks on human rights and fundamental freedoms which have affected important categories of the population, ranging from journalists to the military, in particular. passing of course through school or university teachers. The Copenhagen criteria are clear and we must respect them. However, if at Parliament level the position is fixed, we are waiting for the Council to do the same. We can no longer afford to discuss Turkey and our present relationship with this country through several voices that are contradictory. In order to be credible, we must coordinate and not leave it to Ankara to do what suits him. I think the time has come to decide on a route to take and that we take responsibility for that choice. This is all the more important as Turkey is now a very important partner for the Union and all its Member States, and this applies to a multitude of areas. Migration and trade are just two visible aspects of this partnership. Therefore, it is necessary to know where this relationship is going and on what coordinates it will evolve in the short and medium term. In other words, if we take the prospect of membership off the negotiating table, what else do we put on? How do we see the future of the relationship between Brussels and Ankara? I think this question should not be taken lightly, because it is essential for the continuity of this relationship, but also for the image and credibility of the European Union in Turkey.If we are reacting to the Turkey of today, we must act with the Turkey of tomorrow in mind.This is also why, as rapporteur for the opinion of the AFET committee on the 2018 budget, I supported the redistribution of part of the funding planned for Turkey to Turkish civil society, which defends thefreedom of expression.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 350, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Kati Piri", "mepid": "37229", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Madam President, as EU—Turkey relations have been put on the agenda of the next European Council meeting, I believe it is good to reiterate this Parliament’s position. This House has been speaking out loudly and clearly when it comes to the serious violations of fundamental rights in Turkey. Despite our many political differences and our diverging views on EU—Turkey relations, we have been united in our condemnation of rights abuses. In July – two months ago – we called for the formal suspension of the accession talks if the constitutional amendments were implemented unchanged. The situation in Turkey continues to be worrying, but there have been no developments in the last two months that would cause us to change the position we took two months ago. We also expect EU leaders to come forward with a clear and united response in October. The EU’s credibility is at stake when it comes to the accession talks with Turkey. At the same time, it is important to keep making a distinction between the Turkish Government and the Turkish population. In this respect, let me clearly state that the European Parliament never called for the withdrawal of the candidate status of Turkey nor for the shutting of all doors of communication. Taking away the European perspective from the Turkish people once and for all would be a grave mistake. However, the real question at hand is not whether Turkey can or cannot one day become a member of a future European Union. This is a theoretical debate. The real question at stake is: what we can do to reverse the current authoritarian trend in Turkey and how can we continue to support the millions of people in Turkey who believe in the same values? This is why I believe that starting negotiations on an upgraded customs union would be a first important step, although of course things need to improve first. Another important tool for the EU would be to continue financial support for civil society in Turkey. We must ensure that populism and xenophobia do not take over this debate.

Most recently we saw a USD 2.5 billion contract to purchase the Russian S400 anti-aircraft weapon system. This decision shows not only a disregard for the current strained relations between Russia and the West but also raises questions about its continued policy in Syria that diverges from that of the European Union and NATO: particularly now also Turkey’s offensive against the PYD fighters, against ISIS in Syria – another example – also its bullying of Cyprus in its attempts to rightfully explore for oil in its territorial waters. The situation inside Turkey, meanwhile, continues to reel from last year’s coup attempt. Despite already purging over 100 000 individuals from the civil service and the judiciary as well as arresting a further 50 000 people, it seems that the process continues unabated. Recent figures of 601 individuals arrested; 450 of them were accused of having Gulenist sympathies.

Turkey and the European Union signed their association agreement in 1963. In 1999 Turkey got candidate status. Negotiations have been going on since 2005, and even in better times they haven't really gotten closer. It shows that both sides are not interested in joining in such a way that it could lead to anything. The people in Europe - 77% of Europeans - reject Turkey's accession and support the end of the negotiations. In Germany - in my country - it is 86%. Turkey has not met the Copenhagen criteria for a long time, and if we turn away from surveys and look at the legal situation, Article 5 of the negotiating framework comes into play. If there is a long and serious breach of the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, it is up to the Commission to recommend that the negotiations be suspended. I can't understand why she doesn't. This House has done that several times - it is high time the Commission took this step too. We need this courage to think again. Dear Cristian Preda of the EPP: The question is, what will take the place of an accession process that is obviously dead? Then serious talks with Turkey about how to shape our relations will finally take place here. Discussions about a basic treaty, about energy policy, about the common organization of security in the eastern Mediterranean area, about the management of migration policy.

When I look at how the trade unions keep trying to enforce their freedom of assembly in Taksim Square, how the Gesi Square protests were put down, what the Kurds are like, how freedom of the press is treated - the country is in 154th place worldwide, behind Iraq - the referendum which, according to the Venice Commission, will lead to the abolition of the separation of powers - all of this is really worrying.

There can be no doubt that Erdoğan’s course requires a very strong and clear European response. I think we all agree on that, but the question is: what response? Because I think we need to find a response that is not just there for us to feel good but a response that actually achieves what we want to get to, and for that we need to indeed remember that Erdoğan is not Turkey and Turkey is not Erdoğan. 50% of people in Turkey voted against Erdoğan’s referendum, and people in Turkey are currently, every day, risking their freedom and their employment by speaking up, by defending their rights, by defending the rights of others. We must not forget those people and we must not leave them alone. We must do everything, rather, that we can to support them, and by everything I mean both on the institutional level but also with everything that we as MEPs and we as Groups can do.

I think it would be a scandal if we were to deepen our business ties with Turkey while journalists and labour unionists are in jail. And the customs union is actually not an instrument for political dialogue; it is an instrument for exchanging goods, for exchanging services. And that is also why Erdoğan wants it. He has never threatened to stop that one, and I think that is why we also need to especially use it. We need to say, no, we won’t do the modernisation and enlargement of the customs union unless there is progress on human rights. No business interests can really be more important than the interest of people to live in freedom and in the enjoyment of their rights, and the same is true – has to be true – for the export of weapons. There are still weapons exports happening today from European Union Member States to Turkey. But Turkey is a country in conflict: not a single weapon should be sent there, and certainly also not whole weapons factories. How to deal with Turkey?

Therefore, it is better to refrain from playing by the rules defined by Erdogan. Consequently, I fear that the prospect of a rupture in the dialogue with Turkey may give it new arguments to strengthen the authoritarian state it started even before the failed coup. Dear colleagues, I believe that we must avoid hasty, emotional or electoral decisions. I invite you to reflect and maintain a balanced and responsible position on the future of strategic relations between the European Union and Turkey. In this regard, I welcome the position taken by most foreign ministers at the last CAGRE meeting, which took place in Tallinn last week. Let's not forget, dear friends: Turkey has been and remains a strategic partner of the EU and the Member States, now and in the future. Turkey is a large and important country, with a very active, complex and largely pro-European civil society. The enlargement process has allowed us to positively influence the process of this country over several decades.

With the Customs Union, Erdogan is not obliged to democratize his country, while at the same time expanding his trade with the European Union.

In view of the above, the most pragmatic approach to Turkey's problem is to make it clear to the European Union that it does not intend to accept it as a member.

All our actions as the European Union are focused on finding a way out of the current impasse, in close coordination with our partners around the world, and particularly in Latin America. All our efforts must aim at creating space for mediation between the government and the opposition. This is the only way of alleviating the suffering of the Venezuelan people.  The political violence this year has already cost too many lives. As many as 130 people were killed from April to August. Human rights violations are having a negative impact not only on the population but also on neighbouring countries, with many Venezuelans fleeing the country. The economic crisis has led to a further deterioration in living conditions. The scarcity of food is affecting children, elderly people and women in particular, not to mention the widespread shortages of medicines. As we expected, the election of a Constituent Assembly with serious doubts as to its legitimacy and representativeness has only contributed to raising tensions. Even before it took office on 2 August we had issued a statement explaining that the European Union does not and will not recognise the Constituent Assembly as legitimate. We have made clear that some steps are now urgent to de-escalate tensions and prevent a further deterioration in the situation. It is essential that the authorities fulfil the commitments agreed upon last year and reiterated in the letter from the Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin. First, a clear electoral calendar must be established to allow the participation of all political parties from the opposition. In this regard it will also be critically important that the upcoming regional elections are free, fair and transparent on issues such as the registration of candidates, campaigning and the voting itself. So we will keep a close watch on this. Second, a humanitarian channel should be urgently opened. We are monitoring the situation very carefully. My team from DG ECHO is present in Bogota and carries out monitoring missions regularly. Let me stress here that the EU remains ready to reinforce its support to help address the most urgent needs of the population. Due to difficulties in access to the country what we are doing now is limited – targeted assistance in health and nutrition sectors – but we are exploring all possibilities for further support together with Member States, other donors and partner agencies. Third point, imprisoned opponents should be freed. We also believe that the acts and threats against the main opposition leaders, including the National Assembly President Julio Borges, the former Public Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, and the wife of Leopoldo López, Lilian Tintori, are major obstacles to a peaceful negotiated solution. Fourth and last point, the institutional prerogatives of the National Assembly should be respected. The Constituent Assembly is de facto replacing the legitimate parliament and this situation must come to an end. The European Union is united in backing these requests. Our unity was confirmed once again by EU foreign ministers in their informal meeting last week in Tallinn, and the High Representative, Federica Mogherini, and the ministers discussed their most recent diplomatic contacts and coordinated ahead of the meetings that the High Representative will hold next week in New York at the UN General Assembly’s ministerial week. We are ready to provide all our support to find a sustainable solution to the crisis together with our partners, starting with the Latin American countries, the Holy See and the United Nations. We have continuously expressed our support for regional mediation towards a non-violent return to democratic order and to address the economic and social plight of the Venezuelan people. EU foreign ministers in Tallinn also discussed the possibility of introducing targeted measures as a tool to raise pressure. At the moment we remain focused on our diplomatic and political contacts. We are ready to support by all means the possibility of a credible and meaningful regional mediation process, if requested by both sides and provided the four conditions that I listed are met. This is a moment of truth not only for Venezuela but for the whole of Latin America. The primary responsibility for ending this crisis lies in the country and in the region, and yet we will not close our eyes to the suffering of the people of Venezuela. Our contacts with our partners are discreet but constant and we really count on this Parliament also to use its network to facilitate mediation and of course, to work together for peace in Venezuela.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 393, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Luis de Grandes Pascual", "mepid": "28393", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, the situation in Venezuela has reached a breaking point. It is no longer possible to wait for more events to act. We were able to understand Mrs. Mogherini's prudence and her initial diplomatic position, waiting for some negotiated solution to be found. But Maduro has consummated a \"self-coup\" that no longer allows expressing concerns or exploring sanctions. The time has come for the condemnation, without palliative, of a regime that, without respecting its Constitution, has destroyed every vestige of democracy. He prevented the recall with the lure of a \"trick dialogue.\" He promoted and consummated the election of a monocolor and illegitimate Constituent Assembly, without a doubt, Mr. Commissioner. He nullified the capacities of the thus legitimate and constitutional National Assembly. He fired Attorney General Luisa Ortega, who has had to go into exile and has in turn accused Maduro and Diosdado Cabello of being two drug lords of a drug state. He releases him and successively imprisons the political prisoners Leopoldo López and Antonio Ledezma to demonstrate an all-embracing power, regardless of any type of judicial decision. He ends with any indication of disposition of powers, dismissing the Supreme Court and appointing another designated among his accomplices.

It should also be remarked that most of the country’s opposition leaders have found themselves banned from politics, jailed or under house arrest.  As is illustrated by Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the British Labour Party in my own Member State, there are many in this Parliament that wish to turn a blind eye to the undermining of democracy in Venezuela because of long—held sympathies for the Hugo Chavez model of socialism in Latin America. This now is a disservice to the millions of ordinary Venezuelans that are suffering from the ongoing political and economic mess and turmoil that Maduro has created. Chronic food and medical shortages continue to persist, a fact made all the more galling for a country with one of the world’s largest proven oil reserves.

Each of us will appreciate this policy according to our sensitivity. I am not tempted, rest assured, by Mr. Chavez's socialism or even his communism. I have fought them and I am fighting them, but yet let us speak the truth beyond political bankruptcy. This country has faced US imperialism since the 19th century, and particularly since Hugo Chavez came to democratic power, following a decade of economic and social violence. This imperialism is much more real than the one you accuse Russia of. Our Parliament has approved sanctions against Russia for - and I quote - the destabilization of Ukraine. So why are those responsible for this destabilization of Venezuela not sanctioned by Brussels? The methods of destabilization are always the same as those used, moreover, by the imperialists: guided insurrectionary strikes, provoked violence, campaigns to denigrate the paid independent media and, to top it all, an attempted coup d'etat and the work-study program outside the institutional framework. We must not add crisis to the crisis, when we need mediation and truth. We must condemn violence wherever it comes from. We need humanitarian support and non-interference.

But that should not only concern us as Europeans; we are concerned because it also puts at risk the values ​​and principles that Europe represents in the world: the will to build international relations as a result of multilateralism, dialogue and rules. For all this, and in the face of this new scenario, we are also given the opportunity to strengthen strategic ties with those who share this vision and who also share an agenda in the world. With this objective in mind, this report is being presented today here in Parliament: to explain and tell the group of European institutions that, as a result of the new international reality, relations between the European Union and Latin America today are not just a matter of convictions. They are a matter of necessity. That we want to work together and we have to work together between both regions to promote inclusive governance, defend development goals, fight climate change and protect the Paris Agreements, fight for gender equality, impose governance, globalization with rules and share its benefits. An agenda that we share with these actors —the Latin Americans and the Caribbean—, with both regions, and that we do not share with all the major actors on the international scene. It is evident that we have many ties: historical, cultural, human, economic with both regions. But no relationship can be taken for granted, especially also due to the profound changes, the interactions that exist on this continent, in Europe, but which have also occurred in recent years in Latin America. Since 1999 there is an Association Strategic between the Union and the subcontinent, but many times the relationship between the Union and Latin America has been relegated. Today is the time for it to become a reality. And we have tools for it. We have a dense, long list of association agreements under negotiation: we have association agreements in update with Mexico, with Chile, which can boost our relationship; an agreement in negotiation with Mercosur; We also have a recent political dialogue and cooperation agreement with Cuba, which we understand has a regional impact. But we don't just have this list of agreements. We have an institutional agenda at the summits of the European Union-CELAC that, unfortunately - and I will refer to it later - may be clouded by some of the problems in the region, such as Venezuela. Summits that must act with greater strength to coordinate our position in the G-20, the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund or the WTO. We must and must continue to maintain development cooperation with the region. We have to continue working together so that there is greater mobility; protect common security, especially that of some countries in Central America - a threat that also exists in Europe; follow the hopeful progress in Colombia closely, while addressing the very serious problems of Venezuela. The moment is now. It is now when we must boost our relations, continue working together, establish a clear strategy of the Commission for the region, strengthen our ties to raise our voice in defense of shared values ​​and principles.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 424, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Christos Stylianides", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, since the beginning of this Commission’s mandate we sought to further strengthen relations with Latin America and the Caribbean. Our culture and economic ties date back centuries but we are also getting into a new era. Our economies are more connected than ever. We are partners and allies on the great global issues of our times, from climate change to sustainable development. We share the vision of a more multilateral world, where all continents and all peoples have a say and contribute to global governance. As mentioned in your excellent report, the European Union seeks to reinforce its partnership with Latin America and the Caribbean not only in terms of economic change, but as a partner in social progress and in the defence of common values. In order to do that, we have at our disposal powerful cooperation instruments such as EU-funded programmes and technical or high-level meetings that allow us to foster cooperation and strengthen the ties between both decision-makers and civil societies. Latin America and the Caribbean are now looking for their own way towards regional integration, both on a continental scale and within its sub-regions. For instance, we are deepening our engagement with the Pacific Alliance, in particular on academic exchanges, consular assistance, free movement of citizens or investment policies. In your report you urge the High Representative to ‘look into the possibility of the EU participating as an observer’ in the Pacific Alliance. The EU has already been invited to the high-level meetings of the Pacific Alliance, including the Summit in Cali (27-30 June), as a special guest. We will look into the possibility of becoming an observer as the Pacific Alliance continues to consolidate itself. Let me also mention our relations with Mercosur, which have been galvanised by resuming the negotiation of an Association Agreement. Our goal is to finish the negotiations in the coming months, but beyond the regional and sub-regional organisation, our bilateral relations with almost all countries of the continent are going through a particularly dynamic phase. Let me just mention a few concrete examples. The negotiations to modernise the EU-Mexico Association Agreement are advancing at a good pace. Via meetings, videoconferences and negotiation rounds, the Agreement is taking shape and we aim to conclude negotiations in the coming months. The Council is currently discussing the mandate to negotiate the update of the EU-Chile Association Agreement. This negotiation will allow us to deepen our relations with a close ally with whom we share a rich common agenda, including peace and security. Another partner in defence and security is Colombia, where we have supported the peace agreement from the moment it was signed with a dedicated trust fund. Let me pay tribute to the role the European Parliament has been playing to support an active contribution by the European Union to the peace process in Colombia. The bilateral ceasefire announced by the Government and the ELN on 4 September constitutes a further step forward for peace in Colombia. The European Union, also through the High Representative’s Special Envoy Mr Eamon Gilmore, will continue our work to help the peace process overcome all remaining obstacles. Peace in Colombia was not the only historic event taking place in the region over the past few months. Our political dialogue and cooperation agreement with Cuba constitutes a landmark for the EU’s policy towards the region. In a sign of a new era in Latin America and the Caribbean, we are looking forward to the launch of the provisional application of an agreement that will allow us to strengthen our relations in a wide array of areas, including human rights. Human rights is precisely one of the areas where we cooperate the most with our partners in the region, including in Central America and the Caribbean, where we are also strengthening our support to fight against climate change. The situation in Venezuela makes for a striking exception after such a long list of positive developments. The political violence and the economic crisis risk destabilising not only the country, but the entire region. This crisis encourages us to seek even closer cooperation with all countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to support any attempt for regional mediation between the Venezuela Government and the opposition. Our regions may be geographically distant, but there is so much that we share. We have a direct interest in seeing Latin America and the Caribbean prosper, with peace, development and social justice for all. Our commitment is here to stay.

I also believe that it is important that we reflect - and the report does so in parts - on how we update the cooperation agenda. I want to thank the rapporteur for accepting some of our proposals on climate change, on the fight against violence against women - which he particularly worries us - and on the role that Mesecvi can play in all of this. But I think we really need to update that relationship between Europe and Latin America and, particularly - and my group insisted on this many times - it cannot pivot only on sticking with the type of trade agreements that we have been developing in recent years. And here I believe that it is important to give a much more political dimension to the relationship, and not so much within the framework of this type of agreement which, from our point of view, is not always positive. For example, if we want to fight against tax havens - which I fully agree with what was proposed - we have to see, for example in the Agreement between the European Union and Mexico, how that Agreement is used, for example, for the money laundering. Because it is being used. And that kind of thing we must see together. I will just end by saying that I am sorry that the Venezuelan debate has gotten into this report. He did not play.

This report is of the utmost importance, both for its opportunity and for its content and it is unquestionable that it is a report of great quality. This report aims at a fundamental political objective: to give a signal by this European Parliament in relation to what the relations between the European Union and Latin America must be. In fact, we have no closer partners, from the point of view of the identity of values, principles, models of political and economic organization, than most countries that make up Latin America. This does not correspond to any neocolonial vision, far from it. I do not see, in fact, in this report any neocolonialist perspective on the relationship with Latin America. What is there is an enhancement of common values, of values ​​that are values ​​both in Europe and in most Latin American countries, and above all, there is one thing that is important: it is to highlight how Latin America has evolved in recent decades. Several democracies have been consolidated, there has been a process of economic development, millions of people have left poverty, progress is being made towards the consolidation of the rule of law. Many of the crises that some countries are facing are crises of growth and maturation of their democratic processes, such as, for example, the case that I know best, even for obvious reasons, which is the Brazilian case, which is a country which is experiencing difficulties but which corresponds to the consolidation of a democracy associated with the rule of law.

And to achieve this, we support peace processes such as that of Colombia, including the reintegration of FARC members, or condemning regimes such as Venezuela, denouncing the repression of opponents by the illegitimate Constituent Assembly, and working for a democratic solution. Also signing fair trade agreements that promote sustainable and inclusive development, or holding negotiations with the countries of the Pacific Alliance or Mercosur. These actions, in addition to a contribution to peace, stability and social justice, are a strategic requirement at a time when other ways of doing things are taking positions in the area.

Most of these Free Trade Agreements, instead of opening the doors to beneficial political and commercial relations for both parties, what they do is to build walls with Latin America. They are walls that, in the name of development, continue to increase inequality between the few who benefit from the Free Trade Agreements and the majority who suffer poverty from its effects.

We know that the Latin American countries participating in this treaty, but also others, hope that we Europeans will break this vacuum so that this vacuum is not taken over by China. If you talk to those responsible in Brazil, Argentina or other countries, you will know the extent to which Chinese interests precede them. It is for this reason that I really want to ask the Commission to go stronger and faster with its intentions to come to these treaty negotiations with Mercosur and others. It is not only of great importance in terms of trade policy, but also of great global strategic importance, and I would also like to counter our colleagues on the left: This also means that Maduro and others in such countries will not eradicate democracy and the rule of law and that such rich countries are driven into poverty from the point of view of such a misunderstood socialism. This must not lead us to destroy these relationships, but we must be careful and make it clear that these people cannot speak for Latin America.

The European Union and Latin America must face in a coordinated way the global challenges in an interconnected and complex world. Together we are one third of the membership of the United Nations. Furthermore, we share - I believe - a certain vision of international governance and human rights, and both blocs believe in effective multilateralism. We are, I would say, natural allies. Our relationship must be intensified, taking advantage of the different existing frameworks and forums.

This relationship is all of these at the same time, but above all it is a relationship that has enormous potential, provided that both parties put their partnership high on their agendas. The report I have written and negotiated over the past few months sends a clear message a few weeks before the 14th EU-India summit. The European Parliament fully supports a truly strategic partnership with India, as the full potential of this relationship has not been developed. Indeed, trade between the Union and India should not be limited to trade, although trade obviously has an important role and negotiations around a free trade treaty should be a priority for both. sides. The challenges the two partners face internationally are similar, whether it be regional tensions or global issues such as terrorism, lack of respect for international law, or climate change. For the AFET Committee, the future of the relationship between the European Union and India includes several areas of work, including old ones that need to be revived. It is first of all a matter of working more closely at the global level in favor of effective and regulated multilateralism, of a reform of the United Nations, and of coordinating more often our respective positions in the international. We must then step up our exchanges on the fight against terrorism, in accordance with the declaration made at the last EU-India summit. There is a lot of space for cooperation in the prevention and fight against radicalization. We can also advocate together at the United Nations level, for example, the adoption of the general convention on international terrorism. On the other hand, we can together contribute to conflict reduction and Asia's prosperity, whether through support for regional integration processes, but also through fostering democratic processes in the countries of the region. India and the European Union can also try to take a positive part in the establishment in Afghanistan of a peace and reconciliation process by strengthening their political coordination on questions of military security or development aid. . Likewise, the actions of India and the Union in the field of development, whether in India's Asian neighborhood or in Africa, would have everything to gain from greater coordination so that they are complementary. . We could also strengthen our exchanges in favor of universal disarmament, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and nuclear security. Objectives to which both the Union and India are committed. Working together for a strict application of the United Nations sanctions against North Korea is a goal to be achieved in this context. I would like to draw attention more generally to the importance of establishing mechanisms for foreign policy consultation between India and the European Union, including on matters on which we have had different perspectives through the past. Whether it is China's offensive policy in the South China Sea, the need for India-Pakistan rapprochement, or even aggressive Russian actions in its neighborhood. So these are some of the possible lines of work, but there are obviously many others, ranging from human rights to maritime safety, including people-to-people exchanges.

I am happy to say that the report itself, and its assessments and recommendations, correspond to the intentions and activities of the European External Action Service as well as of the Commission. It definitely demonstrates the coherence of the EU policy approach towards India across the board. I would like, of course, to praise the work of the rapporteur, Mr Cristian Preda, who has my most definite congratulations. As the world’s largest democracies, the EU and India are important natural partners and, in the context of the current global uncertainties, we have a particular responsibility to protect and promote the rules-based international order. The EU Global Strategy recognises that there is a direct connection between European prosperity and Asian security, and we plan to boost our security-related cooperation with Asia, and with India in particular.  In fact, at the end of August, we already held the first foreign policy and security consultations in New Delhi, as well as three very productive security dialogues – counter—terrorism, cybersecurity and maritime – agreeing on specific actions for EU-India cooperation in these areas. During her visit to India last April, High Representative Federica Mogherini had the opportunity to discuss EU-India cooperation with the Prime Minister, the Minister of External Affairs and other officials. They agreed to enhance the ‘natural’ EU-India Strategic Partnership, based on common values, principles and interests, particularly the joint commitment to multilateralism. Last week in Bled the High Representative met once again with the Indian Minister of State Mr Akbar, including for discussions on preparations for the EU-India Summit.  We want to make the summit another milestone in the EU-India relationship to further develop our political, economic and sectoral cooperation. The last EU-India Summit instilled a new momentum in the Strategic Partnership. Several political visits to India supported the implementation of the last Summit’s conclusions, including the visits of Commission Vice—President Katainen in November 2016 and Commissioner Vella in October 2016, as well as the High Representative’s visit in April this year.  We have been working on the last summit’s outcomes, particularly the EU-India Clean Energy and Climate Partnership and the EU-India Water Partnership, and on cooperation on research and innovation, launching the EU-India Start-up Network last October. In March 2017, the President of the European Investment Bank opened a regional office in New Delhi, further strengthening the European Union’s presence in India and the wider region. The European Union plays a more and more important role as a partner in India’s ambitious modernisation agenda. We intend to deepen our cooperation in the area of urban development and further strengthen our cooperation on climate change. Both the European Union and India share a commitment to the Paris Agreement and its implementation and will continue to work together to realise its objectives. The European Union is India’s first trading partner and there is significant untapped potential in the EU-India trade and investment relationship. For this reason, the Commission remains engaged with India to seek to agree on the parameters for the resumption of ambitious negotiations on a free trade agreement. Despite numerous efforts, it has not been possible to make progress with India in this domain in time for the summit, but discussions continue. Looking ahead, the report recommends the adoption of a new EU strategy for its relations with India and, again, I can assure you that we have already started working on a strategic review of EU-India relations. The report and today’s discussions represent a valuable contribution to this initiative. Last but not least, allow me to congratulate you also on the positive impact of the visits of several of Parliament’s delegations to India this year and the strengthening of ties with the Indian Parliament. I would like to encourage you to maintain these regular contacts, including at the highest level.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 457, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Președintele. –", "mepid": "33984", "text": "The point has been closed.The vote will take place on Wednesday, 13 September 2017.

The Tamil Nadu court has adjourned the hearing for the last ten months to announce the final verdict. However, while respecting Indian law and the judiciary, it is important that India also respects the right to a trial within a reasonable time.

The next opportunity is the EU-India Human Rights Dialogue and the EU-India Summit.

Let me start by thanking all my colleagues from the Subcommittee on Human Rights, the Committee on Development and the Committee on International Trade for their input and great cooperation in preparing this report, as well as, in particular, Ana Gomes who was the rapporteur in 2013. The aim of this endeavour was to highlight the link between corruption and human rights, to cover the wide scope of human rights violations and to provide recommendations for EU policies. Corruption is regarded as a complex phenomenon of abuse of entrusted power for personal gain, which poses serious obstacles for the realisation of all human rights. It also distorts democracy and political processes. Therefore, in this report we see an intrinsic need to employ a human rights-based approach to the EU anti-corruption policy. Among other topics, the report highlights business responsibility, investment flows in relation to corruption, the influence of corruption on elections, tax havens, large sporting events and freedom of the media. We continue to insist that the Commission and the External Action Service use all our diplomatic tools so that the European Union takes the lead in the fight against corruption by supporting anti-corruption institutions in third countries, encouraging the sharing of best practices, and negotiating enforceable anti-corruption and anti-money laundering provisions in all future trade agreements that we make. We believe that the European Union can become a credible actor only if we address corruption within our own borders. Thus this report calls for an effective anti—corruption corruption strategy at Member State level too. As far as aid and financing instruments are concerned, we insist that EU-funded projects be permanently monitored and that any budget support be linked with concrete reforms towards transparency and other anti-corruption measures. Having said this, we must admit that the gap between the policy and implementation still exists and here there is a lack of political will to bridge it, as we have learned very well from recent examples. The future of the Guatemalan International Commission against Impunity, which is crucial in its fight against corruption in the country and was also mentioned in my report as a successful example of the EU-funded project, is now unfortunately under threat. In addition, we hear of LuxLeaks, Panama leaks, Russia and Azerbaijan Laundromats and other cases where we realise that corruption stretches far beyond state borders and is in fact having dramatic repercussions on very serious international policy decisions. We therefore call for the highest possible ethical and transparency standards to be upheld in international institutions and national bodies in order to encourage the European Union to have a legal framework in place to deter any type of corruption or fraud. Thus in this report we reiterate our demand to bring the Magnitsky sanctions list against 32 Russian state officials to the Council for its immediate adoption.  Let me finish by quoting John Steinbeck, a Nobel Prize winner from 1962, who said ‘Power does not corrupt. Fear corrupts ... perhaps the fear of a loss of power’. Indeed, I feel as if most of my report was precisely about the fear of the loss of power. I look forward to the debate in this plenary and the smooth adoption of this much-needed report.

I would like to thank the rapporteur for presenting a very good and long report. In my opinion, it is so extensive that it really affected aspects that I did not even know about corruption. It did not occur to me to think that the requirements that the EU will make can play a very important role in the decision-making process on accession to the EU. I would like to thank the rapporteur for that. I think we should have rules that are really generally applicable to negotiations with third countries. We often provide money to corrupt people in those third countries. This is quite clear in the context of development aid. Or, unfortunately - hopefully inadvertently - we use our money to support illegal trade, nepotism or the trade in illicit goods. I think it is really important to have clear, concise rules that we would enforce in all cases, and there would be no such fundamental exceptions as we sometimes witness here and there.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 463, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Νότης Μαριάς (ECR).", "mepid": "125069", "text": "- Mr President, the fight against corruption and human rights abuses in third countries must be the primary choice of our peoples. Land grabbing is unfortunately a daily practice in Africa, Latin America and Asia. Land grabbing by European, American and Chinese multinationals expelling Indigenous people. Corruption in developing countries is a fertilizer for human trafficking and child exploitation. In addition, other human rights violations are on the agenda, not only by third country governments, but also by multinationals, which have mercenaries and private armies to enforce their interests. Finally, the holding of free elections and the observance of democracy will be a demand for several decades, unfortunately, for many developing countries.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 464, "date": "2017-09-12.json", "name": "Christos Stylianides", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the fight against corruption is one of the Sustainable Development Targets of the 2030 Agenda and is therefore reflected in the New European Consensus on Development adopted in June. The New Consensus will shape the EU’s development cooperation in the years to come. All of the human rights issues that are affected by corruption and highlighted in this report are also addressed by the 2015-2018 EU Action Plan for Democracy and Human Rights, so let me go through the five main issues raised by the report. Firstly, trafficking in persons. The trafficking in men, women and particularly children is a grave violation of human rights. It also constitutes a serious form of organised crime: a fast-growing, highly profitable business that can corrupt the legal order of a state. The EU has developed a comprehensive legal and policy framework to combat trafficking: I will list the EU Strategy towards the Eradication of Trafficking in Human Beings, the EU Directive on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Human Beings and Protecting Victims, and the designation of the EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator. This framework has victims at its centre, it is based on the recognition of everyone’s human rights, and it understands the specific needs of women and children. Our priorities in fighting human trafficking are to enhance the law enforcement and judiciary, and to enable them to disrupt criminal networks more efficiently, but it also stresses the need to foster transparency and accountability. I continue because I strongly believe that we have to show our discipline in the principles of this political body. Secondly, Business and Human Rights. The EU Council Conclusions of June 2016 on Business and Human Rights renew the commitment of the EU and its Member States to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and their implementation. Substantial progress has been achieved. For example, the 2014 EU Accounting Directive on non-financial information disclosure has required companies with more than 500 employees to disclose non-financial information in their management reports. Information includes socially-related aspects, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and bribery issues.  Furthermore, the EU has issued sector-specific guidance notes, including for the development of EU Member States’ National Action Plans. As of today, 12 Member States have adopted National Action Plans on Business and Human Rights, and most of the others are advancing with their National Action Plans on Corporate Social Responsibility or on Business and Human Rights. This is really crucial as the EU is the home base of many multinationals with global value chains and potential human rights impact. Thirdly, land grabbing. Respect for land rights, including customary and equitable access to land, is essential for sustainable development and for the enjoyment of fundamental human rights. Poor governance disproportionately affects developing countries and the most vulnerable sectors of populations, such as women and indigenous peoples. The European Union, in its cooperation with third countries, supports the promotion and application of the Voluntary Guidelines on Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests (VGGT). Fourthly, freedom of media. Without freedom of expression and freedom of the media, an informed, active and engaged citizenry is impossible. The EU supports the adoption of legislation that provides adequate protection for whistle-blowers and for journalists’ right of non-disclosure of sources. Fifthly, elections and the functioning of democratically-elected bodies. A transparent, credible and resilient electoral framework, as well as independent and accountable state institutions, are important factors in deterring electoral fraud and corruption in the electoral process. The European Parliament knows very well the importance of our electoral observation missions in this respect. Since 2000, the European Union has deployed 142 Electoral Observation Missions and Election Assessment Teams, in 64 countries around the globe. In addition, from 2008 onwards, we have deployed 85 smaller Electoral Expert Missions and, from 2011, 14 Election Follow-up Missions. Furthermore, the EU supports the fight against corruption via public financial management reform, capacity building for law enforcement and the judiciary, as well as through support to civil society and parliaments. The EU also encourages the signing, ratification and implementation of international anti-corruption conventions, including the 2003 UN Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC).  Finally, allow me to thank the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and especially the rapporteur, my dear friend Mr Petras Auštrevičius, for a comprehensive and highly useful report. The report rightly highlights the massive human rights implications of corruption and corruptive practices.

Corruption is global, it spreads across borders, brutally hits the most deprived in developing countries, undermines sustainable development, and deepens inequalities and the gap between the ruling elite and the majority of society. Corruption also negatively affects trade and its benefits. I am convinced that trade policy can be an important tool to improve the human rights situation in third countries in conjunction with other EU policies, in particular foreign policy and development cooperation. Trade agreements can be better used to fight corruption and to ensure that international conventions and rules are applied in practice. Accordingly, enhanced cooperation between countries and regions, and the activities of civil society organizations in the fight against corruption, should be encouraged. Reducing this practice is essential to economic growth, poverty reduction, wealth creation, education, social and health care, infrastructure development and conflict resolution, as well as confidence in institutions, businesses and political action. I believe it is very important for a major partner and donor like the European Union to exercise continual pressure to improve elite governance in third countries.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google"}]
