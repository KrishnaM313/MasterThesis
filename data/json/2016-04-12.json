There is no magic silver bullet. What we wanted to do is look at every single aspect and come up with an all-encompassing plan, and I would like to thank Cecilia and everyone who cooperated so well to get us to this stage. What we are saying here is that we must shift our thinking: no more emergency solutions to emergency situations. We want a sustainable long-term vision. Our departing point is that solidarity must be the point of principle upon which any action on migration is based. It is clear that we still need to do more to prevent loss of life at sea, and we call for a permanent Union response in search and rescue. When it comes to Frontex and the European Border and Coast Guard, we acknowledge that Frontex and naval operations such as Operation Sophia have played their part in saving lives, but we need to go further. Any holistic approach to migration must also necessarily contain measures aimed at criminal networks, and our report also tackles this point. This is crucial. We draw differences between those who are in need of protection and those who come to Europe for work, because we understand that while people fleeing war and persecution have a right to protection, it is true that this does not equate to an inalienable right to migration. So we highlight that when it comes to labour migration, for example, it must be the Member States who have control over the labour market, and that they and the Union must see how best to fill any possible gaps in the market. When it comes to beneficiaries of international protection, we have come back again and again to the issue of relocation. If we are a Union of shared values we must now truly become a Union of shared responsibility. Relocation is a move in the right direction, but the numbers of people relocated from Italy and from Greece are very disappointing. When it comes to safe and legal routes, we want a binding legislative approach for resettlement. On security, we cannot bury our heads in the sand. Security fears do exist among our citizens, and states must fulfil their obligations at the external borders if these fears are to be in any way allayed. The abolition of internal border controls and Schengen has to go hand in hand with strengthening external borders. This is simply a prerequisite if we are to save our celebrated Schengen zone. We know that not everyone who arrives in Europe is in fact eligible for protection, and we understand that the return of those who are not eligible must be carried out. Only 36% of those who were ordered to leave the Union were actually returned in 2014. On Dublin, we know that there is an upcoming legislative process, but we have put forward one option whereby the establishment of a central system could be considered and the ‘country of first entry’ principle should no longer be applied. We want a new approach on integration. The way forward is to have a two-way process, and while, yes, everyone’s rights must be protected and yes, we must do more to keep families together, it is also fair to expect people to respect the values upon which our Union is founded. We also talk about tackling the root causes and understand that greater commitment is needed to solve the geopolitical issues of our time. This means that Europe must help build capacity in third countries which can eventually allow people to seek protection also in safe countries outside the EU. In conclusion, 1.8 million people crossed into Europe last year. 3 771 drowned in the Mediterranean. This year already more than 77 children have died. This is the magnitude of the situation we are facing and, as politicians, all of us have a duty to take a stand to ensure that these are not just nameless statistics. We cannot allow ourselves to become desensitised to the fact that migration is, above all, a human issue. These are real people with real lives, and we must all do better. It is time for action, and I hope that you will vote precisely for that today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Kashetu Kyenge", "mepid": "124801", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today's vote has come to the end of a political path that lays the foundations for a future common migration policy.  It has been an extraordinary effort to align the different positions – and I thank Mr Metsola for the work he has done together – to smooth out individual sensitivities and to share a common approach: the phenomenon of migration is not opposed but managed. It is managed through all the policies and instruments at our disposal, in the optimal combination of domestic policy and foreign policy. It is managed through the full involvement of all the actors involved, both at European, national and local level. It is managed through short-term concrete actions and forward-looking medium and long-term policies. It is managed if there is the political will to implement a founding principle of the Union, the principle of solidarity and full sharing of responsibilities between all the Member States. We have assumed this political responsibility.  The draft resolution provides concrete answers to what is the largest movement of men and women since the Second World War, as well as outlines structural policies aimed at curbing the phenomenon and combating its root causes. The guiding principle of our proposals is the global approach and the centre on which they are based is the principle of solidarity. The saving of human lives becomes a top priority, as does the development of mechanisms for allocating beneficiaries of international protection to all Member States of the European Union. The time has come for the Member States to assume their responsibilities and fulfil their obligations in connection with the relocation measures strongly desired by this House.  We insist on the need for a binding and compulsory mechanism for the resettlement of a considerable number of asylum seekers directly from the refugee camps of third countries to the Member States, the so-called 'humanitarian corridors', without, however, neglecting the strengthening of similar forms of solidarity, such as humanitarian admission and humanitarian visas. We call for specific measures for children, starting with the right to legal, health, education, protection, and above all non-detention because of their condition.  Let us analyse the critical issues of the Common European Asylum System and decree the end of the Dublin Regulation.  Our proposal is clear: to go beyond the concept of the port state. We propose the establishment of a central and collective system for the allocation of responsibilities. A system that could be designed by setting thresholds per Member State for the number of arrivals. There will no longer be an asylum application in Italy or Greece, but in Europe. Mr Timmermans, this is the Dublin amendment that we expect of you, not cosmetic changes to a regulation which, on the evidence, has shown that it does not meet the migratory challenges of recent years. Managing migration also means acting on the root causes of migration. We call for greater cooperation with third countries, for the relaunch of certain processes, including Rabat and Karthoum, and, above all, for strong measures to combat trafficking and trafficking in human beings.    Migration flows also include economic migrants, we call on the Member States to review their fragmented policies on economic migration and to lay down new rules on entry and residence. Turning to you, Commissioner, I hope that the change to the Blue Card will be ambitious and up to the needs identified in the labour market. The success of a migration policy is also measured in terms of integration. We call on the Member States to take concrete measures to provide housing, access to education and to intensify intercultural dialogue. Mr President, with this resolution we are lay the foundations for a common migration policy that is equal to the challenges of the twenty-first century. It is now up to the Member States to decide whether to follow our path or to decree the definitive decline of the process of European integration. The future of Europe also depends on how much we are able to share our European dream and our values.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, let me start by expressing my thanks to our rapporteurs Ms Metsola and Ms Kyenge for this comprehensive report. They and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) have invested a great deal of serious work to achieve this result. We all share a common objective. We all agree that the time has come to replace chaotic, irregular and dangerous migratory flows with organised safe and legal pathways to Europe. Like the European Agenda on Migration, your report rightly stresses the need to work on all aspects of migration in order to reduce the incentives for irregular migration, assist migrants in need of protection, secure our external borders and attract skills to support our economic growth. We cannot work on one of the aspects and ignore the others. We cannot pick and choose what to focus on. We need to enhance all aspects of our policy in parallel, to coordinate with all key players and be both realistic and ambitious looking ahead. The agreement reached between the European Union and Turkey should also be seen in this broad context. Implementing this agreement is a challenge. We are working tirelessly to put in place all the legal, practical, logistical and financial arrangements to implement it. We are doing so with the Greek and the Turkish Governments, as well as with international organisations and NGOs to ensure that the European Union and international law is fully respected. People who apply for asylum in Greece will have their applications treated on a case-by-case basis in line with EU law. I was in Ankara last week to discuss how the EU-Turkey agreement is being put into practice. Discussions are still ongoing on the protection guarantees for both Syrian and non-Syrian asylum seekers. As a result, the first promising steps have been taken. In the short time since its implementation, which started on 4 April, 74 Syrians have been resettled in Europe and more than 300 migrants returned to Turkey. We have started to finance projects to support Turkey in hosting millions of refugees. More generally, the current crisis has shown that the present system is not working, and many elements are reflected in your report. In particular we need to overhaul the asylum system. Currently, the first place of arrival of a person in the European Union decides which Member State should handle an asylum claim. This is neither fair nor sustainable, as we have seen in the last months. Last week’s communication presented two options for the establishment of a sustainable and fair system for determining the Member State responsible for examining asylum claims. The first alternative is to add a corrective fairness mechanism to Dublin: what I would call ‘Dublin plus’. We would keep the current criteria and supplement them with adjustments enabling redistribution to other Member States in specific circumstances. The objective would be to have a threshold that is not too high. Redistribution should start before the asylum system of a Member State is over-stretched. The second, alternative, line of thought we are proposing is changing the basic criteria. In this scenario, responsibility for an asylum claim would be decided from the very start and for every case on the basis of distribution between Member States. Both options would provide the much-needed solidarity and fair sharing of responsibilities between Member States. Indeed, under both options, the distribution mechanism should be activated automatically. But a reformed Dublin mechanism alone will not make our asylum policy more fair and efficient. This is why the Commission will present complementary initiatives in order to achieve greater convergence in the EU asylum system and to limit secondary movements across the European Union. The Eurodac system will be reinforced. The asylum procedures and the qualification directives will be replaced with fully-harmonised regulations. Targeted modifications will be proposed to the Reception Conditions Directive and a new reinforced mandate will be given to the EASO. We also need to enhance safe and legal pathways to Europe to stop migrants from embarking on dangerous journeys. This is why we will put forward a horizontal mechanism for resettlement. Right now there are many differences between Member States’ approaches to a settlement. It would be more efficient if EU Member States pooled their offers and use the same methodology. We also agree that in the future we will need migration to fill the skills gap and to address the demographic challenge that all our nations in Europe face. We will propose a reform of the blue card scheme for highly skilled migrants, as well as measures to attract and support innovative entrepreneurs. I also want to emphasise that we are working on an action plan on integration for all third-country nationals. This will be a crucial element to increase acceptance in our societies. All these actions are complementary to the actions initiated to protect our borders and reduce incentives for irregular migration. Last week we proposed making our borders smarter and stronger. We created an EU entry/exit system to improve our external borders management by better monitoring over-stayers. The Commission is pursuing its efforts, together with Member States, to improve arrangements for the return of irregular migrants not in need of protection, especially regarding sub-Saharan countries. Let me assure you once more that the Commission is working very hard with all actors to ensure that the current deficit in the migration system is being addressed. The refugee crisis has been a catalyst for the acceleration of these changes. The picture sometimes looks very dark. I will not hide from you that my first thought every morning is whether we as Europeans will overcome this crisis and turn it into an opportunity instead of a disaster. But I still want to believe that we are all now realising the need to adapt to a new era, which is characterised by human mobility. Most importantly, we have started realising that we can only face this new reality united and based on our common values of respect for human rights, and it is true that this Parliament was the first to show the way ahead and this Commission’s mission was from the beginning to tackle the issue in a comprehensive way. In this framework, I welcome the fact that many constructive proposals can be found in your report, which shows our common understanding of the challenges and potential solutions. I am looking forward to a constructive debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Δημήτρης Παπαδάκης", "mepid": "124692", "text": "  Rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Mr President, the title of the report refers to the Mediterranean, but the crisis appeal has taken on such dimensions that we must talk about a holistic approach to immigration on the part of the European Union, based on solidarity, full respect for the fundamental rights, principles and values of the European Union.  The reasons for deciding to leave their country are wars, terrorism, lack of security, poverty, hunger. We must be told that the participation of European Union countries in the deregulation of our flammable neighbours leads to huge flows of migrants, refugees and displaced persons. Europe must be a force for peace and stability in the neighbouring regions. The countries receiving the largest migration flows need support and there must be a fair distribution of responsibilities. Europe seemed like the Promised Land for migrants and refugees but, now, only shame is caused by the images in Idomeni or the shelters that have been turned into detention centres.

A great joint work of rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, with only one common objective: to articulate a comprehensive approach of the European Union on migration. Imagine that we had set up months ago, as my group proposed and endorsed the Treaties, a European emergency intervention force for refugees that was receiving, registering and ensuring first and for all the essential rights of the most vulnerable who come to Europe: children. We would be guaranteeing them access to guardianship, legal and health care, accommodation and education and we would not all be violating the principle of best interests of the child. We would not be covered by the oprobrium and shame of ignoring the whereabouts of thousands of minors who have entered Europe. In November I already alerted the Commission to the growing number of unaccompanied minors who were reaching our borders. In January, and as an emergency, I again asked a question about the 10,000 missing minors that Europol acknowledged, many of them possibly victims of mafias, slavery and exploitation. Yesterday, Germany recognized more than 6,000. Commissioner, we have been waiting months for clarification from the Commission on this matter.

It is the demand for a fairer distribution of refugees to avoid the overload and asphyxiation of the first host country that stems from the Dublin system. There is , and I agree with it - the need for tighter border control, a more effective fight against smugglers and the return to their countries of origin of people who cannot claim asylum. It also includes , and I am particularly pleased with this - the outline of a fully integrated asylum policy.  Asylum must be a European asylum in the future. We must be able to apply for asylum in the European Union. It is the European agency EASO that must investigate applications. All procedures, all remedies and all deadlines must be harmonized. Last but not, Mr President, on the budgetary front, the budgetary resources provided for in the multi-year financial framework are clearly insufficient.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this morning, with the subject of migrants and the reception of migrants as part of a comprehensive approach in the Mediterranean, is an opportunity to check the adequacy of our conduct and the policies we are pursuing with the values we proclaim. The first point is welcome: there is no social integration without professional integration, and the challenge is to integrate migrants professionally even as we are hit by an unprecedented wave of unemployment. Of course, refugees need to learn the language; we must recognize their diplomas, give them equivalencies, promote training. But I would like to draw your attention this morning to one point: once refugees have their papers, they have been welcomed by non-governmental organisations on a site, they must be relocated to sites that offer jobs. And here I ask you, Commissioner, two things: the first is to mobilise the Member States for this relocation which has difficulties which they are not aware of, and the second is to increase the amount spent on the European Social Fund, because we will not be able to do everything within the multi-year financial framework to integrate both European citizens and refugees.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Merja Kyllönen", "mepid": "124736", "text": "  draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. – Mr President, we need concrete and credible proposals to resolve the long-standing crisis, a crisis that is in many ways inhumane and unsustainable from the point of view of people.  The Committee on Transport is concerned about the humanitarian aspects of the crisis, but also about the impact on Mediterranean shipping, the safety of ships and their crews and public maritime safety. The concern is that the Mediterranean will see accidents that could lead to further loss of life and also to environmental damage.  Under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, ship masters are always obliged to provide assistance in the case of people at risk of drowning at sea and always to participate in search and rescue operations. Indeed, the resources of the authorities in the Mediterranean have been too weak, and our merchant bases throughout the world have had to bear an unacceptably high responsibility for rescue work on their own. Funding for temporary rescue operations in the Mediterranean must be increased in order to ensure the safety and fundamental rights of both refugees trying to reach Europe and those working in the Mediterranean.

We make two important contributions, Commissioner, to this resolution. The first is to put cohesion policy at the service of a new migration policy and to make cohesion policy more flexible, more open, more willing to be less blocked in its programmes and to be more concrete in aid, so to speak, of the policy to combat the migration emergency, but also as a structural policy for the coming years.  The second point we make in this report is to point out the need to progressively introduce measures derogating from the Stability Pact so that the resources that individual States and the European Commission itself make available for migration policy are increasingly being taken out of a narrow logic of the Stability Pact.

Many of these are underage girls travelling on their own, as we have heard from one of the other speakers. All of these women and girls are at heightened risk of all forms of violence and sexual assault. Therefore we need measures to meet the specific needs of women, and they have too often only been considered as an afterthought.

Ladies and gentlemen, the migration problem calls on the European Union to confront its principles and values. There is a need, here and now, for a change of mindset, a change of perception and a change of approach to this problem, and I say this because you know very well that the institution of relocation cannot work if there are Member States that do not agree with our decisions. The institution of resettlement by third States also cannot work if there are Member States that close borders and are balding the essential institution of Schengen.  We must therefore understand in this approach that there must be a common immigration policy and that, as the Commissioner said, a common European asylum policy must be promoted. Otherwise, we will not be able to deal with either unaccompanied children, the most sensitive core of this case that the report rightly understands, or those desperate people, some of them counting as simple statistics and figures, and not as human lives, who have left as persecuted to come to see, on our continent, a better life and a better level of decent living.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 13, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Tanja Fajon", "mepid": "96911", "text": "  On behalf of the S&amp;D Group.

The concentration of the Member States and the Commission, including Frontex, on border control and the refoulement of refugees is not a holistic view, on the pretext that Schengen is only saved in this way; Donald Tusk's phrase, calling on fugitives from wars not to come mainly to Europe, is not a holistic view; it is not holistic Frontex transformed into a new Agency for Collective Refoulement; Above all, the agreement with a regime, Turkey, which rejects thousands of returnees to Syrian war zones while repressing their Kurdish compatriots at home, is not holistic.  This report contains positive points, particularly with regard to the application for legal avenues of access to the Union, European search and rescue systems, and the mutual recognition of asylum decisions. It would live up to its initial ambitions if it were to clearly denounce the agreement with Turkey, as called for in specific amendments by my group, if it understood that we are facing a refugee crisis, not an immigrant crisis.

We do indeed need a holistic approach – people have said that – and we need one that is much better than the piecemeal solutions and unilateral actions offensive to human rights that have been taken by several Member States. This Sunday, children were tear gassed in Idomeni, and it was not just the Macedonian police who did this – several Member States were present there. I really hope, Commissioner, that you can remind those Member States of the importance of human rights and the fact that you cannot tear gas people who are in need of international protection and fire rubber bullets at children. What we need instead in the European Union is legal and safe passage for people in need of international protection, because even the best asylum system does not do its job if we close access to that asylum system. I recognise that the Commission acknowledges this problem in its communication, but I think we need concrete and binding proposals so that all Member States are obliged to offer that legal access. Far too few governments in the Member States are willing to welcome refugees, but it is our duty and our international obligation to open the doors to those people in need. We need common standards for asylum rules, but we also need better standards for asylum rules. The review that will be proposed by the Commission should lead to better standards, because current procedures are very often taking too long. They are not very transparent, and legal advice and legal security for people is not there. Accommodation is, in many cases, horrendous. The issue of distribution is crucial: the European Union is based on solidarity, and solidarity should also be reflected in an allocation key, which we urgently need in order to have all Member States participating in receiving asylum seekers and dealing with their claims. However, such an allocation system also needs to take into account the fact that we are dealing with people and not with numbers. We need to be able to take into account their family ties, their community ties and their language skills, because this will also make it easier for them to integrate. Member States will also benefit from that. Integration is indeed key, and we need to find common rules and fight the causes of why people have to flee. We also need to do something on that as the European Parliament. We can contribute to a fairer trade system and a fairer agricultural system.

The starting point was to be the Dublin Regulation, we had to overcome it, we have not yet succeeded because there is a unified vision on this issue.

We need a more transparent, smarter approach to managing funds, because internally there are jackals who speculate on immigration management, both economically and politically.

One of the best examples of a holistic approach in our history and literature is Sherlock Holmes. Here is an example to take when looking at the migration crisis. Applying the method of deduction to the migration crisis shows the weaknesses of our current system and politics, which arose as a result of delaying foreign and security policy. It also shows the current weaknesses in our value system, our border-security system and in internal cooperation between different institutions, as well as weaknesses in the institutions themselves. If we really want to regain the trust of our citizens, we must be successful in solving the migration crisis, and to do this we have to proceed step by step. This step-by-step approach entails, for example, trying to fix these problems one after another.

Of the planned 160,000 posts, only 2,200 have been made available by the Member States and, of course, in addition to the Member States, respect for the European authorities must also be shown by the candidate countries.  The excessive use of force against refugees and migrants the day before yesterday by Skopje police officers and the throwing of chemicals from them into Greek territory is incompatible with the status of a candidate country.

Their job is to radicalise defectors, so that, too, is proof – the migrant crisis and the security situation are linked.

We would have needed such a guard yesterday, and support for Frontex and Europol should have been significantly higher. Fourthly: The European Union should not allow Turkey to blackmail, otherwise it should lose its partner status as russia as it did in the context of the management of the migrant crisis. Fifthly, Macedonia – this candidate has proven to be a true ally of the European Union, thanks to it, we have stopped the Balkan route and facilitated a deal with Turkey. Paradoxically, however, the European Union is still punishing Macedonia for not setting a date for the start of accession negotiations.

The problem is the rise in nationalism and xenophobia that is affecting politics today. This issue will determine the future of Europe. We must send out a clear signal of a new direction for migration policy, based on respect for human rights, in which we stand up in the sun for what europe's fundamental values are about. Refugees should be regarded as people with fundamental rights, whose lives are worth being saved and protected. We need immediate action that saves lives and creates safe and legal routes to Europe.

Schengen: the governments are not asking for it, our people are asking for it, our businesses, our frontier workers, artisans and farmers are asking not to close their borders. The closure of the Brenner only affects Italian workers, not illegal immigrants. No to Schengen means that all refugees and illegal immigrants would remain in Italy, because there is no amendment to the Dublin Treaty. And so truly those who love Italy and those who love their homeland must fight to close the external borders and not the internal ones.  European countries that do not respect quotas, I am sorry, do not receive European funds. I have also said this in recent years: there is no longer a time for solidarity when one does not show it to you. And I'll end with the repatriations. Repatriations are fundamental to us, as we also wrote as the PPE in the Milan document, and if a country of origin – I am going to conclude, Mr President – does not help us, we cannot give aid.

Maritime operations off Italian shores have directed refugees to the Balkans. The closure of the Balkan route brought them back to the doors of Italy. Now new corridors will open through Bulgaria and through Albania. The agreement with Turkey is not a benchmark for European policy, it has started to buoy, it creates more problems than concrete results. The new border and coast guard strategy will keep Schengen Europe as a fortress, but has left three countries – Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia - out of this policy. Finally, the Commission is proposing new ideas for reforming Dublin. We expected more, Commissioner, you only offer cosmetic adjustments.

Mr President, I think we are on the right track, despite the difficulties, because the balance is slowly being restored. In other words, in the last two weeks we have had an 80% reduction in flows, which is a very positive development, because we do not want a fortress Europe, we want a Europe that accepts the persecuted, accepts the poor, but accepts them at a pace that does not put its own social and political system to the test.  Just the fact that all the people who have a problem around the world are looking for a better better fate in the European Union, I think it shows that, despite our problems, we also have great successes that we must support. I therefore believe that by restoring balance, by limiting flows, we will be able to manage the problem in a humane and cost-effective way.  Finally, I would like to say a few words about my British colleagues, who have a negative attitude, I would say, to some of them. I do not think we are doing anything different at European Union level than they are at Commonwealth level, and I think that what they have been doing, in general, in recent decades in the United Kingdom, is right.

We must therefore, Mr Avraboule, finally put in place the process of relocating at least 6 000 refugees a month, as you have already said.

Unfortunately, however, the report also supports inhuman military operations, NATO's involvement in the Aegean sea and the strengthening of border controls, which make Europe a fortress and sustain crime against refugees. Just as unacceptable, in our view, is the call for the implementation of the European Union-Turkey Action Plan, which aims to rid the Union of refugees. An agreement which, in our view, violates international legitimacy, as the United Nations Commission has denounced.  With these policies, the Union's responsibilities for the military interventions that caused the crisis appeal are increasing dramatically.

There is no doubt that migration is a controversial topic. We should avoid playing on the stereotypes. On the contrary, I would say, we have to fight stereotypes. The images of migrants being tear gassed do no honour to our European history and values or to our civilisation. We have to treat these people with respect, but we also need to have a plan – a policy – and to implement this policy, and this is where the problem sometimes lies. This brings me to what many of you have mentioned during this debate. Relocation, yes, has to work. The numbers were mentioned before. Only 1 145 persons have been relocated since mid-March. It is unacceptable. And from this House I again appeal to Member States to make it happen, and to work at the same time on settlement. Later today the Commission will present a report on where we stand on relocation and resettlement. We need an objective and fair reform of rules on migrants for the European citizens, for the Member States and for our partners abroad. We need a policy that does not lead to closing borders, putting Schengen at risk. You know my position on fences and the closure of borders. I believe in building bridges, not walls. In particular, when there is a dispute between Member States, Schengen states – as is the case now, for example, between Italy and Austria – that this is not the proper solution. It is clear that the asylum system as it stands today is not functioning. Europe has to adapt its migration policy to provide orderly and safe pathways to the European Union for those who need protection and those who can contribute with their skills and talents to the European Union’s economic development. We need to share responsibility, reduce irregular arrivals, and prevent and sanction secondary movements. Let me be clear here, however: we do not want a cosmetic reform. We want an ambitious and substantial improvement of Dublin which leads to fair outcomes for everyone. A key point that some of you mentioned is that children, especially unaccompanied children, need protection, and this is what we have to ensure by all means possible. Many of you mentioned the EU-Turkey deal. Let me be frank with you. We – both the European Union and Turkey – have to use the common challenges we are facing as an opportunity to better respond to them and forge closer links through this cooperation. This can only be beneficial for both parties. Implementation, as I said before, is difficult. It is already difficult to cooperate among Member States and even more difficult with third countries, but we have achieved some important progress. I can assure you that this Commission, in close cooperation with governments, international organisations and NGOs, is investing a lot of effort and human resources and providing daily monitoring and dedication to make this deal work, while fully respecting European and international law. Turkey has adopted legislative changes in order to ensure that in practice all Syrians in Turkey will be granted protection or have their protection renewed. Discussions are ongoing to ensure that non-Syrians in need of international protection will have access to asylum procedures, and resettlement from Turkey has already started. Member States are deploying officers to the Greek islands. It is becoming clear now that frontline Member States need support to manage the situation, and the flows have decreased. Fewer people are putting their lives at risk; there are fewer victims of smugglers. This is what we want to achieve on a permanent basis. As some of you have rightly said, this is indeed a global challenge and requires a global response. That is why we keep an open channel of cooperation with UNHCR, the United Nations. This is why resettlement is a responsibility not just for the European Union but for all international partners, for the United States and Canada to the Gulf States. The Commission is determined to improve and strengthen our system to respond to the real needs of the new reality, whether that is asylum, legal migration, migration border systems or security. This not only means changing legislation, it also means putting the necessary human and financial resources together to effectively address the structural deficiencies of our migration and asylum system as a Union. Several of you mentioned the need to have a budget. I could not agree more, and I hope that I can count on your support to get it. We want to make our policies fit for purpose in the context of the challenges of the 21st century. This means building on what we have achieved so far but also being bold and honest to radically improve where needed. We are eager to take up a discussion with you, the European Parliament, as well as other stakeholders, to make all these ideas concrete.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 91, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Πρόεδρος. –", "mepid": "28586", "text": "   Please don't be alarmed!

Thank you, Mr President, and thank you to all my fellow Members who have contributed to this debate and to all those who have worked with us on this report.  Commissioner, like you, I wonder every day whether we will succeed in turning this crisis into an opportunity and whether we will be able to lay the foundations for a new society characterised by human mobility. Will we be able to lay the foundations for a common migration policy that is equal to the challenges of the twenty-first century? Yes, Mr President, we will succeed, but only if we are able to base our future policies on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the principles also enshrined in international law.  What is happening on the Greek-Macedonian border is shameful and the Member States must take responsibility for their actions. This resolution is only the first step on a political path that will bear fruit only if there is unity of purpose, only if the Member States decide once and for all to put aside the new policies of closure, to break down protective walls and to treat migratory flows as invasions.  We cannot deny our assistance to 0.2 % of the population of migrants. We cannot deny a process of integration to those fleeing war and persecution or simply to those who seek a better life prospect in our territories and stop criminalising certain realities and throwing mud on neighbourhoods that are experiencing difficult situations. Those who speak in these terms of Molenbeek, as well as the situation in so many other suburbs, do so in order to put their consciences in order and to gain easy electoral support.

It is good that the report raises the need to combat this phenomenon at international level in order to eradicate human traffickers' networks and prevent the smuggling of migrants.

At the outset, it is worth asking: why have the actions taken under the CAP instruments not produced the expected results? I am thinking here of the EUR 500 million aid scheme introduced last year, financing the private storage of milk powder, butter, cheese or pork. Efforts to limit the effects of the Russian embargo have also been extended.  We have repeatedly pointed out at Committee on Agriculture's level the impact of external conditions – that is, the situation on world markets – on what is happening on our European market. Global food prices have been falling in recent years, up 19% in 2015. Brazil, Argentina, m.in, as well as the weakness of their currencies, have clearly increased their production. Brazil is expected to replace the US as the world's largest soybean producer this season. Argentina has also increased its wheat production and exports as a result of the reduction in the export tax. Cereal harvests in Russia are also growing. All this is taking place with the declining demand for food from China, India. The Russian embargo, which is in its second year (as I have already mentioned), also had an impact on Europe.  A year ago, we abolished milk quotas, which encouraged many producers to increase production. Let us remember the forecasts of a 65-70% increase in food demand in 2050 as a result of the projected increase in the world's population to 9 or 10 billion people and the resulting increase in consumption, which has encouraged many farmers to increase their production.  So, with such complex external conditions, the instruments that we use in the so-called safety net are ineffective. Waiting for possible solutions to the mid-term review is to postpone the problem, which increases farmers' dissatisfaction. I think we underestimate the determination of farmers, which can end in mass protests.  Milk prices are already falling below the cost of production, as is the case in the pork market. This leads to a lack of financial resources for the continuation of production and, as a result, to the collapse of farms. Many farmers at risk of bankruptcy do not see an opportunity for their future in the agricultural sector. This will lead to a further increase in the size of farms, the scale of production and its intensity, which means moving away from the European agricultural model: sustainable and environmentally friendly. In this context, specific questions have been formulated as part of our general question. Firstly, could the Commission discuss more broadly the next steps taken to reduce the pressure on farmers in the sectors most affected? Secondly, how does the Commission assess the effectiveness of the 2015 aid package? Thirdly, how will the Commission combat unfair practices in the food supply chain and how will it ensure a fair income for farmers? Fourthly, what precautions can be taken to counteract the effects of future upheavals and disturbances on agriculture outside the borders? (What I developed at the beginning of my speech.) Fifthly, how will the Commission ensure that, following discussions with financial institutions, flexible and innovative financial instruments that producers can use are made available in a practical form? Commissioner Hogan is working very intensively in this area. It therefore seems that there is an urgent need to adopt measures for today, mainly by continuing the instruments and trends already in place, but at a correspondingly higher level – I repeat: a higher level – which would at least improve the very difficult current situation of farmers. The increase in de minimis aid can also be analysed, as it appears that additional direct support for farms is needed in such a complex situation. In this situation, farmers' expectations of the announced financial instruments and the possibility of using the European Strategic Investment Fund for important investments in the agricultural sector are increasing.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 101, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Phil Hogan", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to address this House at a time of crisis in the agricultural markets in several of our Member States and indeed, to some extent, in all of them, particularly in the dairy and pigmeat sectors. It is just a few weeks since the Commission proposed another set of measures to provide much-needed support for European farmers. I was pleased to have the opportunity to brief the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) of this House immediately after that proposal was made. Yesterday I briefed the Council of Agriculture Ministers on the significant progress that has been made in the implementation of that package of measures of 14 March. In order to provide Members with the most up-to-date information on the implementation of that package, I have written to the Chair of AGRI with full details of the follow-up to the Council, and I hope that the information can be made widely available, because I know I have limited time here. This morning I want to focus briefly on a number of the main areas that featured in the March package. I am pleased to confirm that just yesterday the Commission adopted three draft regulations. The first of these provides for a doubling of the intervention ceilings for skimmed milk powder and butter. It is now the responsibility of the Council to approve this proposal swiftly, and I expect that they will do so in the next few days. I also want to reassure you that the Commission is committed to running a tender responsibly and in a way that helps the market and does not depress prices. In relation to the introduction of the voluntary supply management in the dairy sector, the Commission is activating the provisions of Article 222 of the CMO Regulation. The implementing regulation allowing for agreements between recognised producer organisations, their associations and recognised inter-branch organisations to plan milk production for a temporary period of six months and the delegated regulation extending the measure to cooperatives and other forms of milk producer organisations were also both adopted by the Commission yesterday. The responsibility for their speedy implementation is now with the co-legislators, and I call on you to seize that responsibility with a view to ensuring that this measure is used as an effective contribution towards greater market balance in the dairy sector. In order to encourage use of this tool as an effective contributor to this crisis, I met two weeks ago with COPA-COGECA and the European Dairy Association. I also want to draw the attention of the House, in respect of what Mr Siekierski said, to the fact that I have doubled state aid ceilings on a temporary basis to allow for greater flexibility for Member States in supporting their farmers. I want to reassure the House that the Commission has and is continuing to make every effort to lift the protectionist ban that has been imposed by Russia on pig products from the European Union. Over recent months and in parallel with the WTO procedure, the Commission has made numerous efforts to convince Russia to engage in meaningful technical negotiations for an agreed solution at EU level. We also made clear that we are ready to examine any concrete proposal that Russian may submit to the European Union. Commissioner Andriukaitis expressed the Commission’s position on this matter during a meeting with the Russian ambassador to the EU last month, and he continues to pursue efforts towards the lifting of the ban. Even though, so far, the Russian reaction has not been positive, the dialogue remains open. Over the past two years, the Commission has mobilised more than EUR 1 billion in additional funding to support our farmers, which complements the EUR 56 billion which farmers receive each year. As part of that, and in response to the deteriorating market situation last summer, you will recall that the Commission took swift action in September and provided a EUR 500 million package, including EUR 420 million in direct targeted aid.  Despite the loss of the Russian market, the EU is continuing to trade very successfully. EU dairy and pigmeat exports increased by 11% and 23%, respectively, in January 2016 compared with last year. However, this has not yet translated into the pockets of farmers in terms of improving their income. The increase in dairy exports reflected a significant improvement in import demand, once again, from China. I have prioritised a number of areas and countries to visit to identify and build on new market opportunities. I have just returned from Colombia and Mexico and tomorrow I leave for Kazakhstan, China and Japan. Following my visit to Mexico, we have received some very encouraging news in relation to pigmeat opportunities: the market is opening for fresh pigmeat and processed hams from Spain, we expect the approval for fresh pigmeat from France very shortly, and there are good prospects for fresh pigmeat from Germany, Romania and Italy. An audit is scheduled in May for Poland, after which I hope to see opportunities for fresh pigmeat products. Before passing judgement on the effectiveness of either the September package or the proposals I made last month, I would urge you to give those measures the opportunity to work. In particular, I would point to the fact that, at the end of February, only EUR 162 million of the EUR 420 million that I allocated to Member States last September had been spent in 14 Member States. I accept that Member States have until the end of June to spend this money, but I would appreciate it if they had the intentions to invest it in structural change, something which I welcome. Last month the Council had the opportunity to exchange views with the Vice-President of the European Investment Bank with regard to the development by the EIB of additional financial products and financial instruments for the benefit of farmers and processors. The Commission is prioritising its engagement with the EIB with a view to developing the appropriate financial instruments to assist farmers and processors in investing in their enterprises in order to improve the competitiveness of those enterprises or in investing in making any necessary structural adjustments. Yesterday, Vice-President Katainen told the Council of the opportunities offered by the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) in agriculture. Member States have been encouraged to look into the possibilities of setting up dedicated platforms for EFSI financing. It is essential that full use is made of the opportunities on offer. The Commission’s response to date, even though in a difficult financial situation, has been swift and robust. This package of measures, when taken with the full implementation of the September solidarity package, can have a material and positive impact on European agricultural markets. I would ask for your support for the measures proposed, and I believe that we should give them a chance to succeed and, like all of you, I look forward to a better market in the future. Finally, regarding the question on the food chain that was put by Mr Siekierski, I expect proposals from the AGRI task force to be submitted to me in September this year.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 102, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Albert Deß", "mepid": "28228", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has Many thanks to all those involved who have made it possible for us to discuss today the current situation in agriculture in the European Union. We are very concerned about the situation on the agricultural markets. And we also note that the measures taken so far are not working properly. We continue to have enormous price pressure on a wide range of agricultural markets and, Commissioner, I believe that we must all think together about how we can react more quickly, how we do not react until the child has fallen into the well.  In one of the last speeches, I have just mentioned the situation in the milk sector. The current intervention price system, that does not work. We need a different system, and we must all work together on this. We need a system whereby the Commission or a body can decide that certain quantities are withdrawn from the market at some point – not withdrawn from the market until we are at 22 or 20 cents milk price. And we could create such a system here. We have a completely free capital market, and yet central banks keep intervening in this capital market. If this market does not work, quantities will be withdrawn from the capital market. We need a similar system in agriculture so that we can intervene more quickly in the market situation.  As far as the situation with the retail chains is concerned, I am of course best aware of the situation in Germany, and we have huge retail chains. Here, too, I am very concerned – here legislation is passing the parliaments – that my dairy recently received a questionnaire with 47 requirements to meet the requirements that farmers are supposed to document, at a time when they are offering the worst deals.

This is demonstrated by the insignificant effects of the EUR 450 million allocated to the milk sector last autumn: the dispersion of these resources has in fact mortified the potential for organised use aimed at curbing European production.

I am particularly interested in whether the EUR 500 million allocated by the EU seven months ago has really made a difference to the agricultural sector. Do we continue to suggest that politics can do something for market recovery or do we make real choices to make the sector stronger and healthier? Europe must take a one course and work towards improved competitiveness. First of all, look seriously at the cost side. Nationally and Europeanly, we must curb the regulatory drive. Ensure effective rules and leave room for innovation and entrepreneurship. With new techniques and insights, we can produce more efficiently and cheaply.  Secondly, create added value on our agricultural products by distinguishing ourselves by, for example, taste, quality or sustainability.  Thirdly, look for better opportunities to work together, between farmers and gardeners and along the entire chain. In short, come up with a concrete plan and don't write blank cheques.

I refer to the quite possible ban on the use of glyphosate on farms. We are voting on this tomorrow and it would be disastrous. This is a really big crisis. What has brought this about? Why are we even considering banning this very useful material? The reason is that the World Health Organisation has said that it is probably carcinogenic. On the face of it, we might all be very concerned about this, as it is serious and we should therefore not be using this material – until you look at what else the World Health Organisation also classes as probably carcinogenic. They say that sitting in front of a log fire in your home during the winter is probably a carcinogenic activity; they say that working night shifts is probably a carcinogenic activity; they say that cutting human hair (which will not worry the Commissioner or me) is probably a carcinogenic activity; exposure to dry cleaning fluid is probably a carcinogenic activity, and drinking the national drink of Argentina (which is called mate) is also probably a carcinogenic activity. When you look at these things, a ban on glyphosate is absolutely ludicrous – but it gets worse than that. What do they call definitely carcinogenic? Well, that includes the consumption of alcohol, the ingestion of the female contraceptive pill, and the consumption of processed meats. These are deliberately ingested, whereas glyphosate is just something that you may happen to be exposed to. If we do go ahead with this ban, what are the alternatives? The alternatives are for farmers to have to cultivate the soil far more than they ever used to. If you believe that farmers can improve the world’s weather by reducing CO2 emissions from their farms, you will have scored a massive own-goal here if you vote for this tomorrow, because you will pump out CO2 from all these tractor operations to try and control perennial weeds of twitch and thistles and the new weed we are all getting now called black grass. That is all going to become much more difficult. Now, what is all this really about? It is about not allowing farmers to grow GM crops, because if you ban glyphosate there will be no incentive to grow the GM crop. Let us face it: that what the ban is in aid of. I am not sure whether the Council are going to have a vote on this. I have been told that they may not, which means that our Secretary of State for Agriculture, Elizabeth Truss, will be told tomorrow that farmers in Britain cannot use glyphosate.

We are once again talking about the agricultural market crises, and we are always talking here very theoretically, and perhaps we should remember this: this is about the farmers, the farms and the people who live and work there.  We had a low-income year in 2014, and in refining, we lost another 20 percent of our income in 2015, compared to 2014. This is really very difficult for the farms to bear. Humanly, too, this pressure is no longer very good to bear, and many of these companies are stuck in the financial commitments they have made in order to be competitive in order to survive in the market. You can't just get out of production now just because it doesn't pay off. It is a real dilemma, and this dilemma was predictable.  Warnings are now being issued time and again, completely independent of the Russia embargo. And then the question arises: are we dealing with political failure here because these warnings have not been responded to early enough, or is it accepted in a condoning manner so that our food industry can secure world market shares? World market shares, which are paid dearly by the farms, by farmers, who jeopardise the widespread production of milk and meat within Europe and bleed the whole region to death. This, too, is a kind of structural reform, but it is an unsightly one.  We also talk a lot about sustainability at different levels. We have also signed the SDGs here in Europe. But overproduction is not a form of sustainability, and certainly not when we have to bring the feed here from overseas, in order to dump our surpluses, our overproduction, back on the world market.

In Greece, the price of olive oil has fallen by fifty per cent, resulting in seven hundred thousand farmers involved in olive production suffering economic ruin.

This leads to the destruction of small and medium-sized farms and will certainly turn the locals into slaves on their former lands, with immeasurable consequences for economic and political stability in the medium and long term.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 138, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Marc Tarabella (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "29579", "text": "   Mr President, Commissioner, indeed, we have been talking about this continuing crisis for over a year, and the solutions provided are only 'measures' in view of the scale of the problem.

In light of these observations, I think it is important to highlight two things: we must pay particular attention to the impact of free trade agreements that could further increase the instability of the most important agricultural markets - I am thinking of TTIP and Mercosur - and, finally, we need to think about putting in place countercyclical tools to help farmers in this CAP that no longer meets its objectives.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 139, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Bas Belder (ECR).", "mepid": "4507", "text": "   – The crisis in our agricultural sectors continues.

The originality and excellence of our European products must be what must be our global competitiveness, competitiveness on the world market.

But for farmers there is a small element of ‘live, horse and you’ll get grass’ about this, because a short-term crisis could put a lot of them out of business. So that is why we have to try and come up with short-term solutions. I know the Commission has done an awful lot (EUR 500 million last year, etc.), but is there room for more in the short term? The situation, especially in my country, has been exacerbated by horribly bad weather and the threat of Brexit, so they need help now.

I want to assure you that I share your concerns. However, we can only take action on the basis of the framework of the legislation that was agreed by you and the Council in 2013 and which I am implementing from 1 January 2015. I would like to say to Mrs Noichl that I am not ploughing my own furrow in this regard. I am exhausting all of the tools that have been given to me within the law and the budget. I do not of course need to go into the details about the backdrop to the situation that we have in terms of the market. We have a global oversupply in our milk and pig meat products and we have the Russian embargo, which has not helped and has resulted in a reduction of EUR 5.2 billion of exports to that destination. But I have responded on a number of issues, and I just want to go through them again. I have responded on intervention ceilings by increasing the ceilings by 100% for skimmed milk powder and butter. I am invoking Article 222 for the first time to bring about a stabilisation of milk production and to bring about greater balance in demand and supply. This can be funded through the existing targeted aid measures that have not yet been spent by some Member States or by state aids. I would draw your attention to the flexibility that we are giving in respect of state aids for the first time. Measures under state aid rules, which have been doubled from EUR 7 500 to 15 000 per farmer per annum, can be used for the purpose of the promotion of agricultural products or the closure of production capacity if they are notified and approved in the agricultural state aid guidelines. Holdings may be granted rescue and restructuring aid if they fulfil the conditions that are set out in the horizontal state aid guidelines. Member States could also be allowed to set up access to finance schemes under which aid in the form of loans or guarantees is granted in order to bridge liquidity gaps. Where farmers have undertaken at least to freeze their production during a certain period at a level that has been attained in comparison to a reference period to be determined by the Commission, the aid could be granted in the form of direct grants. So I am saying to Members who have raised the issue of how we are implementing Article 222 and creating some balance between supply and demand in the milk sector that we are giving the maximum flexibility in order to implement that measure. As I have said already, I allocated EUR 420 million in a targeted aid package last September and only EUR 162 million has been drawn down to date, so I wonder what the Member States are going to do with that money, although I know that some of them are considering structural reforms as well. We have more money for new market opportunities, for new promotion measures; we have new outlets for these particular funds; and we have more money for school schemes that Mr Tarabella has successfully brought through Parliament with your support, which is now EUR 250 million per annum, an extra EUR 50 million in the budget. We have EUR 30 million being invested in humanitarian assistance, and this is from products in the European Union as well. We allow flexibility for the modification of the rural development programmes to target sectors that are under financial pressure, and of course we have the voluntary coupled support, particularly in areas of national constraint. So we are not renationalising agriculture. We are providing EUR 56 billion from European taxpayers every year to farmers. So I disagree with Mr Takkula, who talked about EUR 3 billion for Turkey and nothing for farmers. EUR 56 billion every year for farmers is a significant amount of money. With regard to trade deals, it is essential in relation to the Mercosur negotiations on trade that we convey a consistent measure as governments. So it is important that the agriculture ministers and the trade ministers are working in tandem and that the EU is ready to make a meaningful contribution in agriculture. But we would ask – and I would ask, as Agriculture Commissioner – that Mercosur should moderate its expectations to what is manageable and acceptable to the EU both politically and economically, particularly in these difficult times for some of our sectors. I want to assure Mr Nicholson that the yellow card and simplification agenda is very much intact and that we are proceeding to give farmers who make minor errors the benefit of the doubt in relation to the yellow card system. Simplification proposals will emerge again for implementation shortly. I would say to Mr Häusling that I have outlined what I have done on Article 222, so I am seeking measures and implementing measures that are containing production and bringing about a greater balance in supply. So I do not accept it when you say that that I am doing nothing about bringing about a balance in the marketplace. You are advocating that we should not go to the extreme of opening new markets. Well, we are going to continue to open new markets and that will be part of the solution in creating further opportunities and outlets for our agricultural products. In relation to structural change and funding that structural change, the targeted aid measures and the state aids that I have just outlined are applicable in relation to structural change if regions in Germany – or indeed Germany as a whole – would wish to participate. Everybody wants access to more money. As I said, we have already allocated some money which has not been utilised yet, so it is very difficult for me to go looking for more money when that money has not been expended. Secondly, I would be interested in the views of Parliament in relation to the use of the crisis reserve. Should it be used? What are the circumstances in which we should use it? I would be interested in your views on that. In relation to the food chain, I note the unfair trading practices report which was published in January, and I do not agree with the conclusions that the report came up with. I look forward to the proposals of Members of this House to be submitted to the Agricultural Markets Task Force, which will report next September. I would urge you to make your proposals sooner rather than later. I would also mention that this group is looking at financial instruments and new tools which we can use to protect farmers in the context of price volatility. These include hedge funds and also insurance products. Regarding withdrawal prices in relation to fruit and vegetables that were mentioned by Ms Aguilera García and Ms Herranz García in relation to Spain, this is certainly under review. We also have to extend from 30 June – I am trying to find the money to do this – the impact of the fruit and vegetable sector in relation to the Russian ban. So these issues are still under review and we will be making a decision shortly. I would like to conclude by saying that I very much recognise the difficulties that exist across the markets, but this is the second package of proposals that we are implementing in order to reflect the concerns that have been expressed here. I hope that these will have an immediate impact during the course of 2016 to ameliorate the financial difficulties of our farming community.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 151, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Der Präsident. –", "mepid": "28242", "text": "   We thank the Commissioner for this reply, although the volume was a little difficult at the end.

The Macao Agreement is thus intended to regulate a number of aspects of air services, such as the provisions on the determination, safety, taxes and compatibility of the competition rules. For example, in safety matters, the provisions will apply to cases where regulatory control over an air carrier is exercised by a Member State other than that whose designation it bears. The provisions also apply to the taxation of aviation fuel and also prohibit anti-competitive practices. The agreement was signed as early as 2013 and requires the consent of the European Parliament to approve it.

For consumers, the destination principle favours national production over imports as imports would in principle become more expensive. For export countries with a surplus on the current account balance, the origin principle is preferable. For deficit countries the destination principle is preferable.

It is therefore good that the European Commission plans to introduce a new system to combat the current abuses next year. Thanks to it, the company supplying the goods to another EU country will have to pay tax in its country at the VAT rate in force in the country of destination and only the tax office will transfer the received amount to the tax office in the country of the importer's premises. However, cross-border abuse is only part of the problem. With the development of VAT, most countries have decided to introduce different reduced or zero rates. These decisions were to be part of a combination of two policies – fiscal and social.

However, less than 1 % of these areas outside national jurisdiction are protected by the establishment of marine protected areas. In this new instrument, it is important to also include fishing activities, as fishing is one of the most important activities in the waters. The new instrument must complement the current structure (networks of international regional authorities regulating fishing in certain maritime areas) and not replace it.

The report on improving single market regulation provides the main directions for strengthening the governance of the Single Market and regulating the Single Market. Improving the regulation of the single market aims to create a clear, coherent and competitive regulatory framework to support innovation, production and trade and boost the economic growth of the European Union. This requires a concerted effort, a joint responsibility of the European institutions to transpose the principle of subsidiarity. The Single Market must be a priority for the European institutions, and good regulation is needed, policy-making based on the principle of subsidiarity.

In addition, the report contains statements which, in our opinion, speak excessively of an internal market as a potential driver of the economy.

Until now, we have placed great emphasis on exchanges in academia, and yet the labour market is also admonished for highly qualified professionals. The economy also needs good workers with lower education who will be professionals in their field, have good knowledge and will do their job solidly. Going to another country and being able to practice their profession in a new environment is a unique experience that allows young people to become more open, flexible, mobile and independent. These are, after all, the characteristics that employers are looking for the most now. Such an exchange is also an opportunity to compare the technologies and traditions of different countries.

Our citizens are right to expect concrete action to counter terrorism, both from their governments and from the EU. We share your strong will to fight terrorism, as was expressed by your representative Sylvie Guillaume on 24 March. She said ‘Europe will not bow to terrorism. Our unity and determination to uphold our values and rights are only made stronger. Action must cover every aspect of the threat, from prevention to protection and prosecution’, and she is right. So yes, the EU must build a coherent internal security policy that delivers results and protects human rights. As co-legislator, Parliament has a key role to play in this by, for example, strengthening external border controls, and clearly cooperation on security and information-sharing is key to maintaining freedom of movement without internal border controls. And all of us will have to understand that our internal and external security is closely interwoven. In other words, internal and external security can no longer be kept separate. An integrated approach is needed. To give you a brief update on events: immediately after the attacks in Brussels we convened the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers for a meeting on 24 March. Vice-President Sylvie Guillaume was also present, together with representatives from Europol, Eurojust, the Schengen-associated countries and Interpol. The Belgian ministers briefed their colleagues about the attacks. In a joint statement the ministers condemned the attacks and extended our sympathy to the victims and their families and our support and solidarity to Belgium. They also set out a number of priority areas for action, building on the efforts which are already under way. We are not starting from scratch. Unfortunately, terrorism has been on the agenda for years and at the very forefront since the terrorist attacks in Paris in January 2015. Priorities have been agreed and considerable progress has been made towards implementation, as set out by the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator in his latest report of March 2016. But more needs to be done. The ministers’ statement once again underlines the urgent need to increase the amount of data systematically fed into the system, in both qualitative and quantitative terms, and to ensure consistent use of our different databases and their interoperability. We need to make optimal use of the tools we already have. Firstly, maximum feeding and use of the databases by Member States is crucial. SIS II and the focal point traveller at Europol are of particular importance. The Presidency is undertaking work to improve the use of SIS II, with the objective being to agree on a number of actions at the JHA Council in June. Secondly, the European Counter-Terrorism Centre at Europol (ECTC) has been operational since 1 January this year. The ECTC has been asked by France and Belgium to support the investigations after the November Paris attacks and the Brussels attacks, which Europol is doing, discovering links across the EU, which entails not only information collection and sharing but also analysis. Therefore, at the extraordinary meeting on 24 March, ministers decided to set up a joint liaison team of national counter-terrorism experts to support the Member States’ law enforcement authorities in investigating the wider European and international dimensions of the current terrorist threat. Thirdly, special attention will be given to the Commission communication on smart borders and interoperability which was issued last week. Improving the interoperability of the EU’s information system is a priority for the Presidency. It is important that customs, police and law enforcement officials can quickly and effectively consult our common databases. Privacy by design will, obviously, play a key role moving forward on this, and yes, Parliament’s role will be important once again. The Presidency wants ambitious results in June. Counter-terrorism has been added to the agenda of the Justice and Home Affairs Council in April. The roadmap with concrete deliverables on interoperability of databases and information-sharing and better use of information systems will be prepared for the June Council meeting, and there is more that we can do. Together we need to speed up the negotiation of pending legislation. I refer in particular to the Firearms Directive and the Terrorism Directive, as well as the targeted amendments to the Schengen Borders Code about systematic controls of EU citizens at EU external borders. As the statement of 24 March points out, we need preventive measures as well as repressive measures to effectively counter terrorism, which is why it is also important to make progress preventing radicalisation. As you know, the Radicalisation Awareness Network and its working groups are actively sharing experiences and best practices. The Internet Referral Unit at Europol will reach full operational capacity in 2016 and has already made significant headway in cooperation with internet companies to remove online terrorist material. We know there is a strong political will at Parliament to make progress on counter-terrorism measures. We share this determination and we look forward to working with you in order to advance as quickly and effectively as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3355, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Commission President. Mr President, Madam President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, terrorists know no borders. They are striking in Europe, they are striking outside Europe, because they want to attack our way of life and all of our values. On March 22, they struck in Brussels, a city dear to us, a city we love, a city of our friendships and loves, a city where we are used to living in harmony with those we live with. The Commission is in mourning. She is in mourning because, in these cowardly attacks, we lost Patricia Rizzo, a young Italian woman full of energy, fine, intelligent, radiant. We'll remember it for a long time.  I would like to pay tribute to each of the victims, to have a thought for each of them, for each of these shattered lives, and I wish to give great courage to each of the injured and their families. Similarly, I would like to salute the daily work of all those through whom we can resume the usual course of our activities by feeling safe, while continuing to enjoy our freedoms and, in particular, that of travelling. It is our responsibility to provide them with all the necessary tools so that they can carry out their mission to the best of their ability. This is what the Commission has been working on for months, whether it is to improve air passenger screening, external border control, police and legal cooperation between Member States, not to mention the essential cooperation between the secret services. New momentum is needed today for greater sharing of this information and intelligence efforts. In this regard, cooperation is the strength.  Just last week, the Commission presented new proposals on the subject, including how current and future information systems could both improve the management of external borders and strengthen internal security in Europe. It should be noted, in fact, that there are already a number of information systems throughout the European Union that provide border guards and police with relevant information on the movement of people.  But as too often, when it comes to security issues, the problem is not so much the lack of tools as the lack of use of existing tools and especially the lack of cooperation. Relevant information exists, but it is too often lost and, too often, it comes too late. So we need to move towards more interconnection and interoperability.  The truth is that, whatever the quality of the Commission's legislative proposals, whatever the support of this Parliament or the sophistication of the systems used, the fight against terrorism in Europe will not be fully effective until the Member States are prepared to cooperate more with each other and with European agencies, including Europol.  That is why I would say that in the fight against terrorism, no one can afford to give lessons to anyone, and especially not to Belgium, which, I would like to say here, is a great country that is heavily tested. No condescension towards Belgium! (Applause) Let us not forget that this is not the first time that heavy and indiscriminate terrorism has struck in Europe and, if there is a failure, it is first and foremost a collective failure. We have been vowing for decades to learn all the lessons from such attacks. I remember the European councils in 1999 and again in 2001 when, together with my friend Guy Verhofstadt and others, we vowed to establish a genuine exchange of information between intelligence services.  Now is the time to take action. In the area of security, as in many other areas in Europe, it is fragmentation that makes us vulnerable. Europe needs a true security union. I am counting on the support of this Parliament to bring to fruition every proposal that the Commission has already put forward and which may be precursors to this security union which I would like to see put in place in the long run.  In the aftermath of the November 2015 attacks in Paris, the European Commission presented a package of legislative and non-legislative proposals to make it more difficult to acquire firearms in Europe. It took the Commission six days to come up with proposals. Today, six months later, I see no concrete sign that they will be adopted soon.  The Commission, however, continues to do its job. In a few weeks, we will present an update on the progress of our safety program as well as a roadmap ambitious in its content and timetable, with new measures to be implemented. The Commission must be able to count on the cooperation of the European Parliament and the Council. It is about the security and freedoms of our citizens. It is a common responsibility first.

We are talking about the 37-year-old mother who died at the airport and is leaving behind twins, about the 30-year-old illustrator of children's books who loved the city of Brussels and who dies in the metro, and we are talking about the young Muslim teacher who was on the metro on her way to school. Three examples, three innocents, three victims. This is an attack on us Europeans that has taken place there. First of all, to think of the victims is our PPE-DE objective. The second thing, ladies and gentlemen, is to say thank you – the firefighter who arrives at the scene shortly after the attacks, completely smokes without knowing whether there are any further threats, and yet helps the nurses who have worked long hours to help the people, and the policemen and, by the way, the soldiers who stand in front of our facilities here in Strasbourg and Brussels. to ensure our safety. Thank you very much to all these forces defending Europe! Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which The third thing we need to address is the question of our responsibility. Within the framework of legislation, we must ask ourselves the question: are we doing enough? Ladies and gentlemen, no, it is not enough what we do. More security requires more cooperation in Europe. That is why the Commission – Commissioner Avramopoulos and our President of the Commission – can count on the support of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats when it comes to this new common European security agency. We need networking. The secrecy of the Member States must finally come to an end. And the interior ministers have a great responsibility to finally put an end to this secrecy. We need better handling of data. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has been calling for months that we need passenger data. They won't solve all the problems, but it's an important tool to move forward. That is why we are pleased that, after much pressure, we will finally be voting on the issue of passenger data on Thursday. It is exciting for our investigative authorities to know who regularly flies to Syria, who regularly flies to Afghanistan. We must have this data. And we need more. We currently have an agreement with the Americans on the evaluation of financial flows, the so-called TFTP agreement. In other words, we are offering our bank data to the Americans so that they can evaluate how terror is financed. I ask myself the question: why do we not do this ourselves? Why is Europe not itself in a position to analyse its own data and to know how terror is financed? We do not have a TFTP in the European Union, but the Americans are, so to speak, our subcontractor. I want to do this independently in the European Union with European data protection standards. That is why we need more commitment. Europol: Voluntary information collection has failed. We need a Europol that has the right to request and request information from the Member States, not to provide information on a voluntary basis. Last but not least, the Internet has lost its innocence. We have room for hatred on the Internet, we have room on the Internet for recruiting new terrorists that are taking place there, for agitation against our principles. That is why it is the duty of the Internet companies to ensure that we play the rules on the Internet. And we need a European structure – a networking authority – that makes it clear that not everything is allowed on the Internet. We need this new European security agency, and the Commission will have our support in this. The Ppe-DE is ready. Finally, I would like to say one more thought: the terrorists basically want to fight our way of life, freedom, liberality, the joy of life. They want to replace them with fear, anger and also hatred. And that is why the most important thing we, as Europeans, can give in response to this terrorism, is simply to continue to practice our lives, simply to live as we see fit.

We want high levels of data protection, and we now have high levels of data protection enshrined in The PNR legislation– as well as in the data protection regulation that you are responsible for.  We are not going down an American path of the fight against terror, we are going down a European path. But it's also clear that data is powerful tools in the world we live in today– as Google and Facebook prove every day.

The uniqueness of life, of the life that Patricia Rizzo and many others have lost, the idea that every life is sacred is the legacy on which contemporary society was built. I say this because I believe that, in order to combat terrorism, we must first of all ask ourselves how it is possible that our children have come to deny the heart of our civilisation.  I know it is a sensitive subject, but I do not believe that Islam is behind this ideology of death. I think that rather than questioning radical Islam, we should ask ourselves about the radicalisation of Islam. These criminals do not espouse Islam, which is a religion of peace, but instead espouse desperate radicalism, they are, in short, the children of the uprooting of global society. More than the result of religious awareness, they are the poisoned fruits of a multiculturalism that in many cases has failed. Behind the rhetoric of multiculturalism, communi communitism has often been hidden, that is, the idea that men and women of different origins cannot live together, but must each be in separate social groups that then end up being ghettos.  The first response to this attack is therefore to rediscover the reasons that unite us and to reaffirm a citizenship that involves rights, but also common values and duties. This reasoning must then be accompanied by urgent actions: first of all, national governments must implement existing instruments such as the exchange of DNA data, the exchange of fingerprint data.  Against terrorism the main weapons are intelligence and investigations, Europe is lagging behind, unfortunately terrorists strike us in our uniqueness and we respond divided. We must therefore create European intelligence, not yet another coordination structure, but a single intelligence service that collects and networks information, and we also need a European counter-terrorism super-prosecutor capable of conducting investigations throughout the Union and then we also need determination in foreign policy.  I continue to support with great conviction the things that Federica Mogherini is doing, we must be serious. Isis is also there because it is part of a cynical game of regional interests. In order to defeat Isis, we must start by combating those who buy oil produced by Isis in the areas that govern Isis and those who procure its goods. The West cannot, with one hand, attack Isis and do business with those who feed Isis, none of us have the magic wand to defeat terrorism, but we can all provide cohesion, intelligence and humility.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3360, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Syed Kamall", "mepid": "33569", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, it is rather sad that it is often at moments like this that we as a Chamber come together. We all come together to condemn the acts that we have seen over the last few months, in fact years, in many of our countries. But after each attack we have questions. A few days after the Brussels attacks, a man in my constituency tweeted how he had confronted a Muslim woman in Croydon in South London, and asked her ‘to explain Brussels’. His tweet upset a lot of people. Another Twitter user replied: ‘What has a Muslim woman in Croydon, South London, got to do with the horrific events in Belgium?’ So while his original tweet may have been offensive or clumsy, it also demonstrates that we are all looking for answers, whether we have no faith, another faith or are Muslims. We all want to explain Brussels: a city we know so well, whose citizens have buried family, colleagues and friends prematurely after these appalling acts. Last month I opened a conference of the European Parliament, organised by the Iman Foundation, on tackling extremism and terrorism. What was interesting about this conference was that while there may be people here in this Chamber who call for more European agencies to solve all these problems, none of the speakers or experts present there claimed that there was a single solution or metaphorical silver bullet. Instead they spoke about the need to tackle terrorism at various levels: at an international level, militarily, through use of intelligence and diplomacy; at a national level, upholding the rule of law, defence of our values and security of our citizens; and at a local community level to tackle extremism at its roots. We spoke about the drivers of terrorism: some searching for an identity or a sense of belonging, others radicalised in prisons; some violent individuals looking for a new cause, others with grievances over perceived unfair foreign policy; yet others who are vulnerable and fooled into believing there is a final shortcut to paradise in a world of temptation. While we debate these issues here today, are we really clear about what we as MEPs can do to tackle this issue? Yes, we can vote for a new PNR system that takes account of concerns over data protection and civil liberties. Yes, we could encourage our intelligence agencies to work together. But this will only happen if they can trust each other and feel confident enough to share information, not if you force them. But for those of us who represent constituencies where young people have been radicalised, allow me to suggest one more thing we can do. At the Iman conference last month I invited the Unity of Faiths Foundation (TUFF FC project) from London to speak about how they harness the power of football to give a sense of team spirit and instil British values in youngsters from different religions. At the project I had met a young lady who told me how she almost went to Syria, after being recruited via social media such as Snapchat. The project's founder, when he found out about this, made a few phone calls and gave her the choice of going through the gate of the airport to Syria or the gates of the stadium of the Premier League team that she supported. When she arrived at the stadium she was so overcome that she knelt down to kiss the pitch and now through her experience encourages others not to be recruited to terrorism. Think of how much death and destruction that one act could have prevented; and as the project’s founder said, one of the best ways to counter terrorism is to prevent people from becoming terrorists. There must be similar projects in many of our cities that we can support and encourage, and if not, let me know, since TUFF is willing to come to your town or city to help set up a similar project. So, whilst we may not be able to ‘explain Brussels’, we may be able to help stop more attacks by encouraging cooperation across intelligence and security services, by giving security and law enforcement agencies whatever tools we can in a free and open society and by supporting projects that stop young people becoming terrorists and by all of us saying that we will not treat all Muslims with suspicion. We will not drive more people into the arms of extremists. We will not let the terrorists win.

I agree with him that what we must not do now is repeat the ritual of using strong words and making solemn declarations. Now is the moment to act and to make a number of changes. I fully agree with him. This is the opposite of what Mr Kamall is saying; it is fragmentation which is the problem in Europe, and our intelligence services and police services have to work better with each other. Well, I can tell you, Mr Kamall, that we have been hearing this so-called recipe for decades. It is not a recipe. We need European capacities; this is also the lesson from history. In America the Federal Bureau of Investigation was created in 1901 after the terrorist attack where President McKinley, the President of the USA at that time, was killed. In Germany it was exactly the same story. The Bundeskriminalamt was upgraded and was created as a federal agency after the Rote Armee Fraktion attacks. That was their lesson from history, and it is time, Mr Kamall, that your Group also learned that lesson, and that we created European capacities and European capabilities to solve the problem. Let us be honest. Let us face the reality. I have here the long list of all the terrorist attacks in recent years. In Madrid the perpetrators were known to the French and British police. In London the attackers responsible for the bombing were followed and even partially arrested by the French police. The attack on a Jewish Museum in Brussels was by a French terrorist known to the French authorities and even by the German intelligence services. It is the same story for Charlie Hebdo. They were known by the British authorities before the attacks. The same goes for Abdeslam, who was not stopped at the roadblock in Cambrai because the French did not have him in their files, while the Belgians knew very well who he was. The same goes for what the Germans did a few weeks before the attacks in Paris. They found weapons and did not inform their French colleagues at that time. The same is now true again in the attacks in Brussels, where apparently the Swedish had information and did not send it to the Belgian authorities. How many attacks, Mr Kamall, are still needed before everybody understands that we need a real investigation capacity at European level as quickly as possible? Let us face the reality. We have the possibility to do so. Terrorists do not know borders. It is our police services and our intelligence services who know borders. We have the possibility now to change that and to build that up, Mr Avramopoulos, because we have the file on Europol. We have finished the second reading. My proposal is to use the second reading between Parliament and Council to make a few amendments; not to delay it again until the end of the year, but to act immediately in the coming weeks. There are three changes that can be made. First of all, change the regulation of Europol in Articles 1 and 3 and give them the possibility of having an investigation capacity and not only a coordination role. That is the first proposal. My second proposal is that we amend Article 6 of the regulation to finally give Europol the possibility to launch an investigation or oblige national authorities to do so. They do not even have that possibility today. Finally, and maybe the most important problem, Article 7 of the regulation, Mr Avramopoulos, currently says that the national authorities of Europol have to filter the information to Europol. I thought what they had to do was the opposite, namely to transfer the relevant data to Europol. So my proposal is that, instead of talking again about coordination, coordination, cooperation, cooperation – enough of these words – we use the Europol file to put that in place and also to change the role of the European prosecutor, because the European prosecutor cannot only be responsible for financial fraud. We need to change that so that the prosecutor is also responsible for transnational crimes like, for example, terrorism. So that is my proposal: rather than making minor fixes to an old Europol file, to use it in the coming weeks to make a leap forward and to do what the Americans did 115 years ago.

Nevertheless, here, as the Liberal Group, you are in favour of the indiscriminate storage of passenger data, which is not at all capable of remedying this maladministration and which is capable of tying up the hundreds of millions of euros that we would need in order to invest it in an effective Europol and joint investigation teams under this umbrella.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3365, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Guy Verhofstadt (ALDE)", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  blue-card answer. – All storage of data can be useful, including passenger name records, on the condition that there is the capacity to analyse it, to transfer it from one authority to the other, and that there are no walls between the different databases.

Besides the fact that we are going to create 28 databases, it is also necessary that the Commission comes forward as soon as possible with a horizontal system for mandatory sharing of information, without which it is a useless tool.

Mr President, first of all I would like to reiterate on behalf of GUE/NGL our anguish and resuation at the recent terrorist attacks in Brussels. Our thoughts are with the victims of the attacks and their families and we express our sympathy and solidarity with the Belgian, French and other peoples who are experiencing terrorism. Because, ladies and gentlemen, the innocent people who pay a death toll because of fanaticism and intolerance are not only in Europe, they are also in Lebanon in Pakistan, India, Tunisia, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.  These criminal attacks and the rise of fundamentalism are the direct consequence of the wars created by interventions, it is the unfair distribution of wealth and the political interference of the major powers in the internal affairs of the countries. The European Union is not without responsibility. We must remember that large Member States have stubbornly followed American imperialism and have politically and economically supported all the extreme Islamist organisations, of which the terrorist monster of ISIS has emerged.  But the peoples of Europe have a historic duty not to succumb to the Islamophobic, racist slurs of the far right that wants to target foreigners, refugees and Muslims, inside and outside Europe. If European societies accept that their security depends on new draconian measures of file, mass surveillance, further reduction of individual rights and freedoms, then this will be a retreat and defeat of democratic values in the face of terrorism. The best and most effective way to deal with the dark forces of terrorism is through the war against injustice, against widening economic inequalities, against interventions and wars that breed the monster of terrorism.  It is also a fact that the terrorists of Paris and Brussels were naturalised Europeans, born in Europe, and this demonstrates the failure of the migrant integration systems, and I would like to congratulate President Juncker, because from the very first moment he noted this very fact by declaring that the fight against terrorism does not go through the creation of more democracy, but through the strengthening of those social policies that will bring social development, justice and solidarity.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how can we not be appalled by the irretrievable loss of these human lives, by the upheaval of these lives, which are forever bruised, by these coldly prepared acts of death? With all our hearts, we are with the victims of these despicable acts and with their loved ones. But how can we not be worried when danger creeps into the most innocuous gestures and movements of our daily lives? How can we not be outraged by the fact that, as Guy Verhofstadt very well said, most of the perpetrators of these attacks and those in Paris were long-known, but that, for lack of information sharing and, above all, for lack of exploitation, they were left free to move?  How can we not be outraged that even today our countries trade, including arms, with the States of the Middle East which promote the most violent and fundamentalist forms of Islam? Finally, how can we fail to question what has created a breeding ground within our societies for hate speech and violence - discrimination, inequality, exclusion, the reduction of human beings to a factor of production or consumption? Ladies and gentlemen, if we were to respond to these attacks by setting up police states, constantly monitoring the least of our actions, by an even greater stigmatization of our fellow Muslims, by the closure of our society on itself and by the adoption of a warlike rhetoric separating the world between \"them\" and \"us\", the terrorists would have won. On the contrary, the best answer we can offer them is the one that combines Belgian and European currencies so well, \"unity in diversity is strength\". Let us face them, intelligently joining forces to derail their murderous projects, but above all by ensuring that our societies put the human dignity, the dignity of every human being, back at the heart of their project. I would like to finish, Mr President, if I may, with a short quote from my Corsican friend Jean-François Bernardini \"do not excuse anything, forget nothing, resist, seek to understand, otherwise we maintain evil.

They were supported by large states, both economically and militarily and politically.  Even today, they have trade relations with some countries that are our allies, the West I mean, like Saudi Arabia, like Turkey, and they are supported by these countries economically and commercially.

Its fundamental weaknesses lie in the turgid, lengthy and often outdated processes required to address what are now fast-moving events, not merely on the European continent but also on a global scale; but more fundamentally in the sacrosanct protection that it enjoys in the face of fundamental threats to civil society and citizens. Trying to connect 28 Member States’ varied cultures and processes at a time of crisis, the EU is unable to anticipate events or to react at adequate speed to these events. This is not an approach capable of countering let alone beating terrorism. When there is a threat, it is important to think like the adversary and not bury oneself in mindless dialogue and consultation with the objective of protecting a sacred cow. The United Kingdom endured some 30 years of conflict and terrorist activities before a resolution in Northern Ireland was found. The UK has much to offer the European and international community on how to counter terrorism: not least money-laundering, a key element in terrorist funding and financing. But in contrast, the EU seems purely focused on unified border control and a central intelligence agency. But these so far have been total failures, critical weaknesses serving only to facilitate the recent terrorist atrocities. Now again, the United Kingdom has led the way in combating international counter-terrorist efforts via the Five Eyes, Signet and as a founding member of the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum, and the UK will maintain those responsibilities, EU member or not. In contrast, the EU reaction to the migrant crisis has been unhelpful in the extreme and its reactions unhelpful and just like those of a rabbit in the headlights. The EU has its border control agency Frontex, which consumes several hundred million euros but is not operational and is little more than a data collection and analysis agency. It produces reports and stats, fine; it is supposed to coordinate the activities of Member States in border control according to its charter, but in fact it has no operational capability, and it has to rely on NATO, individual Member States and other operational forces to do anything useful. Indeed, we have a basic conflict of interests here for Frontex in that the EU mantra is open borders with no control. The EU probably never imagined that its open border mantra would encourage the movement of criminals, terrorists and weapons. The result has been that a number of countries have had to take unilateral action to defend their borders and actually, as a result, break their Treaty obligations. But just look at INTCEN, set up as a fledgling European intelligence agency: yet another failure, doing little more than gathering data. The collection of data, such as fingerprints (already mentioned by others) at the borders within Europe, has been a disastrous example. Only 17% of migrants at key points of entry have been fingerprinted, and to make matters worse, even if their fingerprints have been taken, no one within the Member States has been allowed to share that data. There could be no greater gift to terrorism than being invisible and untraceable, yet this is what the European Union approach facilitates. We have talked about PNR, but that is stuck in turgid debate, as we well know. But there are issues about privacy and human rights, and I do wonder, having been criticised for the comment on frontier Europe, are we not actually building that? For too many in this Parliament, the response is: for rectification of these failures, we need more Europe. And we heard that this afternoon. Why would anyone pour more money into an approach and into structures that are broken, ill-conceived and ineffective? These can be addressed, but just not by doing more of the same; that is the definition of an idiot. It could well be argued that the EU should stick to matters that it can usefully address and do well, but stay out of matters where it does not have the experience or capability. General Michael Hayden, ex-head of the NSA in the US, said security is a national issue. Now is the time for the EU and Parliament to open their eyes to what is going on and bear in mind that the future is – and this should be recognised – bilateral agreements based on good data exchange.

The fight against Islam should have started long ago, because Islamic ghettos are cheering and protecting these Islamic heroes.  Let me be clear, Mr President, I see it this way: you too are morally responsible for these attacks, as are many other MEPs, Commissioners and national heads of government, all of whom are calling for open borders and a welcome to migrants from Muslim countries.

They are the ones who, in the name of God, take innocent lives. It is the action of the Islamic caliphate and fanatical Muslims across the globe. There was terrorism before the emergence of the caliphate, so it will exist after its elimination, as long as there are fanatics. Terrorists use migration flows and can move virtually uncontrollably between European states and training camps. It is the incompatibility of most forms of Islam with European values that will always lead to extreme confrontations.  We have to deal with the very root of the problem.

I think it's unfortunate. If the dead had occurred in Britain or occurred in France, we would have had them all here noticing. And instead, we've heard them say things like Islam is a terrorist ideology or that Europe is to blame for terrorism. Things like that can't you tell the victims by looking them in the eye. And I ask you, Mr President, to demand a correction from the two parliamentary groups which have said here that Europe is guilty of terrorism or that Islam is a terrorist ideology. That's not how we fight terrorism. (Applause) What we say in this House is heard outside. If we sow fear, we'll gather fear. If we sow a grudge, we'll gather hate. And if we sow division, we'll collect misunderstanding. As Malala would say, a policeman can arrest a terrorist, but only politics can end terrorism. But a policy that is made from unity, a policy that is made by understanding and including victims, a policy that is made clear that well-being and prosperity are not only yearnings of the West, but belong to all humanity. It's not the Muslims, it's not the refugees; they're the terrorists. Islam is not a terrorist. Jihadism is an ideology, not a religion. That's why jihadism isn't just about cops. You also struggle with pencils; you struggle with books; you struggle with schools. Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot face terrorism if we do not know what we are dealing with. They are not enemies of any country; are enemies of freedom. We are living in such a paradoxical situation that we are erecting walls in Europe to stop refugees, because we are afraid of them. And they are the victims, when their executioners, their persecutors are born, educated and live among us. If we close the walls, we will not let the victims in and be left alone in our countries with the executioners.

The attacks in Brussels a stone's throw from my office and from my home town have shocked us deeply. Brussels is the city where I spent my childhood, Brussels is in my pocket. True people in Brussels are open and tolerant, have a sense of humour and love life, which is why terror affects us so deeply in our hearts and souls.

The fact that this dossier was blocked in this house despite great efforts by national authorities is a pity! The fact that this dossier was thwarted even after Paris in this house is disgraceful!

Firstly, one point: in the fight against terrorism, data exchange is a very important function. Of course, there are shortcomings on the part of the Member States, which do not exchange enough data, are sometimes too slow and have not set up enough in the institutions to exchange data precisely. However, there is also a problem here in this Parliament. Every time it comes to making databases interoperable, there were always concerns, especially on the part of the left of the house, but also, dear Sophie in 't Veld, partly by yourself too. If, for example, Eurodac was to make it accessible to the police and law enforcement authorities to make automatic data matching with the SIS databases, this is not yet possible. In other words, we need data exchange and interoperability, but here too we need confidence in our security authorities, and we must give them the tools to make the best use of the necessary databases in order to make the best use of the data. We need confidence in Europol and, dear Jan Philipp Albrecht, when you say here that Europol should be expanded, then I would like the Greens to vote positively next time on our motions – when it comes to strengthening Europol, better equipping Europol with staff. We must stop standing in each other's way here in this House, but we must also accompany things in a positive way. Thirdly, I would like to see the terrorism directive, the issue, stop people travelling at risk – not those who are already being sought, but those who are in a dangerous environment – stop them travelling, no matter in which direction we inform each other and also prevent them from doing so. I hope that we will be able to stop radicalisation on the Internet, because the Internet must not be a lawless area, but must be just as much a legal area as the normal world in which we live here.

Terrorists do not target a country, a nation or a people's community. The attack was not directed against the Belgians, the French or the people of Brussels, but against the way we live, against the core of our European values. Part of the solution will therefore lie in the joint development of these values by putting them forward in our education. Raising our children, our young people with European values: equality between men and women, diversity, openness, justice, freedom of expression. That will be essential and is part of the solution.

The security policy of the last 15 years has been a one-track policy which says that more and more data needs to be acquired, and this has come at the cost of policemen on the streets. For the last 15 years we have been reducing the number of policemen on the streets in each of the Member States.

Terrorism has claimed over 180 lives since January 2015 in Europe and many more have been seriously injured, many more lives changed forever. You know, because I said it many times before, if we do not put aside the national silo mentality, terrorists will strike again. This is about information-sharing, trust, joining forces, working beyond our borders, giving our experts to Europol’s European Counter Terrorism Centre. That is the only way to respond to the threat: together. We all need to live up to our responsibilities – all of us: the Commission, the Member States and this Parliament. There is no time and space for blame games. The priorities and gaps have been identified. Now, more than ever, it is time for joint work to deliver actions. And this can only happen by cooperating to the maximum while respecting the principles of our democratic societies. That is why I welcome the finalisation of the Data Protection Package to be voted by this House this week. This is an important step which will help us to develop our future tools on the exchange of information. You will also vote to adopt the PNR Directive. The PNR framework is one of the tools that can substantially contribute to our security. I will continue pushing Member States to implement this quickly and not wait for two more years. I want to assure you that the Commission stands ready to support Member States, to ensure a uniform understanding and implementation as the Commission also supports interconnected national passenger information units through pilot projects. Therefore your wide support for PNR on Thursday will send a strong signal on the role and contribution of this House to security policies. I count on all of you. We made together some progress in recent months: that has to be acknowledged. More information is being shared between Member States, but still not consistently or comprehensively enough. More alerts are created in the Schengen Information System, which has proven to be one of the most valuable tools to enhance security. The European Counter Terrorism Centre with Europol is operational, and we still expect all Member States to send their experts and use to its full potential this nerve-centre of our operations. Mr Verhofstadt, I share some of your views and took note of your suggestions. We have to reach the point where Member States exchange intelligence information in the future. Europol has a very specific mission by the Treaties, but as Mr Weber reminded us, it is an important one: to support and strengthen action by the Member States’ police authorities and other law-enforcement services and their mutual cooperation. Both Europol and Frontex are already supporting Member States to better protect our external borders. We are working with countries such as Turkey, Tunisia, Lebanon, Jordan and the Western Balkans against terrorism. I was in Turkey last week with Europol’s director in order to accelerate our effective cooperation. We need Turkey just as we need other key countries in the region that can share information with us on radicalised persons or on persons leaving or returning from ISIS-occupied areas. On 20 April, one year after the presentation of the agenda, the Commission will report formally on the progress made so far on what needs to be accelerated and what more is needed on the road towards a genuine security union, as President Juncker said here today. Over the last five months we have put on the table important legislative proposals on terrorism, firearms, criminal records, borders and information-sharing, all of which should still be adopted as a matter of priority. We cannot expect quick results in security if after each attack we proclaim our determination but then water down every good proposal on the table. With regard to information-sharing, here we are finally coming to understand that the less information we share, the less we know and the less we can prevent. Our information landscape for security in the European Union is simply too complex, too fragmented. If our systems do not talk to each other, if they are not connected, we will continue putting data into black boxes. Data must be interconnected to be useful. Many EU tools for information-sharing are still under-used. We do not need to reinvent the wheel: we have to start using it more. Last, but very important, a word also on radicalisation, which is key, as Mr Pittella stressed. Last week I was at the UN Conference in Geneva. We cannot close our eyes to the fact that, again, the terrorists were young persons born and raised in the European Union. These are our youngsters. The roots of radicalisation are complex and multifaceted. There is no button that we can press to solve it. That is why we must rethink our integration and inclusion efforts, our educational structures, our whole approach to promoting tolerance and common values. Let us not repeat ourselves. Let us avoid empty words. Our challenges are considerable and they are shared. Let us prove our unity and resilience with concrete actions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3437, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, like the Members of this House I share the indignation about the attacks that have taken place. I equally share the sense of urgency: we have to act because of Charlie Hebdo, the Bataclan, and Zaventem and Maelbeek. It is our responsibility to act, and I am pleased to note that most of those who have contributed to this debate are genuinely seeking solutions. Most are trying to understand what causes senseless violence and terror and how to fight and prevent it. But let me be clear: giving up on our freedom is not the way forward. Closing our internal borders is not the solution. This is not about political correctness: it is about our way of living, our values. Several concrete questions have been put to me as the representative of the Council Presidency, including, for example, the calls for greater exchanges and sharing of intelligence and information. Mr Verhofstadt asked me specifically about Europol, and to him I would say yes, we certainly do need to make the information in common databases better in terms of quality and quantity, as well as ensuring consistent use and interoperability of databases. We need to join the dots. The Council will specifically address the challenge of improving the interoperability of databases at its meeting on 21 April. I would also like to draw attention to the joint statement issued by the Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs on 24 March in response to the attacks two days earlier. We think that the ten actions set out in that statement are a comprehensive agenda. Our Presidency will pursue it with the utmost vigour. Specifically as regards Europol, we fully agree that effective cross-border investigation capacity is of the utmost importance. Collection of information is, of course, a prerequisite for connecting and exchanging information, and Member States should step up their efforts here, using agreed methods such as joint investigation teams. Europol plays an important role in supporting cross-border investigations and should continuously enhance its capabilities as the central information broker and as an analysis centre. Soon the Siena information architecture, which connects Europol with law enforcement authorities in the Member States, will be upgraded to confidential level. Our Presidency is committed to improving the collection and exchange of information overall, and yes, in reply to Mr Verhofstadt, we would very much welcome further discussions with Parliament on this initiative.

From this point of view, a European Intelligence Agency and a European Police Office would have their relevance. It is also essential to tighten the noose on the illegal use of firearms. The failures of the current legislation have created legal loopholes that benefit terrorists - the recent attacks were carried out with alarm weapons converted into lethal weapons and neutralized firearms that had been reactivated.

On the other hand, the reality is– we know well – that the fanatics who carried out the attacks were all young people born and socialised in Europe, many of whom were radicalised in camps in Syria or Iraq. And some of whom have indeed infiltrated our borders with a wave of refugees, but this does not allow us to brand every man, man and woman fleeing murderers like them as terrorists.

It is too early, unfortunately, to have a full analysis of the Panama Papers, but all of us are – as you are – examining their implications and the responses to be given. National governments have announced investigations. In discussing what the EU can do, I will distinguish between the tax aspects on the one hand and anti-money laundering on the other. On tax, action needs, in particular, to focus on two policy strands – firstly, access to information, and secondly, measures that can be applied to remedy cases of fraud. The Commission’s Anti—Tax Avoidance Package, presented at the end of January, provides an important basis to implement internationally—agreed standards in binding EU law. As regards access to information, internationally—agreed standards on transparency and the exchange of information have been developed by the OECD. Significant progress has been made in recent years. However, not all international players have totally committed yet to playing a fair game, and this is clearly the case for Panama. In order to ensure efficient tax transparency, we need everyone on board, and the EU, as a major international player, must speak with one voice to convince its partners on the international stage to adopt the standards agreed by the majority. The EU itself is committed to the issue of the exchange of information. We have gone even further than the OECD standards and many consider us front runners, which is good news. We have adopted a directive on administrative cooperation that was recently complemented to cover tax rulings exchange and which will soon cover country—by—country reporting between tax administrations, as proposed in the Commission’s Anti—Tax Avoidance Package. The Council has already reached agreement on this country—by—country reporting, and I would very much welcome the Parliament adopting its opinion as soon as possible. Clearly we will not stop here. Today the Commission adopted a proposal on public country—by—country reporting of multinational accounts to increase transparency, and this proposal will, obviously, receive the full attention of the Council. The Presidency will definitely strive to have swift progress on this proposal. To come back to the revelations, I would like to speak of what we can do beyond increasing the exchange of information in order to fight tax fraud and avoidance, as well as money laundering. In January the Commission issued a communication on an external strategy for effective taxation as part of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Package, amongst other things proposing a common EU listing process to respond to third countries that refuse to respect tax good governance standards. The Presidency is striving to react swiftly to these proposals, explicitly taking into account the Panama Papers. Also in January, the Commission Anti—Tax Avoidance Package contained a proposal for a directive laying down rules against tax avoidance practices – the Anti—Tax Avoidance Directive – which is currently being examined. Some of the rules put forward in the draft directive could be of use, considering that we are also talking about abusive forms of legal tax avoidance. So again, the need for a swift agreement on this directive is stressed. The Presidency is striving to reach an agreement on this proposal during this semester, and I hope that we can count on you – Parliament – as well. Finally, I would like to draw attention to the ongoing work of the Code of Conduct Group on Business Taxation in fighting harmful tax regimes. The Group is committed to promoting the adoption of the code-of-conduct principles in third countries. The group has worked successfully in Switzerland and the Commission is continuing its dialogue with Liechtenstein on behalf of the group. Other countries outside the EU should be involved in the near future. Let me turn quickly to money laundering. This issue, which is closely linked to the financing of terrorism, is also very high on our agenda. In February, in reaction to the Commission’s action plan on the fight against terrorist financing, the Council agreed to proceed swiftly with the implementation of a number of measures which will contribute to combating both terrorist financing and money laundering. Let me outline the ones which are particularly relevant in the context of our discussion today. Firstly, ministers emphasised the need for the identification of third countries with strategic deficiencies in the area of money laundering or countering terrorist financing. As you are aware, in accordance with the Fourth Anti—Money Laundering Directive, Member States should apply enhanced due diligence measures on financial flows from and to these listed countries. In February we called for the identification process to be completed by 1 May. Here, however, we are in the hands of the Commission. We know that our sense of urgency is shared by the Commission, which is working hard on this matter, and we hope that it is also shared by Parliament. Secondly, ministers underlined the importance of speeding up the implementation of the Anti-Money Laundering Package which Parliament and the Council adopted last year. Our shared objective is to aim for completion of this process by the end of this year. Thirdly, we have undertaken to further improve the cooperation and exchange of information between Member States’ financial intelligence units. Fourthly, we called on the Commission to propose, by June, certain targeted improvements to the Fourth Anti—Money Laundering Directive. Furthermore, we have asked the Commission to explore the possibility of introducing limits to large cash payments and to consider, together with the European Central Bank, whether appropriate measures might be necessary for high-denomination notes such as the EUR 500 bill. As you know, the Anti-Money Laundering Directive is very recent and is still being transposed by Member States. For certain areas, however, it has already become clear that targeted amendments are needed, for example aimed at strengthening access to information such as access to bank and payments account information by financial intelligence units, operationalising the list of high-risk third countries, and in view of the handling of virtual currencies. The Council is ready to work on a Commission proposal in this respect as a matter of priority, and I am sure that this would also be the case, again, for Parliament. I know that the issue of money laundering and terrorist financing is also very high on our international agenda, particularly in the context of the Financial Action Task Force, but also in the G20. Let me conclude by saying that the Presidency has decided to put the so—called Panama Papers on the agenda of the informal Ecofin meeting in Amsterdam on 22 April, where the Commission will be invited to give a policy reaction, including an overview of the initiatives on the fight against money laundering and tax fraud. Ministers and Central Bank governors will be invited to exchange views on this issue. I look forward to that specific exchange of views.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3449, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Pierre Moscovici", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. Mr President, Madam Representative of the Council, Madam Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen, the Panama Papers scandal is giving new legitimacy, and greater legitimacy, to our programme to combat tax evasion and money laundering. If anyone still needed evidence of the importance of our common work in this area, they are now known to all through the remarkable work, and which I want to salute as such, of the media. If all the transparency and good fiscal governance measures that we have long advocated - Parliament and the Commission - had been put in place within the European Union and internationally, this huge cover-up of funds could not have been so colossal. Therefore, the indignation, which I share, is not only understandable, but also salutary, in the face of revelations of such great magnitude and so harmfulness. Citizens cannot understand or accept these practices, which are, in reality, nothing more or less - let us say the word - stealing them. We must now turn what we feel, that is, this public outrage, into concrete positive actions and also seize the opportunity offered by these revelations, because it is indeed a political opportunity that we now have, and a political duty that belongs to us, that to deal decisively with tax evasion, tax evasion, aggressive tax practices or tax optimization. , corrupt and money-laundering practices.  This is an opportunity to strengthen the dynamics of our already very ambitious programme to combat tax evasion, tax evasion and money laundering, in particular by obtaining, I am confused to say here, Member States turning their political commitment into concrete action and also making new political commitments. It is also an opportunity to reassess our whole system and to identify new measures that can be taken to strengthen the European Union's defences against tax evasion. And it is, finally, an opportunity to intensify cooperation with our international partners to put pressure on problematic jurisdictions - let us call them as everyone calls them, tax havens - so that reforms for fairer, more transparent taxation, decided at the international level, can be implemented, and that they take up our own standards for the prevention of money laundering. A word, though, about what has already been done because I believe that we must not constantly beat his coulpe. A lot has been done in recent years. There is a transparency revolution that has begun, and I often say that it will not stop. I think so more than ever. We're not starting from scratch. The Commission has taken strong initiatives to improve the tax environment for citizens and businesses alike. Indeed, in recent months, we have presented no less than three major tax reform packages.  This includes, first, a proposal that includes legally binding measures against tax avoidance. This proposal provides, on the one hand, a general anti-abuse rule that would prevent artificial offshore structures from being used, as is all too often the case, to avoid tax and, on the other hand, rules on controlled foreign companies known as controlled foreign corporation rules, which would allow Member States to tax profits that have been artificially misappropriated through low-tax jurisdictions. , or even zero. In other words, it would capture a number of situations that have been apprehended by the Panama Papers.  Secondly, we have put forward ambitious proposals to advance tax transparency within the Union through the world's largest automatic exchange of tax information between states, on the one hand, and between companies and tax administrations, on the other. Thirdly, we are also advancing tax transparency outside the European Union, first with European third countries. I am very pleased that we have been able to negotiate and conclude agreements with Switzerland, Liechtenstein, San Marino, Andorra and, as will be the case soon, with Monaco through bilateral agreements. This has a very concrete meaning for our fellow citizens, is that what is called bank secrecy is dying and disappearing in Europe; it's a tremendous success. As far as countries outside Europe are concerned, we have proposed to create a pan-European and common list of paradises as part of the external strategy for effective taxation that I presented last January. All this constitutes an anti-tax evasion package which is, for the most part, now on the Council table. We have presented these new initiatives on the basis of strong transparency requirements from the European Union, which are already in place for individual accounts and for the banking sector in the European Union. For example, I want to quote it here, from 2017, Member States will automatically exchange a large amount of information on bank accounts to prevent fraudsters from hiding their savings and money abroad. Even today, a few minutes ago, the Commission decided to push the boundaries of tax transparency even further by proposing that multinational groups make public a country-by-country reporting of their activities.  I have been involved in enough debates now here to let you know that, on the one hand, I have been in favour of this publicity from the beginning and, on the other hand, I am very pleased that the Commission is proposing today that the European Union be - I say to those who say that it is not enough - the first economic zone in the world to shed light on business activity on the other hand I see you nodding, Mr Lamberts, as I know that the OECD has proposed that this should be limited, which is not insignificant, at the moment to exchanges between tax administrations. In the debate, I imagine, I know, that a number of you will ask us about the threshold - EUR 750 million is the same as the OECD threshold; it allows us to understand 90% of transnational activity - and also on the perimeter, wondering why we are not going outside the European Union. From this point of view, I want to tell you that first we are going through aggregated data for the rest of the world, but also - and you will not have missed this - that we will ask for detailed data for the activities of multinational firms working in tax havens. And that can't escape us. This is a first step of decisive importance, and I would like the European Parliament to be able to welcome it as such, but, of course, we will continue to work together. While significant progress has been made on some of the tax initiatives, including the rapid agreement on two transparency proposals, many important measures are still on the Council's table. The Panama Papers are a signal to the Member States that it is time to show the same level of ambition as the Commission and Parliament in the fight against tax evasion, by quickly agreeing on the new eu-fighting provisions. The same goes for our anti-money laundering measures. Member States must fulfil their political commitment and implement the provisions of the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive by the end of the year. This directive provides, among other things, the identification of the true owners of companies and trusts and the establishment of central national registers. And of course, Parliament knows this — it has been asking for it for a long time — absolutely crucial to prevent the misuse of the financial system to launder criminal money. I want to tell you here that the Commission is ready to give all the necessary support to facilitate this transposition process and to ensure the proper implementation of these provisions, but, let us say it, and you know as well as I do, and I also turn to the Presidency of the Council, the primary responsibility lies with the Member States. I hope that this message from the Panama Papers, the message you are sending as a parliamentary institution, the message of the Commission, will be heard and that the Member States understand that there can be no excessive caution on these matters and that the transparency revolution applies to everyone. What else needs to be done? As I have said, much has already been done in the fight against tax evasion, against money laundering, but the recent revelations show that we still have a long way to go to reduce the distortions between legislation and to be fully cooperative within us.  I just want to mention a number of key areas where we need more work. First, there are still a number of proposals that are on the Council's table and will have a major impact. I am thinking of the anti-tax evasion directive, which I know I want, like the Dutch Presidency, to be adopted before the summer. You have mentioned, Madam, everything now the informal Ecofin Council of 22 April, and I know how much Jeroen Dijsselbloem, like me, cares that it is the whole package that is on the table, and the whole package that is adopted. I would like to take this opportunity to say to the ministers who say that they want half of it, that if they have half the package, they will have half the results, that we have no right to do that, that we have to go through with it. It is also time to make the pan-European blacklist of tax havens a reality. The Commission already has a list, but it is only a best of or a compilation of the lists that exist in the national states, which are far too heterogeneous in this area. For example, Portugal has 85 tax havens on its list. No doubt that's a lot. Germany has zero. There, of course, it's too little. If I take the example of Panama, whose whole world has now discovered how much of a tax haven it is, and I hope it will change on this point too, only eight countries of the European Union, nine since last week with France, have named it as such. That's obviously far too little.  Let us work to establish a true pan-European list of tax havens, and I myself have proposed six months to achieve this, six months for the right criteria, six months for the right methods. At the European Union level, it is extremely fast. I think we can and must do it. Then we also need to further strengthen our regulatory arsenal. For example, we have already announced a revision of the Anti-Money Laundering Directive for June of this year, and we will have to learn from the Panama Papers.  Finally, I would add that there is one dimension that is essential, namely the international dimension. Of course, there is what we need to do ourselves, and I think that the European Union is already ahead of the rest of the world, that it has the opportunity and the chance to be a leader and a leader in this area. But everything that is done in the global context is of course more effective. And that is why we must, in the G20, propose a new stage. As it happens, from Thursday, all of the world's finance ministers will be in Washington for the International Monetary Fund's spring meetings, and in this context a G20 meeting will be held at the level of the ministers of the economy and finance. The Commission will be there to propose to go further. I am very pleased that a number of ministers from G20 countries are ready to join us in this area to speak with one voice. Ladies and gentlemen, I have made this introduction an overview of some of the additional steps we could take to eliminate opaque structures, offshore arrangements, and anonymous financial transactions, such as those that came to light last week.  I know that the Commission can count on the European Parliament to feed the debate, to support our ideas, to maintain the political momentum we are building on the next steps on this agenda, and I want to tell you that you can also count on the Commission.  In this case, let us say, we are natural allies. We may have this or that difference or nuance, but we are defending the same cause, and I believe that we must be able to work hand in hand, each with its own sensitivity, to go as far as citizens expect us to do so that this revolution of transparency can eliminate these practices that have scandalized the planet. I am, of course, looking forward to hearing your views on this issue today, but also, of course, in the weeks and months ahead.  If I had the impression that I would be short of tax work until the end of this mandate, that is an impression that I no longer have.

And one has to ask why the tax authorities have not noticed this, or whether it has not been known to the tax authorities for a long time in all countries that this type of tax avoidance and evasion and money laundering is being carried out, and whether they may not have reported it to the finance ministries and to the ministers for a long time.

Mr President, Commissioner, I am glad to see that the Dutch Presidency is sending us the Minister of Defence. We are going to attack tax evasion with military means, maybe that is a good thing. I salute his presence! Much more seriously, this is an issue on which, for the Liberal group, there is no doubt that there is action to be taken at two levels. First of all, there is an investigative action, and I believe that we, like other groups in this Chamber, are in favour of trying to deepen the work that has been done by journalists and to which Mr Moscovici has paid tribute. So there is the aspect of understanding what happened, checking whether you really have all the information. This is an investigation, and it is also about companies and, for the first time, private individuals. Secondly, I think it is also very important that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs should devote itself to tax matters - I mean 'tax', the equivalent of tax in English; I insist because it is often translated in a bizarre way - the interest they deserve. That has been said, there are texts to be adopted in a number of areas, and we welcome the new proposals, particularly on the issue of information communication, namely the work that has been adopted by the committee today. Then there is another level, which was raised by Mr Pittella, which is the important criminal aspect, with the laundering of dirty money. To do this, we need other commissions, namely LIBE or JURI. So I believe that this Parliament needs to mobilize beyond competence. In any case, we must not just put things on paper. The issues of implementation, control and possible sanctions against those who do not comply with the rules should, in my view, be explored further, particularly at the global level. We voted this morning on my report, a small initiative report on our role in global for a.

Cameron advocated for an exemption from offshore trusts and parked money there. The Netherlands does not tax financial flows in tax havens. And the US has Delaware and is boycotting the exchange of information. Are they all now on the EU's blacklist? The US has demonstrated with Switzerland and Liechtenstein how to do it: we need withholding taxes on financial flows in tax havens. We need a criminal law for companies. Banks that help with tax evasion must be stripped of their licences. We need a public register of the true owners of letterbox companies, an asset register and a levy on assets. And we need corporate reporting for each country instead of the bazaar around blacklists.

You don't want country-by-country reporting for all businesses and for all countries. You don't want it!

Do not tell me that it does not have this data because, if it were, it would be well managed companies.  Therefore, even a small transnational company has this data. And there is no country that we could not impose, that we could not encompass. We have imposed it on the banks, so if you do not, it is because you are playing the watch, but for the benefit of whom? There is only one stakeholder who opposes this measure, and he made his press release today. Businesseurope represents MEDEF, the FEB and all business federations.

Madam President, the recent revelations about offshore companies in Panama have simply confirmed what we already knew or even suspected. Europe's political class is following the example of corrupt businessmen. Many representatives of both classes consider themselves above the law, at the same time as imposing savage austerity measures on citizens and appearing as crusaders against tax evasion. How much of this money has been taxed? How much comes from illegal activities and how much is legal?  There is a very serious moral issue and those involved in this case must be held accountable and take on their grave responsibilities. We should take action to discover all those who hold accounts in offshore companies, as the names that have been leaked are a minimum fraction in front of the total number. The most important thing, however, is to take measures that will prevent a recurrence of the phenomenon. Offshore companies serve no purpose other than to make it easier for them to avoid their own burdens. We need to rethink their status across Europe. Does their existence really serve society? Is there even one plausible excuse for their operation?  Because the answer is that there is in fact none, we must move towards a complete ban on offshore companies. Any company wishing to operate in Europe should acquire a tax registered office within the Union. Of course, ghost companies without any functioning object should not continue to exist. However, I fear that there is no political will for such measures, because probably, as was recently revealed, a large part of these companies belongs to politicians.

It should also be noted that there are some differences between the Panama Papers and LuxLeaks. First of all, with the Panama Papers we are mostly dealing with individuals and not with firms. I believe that with the Panama Papers we are looking more at tax evasion and not so much at tax avoidance, and the sources of the money in the Panama accounts are probably not always that clean. Also it should be noted that many cases in the Panama Papers are a little bit older.

Those who have not yet realised this – at the latest after the Panama Papers, it is obvious: the aim of all these measures must be: profits should be taxed where the economic activity takes place. The UN-OECD BEPS initiative is an important initiative to tackle this global problem of tax evasion globally. The 15-point action plan provides for an international coordination on the taxation of company income, closing financial loopholes and increasing transparency. 96 countries have already committed to carry out the automatic exchange of information on financial accounts.

It is a provocation to ordinary citizens who pay their fair taxes and it destroys jobs when SME tax burdens are 30% higher than those of multinational corporations.

Madam President, thank you Ladies and gentlemen, for this excellent debate which shows on all the benches the shared wish for a strong, active, I would even say virulent, fight against tax evasion and money laundering. The Panama Papers stressed the need for a more comprehensive, more coordinated and stronger approach to combating tax evasion, money laundering in the European Union and beyond the European Union.  We are dealing with a problem of such magnitude that we need a political response that is transnational, and this Commission, I want to say, is built around that and it is united for that. We are here several commissioners and we are really pulling in the same direction with great force. In the immediate future, the Commission has several even more ambitious initiatives in the pipeline, as they say in English.  For example, we will be presenting our amendments to the Anti-Money Laundering Directive by June, and this will further strengthen our preventive approach against this phenomenon, the fight against anonymous transactions and the coherence of our response to deal with this risk in third countries, but my colleague Vera Jourova is here to give you all the necessary details.  We will also return to the old project known as ACCIS (CCCTB), by the end of the year, with a desire to see it also contribute both to economic efficiency and to the fight against tax evasion, at least in the internal market. We will present a table that will trace the different regimes in third countries, and it will also be a first step to build the common blacklist that I mentioned by the summer. Then we will continue to work closely with our international partners — I am thinking of the G20, I am thinking of the OECD, I am thinking of the FATF — to ensure that the commitments that are made are commitments that are gradually becoming standards of good global governance. And I know how much these concerns, I say, are shared by the Dutch Presidency, which is really very invested in this subject. Jeroen Dijsselbloem and his Secretary of State fully share our concern for success, and I believe that by June we must make decisive progress and put Member States in front of their responsibilities. Then we'll go further, too. There are a lot of proposals that have been made here that need to inform our thinking. That is the echo I wanted to give to the reflections of parliamentarians, with three answers that I want to give in a particular way to parliamentarians for whom I have esteem, but with whom I have a slightly different relationship.  First to Mr Lucke, who questioned why the Commission had not acted earlier. He is well aware that the Commission can only propose and, in this respect, I will say, for example, with regard to the proposal for the automatic exchange of information on tax rulings, that we have accelerated the project considerably and that we have taken advantage of the movement to go faster.  I think the Panama Papers are also a point of support. Rather than criticising the Commission, I think that the European Parliament and we really need to work hand in hand because, I repeat, we are allies. We have the same convictions. Mr Woolfe, with his usual elegance, wanted to present the European Commission as I do not know what a tax haven, to accuse the 47,000 civil servants of this system of being so many fraudsters and the Commissioners, basically, to be their leaders. I hardly caricature, and all this is really outrageous because, contrary to popular belief - and I take this opportunity to say it here - we pay taxes! Of course, the Commissioner's idea, which I do not know which international official is tax-free, is totally false, and this applies, of course, to all Commission officials. On the contrary, we have an approach that saves money over the 2014-2020 period. I would remind you that we will make savings for our entire administration in the order of EUR 4.3 billion, and EUR 1.5 billion per year over the long term, with a policy of wage moderation. European Union officials pay progressive taxes of between 8% and 45%, which are in fact far greater than what is done in the Member States. I'm not talking about tax havens. They also, of course, pay social contributions. Therefore, let us stop this kind of demagoguery or I will also go and ask for other income in Britain. And then, still a little decency! I would like to point out here that there are two MEPs, members of Ukip, who have been sentenced to Prison. I say prison, for fraud committed with public money. So, frankly, first of all this is totally wrong, and then it's more than bad taste. You have to start by sweeping in front of your door. Finally, my last answer is for Mr Lamberts, for whom I have the highest esteem, and who is a very good connoisseur of these subjects. Besides, we end up having exchanges that all look the same because he apostrophes me, and then he goes away, and he is not there when I answer him. So this is probably very interesting videos, but it is better from time to time to confront each other and wait for the Commission to respond. I was really hurt by what he said. He said that our last exchange was pleasant and that he had made him laugh, and so did I. This one is not pleasant and it does not make me laugh because basically it has accused the Commission of waiting and of being in the hand of I do not know what lobby. There is nothing that is more false, nothing that is more false! Earlier, Jonathan Hill presented a proposal for a directive on the CbCR that goes beyond what all international bodies are proposing. The OECD threshold of EUR 750 million is the OECD threshold. When you look at the OECD, what does it say about the scope? It says exchange between tax administrations; we say advertising. And then I think, for once, he was wrong. We will know, of course, what any multinational in Belgium, Ireland, elsewhere in Europe and outside Europe does. We will ask for aggregated data and even, for some countries that are tax havens, we will ask for detailed data. We are the first in the world, the first in the world! The most ambitious in the world. So I understand that a parliamentarian is in politics. I understand that it is more demanding, and I can understand that he wants us to go further, and the Member States will have that responsibility, if any. But, finally, when we make collective progress, when we do it together, when it goes in the right direction, we must be able to say: 'Yes, that is good!' instead of stigmatising or accusing the Commission. I repeat: we are allies. We are allies, and this Commission, all the Commissioners who are there, under the authority of the President, who is in constant support on these subjects, we want to be the engines, the leaders in the world of the fight against tax evasion. What is being proposed by this Commission is of unprecedented ambition in the history of the European institutions. That is, because I know that Mr. Lamberts is very intelligent and knows these subjects very well, I am obliged to infer that there is a part of bad faith on this point. This is not the right way to do politics, because we have to respect each other and pull in the same direction. That is what I want to do with him, with the Green Group, as with all the groups in this House, for whom I have the greatest consideration.  Yes, the European Parliament and the Commission have the same purpose. This purpose, we know it, is transparency and it is the fight against tax evasion. So let's move forward together rather than engaging in bad polemics that are, I think, counterproductive in truth. This Commission is an institution like all the others, which is not perfect. No institution is, but I assure you that, frankly, on these subjects, it does not have to be ashamed of what it does, and today, in particular, I am very proud of what we have decided and what Jonathan Hill has presented, because it is a step forward that no country in the world, no region in the world can claim.

It now awaits speedy transposition and implementation by the Member States, which is crucial because it has to be brought to life. The registers should be set up by the end of 2016. The Commission is prepared to provide all necessary support for this transposition, and I am keeping actively in touch with my counterparts in the Member States on this issue. You are also right that the Commission is now working on the revision of this directive. As announced in the action plan on terrorist financing, the revising proposal should be submitted on 1 June; it is focused primarily on addressing risks posed by terrorist financing, and especially on anonymous payments and the like, given that, according to security experts, financial transactions are very often the first indications that terrorist attacks are being prepared.

The Panama Papers have revealed one of the tools used by the global elite to conceal their incomes, avoiding the burden of sharing in their home countries. Which also creates the possibility of carrying out all kinds of illegal economic activities. Meanwhile, poverty is increasing throughout Europe, with less and less money coming from public budgets for public services, education, health, the unemployed, the homeless and refugees. This injustice must end. It is the common responsibility of European legislators to prevent 'tax optimisation' without limits. As a first step, transparency of the finances of the political elite must be ensured at European and Member State level. Rules on conflicts of interest and declarations of assets of those in different political functions and their families should be regulated in a strict, transparent and verifiable manner.

It only takes a few hundred euros to set up offshore companies and thus take huge resources away from the community, and the banks make money in these transactions: those who cooperate with tax havens should first be properly penalised in economic terms, and then we should arrive at the withdrawal of the banking licence for those who are complicit in these scams.

It is appalling that only this one scandal reveals information about more than 200,000 companies and their owners who, wanting to avoid paying taxes, register their businesses in tax havens.

I think we heard from Commissioner Moscovici on both the range of the measures that have been taken and the passion with which he is pursuing this. Clearly, as we discussed in the last debate, the Panama Papers have sharpened the focus, but the proposal that the Commission has brought forward today, to require all large multinationals operating in Europe to publish information on the tax that they pay country-by-country, pre-dates the Panama Papers. Our proposal builds on the work that has been taken forward by the OECD to require the sharing of information related to corporate income tax between tax authorities. But it goes a step further, and we are the first in the world to require the biggest multinationals to make key information public. Why? Because this greater transparency will shine a light and help us ask whether we indeed have the right laws in place. It can help the public see whether companies are acting in the best long-term interests of their shareholders from a reputational point of view. In working on this proposal in recent months we have been guided by a number of clear principles. First, that we should aim to be consistent, with international work being taken forward by the OECD and endorsed by the G20. Then, that we should build on the major reforms already taken forward by my colleague Commissioner Moscovici and others to increase transparency and to fight tax avoidance. We should bring forward measures that will affect all the biggest multinationals operating in Europe, not just the European ones. We should be proportionate in what we do in two main respects: first, we should not undermine the position of European businesses vis-à-vis their global competitors; and second, we should not burden small and medium-sized European businesses – the lifeblood of our economy – which typically operate in one country. Indeed, for me it is this wish to protect the competitive position of our SMEs which lies at the heart of, and is an important part of, this proposal. It should not be the case that smaller companies, which do not know how to shift their profits – they cannot afford the clever tax advice to minimise their bills – should be at a competitive disadvantage compared with the big multinational companies. In some higher-tax countries it is the case that some of the big multinationals can pay up to 30% less tax than would be paid by the smaller companies. I say this as someone who is pro-business, but I would prefer businesses to be concentrating on their customers – on the services they offer, on product innovation, on true competition – rather than the competition of the creativity of their tax advisers. So this legislation that we are proposing would require the biggest multinationals – those with a global turnover above EUR 750 million – to publish information in a number of key areas. On a country-by-country basis, they would in future need to publish the nature of their business activities; how many staff they have; their net turnover; their profit before tax; the amount of tax due based on yearly profits; the amount of tax they actually paid in that same year, and their accumulated earnings. They would also be required to report on the total tax they pay outside the EU. In addition – and this links to our last debate on the Panama papers – if they pay taxes outside the EU, in countries that do not abide by international governance standards on tax matters – so-called tax havens – multinationals would have to publish the same detailed information as for a European country. We think that, taken together, this information will give a clear idea of whether a large multinational is paying its tax where it makes its profits. The information would have to be made available for five years on the company’s website so that anyone who is interested could see where multinationals are paying their tax and whether there is a level playing field for all businesses. To make sure European companies are not disadvantaged, these rules would apply also to the subsidiaries of non-European multinationals doing business in Europe, as well as to large European multinationals. European banks already have to comply with a specific transparency regime in the Capital Requirements Directive that includes country-by-country reporting, so they will not be affected by today’s proposal. The only change would be that large banks established outside the EU but doing business inside it would in future be required to publish a country-by-country report. In preparing this proposal we have looked at the rules already in place for the banks in extractive industries. We have given careful consideration to the ideas that were discussed in this House for the Shareholders’ Rights Directive, and we sought to strike a balanced approach – one that does not harm the competitiveness of European businesses but that is nevertheless ambitious on greater tax transparency. It is now, of course, for the Council and Parliament to consider our proposal. The Commission consulted widely before bringing it forward. We have listened to the views of all interested parties and fed them into our analysis. I think that, as a result of that, the College believes we have a simple, proportionate way to increase accountability. Now our ambition is to get this agreed as quickly as possible. With your help and the help of Member States we need to seize this opportunity to promote fairer competition and to build trust not just in our tax system but also to build trust again in Europe’s businesses.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3509, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Pablo Zalba Bidegain", "mepid": "96763", "text": "  PPE Group. – Madam President, Commissioner Hill, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, thank the Commissioner here today and for his explanations regarding his proposal.

The circumvention of corporation tax and pernicious tax competition are two of the great challenges we face in the European Union. Large companies and large multinationals are without the complexity of tax rules and the lack of cooperation of Member States in shifting their profits and minimizing their tax burden and, dear colleagues, we cannot afford it. Fiscal transparency must be one of our objectives to ensure that past mistakes are not repeated.  The European Commission has presented its proposal to us in defence of the interests of European citizens, SMEs and transparency; welcome these proposals.

My words are sincere, they're compliment, they're encouraging. That said, there are, in fact, two elements where progress was still possible and would be welcome. It makes no sense, despite the explanations you were kind enough to give us, that all multinationals with a turnover of less than 750 million are excluded from this report. We end up covering only 10 to 15% of multinationals and the information that is requested is absolutely banal to any company operating in more than one country. As you mentioned, the banking sector also follows this practice and gets along well with it.  The second question concerns the exclusion of this report from operations carried out outside the Union, which may be presented in aggregate form, that is to say, without the identification of the country where the transaction takes place. The inthe meantime obligation to report transactions made in tax havens, once they are defined, goes in the right direction. However, this possibility of reporting, in aggregate, transactions in jurisdictions that are not from the European Union and are also not tax havens, can lead to an unintended effect, which is to relocate the concentration of profit to jurisdictions that have an option, a tax offer, particularly advantageous and that is not what we wanted for Europe.

The proposal we are discussing today, this country by country reporting, is a good idea. International companies will have to show where they operate, where they make profits, where they employ people, what occupation they have. But also where they pay taxes and how much taxes.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his excellent work and for the work she has done. The Commission's proposal on country-specific reporting requirements is a significant step forward in the fight against aggressive tax planning models. In the report of the TAXE-1 Special Committee, which this Parliament has adopted, we asked the Commission to present a country-by-country reporting proposal. It is important to establish transparency with regard to the tax authorities at long last. That is also the OECD template that is being implemented here. It is gratifying that the Commission's proposal goes beyond the OECD proposal. This is a real, visible signal that the European Union is committed to tax transparency.  It is precisely in the light of the Panama revelations that we are called upon to act here. At the same time, public reporting obligations, which are also being proposed, must now be carefully examined as to what these proposals mean, whether the threshold is correctly chosen, for example, whether this does not cause some companies to fall through the rust and whether the balance between, on the one hand, tax transparency and, at the same time, the legitimate desire to protect trade secrets, which is also called for in the REPORT of the TAXE Special Committee, is sufficiently taken into account.  There are fears from companies that the reports could then benefit competitors and also states that are not to be regarded as constitutional states. It is also right – and this too is a demand from TAXE 1 – to present a blacklist of tax havens.  Finally, I believe that it can be said on this point that public pressure and also the work of this Parliament – in the TAXE Special Committee, above all, and also in the ECON Committee – help to make important progress.

It would be transparent, but it would provide no privacy. After all, you could allow phone tapping, you could allow looking into anyone’s internet history or you could even ban  curtains, if you followed that logic. On the other hand, we could do the complete opposite. We could respect everybody’s privacy, publish absolutely nothing and allow things not to be exposed when they should be. That would make it difficult to deal with tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. It would make it harder to ensure that multinationals do not have a competitive advantage over SMEs. But here is the point. If on 23 June the United Kingdom votes to leave the European Union, we will have the sovereign right to take those decisions for ourselves and be able to get the balance right between justice and privacy.

It is important that the leaked reports also cover subsidiaries registered in countries defined by the EU as 'tax havens'.

I believe we are all keen to ensure as conducive a business environment as possible for European companies, but at the same time we expect these companies to pay their fair share of taxes in our countries. The draft directive requires multinational companies to make public information on a well-defined and limited set of tax information. It does not impose on them an additional administrative burden, as all the required information is already reported by companies to their shareholders and respective national tax authorities. It helps to re-establish a level playing field between EU and non-EU companies and it reduces the scope for aggressive tax planning by large multinationals. It also raises public awareness of tax issues and strengthens the sense of corporate social responsibility among European businesses.

But taxation is also a justice issue, and when we see, conversely, that almost 90% of all companies operating in different countries do not fall within the scope of this high threshold at all, I have a problem of justice. Large companies as such should explain in which country they pay for what income and how much tax. We have defined the question of what a large company is at various points in EU legislation. 40 million is the threshold, and I believe that this is precisely what we should be building on.

Of course, the protagonists in these tax-exempt and tax avoidance practices are multinational companies which pay crumbs as resources, thus eroding the national tax base and hurting the economy. Moreover, these companies through intra-group transactions avoid paying taxes on their profits, thus saving billions of euros.  In order to deal with these tax ruling practices, the profits of each company must be taxed where they take place, in order to stop companies turning to tax havens, such as in the Netherlands or Luxembourg.

I take the general thrust of the comments very much as support for this measure. Clearly I hear that there are some parts of the House which understandably want people to go further and to go faster, but I think overall the support for the proposal from the Commission is clear. I also think that there was an important set of remarks about balance, and balance is what we have tried to strike with this proposal: the balance between more transparency and wanting to defend and protect and promote the competitiveness of European businesses. I think that links to the questions I have been asked about the threshold in particular, because one of the principles that we have pursued, not just on this proposal but more generally, is to want to take our ideas forward in concert with international work, with the work being done by the OECD and the G20. The reason for that is that this work in international fora has been taken forward over many years, and I think the more we can do it in step, the more we can ensure we can make progress, and the more we can make sure that we can make progress that will be of benefit for Europe, European taxpayers and European businesses. This point about competition and the need to make sure that this proposal applies equally to non-European multinationals and to European multinationals lies at the heart of the proposal. So, OECD: why 750 million? Yes, because it is consistent with the OECD approach, and I think it is important to preserve an international approach on it. But to be clear: this would capture 90% of the revenues of all multinationals, so that is not an inconsiderable slice of the revenues from the multinationals. I was also asked a question about the aggregated figure. Why do we not have a disaggregated figure for outside the EU as well as within the EU? Again, this comes back to the point of competition. We do not have the wherewithal to insist that companies outside the EU share, for instance, information between the United States and Singapore and publish the same information that we could require companies within the EU to provide. Why is it important to try and pursue an approach in parallel? Because if our companies were having to provide more information than was the case with companies outside the EU, that could not only be of commercial advantage to their competitors, who would have more information on European businesses to be able to find out, for example, what their strategies might be on R&amp;D to help them with their commercial strategies , but also to third-country tax jurisdictions, so that European businesses might end up being taxed twice. So that was why we have gone for an aggregated figure outside the EU, and I think it was sensible to take that balanced approach. In terms of the questions I was asked about the blacklist and how that process is being taken forward, Commissioner Moscovici will be responsible for most of that work. He was saying earlier today that he would hope to be able to get that list together in six months. In terms of that process, his intention here is to come up with one which is a fair but careful assessment using all those four criteria on which the list is based. The process, to be clear, is that all third-country jurisdictions would be screened – not automatically just homing in on any particular country or jurisdiction – and then on the basis of that screening we would talk to the jurisdictions in question and ultimately, depending on the severity of the problem in relation to one or more of those criteria, we would put together a list based on that assessment. So it is more of a dynamic process, where we hope to be able to make progress together. I was also asked about what would happen with a non-EU company that might have a smaller subsidiary or branch in the EU. That is subject to our proposal even if the subsidiary is only medium-sized, so we would be able to get those non-EU multinationals through those subsidiaries or branches. Finally, a couple of comments on timing. I do not accept that this work has been taken forward by the Commission simply because of the Panama Papers and that that is what has belatedly prompted the Commission to ask. As colleagues here will know, we have been working on this proposal for a long time. We have carried out a full impact assessment. We have discussed it over many months. The difference, I think, with the Panama Papers disclosures is that it has sharpened the focus of the proposal and has made us reconsider how we go about tackling the question of jurisdictions that do not have high standards of governance in terms of their corporate governance over the so-called tax havens, and that element of the proposal has been refined in light of the Panama Papers. But we had been working on it, and I think we share the sense of urgency that has been expressed by a number in this debate. And so, finally, on timing: how quickly can we take it forward?

I know that Parliament will want to make progress as rapidly as possible, and we will be seeking to make progress as rapidly as we possibly can with the Member States, so that we can get a measure implemented as soon as possible, because I think that is part of how we can have a system of taxation in which our citizens have confidence , but also so that our businesses can go about the task of rebuilding trust with our citizens.

It goes on to say ‘he’ – so probably not me – ‘shall ensure that the views of the European Parliament are duly taken into consideration’. Let me start by saying that I believe that in the last year we have managed to successfully do this, by having regular consultations and listening to updates, developments and the implications for our policies, in constant dialogue. But for the sake of clarity and frankness, let me also say that I find it hardly acceptable that we are having five debates this evening in this Hemicycle. We have 2.5 hours. I think this is not respectful to your work and to my work. Having said that, let me say that this year has been a very demanding one for our foreign policy. The deal with Iran has opened an intense phase for our  European diplomacy, especially on Syria. After the attacks in Paris, a Member State invoked Article 42.7 for the first time in our history, an issue that we debated the last time we met in this Hemicycle. Our response to the refugee crisis has put together an unprecedented number of foreign policy tools, from operation Sophia in the Mediterranean to the new trust fund for Africa, from financing schools or health care inside the refugee camps to the economic compact for Jordan and Lebanon, which we remarkably put together for the London conference. The months ahead will be just as challenging. The foreign policy community is sometimes tempted to look at the electoral years in the United States as years of transition, but this is not a sabbatical year, especially not for the European Union. On the contrary, in some cases we face a window of opportunity that could soon close, and in others inaction can make things terribly worse. In this debate I will focus on the immediate priorities of our foreign policy, as we will have time for a broader conversation on the medium and long-term in our debate on the EU global strategy later in the night. By the way, let me repeat once again that I see no particular reason for holding two debates in a row on topics that are completely similar. So I would ask you once again to avoid this kind of repetition, and spend our time more logically and efficiently. Back to our priorities: ending the great civil war in the Middle East and North Africa remains our most urgent commitment. It is a war that is being fought on different fronts, from the border between Syria, Iraq and Turkey to Yemen and Libya. Each of these fronts has its own history and its own actors, and probably also its own development. But in each one, the solution to the conflict has to come through national reconciliation. The defeat of Daesh, Al Qaeda and all terrorist groups can only go hand in hand with these political processes. We are working hard for this to happen, and we are beginning to see some fragile first results. For them to consolidate, regional powers will need to stop feeding the war, support and encourage reconciliation and head towards some kind of cold peace. What is happening in Syria seemed impossible just a few months ago; the ceasefire is fragile but it is largely holding. Humanitarian aid has reached a number of besieged areas, even if it is far from perfect. Staffan de Mistura is touring in the region to build support for the talks. We are in constant contact, and I was in Geneva with him last month as I was also meeting the parties in the talks. We coordinated our position on Syria with the G7 Foreign Ministers just yesterday in Japan. We need progress and we need it quickly. Peace has a huge number of enemies. That is why a strong sense of urgency has to drive our engagement, and at the same time we will need the same patience that has led us here. The negotiations will not be easy, but perseverance has always paid off. The same will go for Libya. Most of the Presidency Council is finally in Tripoli after months of hard work to build a fragile consensus around it. But this is only a starting point; all actors have to facilitate a peaceful transfer of powers to the new government. On our side we are ready to help, and we are working with the Presidency Council and Fayez Sarraj on this because – let me be very clear on this, as I always have been – whatever we do, we will do it with the Libyans. If they ask for support, we will give them the support they need and want, be it on humanitarian aid, training, security forces, the judiciary or border management. But the future of the country is in their hands. The stability and prosperity of Libya and defeating Daesh depends first and foremost on national unity. The solution to the conflict in Libya can only be political and can only be Libyan. Our responsibility is to consistently support it. The third point on the region concerns Yemen. Our focus in the coming months will obviously have to be on Syria and Libya, but we cannot afford to close our eyes to other crises, even if they do not make the headlines. The conflict in Yemen has caused a humanitarian tragedy at a massive scale, with 80% of the population that is now in need of humanitarian assistance. Instability is a breeding ground for terrorist groups at the very crossroad, among the Middle East and the Horn of Africa, the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean. I met the UN special envoy last week, and we are working together on the ceasefire that began last Sunday, accompanying this process with our concrete support for the preparation of negotiations and with a massive regional outreach. Let me finish on this first priority on the Middle East peace process because – despite the lack of media attention – we cannot forget the conflict in Israel and Palestine. With no progress towards peace, it is only a matter of time before the next escalation comes. Together with the rest of the Quartet and with our Arab partners’ involvement we are working on a report with substantive recommendations on how to move beyond the deadlock towards a two-state solution. To sit and wait is simply not an option, and our work has never stopped; it is sometimes quiet but always ongoing. Public opinion is not currently focusing on it, but this does not mean we are stopping our work. Putting an end to this conflict in Libya and Syria and Yemen – as well as in the Middle East as a whole – building strong partnerships with our neighbours, but also with key actors in Africa and in Asia, will be the best way to respond to the threat of terrorism in the region, the world and the European Union. We can close the vacuum that Daesh uses in territories with no government, and we can prevent radicalisation in partnership with Muslim-majority countries that are promoting coexistence and respect for diversity. We can increase the security of Europe by increasing and improving the security of our partners: in the Middle East, in North Africa, in the Sahel, in South-East Asia, in the Western Balkans. The second broad issue we need to deal with has much to do with conflicts in the Middle East, and yet the issue of refugees and migrations will not stop even with peace in Syria and Libya. Let us face it: big movements of people are the new normal, and again this is something we discussed recently in this room. Walls will not stop the flows; they can only make the situation worse: opening new routes, destabilising more countries and creating an incentive for human smugglers. We can only manage this together with our neighbours, not against them. For this reason, I was in Lebanon and Jordan last month and in Africa last week. At the end of this week I will board one of our Operation Sophia vessels that just yesterday rescued hundreds more lives. The third field where we need to urgently engage is self-evident if we want to manage the two priorities I have just mentioned. This is launching multilateralism as the privileged format for dealing with all international issues. This might sound less urgent if you do not think about the concrete meaning of multilateral diplomacy. Multilateral diplomacy led to COP21 and to the Sustainable Development Goals. Multilateral diplomacy made our deal with Iran possible. It is the comprehensive approach: win-win solutions and the rules-based scenario. It is the European way for foreign policy. We will need more of this in the coming months, including in the field of non-proliferation. The international community has shown unity in responding to North Korea’s new tests. I have just attended two important events on disarmament and nuclear security: in Washington with President Obama and in Hiroshima at the G7 just yesterday. For the first time ever, we and the rest of the G7 honoured the memory of the victims of the atomic bomb. The discussion was positive, and it is in our common European interest to work for closer and deeper cooperation at international level on the issue of nuclear security, non-proliferation and disarmament. Let me include, under the same headline – multilateralism and international cooperation – the issue of our relationship with Russia. On most of the files I have mentioned so far – on Iran, on Israel and Palestine, on Libya and partially on Syria – the Russian leadership has shown some interest in cooperating with Europe and with the rest of the world. We decided, together with the European Union foreign ministers, a few weeks ago that we will engage with Russia in the fields where we have an interest to do so. A few days ago a new meeting of the NATO-Russia Council was announced – and today the date was confirmed, I believe – after having been suspended for some years. Does this mean that our relations with Russia can go back to normal? My friend Jan Stoltenberg explained the NATO position with these words that, I believe, reflect very well where we are: ‘there will be no return to business as usual until Russia again respects international law’. Our European position was agreed unanimously in the Foreign Affairs Council just one month ago. We have all signed off on five principles of our policy towards Russia. Selective engagement goes together with the implementation of Minsk, our relationship with our eastern partners, the strengthening of our own resilience and support for Russian civil society. I chaired the Foreign Affairs Council one month ago, and let me tell you that all Member States are now on the same page. On Russia, as on most other topics, we will need more of the same unity to make our way through these difficult times. I believe that we as Europeans all share the exact same interests on all the issues I mentioned tonight. Our governments are starting to understand that, but our citizens already do. They know that we will either have a common European foreign policy or no real foreign policy at all, because it is only together that we have the tools and the weight that are needed in today’s world, and this is the best answer to our people’s need. I count on the continued support of this Parliament to manage to shape that effective common foreign security policy now and in the years ahead.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3545, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Elmar Brok", "mepid": "1263", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Madam Vice-President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioners for their excellent work and for the work she has Thank you very much for your statements, with which I agree on many points. However, following the terrorist acts in Brussels, I would also like to say that we need to think more about a new definition of security policy. This is no longer the classic. The Islamic State is waging a land war in Syria and Iraq, it is waging an economic and terrorist war in North Africa, in tourist districts, in order to cripple the economy, to be able to have unemployed young people, and it is waging a terrorist war in Europe. This is a uniform approach. And I believe that this uniformity of the response to this – cooperation between domestic and foreign policy, but also when we are talking about Africa policy, foreign and development policy – I believe that we must look at this in a larger dimension, because it is also to be viewed differently today because of the challenges that have been the case in the past. This includes, of course, in particular strengthening our neighbourhood and cooperation for peace – peace, which you rightly mentioned, in Syria and Iraq, but also of peace in Ukraine. In other words, in all these cases, we must make it clear that we are on the side of those who want to create peace and that we should make our influence possible to do so. Since this also has to do with migration in certain cases, this is also part of an entire larger concept of security that we should take. Colleagues! I must also see that, on the crucial issue of the ceasefire in Syria, we have seen that the Russians and the Americans have done this on their own. This leads me to wonder whether the soft power, in which we are better than many others – 60% of the world's development aid is provided by the European Union and its Member States – is often only successful if we also know that the one who has soft power also has hard power, and whether we therefore need not be more ambitious with the possibilities of the Treaty of Lisbon. how we can build a strengthened security and defence policy at European level, creating the necessary synergy effects in order to be able to demonstrate something stronger here too. We are wasting money. One final comment, because my time is running out: Mrs Mogherini, you raised the issue of multilateral diplomacy earlier. I agree with that.

Anyone who has listened well has also seen how our security environment is changing. In addition to the regional conflicts in the neighbourhood, we are now faced with threats that are not limited to individual geographical regions. Threats such as terrorism and cybercrime also blur the boundaries between internal and external security. If the Member States cooperated in the areas of arms planning and procurement, we could avoid costly overlaps. Coordination and governance at EU level are needed, and hence the strengthening of the European Defence Agency. The common defence policy does not automatically mean more armaments, but rather that our armies will be equipped more intelligently. If the EU wants to be a serious global and autonomous partner and actor in the areas of peace-building, conflict prevention and crisis management, then there should be a common security and defence policy, because security policy and diplomacy belong together.

In fact, in the military field, the European Union has no special requirements and no capabilities different to NATO. There is no need for the European Union to be militarily involved, and it is a complete distortion to imagine that CSDP might somehow reinforce NATO. It could complement NATO with civil capabilities, but this ignores the very reasons for CSDP: to create autonomous European military structures and decision-making processes in which the United States is not involved, and to make the EU an actor on the world stage. Actually, this obsession with CSDP is a distraction from NATO at the very time when the Alliance needs fresh vitality and commitment in the face of some very real threats.

The first is that she has very little in common. Indeed, of the 190 billion total defence spending in Europe, member states, only around five billion are spent on joint investments and around seven billion on joint missions, which means that only around 6.3% of total defence spending is spent jointly and this is a major weakness of the common security and defence policy.  Another difficulty of this policy is that it does not have legal instruments to act on crises concerning them. No major power, a non-European major power, a member of the Security Council, will decide that the European Union, even if it had the strength, intervenes where it is not their interest, and their interest does not necessarily have to be stability in the Middle East, and often times there can be destabilization of space and difficulties that the European Union can have.

However, I believe that we must be realistic in assessing our role in security policy and define it within the framework of the overall multilateral structure. I am certainly sympathetic – and i am surprised – to some of the critical remarks that Mr Van Orden made earlier to other Members of this House. And I believe that we need not only multilateral diplomacy, but we also need to strengthen multilateral institutions in a targeted manner if we do not want this fundamental idea of international rule of law to be replaced by a new philosophy of polarisation, which is advocated by other powers. In a nutshell, I would like to mention three aspects that are particularly important to me in the context of this multilateral policy. Firstly, I note that the Barcelona Process was still the foundation of a common Mediterranean policy. In the meantime, we see the Mediterranean as something that divides and protects us. I believe that we need to reconsider this. Secondly, we need a strategic partnership, especially with sub-Saharan Africa.

It might actually come as a surprise to many people in the United Kingdom that the European Union has a foreign and defence policy, so I thought, in the interests of transparency, that I would point out some of the things that are being said out here. Last year, for example, Commission President Juncker called for the creation of an EU army, but at least he said: ‘you wouldn’t create a European army to use it immediately’. In September, Angela Merkel told David Cameron that he would not get any meaningful reform to the UK’s relationship with the European Union unless he dropped opposition to an EU army. Well David Cameron has gone awfully quiet about it, hasn’t he? Maybe he caved in. Maybe he sold our birthright for a pot of stew, coming back from Brussels giving us three things we already had and one we did not want, but now perhaps plans to give up the defence of the realm in exchange. I wonder how many people in the UK know that there is a European Defence Action Plan coming in June, very soon after the referendum, for example, or that the ultimate aim is an EU army. But if they knew that we were being threatened with the creation of an EU army, I do not think that they would risk staying in the EU.

The London Donor Conference for Syria was made a success because the EU leveraged the three billion raised.

According to the Director of Europol and the former Chief of British Special Forces, my country would be less secure. And as has been argued today, it would harm the whole international order. In the modern world of partnerships, the US and Chinese Presidents, the Indian Prime Minister and Commonwealth allies including Australia and New Zealand all say that it is better for Britain to remain in the EU. As Chancellor Merkel has said, only Vladimir Putin would be happy if Britain left. Throughout history, from the Congress of Vienna to the end of the Napoleonic Wars, to the Locarno Pact at the end of the First World War to the great Labour Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin, who forged the relationship between America and Europe at the end of the Second World War, Britain has engaged in Europe to secure peace.

Second in this context is the specific relationship with Turkey, where both stability in the region and the enlargement process and controlling migration and controlling our external borders mix.

Then I would like to underline what many Members have mentioned in this first debate tonight concerning the links between the internal and external security aspects. Indeed today this Chamber discussed two aspects on the internal side of our policies on which we also have an external approach: the response to migration and the refugee crisis, and counter-terrorism after the recent attacks in Brussels. These are two aspects of our policies that have both an internal and an external angle, and we have developed an approach over recent months – especially inside the Commission, but also on the Council side – of integrating more and more our internal and external responses. All of this will, I expect, be included in our debate in a couple of hours on the global strategy that we are preparing, because the whole exercise about the global strategy is exactly that of merging different strands of policies that we have inside the European institutions to overcome the gaps that today we know are there in the use of internal and external tools. Let me again underline the fact that the debates in this room show that, at parliamentary level too, we have to develop new ways of thinking and dealing with issues, because we have those that deal with internal aspects of our policies discussing terrorism and migration, and those that deal with external aspects of our policies dealing exactly with the same kind of topics, but in two separate meetings and in two separate debates. So again, maybe we could look at innovative ways – different ways – of tackling the same issue from different angles, because this is the added value of the European Union. We have so many different tools: internal and external, soft and hard – the so-called comprehensive approach – but then sometimes we are the first ones inside the institutions, including this one, not to have that comprehensive approach. Many of the things that have been raised here tonight actually fit in other kinds of debates we will have tonight. That is certainly true for the definition of our role in this world that Elmar Brok defined as multipolar. I have my doubts that this world is multipolar anymore; we probably lack the poles to define the world as multipolar – we are living in a changing world. But again, this is a strategic debate we will have in a while, as well as the issue that Mr Danjean raised, which I believe is key, on how we implement the strategies we put in place. Here again I would like to come back to this point in our debate on the global strategy, because implementation is the key element of our strategies. It is not the end of it; it is not the subsequence only but it is an integral part, I believe, of our strategies. The other issue that was raised is that there are many other policies and many other priorities – key areas – on which I did not focus tonight. This does not mean that they are not priorities for us. I will name three of them: energy security, which was mentioned just now; our relations with ASEAN, which was mentioned in a previous speech and intervention – I am just back, before being in Japan for the G7, from Jakarta, where we had an excellent meeting with the ASEAN Secretariat for the Member States, deciding precisely to proceed on upgrading our relationship to a strategic one; and thirdly, the work we do with the Sahel, which is key to our security; it is key to our management of the refugee and migrant flows, and it is key to economic development and global issues as such. But again, I am trying to focus on the immediate and ongoing priorities, as this is the purpose of this debate as I understand it. Let me say some final words on an issue on which many of you have commented, which is the European Union’s added value or non-added value to foreign security policy. Let me say this very clearly: I see a growing awareness among our people, among our European citizens, and even a growing one in our Member States, that not even the biggest Member States are world powers anymore. I often say that we have two kinds of countries in Europe: the small ones and the ones that have not yet realised they are small. But this is the reality of our history. This is the size of foreign policy and also security policy, and there is nothing that any of our Member States can do better alone than all together. I think that we are going in the right direction now. I have also heard a lot of this thinking about the United Kingdom’s role in the Union on foreign and security policy, and let me mention an example that Richard Howitt mentioned before. We met in London two months ago for the London conference on Syria, where the European Union as such, together with the Member States, provided two thirds of the pledges – two thirds – making the London conference a success. But my example goes beyond that. The UK on that occasion put forward an idea for economic compacts for Lebanon and Jordan, with creative ideas on how to make the fact that Jordan and Lebanon are hosting so many refugees, either in refugee camps or in host communities, sustainable in the mid-term. That idea moved forward, and we are now putting it into practice together because – and simply because – the European Union put at the disposal of that idea the instruments, especially relating to trade, that made it possible to create this compact, which relates to decisions that the European Union, and not one single Member State, has the capacity to take. This means that the brilliant UK idea that helps all of the European Union and its neighbours has been made possible by a common decision of the Union to implement this idea. This is a win-win – more than that, a win-win-win for the UK, for Europe and for the neighbourhood. Win-win-win: three times, rather than a loss all alone. Sure, we still have difficulties and limits, and some things that do not work. But the point is that our role is not to say: it does not work. Our role as decision-makers, as policy-makers, is simply to try and make things work, and that is what I believe we are trying to do.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3577, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "La Présidente. –", "mepid": "96952", "text": "   The debate is closed.

In June, the High Representative will present a new EU Global Foreign and Security Policy Strategy. A NATO summit will be held in Warsaw in July and a new Space Strategy will be presented in the autumn. In this context, I would like to emphasise three points.  A huge challenge and direction for the EU and every European country to follow is to continuously improve defence capabilities through investment in technology. Our European technology base must become even more competitive and should receive constant impetus for development.  The CSDP is visible through its activities in various places, from Bosnia to Ukraine to African countries. Our actions must be subject to strict and methodological scrutiny and be widely consulted with NATO and UN partners if we want them to add value.  Space technologies are one of the most important areas that support European security and defence.

The situation in Nagorno-Karabakh was probably the centre of my talks both in Armenia and Azerbaijan when I was visiting those countries last month. When I was looking at the last time this issue was discussed in plenary, I saw that it was in 2011, so I am really glad that this Parliament is addressing it for the first time in plenary. It is going to be very helpful and useful, because events in Nagorno-Karabakh are another reminder of how dangerous a protracted conflict can be. Just days before the latest and unprecedented escalation, we had cautioned that the status quo was unsustainable. From a tense situation to large-scale hostilities can be a very short step. For this reason, we are increasing our efforts towards a settlement of the conflict. It has already inflicted too much suffering. It continues to pose a threat to regional security in our neighbourhood, and it is an obstacle towards the development of both countries and of the entire region. The South Caucuses is a crucial region for Europe. It lies at the crossroads between Europe, Asia and the Middle East. It holds a huge potential for growth, but such a potential is held back by instability and war, and again this came out very clearly in my recent talks in both capitals. A large-scale conflict is not in the interests of anyone and can lead nowhere. This conflict hinders the development and the stability of the two countries and of their neighbours, as well as the rapprochement with the European Union. As you know, at the beginning of April, the violence surged to a level that was unprecedented since the ceasefire agreement in 1994. We have all seen reports about the use of heavy weapons and the large numbers of casualties, including among the civilian population. Statements from Baku and Yerevan make it clear that there are serious dangers if the situation is not quickly calmed. Immediately, on 2 April, I called on the parties to stop the fighting and observe the ceasefire, to show restraint and avoid any further actions or statements that could result in escalation. I have reiterated my support for the OSCE Minsk Group and the three co-chairs as the internationally-agreed format for the settlement of this conflict. The EU Special Representative for the South Caucasus, Herbert Salber, made immediate contact with the parties and kept these contacts regularly. I myself had separate constructive conversations with the Foreign Ministers of Armenia and of Azerbaijan. I will stay in contact with them in the coming days and in the coming weeks, and our Special Representative is visiting the region this week. Let me add that I hope that you can contribute to our efforts with your own parliamentary contacts. As you know, I believe very much in parliamentary diplomacy, both with your fellow parliamentarians but also with civil society organisations. We all know the way ahead. The escalation makes it even clearer that the conflict does not have a military solution. Developments on the ground demand that we stay vigilant and continue to insist on the strict observance of the ceasefire and on moving forward in the peace process. In particular, the targeting of civilians must stop. But obviously we cannot settle for the status quo. A political solution is what is needed, and our political goal must be that the sides resume negotiations on a comprehensive settlement of the conflict. The Minsk Group and its co-chairs are there to further mediate, and the EU has supported a settlement on the basis of the Madrid Principles proposed by the co-chairs. But ultimately we know well that the solution is in the hands of the parties to this conflict. They need to be ready to make meaningful compromises towards peace. In parallel with observing the ceasefire and engaging in negotiations, it is necessary to create an environment that is conducive to progress. Actions and statements which could further complicate the already complex environment have to stop. The European Union fully supports measures that can help, for instance, with the repatriation of the bodies of dead soldiers to their families. I am encouraged by the mechanism that has been put in place in recent days by the ICRC and the OSCE. We will also need new efforts that can accompany the political process. These include enhanced security measures, such as the OSCE-proposed mechanism for investigation into the ceasefire violations. This is a mechanism the European Union has endorsed. The EU – complementing the efforts of the Minsk Group co-chairs – has for several years now supported activities that facilitate peaceful contacts between people across the conflict divide. Today this work is more important than ever. The conflict settlement will also continue to be part of the EU’s contacts and dialogue with Armenia and Azerbaijan, as partner countries, as well as with key international stakeholders. As I said, this was at the centre of our talks when I visited both countries a month ago. After this tragic outburst of violence, talking about negotiations and trust might sound out of place. It is not. Actually, it is the only rational thing to do. The alternative to negotiations would be more death and more destruction. Everyone now understands that the status quo can only lead to more violence, and this is exactly what happened.

At present, the situation seems to have returned to what normality means, in the case of Nagorno-Karabakh, i.e. a fragile ceasefire agreement first established 22 years ago. Unfortunately, in the former Soviet space, such frozen conflicts are numerous - Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, more recently eastern Ukraine - and all these unresolved conflicts have one thing in common: Russia's interest in maintaining them.

The ceasefire announced on 5 April seems to be holding for the moment, but we have to face the reality that, after more than 20 years, we have no political solution for this frozen conflict but rather a serious aggravation. We call on both sides to show restraint and to stop the confrontation. We also call on the establishment by the OSCE of a real mechanism to monitor the ceasefire in order to avoid another escalation in this large-scale military confrontation, which carries the risk of the involvement of external actors. It is important that the OSCE Minsk Group action is revitalised in order to bring the two sides back to the negotiations. At the same time, it is fundamental that Europe is seen to play a more active role by using more for more, bearing in mind the particular relations we have with Armenia and with Azerbaijan.

I am pleased that the ceasefire is holding and I encourage an immediate return to the negotiating table under the auspices of the Minsk Process. The use of advanced Russian weaponry by Azeri forces, such as Smerch rocket launchers, shows us that the policies of Putin are once again at play in his so-called spheres of influence. We must also bear in mind the prevailing low oil price and the domestic effects that this is having on Aliyev’s strategy to create an external military diversion.

Blood money: billions of dollars is pouring into the Russian budget. The Vice-Prime Minister of Russia has recently said the following about the Russian arms supplies: ‘Everything is according to contracts. Both countries are strategic partners to us.’ For me, the question is what we, as the EU, should do in order to deal with the so-called ‘frozen conflict’ and the destructive dominance of Russia in the region. Have we, as the EU, ever asked for our legitimate place at the negotiating table that is supposed to deal with the conflict? Indeed, the argument from 1994, when the Minsk Group was set up and the EU was not considered a global player and mediator, is no longer valid.

In my opinion, that future goes through an agreement based on the right of self-determination. Respect and recognition will ensure safety and stability.  On this path, it is essential that Armenia and Azerbaijan accept the mechanism for investigating ceasefire violations proposed by the Minsk Group.

The best way to achieve this is to deploy a robust UN peacekeeping mission around the line of contact with demilitarisation of the area and the withdrawal of all heavy armaments to 15 to 30 kilometres away. The parties in the framework of the OSCE Minsk Group should develop and agree to an incident prevention and investigation mechanism to address all violations that may occur. Nagorno-Karabakh differs from the other frozen conflicts in one point: both parties agree that most of the conflict area belonged to Azerbaijan, and I am talking about the seven provinces surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia, therefore, should give back to Azerbaijan most of the occupied provinces within a reasonable fixed time period, and at the same time, the OSCE Minsk Group presidency should relaunch the negotiations on the final status of Nagorno-Karabakh. Instead of exchanging accusations against each other about possible war crimes committed in Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia and Azerbaijan should both sign and ratify the Rome Statute on the International Criminal Court.

And though maybe you and I disagree on the role that these institutions should play – maybe I see the United Nations as more important than the European Union – you are certainly correct in suggesting that it is our responsibility to do whatever we can. All nations, and indeed the United Nations, must make urgent representations to ensure that basic things, such as civilians not being targeted, are respected. It is vital, too, that simple measures such as the repatriation of bodies actually happen, not because those things change anything of themselves but because they perhaps provide a focal point from which peace can build and a form of trust can be created.

In recent days, the conflict in The Karabakh has ignited and is in danger of exacerbated if the international community does not intervene.  It is worrying that what is happening is only a few days after the strategic visits of High Representative Mogherini and Vice-President of the Energy Union Commission Mr Shevčovič to Azerbaijan.  I believe that the EU can no longer be a passive observer, but should play a more active role in the peaceful resolution of conflicts, which currently constitute an insurmountable obstacle to the full development of good inter-neighbourly relations in the Eastern and Southern Partnership countries.

The EU must insist within the OSCE on participating in the Ming group together with the US, Russia and France and be a guarantor of a peace agreement.

The EU supports existing forms of negotiation along the lines of the principles of the Neighbourhood Policy, while at the same time call on both sides to respect the ceasefire and not to jeophold stability in the region.

March was a historic month for Cuba, and we were there. Europe was there. My visit to Havana, the second of my mandate as High Representative, preceded by a week the historic visit President Obama paid to the island and also another historic event, which was the Rolling Stones concert. That cannot be underestimated for an island like Cuba. We have been there as a driving force for change. In March we initiated the first ever agreement between the EU and Cuba. Our relations with Cuba have always continued, in good and in difficult times, although over the last decade we have had difficult moments. Our starting point was – and still is – much more positive than that of our friends in the United States. The political dialogue and cooperation agreement we have initialled is totally unprecedented. It touches on the broadest set of issues, from political dialogue to economic cooperation, from sustainable development to our cooperation in multilateral fora, from the protection of the environment to human rights. This moment marks the beginning of a completely new era in our relations with Cuba. Cuba has been changing, slowly but continuously, for a number of years now. On regional and international affairs, our cooperation has already been constructive for quite some time now. I think, in particular, of Cuba’s role in hosting talks between the Colombian Government and the FARC, which we followed very closely. I remember that we had a debate about that very recently. We can only look forward to expanding our cooperation on these matters. But change is happening inside Cuba as well. Over the past few years, the European Union has started to discuss how to accompany Cuba’s evolution. We have a choice to make: should we wait for more structural changes or should we make our voice heard right now, as a friend and partner of the Cuban people, through active engagement and dialogue? The new agreement answers this question. We can now accompany more decisively the process of reforming the Cuban economy and society, fostering sustainable development, democracy and human rights as a trusted and reliable partner, as the Cubans see the Europeans. Since my political dialogue meeting with Foreign Minister Rodríguez last year, we have jointly agreed to give human rights dialogue a head start. This format has now been formally set up by the political dialogue and cooperation agreement we initialled in Cuba last month. But the process was launched before the agreement was even finalised, and the next human rights dialogue will take place at the end of May in Havana. We were able to announce it while initiating the agreement. In the first meeting of the human rights dialogue, which took place last year in Brussels, we touched upon the respective situation of human rights and recent developments, both in the EU and Cuba. Let me say that it was a very constructive and very frank exchange of views, and a useful one. Let me conclude with a note on the work ahead. We now have to go through our internal process to ensure the swift signing and ratification of the agreement. Parliament will have a part to play in this when the time comes, and I hope it will not be too far away. The signature of the agreement will also mark the end of the EU’s 1996 common position as the Union’s instrument defining its external relations with Cuba. As you are aware, the common position had already envisaged the perspective of a bilateral agreement. This has now been accomplished, setting a new framework for our relationship. So it is time we finally developed a partnership that reflects our shared history, serves our interests in the present day and helps us build a future that is shared. For this reason, in parallel to the process leading to the signature of the agreement, I will propose a Council decision to formally repeal the common position. This agreement benefits Cuba and benefits Europe. Let me be even clearer: it benefits the Cubans and it benefits the Europeans, because this is the nature of all good friendships. I am sure we will be able to count on your support in this new phase of our common history. To sum up, it means enhancing EU relations with Cuba, effectively accompanying the modernisation and reform process on the island, promoting democracy and human rights and finding common solutions to global challenges. The path of more engagement in the framework of the future agreement is the most effective one.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3609, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Francisco José Millán Mon", "mepid": "28400", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, thank you, Mrs Mogherini, for the information you have provided us on the Agreement on Political Dialogue and Cooperation with Cuba. I would like to congratulate you on the conclusion of the Agreement. The European Union and Cuba thus have an instrument, a bilateral framework, as you said, to advance the development of their relations.  Cuba is at a very important time at the international level. The recent shift in relations with the United States has historic scope, but the country is, also domestic, at a crucial stage for well-known reasons. With the Agreement, the European Union will be able to strengthen, consolidate its presence in Cuba and thus be able to influence more of the process of change that the country is experiencing. Through the framework of cooperation and dialogue involved in the Agreement, the European Union will be able, as you yourself have said, to stimulate the process of reforms that the country is undergoing, while defending European interests and values. In this regard, I too would like to stress the inclusion in the Agreement of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, by collecting a specific dialogue on this subject.

Secondly, because of the courage it has shown in overcoming the Common Position which for fifteen years has blocked Europe's relations with Cuba and signing an agreement which I consider very important. Cuba is a small country, we know, but it is a very important country, you have said so. Seeing Obama a few days ago is largely because the United States wants to change its role, its image, in front of the rest of Latin America, but also because peace is being negotiated in Colombia. It is a country that has a great irradiation towards Latin America. And that's why I think Cuba needs to start dealing with it now with the importance it has in our international politics. Some— today we will hear it here too—will continue to think that Cuba is a triumphant revolution; others will say it's a hateful dictatorship where there are no human rights. I believe that the two archetypes are extreme and distort the reality of a country that is changing a lot. Here's what I think is important to highlight. Old archetypes are no longer good for a world instead. Nor for a deep-changing Cuba. And certainly the problem was what Europe was doing in that position. Stay out, stay isolated, stay in the old position or take charge of a new policy of friendship with Cuba? I think there are four very important things we can do. Firstly, to change the stage of what we have called the Common Position to a stage of economic, political and trade collaboration that this agreement allows us to consider. Secondly, help the Cuban people. Help the people, the Cuban people, with investments, with companies, with market economy, with cooperation, with technology. Thirdly, to understand that this will come from freedoms, democracy and human rights, which I too want for Cubans. But they will probably come with openness, with the Internet, with telecommunications, with the citizenship that is coming. And, from there, respect a very important thing and it is that it is the Cuban people who must decide their future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3611, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Bas Belder", "mepid": "4507", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group.

Whoever fits the shoe, Madam High Representative, put it on. As a member of the Protestant community in the Netherlands, which has had close links with the Cuban Church and Christians for many years, I also urge the High Representative to address the Cuban authorities directly and with continued support for the religion and freedom of faith on its own territory. This freedom excludes, first of all, a system of government informants and snitches in church meetings and congregations.

I am not sure that what we have seen in recent weeks – people being imprisoned and acts similar to that – are the change. I wonder: what is for you the objective of changing that agreement? As politicians we should have an objective. I would appreciate it if you could comment on that. The people that I tend to talk to do not feel that the changes are really occurring. It is not even that they are occurring slowly; they are not occurring. Maybe I am ill-informed. I would like to learn more. In fact, the ALDE Presidency delegation, which is to go to Cuba, has been waiting for weeks and weeks to get an answer from the Cuban authorities as to whether it will be welcome or not. I wonder whether this is also a sign of change. I see Cuban diplomats are hopefully taking note of that fact. Am I right in saying that there is a provision in the agreement that we will not intervene in the domestic affairs of Cuba? I am not quoting now, but what is the meaning and your interpretation of that phrasing? So we need a dialogue for sure, a change for sure, but we really need to see change.

The common position of the European Union, although in practice inactive, was a substantial obstacle as it violates the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of states. I'm glad mrs. Mogherini announced its intention to withdraw the common position.  The exclusion of Cuba from the US for sixty years was a criminal behaviour towards its people and its removal must be completed immediately. It is worth noting that excluded Cuba provides universal public free education with impressive scientific results, provides free universal healthcare and has the best indicators at all levels and is a pioneer in the fields of prevention and ongoing research in the pharmaceutical and medical field. I stress this, because I believe that speeding up the completion and signing of the agreement will be undeniably in the interests of both sides.

This fact, however, does not mean that we must ignore the relations that historically bind Cuba to Europe. In this context, the Agreement on Political Dialogue and Cooperation provides a framework for the development of these relations in various dimensions. Europe's role must continue to be to promote human rights and respect them, which, unfortunately, is not yet the case in Cuba. We do not want and must not forget the Sahara Prize winners, political dissidents and political prisoners, and they are still in Cuba.  It is equally important that in gradually opening up the Cuban economy, the benefits of this opening are not only for the ruling \"castrism\" elite, as has often been the case in post-communist societies in Eastern Europe.

As early as April 2014, negotiations had begun within the framework of the political dialogue, with the aim of paving the way for economic relations between the twenty-eight Member States of the Union and Cuba.  In addition to trade and political dialogue, the agreement also mentions human rights in Cuba. The European Union is pressing Cuba to sign international agreements.  At a time, of course, when the European Union was suggesting proposals for the protection of human rights in Cuba, it was itself violating the rights of the countries of the Union set out in memoranda every day, thus imposing policies of violent fiscal adjustment and austerity and increasingly pooring these European peoples.

Both in my introductory words but also hearing the debate tonight, it is quite clear what it is: it is to engage with an interlocutor, coming out from the common position to encourage and accompany a process that is happening in Cuba – inside the country and with the outside world, starting from the United States, but also with others in the region and beyond – to try to accompany this process in the best possible way. Here the European Union has a special role to play. We are not in competition with the Americans. The United States has a different kind of history of relations with Cuba that we do not have. It has a different kind of geography that probably, in perspective, makes relations with the island potentially huge. We are far away, but our history is much more solid. We have a people-to-people exchange with the Cuban people – as Europeans – that is and always has been in place, even during decades of difficult times. So I believe that, whether it is for the work that we can do on trade or the work that we can do on the development of different forms of small and medium enterprises, cooperatives or small economic steps of change, the role of the European Union – because of the structure of our society, our economy and our social system – can be of great help in the transition, the transformation, the changes and the process of reforms that Cuba is potentially entering into. This is an open debate in Cuba. If I am not wrong, the party congress is taking place in a few weeks. We need to have a respectful stand. You mentioned that we make reference to the fact that we have a process of non—interference. This is the basis of our relationship with all countries in the world. We do not interfere in internal processes, but we have our consistent, coherent, strong and principled positions on many different issues. There are issues where we see space for cooperation and mutual benefit. There are issues where we know very well that we are very distant in our positions, but there are fields where we can work together, accompanying a process that Cuba is starting and making sure that there can be a European – whether businesses, churches, NGOs, tourists, entrepreneurs – common framework that can be beneficial for Europeans and for Cubans. I mentioned the work of the small and medium enterprises and cooperatives. The field of telecommunications is huge and potentially very beneficial. Our experts are working in Cuba, advising the different ministries on the different sectors of reform – even very technical kind of work – because there is a certain level of understanding and trust between our people that has never been interrupted throughout history. Again, with student exchanges or people-to-people contact, I can see a lot of benefits. So we do have a fundamental role as the European Union. Regarding something that you mentioned, namely the blockade: our position has always been very clear. I have stated it again, publicly and in our meetings, both in Cuba and with our American friends. We consider this policy as counterproductive, as it is also affecting European economic interests in a serious way. We know very well that the administration in the United States stands exactly where we do, but Congress does not, so we need to see how the Americans will work on that. Human rights will stay crucial and central in our dialogue, and let me stress that the European Union and Cuba have a human rights dialogue. We have already had the first round of it and we are going to have a second round in Cuba in early June or at the end of May in Havana. We are fixing the date. This is something the Americans do not have. This is precisely because we have a certain level of confidence in each other, and respect. We are engaging in this dialogue, as well as in other dialogues, with a constructive approach. It is frank, because we know very well that there are issues where we do not agree, but with the idea that engaging is always better than not talking. Lastly, regarding the role of the Parliament: this process is just a starting point. We have initialled the agreement. This means that we have finalised the negotiations. We have no open points on our table. I would also thank our delegation in Cuba, the negotiating team – which has been working in an excellent way – and also the Cuban negotiating team. Obviously they had their own position to defend, but they engaged very constructively. I can tell you that seeing experienced officials and diplomats, at the moment when we were signalling the agreement, moved after years of negotiations was something quite special, even for someone who has been working on diplomacy for so many years. Your role will be key when we come to the ratification of the agreement. We have signalled it. We have to sign it, which means, as you know, going through translation into all our languages and all the internal processes, and then we will come to ratification for this Parliament.

On 22 March, Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs began with a moment of silence to honour the victims of the terrorist attack at Zaventem Airport. When the Committee on Foreign Affairs was preparing to vote in favour of my report on the European foreign and security policy strategy, we learned that there had just been an explosion at the nearest metro station in parliament. It was an unreal and strange feeling. We voted in favour of the strategic objectives of European foreign policy, but a few hundred metres away, people died , partly because of Europe's failure to achieve the objectives set out in other strategic documents many years ago. Looking at the European Security Strategy adopted in 2003, we can see that one of the three key strategic objectives set is the stabilisation of Europe's neighbourhood, including the Middle East. Today, 13 years later, we must find that this strategic objective has not been met and the situation in neighbouring regions has become one of the main causes of a major security problem in the heart of Europe. I would very much not like our descendants to find out again after five or ten years: good documents, weak works. Poor lying is because our Union suffers from a chronic lack of political will, which affects the implementation of many European policies. Therefore, one of the important recommendations in the resolution on the EU's global strategy is to follow its implementation, regularly evaluate and update, link objectives to resources. With this resolution, the European Parliament wants to contribute to shaping and concentrating the political will of the institutions and the Member States. In the resolution, we call for a substantial strengthening of the Common European Defence Capability, towards the creation of a European Defence Union in the for a transparent future. We call on the European Union's external action to focus its efforts specifically on stabilising europe's wider neighbourhood, rather than trying to be all for everyone. We call on Europe to be a global actor with a regional orientation that is an active global rule-maker, not a designer. We stress that this is only possible in cooperation with the Union's main strategic partner, the US. At the same time, we must be aware that America's interests are increasingly in Asia and that we ourselves will have to be able not only to act in words, but also to ensure the security of Europe and Europeans. We therefore call on the Member States to increase their defence investments to at least 2% of their GDP by 2024 and, at the same time, to spend these funds wisely, matching our military industries and capabilities and achieving greater return on investment. What do I think are the main challenges and risks of implementing the strategy? The first is the political will and the awareness of the common objective of the Member States and their societies. The second is the growing risks of populism. They present unpredictable challenges and consequences for the Union and its foreign policy, such as the Dutch referendum, BREXIT, the presidential elections in the United States. And who knows what we're going to experience. Finally, we are talking about insufficient resources. Citizens often expect simple and quick solutions. Especially in a context of slow economic growth. It is difficult to explain that for every euro that we do not invest effectively in our external action, we may have to pay many times to deal with internal problems caused by external circumstances. I would therefore like to conclude by stressing that one of the important tasks will be support from European citizens. And it is in this interpretative work that the role of the European Parliament and our Members can be important. We therefore call on you, high representative, to provide Parliament with regular reports on the implementation of the strategy and believe that the global strategy should be reviewed every five years. Thanks for the attention!", "language": "en", "original_language": "lv", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3629, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, Madam rapporteur, you know how much I care about this global strategy, and we also discussed that recently. I would like to thank you personally for your work in this Parliament and outside, in this respect. Our world has become so unstable and so dangerous that our foreign policy can simply not afford to guess and check. Our mistakes can be too costly, as impulsive reactions can lead us to very dangerous places, and we see this every single day. The security of our citizens calls for a coherent, rational and united foreign policy. You also know how much I care about the broad discussions we are having about this strategy. It has been a clear political decision for me. This has to be a strategy not for the European institutions but for our Union, and this means it can only be the result of a collective process. All the Commissioners have contributed to it. All the Member States, in different formations of ministerial meetings, have discussed their comments and proposals. We have involved think tanks, foreign policy experts and civil society representatives. We have organised a student essay competition and have met recently with former Erasmus students – and I have to say this was one of the best meetings we have had in the process. Obviously the European Parliament and the national parliaments have a key role to play, also because you represent directly our citizens, and our citizens know today that foreign policy matters to their lives. So let me thank the rapporteur for the excellent work, as our thinking on many different issues also goes exactly in the same direction. This is also very encouraging to see because our strategy, our common work, will not stop in June when the document is ready, as you said. In the report you ask for a review of the strategy every five years. I agree. This should be a regular exercise we will have to do – five years, or even less maybe. But I believe that the first sections of the strategy on our interests and principles could have the potential to drive our actions for many years – probably even more than five – but at the same time, the strategy will have to be a living document. We need constantly to adapt the priorities we have set with the reality that surrounds us around the world, in our region, and also in terms of implementation. I will come to the implementation in a moment. From day one we will have to work on this, especially on the implementation of the strategy, for instance with sectorial papers and action plans. This is not going to be a PhD thesis or an academic dissertation. This has to be a living document on how we achieve our objectives, and I cannot imagine Parliament not being involved in the life of this strategy after June. Looking at your report it is clear, and I do not need to explain why we have opted for a global strategy and not simply a security strategy like the previous one. For sure, traditional security will be crucial, and security includes defence. Still, we all understand that this is not enough. ‘No security without development’ is what we always say, but also ‘no security without democracy, human rights and the rule of law’. I believe the Arab awakening should have told us something about this – that security must be sustainable, and sustainable security cannot be achieved through security and defence instruments alone. It requires development, governance, civil society support, climate action and much more. This is why I put resilience at the core of this strategy: the resilience of institutions, the resilience of societies, the resilience of people and the resilience of countries at the end of today. If you understand this, we should also see that our European Union can truly be a global power and, I would say, a superpower. We hold in our hands a unique mix of hard and soft power that no other power in the world can use. As a Union of 28, we can mobilise public and private investments, soldiers, observers and an unparalleled diplomatic network. This includes your contacts with other parliaments and with civil society organisations worldwide. The real challenge is making the mix of all these assets truly effective with common political guidance, and this is one of the main aims of the strategy. Such a mix already makes us incredibly interesting for our global partners. Just hours ago I got back from Indonesia and Japan, and to them – on the other side of the world – it is absolutely clear that the European Union is a global power and the partner they want to partner with. I fully agree with the report when it says that there is no contradiction between our role in our neighbourhood and our global engagement. Of course we need to prioritise, and of course our neighbours are the top priority, but let us not forget that our neighbourhood is expanding by the day. Think of this simple fact. If we exclude Syria, the highest number of refugees in Europe comes from Afghanistan, but there are also migrants from Pakistan and refugees from Eritrea. These are faraway places and yet so close to us. We need to be a global player because issues are global. We cannot stabilise our immediate neighbourhood if we do not look at the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and Central Asia, and our stabilisation efforts must account both for the roles played by other global players in these regions and for global causes of instability, such as climate change. We cannot build a new global order based on rules and cooperation if we do not fully engage with our partners far away in Latin America or Southeast Asia. So indeed, everything is interconnected, and the global strategy is just that: a global response to global challenges and global opportunities. Let me mention the three principles guiding our external action, in my view. First: engagement, because turning inwards is simply not an option. It would make us more, and not less, vulnerable, as we see when we underline the link between external and internal threats. Second: responsibility – thinking of what happens the day after and what we do the day after an action is taken. Having clear ideas of why we are taking any single step, what happens next, who are our allies and how we engage with them. We have seen too many mistakes in the past, just because we did not consider the consequences of an action. Third: partnership. The days when the weakness of my neighbour was my strength are long gone. You mentioned that. Instability in our neighbourhood can only bring instability here in Europe, so we need strong neighbours and strong cooperation with our partners in their neighbourhoods. No country alone, not even our Union alone, can carry the whole world on its shoulders. Engagement, responsibility and partnership: our engagement needs to be responsible and it needs to be cooperative. The strategy will focus on some broad priorities: the starting points for the work ahead. First, the European Union must strengthen itself. We need a stronger Union. This includes building up our defence and doing so in a cooperative manner; making our intelligence services work together; working against radicalisation in our societies; monitoring hybrid threats; strengthening our energy security, cyber capacities and strategic communications; and preserving the Schengen system with new asylum rules. In a phrase, we need a 21st-century approach to security. Second, we need to invest in the resilience of states and societies in and around Europe, to the east and to the south. We need to support effective and democratic institutions, protect the space of civil society and promote it, address countries of transit and origin of migration, promote socio-economic development, fight climate change and promote energy transitions. This is a complex priority which will need to be fleshed out, country by country, with a targeted approach. We have all the means to make our partners more internally resilient, but we need to focus on every single one to make it happen. Third, we must do all we can to put an end to the current crisis in which the state, far from resilient, is on the verge of collapse – from Syria to Libya, from Somalia to South Sudan – and we must prevent the next crisis from addressing problems before they boil up and get out of control. These may not get us in the headlines, but it is the most effective way to save human lives and increased collective security. Fourth, we must strengthen regional orders, because the causes of conflicts have an increasingly transnational nature. We are seeing this every single day. More often, the key to solving or preventing a crisis lies not only inside the country but in the region. Our cooperation with the US and NATO, with the African Union, CELAC and ASEAN, are all key. In some parts of the world, like Africa, we need to strengthen existing organisations. In other cases, we need new and creative formats. I think of the talks we have on Syria that have somehow established a format that is what I call ‘minilateral’ and that is flexible enough to feed into a process like the complex one in the Security Council of the United Nations, managing to bring results in that multilateral format. We need more of that. A network of bilateral, trilateral, sub-regional and regional organisations can be the best base for a more cooperative and more effective multilateral global order. So the last priority must be better global governance that is truly fit for our age. This was a year of important achievements for the international community, from the Iranian deal to the sustainable development goals, to COP21. We need to stick to this path and preserve a system based on rules, but we need to work on how we can be imaginative. In a world of predictable unpredictability, the international system as it is does not suffice. We do not need conservation but change if we want to preserve the principle of effective multilateralism. There is only one way to succeed in all this and to achieve our objectives, and this is a truly united Europe. I began by saying that our environment has never been so dangerous. I will add that, perhaps for the first time in our history, the European Union faces an existential threat. But these threats do not come from outside our borders. The only existential threat against the European Union comes from our internal divisions, the petty nationalisms, the finger-pointing and the lack of forward-looking leadership. We discussed this early this afternoon when we discussed our response to terrorism inside the European Union.

This report sums up Parliament's vision of the Union's priorities in terms of foreign and security policy. In the debates we have had in our meetings in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I have stressed that the European Union must speak with a strong voice in international politics and, for that, we need the solidarity of the Member States and also, of course, the resources. In the amendments I tabled, I emphasised the Union's priorities. I mentioned three: first, improving our ability to anticipate conflicts and crises, but also to respond quickly to these crises. Secondly, I stressed the need to contribute to the stabilization and pacification of our neighbourhood in the East and south, not to mention any of its parts. And thirdly, I stressed the maintenance of the need to maintain our commitments with regard to enlargement.  I think that in this terrible identity crisis that we are experiencing in Europe, we must be courageous, we must say things that are not sympathetic to Europe's adversaries.

It is not easy to make less of the European Parliament's contribution to the overall strategy that the Union seeks to develop in the face of the humanitarian, economic, political and security challenges it faces, from state and non-state actors, both within and outside common borders. A credible political union requires Europeans to take full responsibility for collective security and defence in the neighbourhood and globally, without ever losing sight of their interests as well as founding values and principles.  The Union must strengthen its strategic autonomy in defence capabilities and not continue to underuse the potential of the CFSP and CSDP to consistently articulate internal and external policies and ensure civil and military resilience in the collective response. This alone will not fail citizens, partners themselves, nato, the United Nations, the EU-Africa Partnership and others, as Mrs Mogherini stressed.  Mutualisation and sharing of military resources, joint research and development projects strengthening the industrial and technological base of European defence, including CBRN security and cyber defence, are crucial to prevent duplication and failures and to ensure economies of scale and interoperability to systems.  Combating terrorism and other forms of organised crime is a priority that no Member State can pursue on its own: it imposes capacity-sharing in the internal and external security sectors, in particular intelligence, police and justice. It imposes coherence and consistency in external policies and actions. From Ukraine to the Mediterranean we see a lack of cohesion and solidarity, with results that shame and discredit the Union. Defending European citizens, principles and interests can only be achieved through a political union that promotes human security, based on rules of global governance – as Mrs Mogherini has also just stressed again – anchored in international law, human rights and the rule of law. We support the effort of the High Representative, who is also Vice-President of the Commission, to ensure leadership and strategic coherence in the pursuit of common interests.

Squeeze more money for weapons, expanding the armaments-industrial complex, and expanding the geostrategic sphere of influence in arms fraternity with NATO and 2% of GDP for defense purposes. As an example, this would mean for Germany: from EUR 30 billion now to EUR 60 billion. Security should be called social security, but there is supposedly no money for it.

We stress the international diplomacy necessary to sustain efforts for global climate action, and we reiterate that there is no solution to the challenge of international migration without the first emphasis being on conflict resolution and international development. Tonight I want to argue that we should not fight shy of Berlin Plus defence cooperation, which cannot, and must not, be deliberately misrepresented as a European army. Those who seek more ambition for EU foreign and security policy must also recognise that this encompasses more ambitious EU security cooperation. Why shouldn’t Europe be ready to undertake peacekeeping if a permanent peace could be established in Syria or even in the Palestinian territories? Surely recent attacks have removed any excuse against greater cooperation in counter-terrorism and intelligence-sharing. Tonight we have heard from some who insist that this can only be achieved through institutional change, and others who resist it altogether. I simply say that this can be done in full complementarity for the EU countries which are also members of NATO. But inside or outside NATO, it does require a commitment to improve capabilities, and that is an issue of political will in Europe’s national capitals to improve our individual – as well as our collective – response, not in EU institutions alone.

We need to work on strengthening defence capabilities and sharing defence budgets smarter at Member State level.  A holistic approach to Union external action must effectively bring together a complete catalogue of available external activity instruments and the overall assessment of the EU's effectiveness will be measured through the performance of our neighbourhood action, with engagements in Ukraine, Syria, Iran, north Africa and the Middle East peace process essential. The priorities are also relations with Russia, the fight against terrorism through a combination of internal and external security measures and the protection of external borders, which must be strengthened by controlling migration and firm agreement with Turkey.  I expect that the global strategy will clearly define ambitious but realistic objectives and, while ensuring adequate budgetary resources, will provide concrete mechanisms for their achievement.

We need to ensure coherence between different institutions, different instruments, different policies and sometimes even different priorities within different policies. We have an enormous amount of tools, but we do not necessarily use them in a coordinated and coherent way. I will also comment on the last comment that was made: the need maybe to have a Mogherini plan or something similar.

I especially appreciate the Vice-President/High Representative being present here. Her stamina and perseverance is actually both admirable and indeed exceptional in these long foreign policy debates. Today we have already discussed a number of pressing problems, deadly crises, complex policy problems and precarious situations around the world. The region that we are going to talk about in the last item on today’s agenda, Central Asia, may not seem to require such urgent attention. It may not produce a pressing demand on our resources, but it is – and this is one of the most important conclusions of the report – a region of increasing strategic importance to the European Union. As rapporteur on the implementation and review of the EU-Central Asia strategy, the first fact that I have learned from my colleagues is that we all agree on the growing relevance of the region to the European Union. So this debate comes last, but not least, on today’s foreign policy agenda. First of all, allow me to express my sincere gratitude to the shadow rapporteurs, whose dedication, flexibility and professionalism resulted in the rich – and indeed not very short – text. I am also grateful to the various representatives of the European External Action Service (EEAS), who proved to be very helpful throughout the entire process. Let me start with the observation that the Central Asia strategy, as formulated nine years ago, had the right level of ambition. The achievements of the implementation were rather less spectacular though. That limited success requires that all parties involved – the EU, the Member States and the five countries of Central Asia – need to make a serious and concerted effort to reach the aims laid down in the various official documents and treaties which we have with the region. We agree on a number of points within Parliament on the strategy review. For instance, we also see a need for a more differentiated, conditional and incentive—based approach, and it should be applied so that regional programmes are more tailored to the needs of the interested parties within the region, not necessarily comprising the entire set of five countries. Central Asia has weak interregional links. Some would even doubt whether it is a region in its own right. It would make sense to develop projects aimed at those countries which are willing to participate and willing to foster these kinds of links. We emphasise that the disbursement of EU funds should be incentive- and performance-based and that benchmarks should be developed for each and every country. These need to be formulated to assess their progress. The key areas include, among others (and I am sure my colleagues would list more than these) democratisation, fighting and preventing corruption, free and fair elections, ending drug trafficking, respecting labour laws and so on. The countries of the region need to develop their human rights records. Some indeed seem to be inhospitable terrain for even the basic political rights. Because of the precariousness of the human rights situation in some countries of the region, we urge the EEAS to base their assessments not on the laws enacted but on the facts established on the ground. For such a strategy to become viable we need a unified approach. This is not the first or the last time that we have said that. We need to speak with one voice, together with the Member States. No bilateral negotiations should undermine our efforts.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3650, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, let me start by saying that this debate is indeed important. Central Asia is a region that is increasingly recognised as strategically important. That is why I believe it is quite a shame that we have to have this late night debate with 11 Members of Parliament in the room while we discuss a highly strategic, important issue. Central Asia needs to feature high on our foreign policy agenda for a number of reasons. In the previous debate we talked about a more connected world. In a more connected world the most ancient global trade route can only become more relevant. Central Asia stands at the crossroads between Europe, Russia and Asia. Europe and Central Asia share many interests, from peace in Afghanistan to the fight against foreign fighters. For this reason we are engaging directly with all countries in the region. As you know, last year I decided to nominate an EU Special Representative to Central Asia – Peter Burian – going back on a previous decision to remove this position. I personally began discussing the strategy review with Central Asian ministers of foreign affairs in Astana last December. Asia’s economic slowdown and the threat against our security are making it very clear, for both us and Central Asia, that we have a strong interest in reinforcing our cooperation. Cooperation with the European Union is not an alternative to cooperation with other global powers, namely Russia and China. This is not about expanding our sphere of influence; we as Europeans do not have that kind of mentality. Your report rightly notes that on a number of issues, such as economic development and connectivity, that are key to the region and to us, some kind of cooperation between our European Union, China and Russia can only benefit both Central Asia and ourselves. There is space and desire inside the region, as you mentioned, for a more active and result-oriented cooperation between Europe and each of the Central Asian states. We cannot consider Central Asia to be a non-differentiated bloc. The 2015 review of the strategy reflects some Asian partners’ eagerness to distinguish themselves from their neighbours, including in their ambitions to take forward their relationship with Europe. For example, the signature of the EPCA with Kazakhstan and the first discussions on an announced format of a partnership with Kyrgyzstan signalled these countries’ willingness to go beyond the strategy on an ad hoc basis. We need to seek the right combination of individual and regional approaches, because many of the challenges the countries of Central Asia face require common solutions. A regional approach is therefore required. Water, trafficking and border management, the rising threat of radicalisation, and limited international trade are all issues which call for trans-border coordination. This has already been a specific focus of our regional approach. The areas of education, the rule of law and the environment have been given particular attention. We want to reinforce our common action on these issues and intensify interaction between experts through existing platforms and projects. An ambitious working programme has been set up, for example under the education platform, and we welcome here the commitment and close cooperation of several Member States, such as Poland and Latvia. Parliament’s report and the strategy review also underlined economic and commercial relations, and the wish to promote business and investment in the region. This would be possible with the necessary development of a reliable investment climate which calls for, on their side, more work in the fight against corruption, developing interconnections with the international business community and further regional integration. In this respect, like you, we are following with concern certain negative developments in Central Asia concerning human rights and basic freedoms. Let me say, my dialogue with leaders and ministers of the region on all these issues was very frank and very open. It is in their own interest to look for another way. In this regard we want to make better use of existing platforms and dialogues to look for positive solutions. The Special Representative for Central Asia is preparing a joint trip to Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in April with the Commission’s Directorate-General for International Cooperation and Development to discuss these issues and put forward positive steps. EU development cooperation can assist countries of the region in dealing with the challenges they are facing. Among these we cannot forget the many threats to regional security and stability. Regional security will be discussed again in the upcoming meetings of the Central Asian border security initiative in April in Bishkek and of the high-level security dialogue in Brussels in May. We are satisfied with the support provided by the rule of law initiative and the new face of border management and drug action programmes. Many of these are shared threats for Europe and Central Asia. We share an interest in the stabilisation of Afghanistan and have asked regional leaders to actively contribute to the preparation of the conference on Afghanistan which we will host in Brussels in October. We all deal with the return of foreign terrorist fighters from theatres of conflict in the Middle East and elsewhere, and we all know that our youth is exposed to radicalisation. Links between Europe and Central Asia date back centuries, but every single day we on both sides understand a bit better how much we need each other. I know you see this very well and I know we can count on your help in defining a new fruitful relationship with Central Asia.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3651, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Julie Girling", "mepid": "96956", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur particularly for listening to, and including, so much of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality (FEMM) opinion in his report.

Members of the UN discussed and debated a number of key points pertaining to the equality of women and men, and the result was an ambitious document. This included issues around violence against women. The FEMM Committee opinion calls on the governments of the five states to fully implement the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and demands that they treat violence against women as a criminal offence. I would like to acknowledge that in some of those states some significant work has been done and some progress made. Across the five states, violence against women has been described by the UN as prolific and pervasive; one third of girls report domestic violence as part of their lives.

The report focuses mostly on shortcomings and the need for a democratic reform process in the region. The situation concerning the rule of law and human rights is a primary concern, yet it is also important to rightfully acknowledge the positive developments in some countries of the region. The EU needs to engage with this neighbouring region by means of a positive, forward-looking and constructive dialogue. External action by the EU and Member States in Central Asia needs to be more coordinated, coherent and visible, guided by the work of the EU Special Representative, Ambassador Burian, and with a differentiated and flexible approach to each country.

And is there any doubt that the countries that make up what we call the Central Asian region - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan – are countries strategically relevant to the European Union? Is there any doubt when we contemplate that they are countries that produce energy – oil and gas; countries receiving large investments from a number of Member States of the European Union; countries of transit and destination of a significant flow of goods?  No, there is no doubting its strategic importance. But there is also no doubt that they are countries that pose serious problems in defining the priorities of European diplomacy: respect for the rules of the rule of law, for the separation of powers, for the dignity of the person, for the oppression of fundamental rights, for the protection of minorities and, in particular, for women.  For that is the message which has to be given by the definition of a European strategy for Central Asia, and in my view it is the message they send in this resolution on which we have worked the rapporteur , whose work we thank, Mr Meszerics - and the shadow rapporteurs - because I have had the honour of being the shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group. Exactly to frame the European Union's message in promoting the improvement of the rule of law and separating powers the importance of the judiciary, but also civil society and citizenship, in the fight against the clientel practices that define the capitalism that is practiced there and also, of course, in the fight against corruption.  All these messages are absolute priorities of the European Union, and must be framed by the European Union also in a commitment to the prevention of jihadism, because they are countries that have an important presence of the Muslim religion, which is always a practicable ground for \"yihadisation\" and radicalism, which must be intelligently prevented in the combination of efforts of the European Union , and to do so with a European accent, not by competing with Russia, nor with the Community of Independent States, nor with the importance of Russophone influence in that region, but by marking the European emphasis on the definition of our own diplomacy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3654, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Karol Karski", "mepid": "124887", "text": "  On behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent The author of the resolution rightly points out that it is in the european Union's important strategic, political and economic interest to strengthen our relations with all central Asian countries on the basis of shared values. This position must be supported, although at the same time it is necessary to be fully aware of how difficult it is to formulate our common policy towards a region so multidimensional, fighting problems inherited from the Soviet period, balancing between Russia, China and the West, in which relations between countries are generally bad due to disputes over borders and resources. However, the report's argument that one of the priorities in formulating a new strategy for the region should be to increase macro-financial assistance , without the report indicating the specific sources of such additional funding.  Furthermore, I believe that the positive, stabilising role of Kazakhstan in the whole region has been highlighted too little. For example, turkmenistan is separated by a gap in the quality of cooperation with the European Union and respect for human rights, including after the recent legal changes mentioned in the report.  At this point, I would like to mention the fruitful cooperation of Polish with the Government in Kazakhstan in the repatriation of Poles – descendants of exiles living in this republic, youth exchanges in educational programmes or developing economic cooperation.

The development of good political and economic relations with central Asian countries is of strategic importance to the European Union. There are several main factors that make the region relevant not only to the Union but also to other global powers. Central Asia is the natural bridge between the complex political and economic processes in the west and the dynamically developing eastern world. It is this particular geographical location and the possession of important energy resources that enables countries in the region to develop close relations with Europe, the US, Russia and China. The European Union must work diligently with the countries of the region to deepen our cooperation, to create regional programmes, new energy routes and to provide investment for the development of Central Asia. In this regard, the reinstatement of the post of EU Special Representative for Central Asia will make an important contribution to the implementation of the strategy and to deepening our relations with the countries of the region. Of course, this cooperation must be separated on the basis of each country's achievements and progress with regard to human rights, the rule of law, and good neighbourly relations. I find it important to improve cooperation with the countries of the region in the fight against terrorism. A particularly worrying fact is the growing number of Central Asian citizens in the ranks of Daesh and other terrorist organizations.

The countries of Central Asia must cease to be treated as the field of confrontation between the major powers on natural resources and the European strategy must promote an equal relationship that respects the national independence of each state and serves the mutual benefit.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3663, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, as I understand that the European Parliament has a responsibility towards the interpreters and the staff, I will contribute by finishing more or less at midnight in accordance of the rules that Parliament has.

I have just a few brief points on some of the notions mentioned in the debate. As for having a forward—looking attitude in our programmes and in our strategy, indeed, yes – nobody would want to contradict that. As for the notion that we should acknowledge progress when it takes place, I am also in full agreement, and I would like to emphasise both clauses of the sentence: ‘acknowledgment of progress’ and ‘when it really takes place’. And finally, as for the clear and consistent policies sorely missed by my colleague Mr Carver from the EU strategy, may I remind him that the historical record of Great Britain in that complicated region during the time of the great game is not much more impressive than ours, and I hope we could be somewhat more transparent than that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3665, "date": "2016-04-12.json", "name": "Przewodniczący. –", "mepid": "28372", "text": "   I close the debate.

As regards the EU's strategy for reaching an agreement with central Asian countries, the approach of the partners to cooperation should be re-examined. Although these countries are very attractive economically because they have significant mineral resources such as oil and natural gas, there are some aspects that make it impossible to establish closer international relations. Barriers to more effective cooperation are the still existing problems in central Asian countries, such as lack of freedom of expression, lack of respect for fundamental human rights and property rights, lack of rule of law, widespread discrimination against women. Ties with Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan should be strengthened, as this will make a significant contribution to solving their regional problems. Despite legislative reforms, the situation regarding respect for democratic standards and respect for human rights remains neglected. A priority for Europe should be to promote and strengthen values such as democracy, good governance, media freedom, human freedom. There should be a more intensive dialogue on infrastructure development, energy generation and environmental protection. As a result, economic cooperation will give greater coherence in the regions of asian countries.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}]
