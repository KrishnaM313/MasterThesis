Looking at progress in this area, we have made progress, but despite that, the number of children dying or suffering from undernutrition remains unacceptably high. This oral question and resolution seeks to ensure this issue is given the priority it deserves by the Commission in our collective action towards the post-2015 global development framework. Undernutrition represents an enormous development challenge. The World Health Organisation says that undernutrition is the biggest contributor to child mortality, causing 35% of the disease burden in children under five. It can create a vicious cycle of poverty, can reduce productivity and impede social and economic development. That is why the fight against child undernutrition and the provision of universal access to adequate nutritious food should remain as one of the major goals in the post-2015 agenda. We voted on Tuesday on that issue, and it is something we do feel is very important. In the draft document by the Own Working Group of the United Nations, goal 2 of the draft SDGs has a target to end all forms of malnutrition by 2030 and by 2025 achieve the internationally-agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under five. The World Health Organisation Assembly endorses the global target for a 40% reduction of the global number of children under five who are stunted by 2025. That means reducing the number of stunted children by more than 70 million – 70 million, colleagues – by 2025. In the Stier report on Tuesday, our Parliament voted with a huge majority to support this objective and goes further, calling for the zero hunger goal to end the scandal of hunger by 2025. It calls for promoting sustainable agriculture and recognising the specific needs of women farmers related to food security. These are vital efforts in our fight against child malnutrition. So what we are asking the Commission for this morning, and why we have asked for this debate, is because we now need a concrete action plan from the Commission on how we, as the European Union, can contribute to the child undernutrition targets, and how we can work with our international partners to achieve this. I understand that the Commission services have been working on an action plan on nutrition, and I wonder, Commissioner, could you update us on this and tell us what is happening and when we can expect something concrete? And how can the Commission ensure coordination, both in its different policies and with our international partners, in speeding up progress towards the WHO targets? Reduced and ending child undernutrition is possible but, like our other development policies, it requires resources, coordination and political will. This week we have had a debate marking the 25th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Tackling undernutrition in the next 15 to 20 years would be a key contribution to make sure that every child could have the basic right that gives them the opportunity for a decent life.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2014-11-27.json", "name": "Christos Stylianides", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, I am here with you today on behalf of Commissioner Mimica. I would like to thank Ms McAvan for this pertinent question. It reminds us all that undernutrition is not only a real human tragedy but also an economic issue which can be in the way of sustainable development. Let me underline that the Commission is fully engaged to improve the current situation, since in the last few years the European Union has indeed emerged as a key actor in the area of nutrition and has put nutrition at the heart of its development policy. The 2013 Commission Communication ‘Enhancing Maternal and Child Nutrition in External Assistance: an EU Policy Framework’ set a strategy on nutrition with two objectives: reducing wasting as well as stunting of children under the age of five. The Commission has also developed two action plans: one which addresses undernutrition in emergencies and mainly targets wasting. The second one sets out how the Commission will implement the EUR 3.5 billion it has pledged to reduce the number of stunted children under the age of five by seven million. Although these action plans do not foresee any mid-term evaluation, accountability to track financial resources and monitor the impact of nutrition intervention represents an important horizontal pillar of our nutrition action plan. We are fully aware that nutrition-specific intervention which addresses the immediate causes of undernutrition will not be sufficient. There is a need to address the basic and immediate causes of undernutrition. Therefore nutrition has to be mainstreamed in other relevant sectors like agriculture, education and water, and nutrition-sensitive intervention implemented. This is one of the reasons why the Commission has earmarked EUR 3.1 billion for nutrition-sensitive intervention, mainly through agriculture. Unfortunately there is not enough evidence on the effectiveness of nutrition-sensitive intervention. To address this challenge the Commission will promote applied research to identify the cost-effectiveness and monitor the impact of nutrition-sensitive actions. Based on the results of these efforts, the Commission may decide, during the mid-term review in 2017, to redirect some funds to possibly better-performing actions in order to attain the set objectives by 2025. In front of the challenges ahead, the Commission cannot work alone. The Commission intends to continue raising awareness of undernutrition issues in international forums like the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement, which has now been joined by 54 countries in the Committee on World Food Security. Second, the Commission will also strengthen its strategic partnership with FAO and WHO for nutrition and use events like the International Conference on Nutrition to keep the political momentum on nutrition. Third, at country level, the Commission has applied the principle of aid effectiveness through the joint programming within the 2014-2020 programming exercise. Last but not least, the Commission will continue its collaboration with NGOs through regular information- and experience-sharing lessons. In conclusion, I am fully aware that tackling undernutrition effectively will require combined efforts at all levels. I welcome Parliament’s interest in this matter and I thank you for your continued support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2014-11-27.json", "name": "Anna Záborská", "mepid": "23894", "text": "  for the PPE Group. – First of all, I would like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Development Policy, Linda McAvan, for taking on the role of rapporteur on a document that was actually approved by the committee at the last parliamentary term. I also thank my colleagues in charge of this theme in the various political groups for their cooperation in tabling amendments. It has already been mentioned that this week we voted on a document that will be with the Millennium Goals after 2015. Lack of nutrition is a truly complex problem that lies as a responsibility throughout society. It lies as a responsibility because the lack of nutrition does not respect fundamental human rights, and that is the right to a dignified life for the little ones, those children who live in hunger. When we take that a few children die every minute, not because there is war in their countries and not because they are sick, but because they are hungry. And it's not just those children who are dying, it's the other children, thousands and thousands of children who are bearing the consequences of this lack of nutrition for life. We are talking about figures here – I think we know these figures almost by heart, but cooperation is important, cooperation is important, both with the Institutions of the European Union and with other nutrition organisations, especially with the FAO. There needs to be a meeting this week, and I think that cooperation should be closer. And just one more sentence: I believe that what the Commissioner said in the hearing, that we will look more at poverty, we will look more at hunger than on climate change.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2014-11-27.json", "name": "Patrizia Toia", "mepid": "28340", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I welcome you and tell you that our first meeting in this House is taking place on a particularly significant issue, because there are such dramatic realities that we end up almost addicted, as if they were inevitable. But then, looking at them a little more closely, we see that they are by no means inevitable or inexorable, that they are tragic realities but perfectly solvable. We know how this should be done, we know what instruments should be put in place, we know the causes of these phenomena and we see the effects. And so I think that the very fact – as my colleague also said – that they are not inevitable really should make us take on a great responsibility and understand that if it is possible to do so, we must do so.  The question is whether we are capable, whether we want to put the instruments in place and, above all, do so to an appropriate extent. Today, this phenomenon of malnutrition, child malnutrition, takes on even more devious, more hidden forms: it is the so-called hidden hunger, which is less obvious, less impacting even as images that reach our eyes, to knowledge through NGOs and international cooperation operators, but which are equally negative and prejudicial to the development of boys and girls. And so this phenomenon of hidden hunger is also one of those that we want to tackle.  We are mobilizing in these days with renewed vigour precisely to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. And I would really like to thank our chairman Linda McAvan and all my shadow colleagues because we want to tell her that our commitment as a Parliament is there, not only of the DEVE Committee, but of parliament as a whole. We call on the Commission to take this step forward just as effectively, with equal conviction. I really do think that we should not have – and I say this to myself first of all – the right to commemorate and celebrate if we do not accompany this right with a serious commitment, a measurable commitment - you spoke of numbers, figures and dates, and we appreciated that - and a commitment that also looks at effectiveness in its use.  We know that resources for international development, like other resources within the Union, are not always used effectively, but we cannot afford to lose anything here. So even this dimension of effectiveness control, of understanding what happens to our plans becomes absolutely essential. So I believe that we must make these commitments with renewed vigour. You spoke about these plans, you also talked about the need to make an evaluation of effectiveness in order to see how to reprogramme the interventions. Well, I would ask you to have a very cooperative and very engaging relationship with Parliament throughout this process, because you will find, as you have seen, great competences and passion in the committee and therefore a great desire to cooperate in the development of the most effective measures.  Many things have been done – linda mcavan mentioned some of the results, you mentioned them – and I think that Europe should be proud to have contributed to these results. However, the phenomenon is returning to certain geographical areas and places where it was not there as a result of the economic crisis, as a result of speculation on food prices, essential food products. We therefore also ask you to involve your colleagues in a vision of a policy that is a little more horizontal and across the agenda in order to trace the causes of some of these phenomena that can perhaps be tackled in other areas, with a different agricultural policy, for example, with a different trade policy, with a financial policy. This phenomenon of commodities speculation on food is something – I believe – intolerable to the common opinion of this Parliament. Finally, one final point: we have all seen, reading and documenting, not only for this occasion but for our work, how the role of women is fundamental. There are data that make you shudder: 80% of women contribute to food in developing countries and 60% of malnourished people; they contribute to producing and being the real farmers, the farmers, and they have 2% of the ownership. That is what we are also doing about women, who are an element of development in many countries, not just in the West that we know.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2014-11-27.json", "name": "Dawid Bohdan Jackiewicz", "mepid": "124882", "text": "  On behalf of the ECR Group. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by Commissioner, i would like to thank you for your comments. Just before yesterday in this chamber, Pope Francis said: \"It is ediving that millions of people around the world are starving, while tons of food are thrown out of our tables every day.\" According to a study by the United Nations, 1.3 million tonnes of food is destroyed each year.  Dear! No Action by the Commission, no subsidies spent on combating malnutrition will work unless we make a comprehensive change in the regulations and practices of food producers beforehand. Why are we debating this vague document if we can continue to speculate on the prices of goods in accordance with EU law by throwing away tonnes of food products in order to prevent their prices from falling? And those who share their surplus food, punish taxes.  In this context, the Commission's proposals to address hunger among children by promoting gender equality and empowering women in all areas of nutrition seem like a grim joke. We must have the courage to tell ourselves a brutal truth here in this Chamber today. It is EU legislation that largely allows unethical practices of food producers. If we want to counter the greatest disgrace of today – the scourge of hunger among children – we must take really decisive action and start it by changing the regulations that have so far undermined many of our efforts to improve the existence of the most vulnerable among us.

Mr President, Commissioner, the world is experiencing a silent crisis that is devastating entire communities in the developing world. The european Parliament's examination of this issue therefore obliges us to focus on a humanitarian, political, economic and developmental scourge that requires a coordinated and coherent response. This is, of course, an ethical imperative that also generates collateral economic effects. We all know- this has been said and repeated here - that more than 165 million children under the age of five are malnourished and that the first thousand days of life are of paramount importance for the development of the child.  We are all aware of the recurrent nutritional crises in the Sahel and sub-Saharan Africa. What interests me is how we are going to address the causes of this evil? We cannot separate this issue from that of food self-sufficiency. I would like to take a look at your performance at the time of your hearing, so I think you are certainly aware of these issues, and in your plan and in your approach, the need for cross-cutting policies that are not only about undernutrition but also about food self-sufficiency is taken into account.  I have not yet heard of the subject of land grabbing; I see that in Africa there is a real tendency in the economic world to take over land, a tendency with obviously dramatic consequences.  We talked about water, there is also education and technical transfer, perhaps from us, that will improve the productivity and yield of those lands.  I agree with the speaker that it is quite scandalous to allow financial speculation on food. As for the issue of women, I obviously agree because I am a privileged witness to the major role of women, particularly in Africa and in the economic world.

But also in southern Europe children suffer from malnutrition. In my country, galicia, there are more than 20% of children below the poverty level. In the Spanish state today, 60% more people are at risk of poverty and social exclusion than in 2007.  The cause of this situation lies in the policies of the European Union, which make it possible for multinationals to steal the wealth of peoples, which prevent them from developing their agriculture, which occupy their lands, which impose ruinous free trade agreements on peoples.  Without questioning these policies there will be no solution to hunger and malnutrition in the south, without putting an end to the troika's policies, hunger and malnutrition will continue to advance in the north. Mr Commissioner, the neoliberal policies of the European Union must radically change, with urgent measures such as ending multinational summing-uppolicies, ending free trade agreements, acting, adapting, changing agricultural and food policies within the framework of food sovereignty.

It is shameful that millions of children are still suffering from hunger and that every few minutes a child dies of hunger. I am also very pleased – and I would like to thank Mrs McAvan very much – that in this report we are not only talking about malnutrition, but also about malnutrition, because it is not enough for children to get enough calories. For healthy growth and age-appropriate development, they need a balanced diet with vitamins, with trace elements, to name but a few. However, we will not achieve this if we continue to promote the usual monocultures. They displace diversified cultivation systems with different cereals and vegetables and thus also the production of the required micronutrients. I call on the EU here to follow the recommendations of the EU Special Rapporteur on the right to food, who explicitly mentions greener agriculture as a way for these countries to feed themselves, and who also points to the role of agriculture in climate change and the fight against poverty. It is therefore important to promote and support small farmers, because they have the potential to spread diverse climate-friendly farming systems, they have the potential to produce fair food that meets local dietary habits, they have the potential to build an economy. Because with the original production are also the processing, transport and trade in the region. This is where the potential for the labour force lies, and thus the first step out of poverty. But without land, no food can be grown. This means that traditional land rights must be protected, that access to land must be guaranteed for the local population, especially women. This must not be the winner who puts more money on the table. The local population must be the victors here, and we must not encourage further land grabbing under any circumstances. Investment in agriculture is absolutely necessary. They are necessary if we are to fight hunger and poverty in developing countries. But not every kind of investment in agriculture is helpful here. If private investors end up more or less expelling the local population from their own resources and depriving them of it in order to carry out this indispensable food production themselves, in order to produce large margins for the world market, for international markets, then no child will be fed up. Trade agreements must also take this into account in the future, and they must also do justice to this. Otherwise, these countries are becoming increasingly dependent on international commodity markets and on fluctuations in prices on these markets. They become dependent on food speculation, and stock market developments thus become decisive for whether a child can go to bed hungry or full at the end of the day. This is highly immoral, and we must fight against it. Poverty and hunger can be prevented by providing sufficient support to local farmers. That is the only way for these countries to achieve food sovereignty. We need further greening of cultivation systems in order to adapt them to climate change, because it is precisely these countries that will be the first to be affected by climate change.

Malnutrition leads to conflict, poverty and social insecurity. The United Nations Millennium Goals have already achieved a great deal. In 1990, malnutrition was still 18.7%, and we are currently at 11.2%. Much has been achieved, but the number of malnourished children remains at an unacceptably high level for us. The main reason for hunger is poverty. Experts also attach great importance to the education of women, especially in terms of malnutrition, which leads to increased infant mortality.

Of these, 225 million are children under the age of 5 who are chronically malnourished.

It is a scandal, as Pope Francis called it, whose messages I hope we have not only listened to and quickly forgotten, but with our long applause in this House we have accepted and supported. So there's food for everyone, but there's no justice for everyone. That is why this week we adopted a Resolution on a new global framework for development and we demanded that the European Union and the international community focus on the causes of poverty and hunger. And clearly, this resolution by Colleague McAvan mentions what those causes are, and there are more of them.  But in short, if we are going to resonate by following the Pope's messages, then we must conclude that the main causes of poverty and hunger are in fact selfish human behaviors and policies that have only material interests in their center, namely the strongest ones, and ignore the dignity of human life for all its duration. Yes, as a Christian Democrat, I will point out that the issue of child malnutrition shows that the dignity of human life must be protected from the start. Here, as stated in paragraph 3 of this Resolution to meet nutritional needs, the first 1,000 days of a child's life, including the gestation period, are paramount.  However, it is not enough to say that we want to protect life from the beginning, it is also necessary through an effective coherent development policy to allow that child when it is born to have a quality diet, access to health, education and we all have to work on it together a lot more. In this regard, I welcome the Commission's intention to invest EUR 3.5 billion, as well as the intention of the Commissioner, who said he wanted strict monitoring to implement and assess the effectiveness of these programmes.

Unicef, for example, has taken this issue very seriously and has taken action in it. Indeed, as the Commissioner says, the EU can also act through UN organisations to promote this issue. It is very much a question of moving towards more one-sided farming as well. That is why the Greens have tabled an amendment stressing the importance of an agroecological approach.

It is also one of the criteria that the World Health Organisation recommends for assessing equality in health. Unfortunately for Europe, new areas of malnutrition that are suffering from the effects of austerity policies in response to the economic crisis must also be in place.

Thousands of Greek families, with zero income due to unemployment, do not have to give their children the necessary. Kids go fasting to schools.

The world has a food problem that particularly affects children. While great progress has been made towards achieving one of the Millennium Development Goals, halving the rate of malnourished people in developing countries. The problem, however, has not disappeared, it is ubiquitous and complicated. I therefore support the content of the motion for a resolution. Poverty is the main cause of malnutrition among children in all regions of the world. The most difficult situation is in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Unicef data shows that around 100 million children worldwide suffer from malnutrition, and more than 50 million children under the age of five are suffering from hunger. By contrast, as many as 160 million children worldwide suffer from growth shortages.  Malnutrition inhibits the physical development of the child, weakens his intellect, the ability to concentrate and learn, and consequently deprives him of the chance to be independent in the future, to find a good job and to break the circle of poverty in which he grows up. That is why, in the report on the post-2015 global development framework, which was voted on yesterday by a large majority, Davor Stier mentioned combating poverty and, as a result, hunger, malnutrition among children as the most important objective.  As a member of the DEVE Committee, I would like to stress the particular need to help developing countries to support their real development, which will enable self-sufficiency in the future. We cannot refuse emergency assistance, especially in extreme cases where not only children suffer from hunger, but their entire families. Malnutrition is especially dangerous for pregnant women, as it can cause significant harm or hinder the development of the fetus.  Well-nourished children are hopeful for future generations, healthier and learn better. Thanks to this, in the future they have the opportunity to provide themselves and others with decent living conditions. Meanwhile, today one child dies every 5/6 seconds in the world, as we already know.

I am very pleased to note that in the United Nations proposal for the new Post-2015 Development Agenda, one of the goals is to end all forms of malnutrition by 2030 by focusing on children. But we need to further open the scope to achieve our goal and eradicate child malnutrition. Efforts must be made to help improve developing countries in other fields, such as the provision of safe water and sanitation, hygiene, sustainable agriculture, fisheries, natural resource management, a healthy environment, measures to support women to ensure a healthy life for themselves and for all members of their household.

Thus, before the age of five, girls are three times more likely than boys to be severely malnourished. Deprived of good food conditions and therefore even more vulnerable to growth problems, girls are more likely to die when they are still very young. It is therefore necessary to identify cultural and religious barriers in discriminatory practices and attitudes detrimental to girls, and of course to try to remedy them.  Moreover, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, if women farmers had access to the same means of production as farmers, they could increase yields worldwide by 20-30% and increase agricultural production for food purposes. In other words, these advances would prevent 100 million people, or even 150 million, from suffering from hunger. Therefore, addressing inequalities between men and women and between girls and boys from an early age, ending the unfavourable treatment of girls, and improving the prospects of women farmers are concrete ways to combat child malnutrition in developing countries.

It is often conflict and political instability that are the main causes of child malnutrition. We therefore need more methods, statistics and monitoring of the consequences of different types of conflicts on children and their nutrition. The governments of developing countries must create an environment for better baby food and care. That is why national plans and strategies need to be better coordinated. On our part, the Commission and the Member States should mobilise long-term financial resources and investments in the field of nutrition and cooperate effectively with international organisations.

The fight against child malnutrition is and remains one of the main Millennium Development Goals for 2015. When we talk about child malnutrition, we always link it to food insecurity and poverty, but also to unhealthy domestic environments and inadequate access to health services. Currently 805 million people worldwide do not have enough food to lead a healthy life, most in Sub-Saharan Africa and also in Asia. One in nine people in the world is in this situation. There are also 66 million school-age children in the world who go to school going hungry. The first thousand days of a child's life are essential, as has been said here, so that he can have full growth and his dignity can be respected. It is the period that is therefore considered most critical in order to prevent malnutrition and its consequences in adulthood. It is true that the European Union has made an important effort on all issues of development cooperation, but we must do even more to alleviate this problem, with innovative funding, but also with long-term funding. The aim is that we can talk about food availability, accessibility of these foods and also that these foods can be adapted to the needs of the children themselves.

We have also spoken about the need to improve diet, to make sure that there is a sustainable food supply. We have also spoken about the need to ensure that discrimination, especially discrimination against women, is tackled within the developing world, and the position of women in terms of education at home and in the workplace also needs to be tackled. We also have to encourage greater use of breastfeeding to avoid contaminated water; and I think, crucially, a plan needs to be built around a child’s first 1 000 days, which other people have spoken about. The first two years are crucial in terms of getting on top of the problem of malnutrition. I think tackling food price volatility and food price security is another issue that we need to address.

It is painful that today's reality is that in some countries we are talking about how to reduce food waste, while in others we are counting the children who die of hunger.

As recalled in the European Union guidelines on freedom of religion or belief and the European Union guidelines on freedom of expression, laws that criminalise blasphemy can have serious inhibiting effects on the exercise of these human rights. As a general principle, the European Union recommends the decriminalisation of blasphemy offences. In Pakistan the blasphemy laws are frequently used to settle personal conflicts or to stoke up secretarian and interfaith tensions. The application of blasphemy laws is an issue of considerable concern for the European Union, not least because they carry the death penalty. In our human rights dialogue with Pakistan in June we discussed the blasphemy laws. We reminded the Government of Pakistan of its obligation to enforce the provision of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concerning freedom of religion or belief. During his official visit to Pakistan in October 2014, the EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Mr Stavros Lambrinidis, specifically raised the misuse of blasphemy laws with several ministers as well as with religious leaders. He also expressed deep concern at the decision of the High Court to uphold the conviction of Mrs Asia Bibi, despite blasphemy legislation being a sensitive issue within Pakistani society. The EU message is that leaders, whether political or religious, must find the courage to address this. Threats and violence against judges, lawyers and human rights defenders involved with these cases are common. Some of them have even been killed. It must be clear that any form of immunity for such crimes would undermine the justice system and the rule of law. The European Union will continue to use any appropriate opportunity to raise this issue with our Pakistani counterparts. In this regard, the GSP+ trade preferences are a major milestone in our relations with Pakistan. GSP+ offers a clear framework for assessing and promoting progress in implementing the 27 co-international conventions on human rights, labour rights, environment and good governance – a process we are following closely. The European Union, and notably our delegation in Islamabad, will continue to follow the case of Asia Bibi closely and to advocate for the verdict to be overturned and for Mrs Bibi to be released. The European Union will use any opportunity to raise this case, and the wider issues of the death penalty and the blasphemy law, with our Pakistani counterparts. I have taken note of and welcome your strong interest in this issue. Let me assure you that the European Union remains fully committed to engage with Pakistan – with the government, human rights defenders and other stakeholders – to promote and defend human rights.

This is all the more shocking when we consider that the High Court of Justice in Pakistan has ratified the death sentence, which will have to be carried out shortly. So the rule of law does not exist in Pakistan at all and Christians continue to be persecuted with impunity. It is important for the Pakistani authorities to realise that if they continue to violate human rights so barbarically, dialogue with the European Union will become impossible, given that a sine qua non for dialogue is precisely about good governance and respect for human rights.

Under these provisions, which are part of the Pakistani Penal Code, dozens of people are persecuted every year, although the vast majority of cases are actually fabricated and part of land or workplace disputes. While no one has been executed by the state for blasphemy, those accused of breaking these laws often spend years in prison and along with their family are at all times in danger of mob violence. Even advocates for reform in Pakistan run the risk of being targeted by extremists. It is abundantly clear that the blasphemy laws have been used to instil fear into religious minority communities, and in particular Christians. While minority rights are guaranteed by Pakistan’s constitution, the government must actively address religious hostility within society.

We are dismayed, like all of you, by the daily reports of atrocities specifically targeting women and girls by ISIS and associated armed groups in Iraq. In particular, there are reports of kidnappings, forced marriage, slavery, sexual abuse and forced conversion which are targeting in particular the most vulnerable people belonging to ethnic and religious minorities. The EU, in a formal conclusion of the Foreign Affairs Council and the European Council, has repeatedly condemned in the strongest terms these brutal acts and calls for the perpetrators of these gross abuses to be held accountable. We therefore strongly support the work of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, who has launched an investigation on ISIS human rights abuses in Iraq, and the gathering of strong evidence of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. The Iraqi Government should now ensure the investigation of all human rights abuses to avoid immunity on all sides and send a strong message on the importance of respecting the rule of law. This will require reform of the criminal justice system and the steady consolidation of a culture of respect for human rights. An independent judiciary giving a sense of equality to all citizens before the law will be a crucial element in the process of national reconciliation, which is a matter of urgency. Many human rights violations currently committed in Iraq qualify as crimes against humanity. We therefore strongly recommend to the government to accede to the Rome Statute or at least accept the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court over the current situation and Article 12(3) of the Rome Statute. The EU stands ready to continue supporting the major reforms needed in the area of the rule of law and governance in Iraq. A new programme for an amount of EUR 10 million was started in early September. In addition, the EU is financing a number of assistance programmes more directly related to the protection of women and children, including an ongoing project on establishing a strategy for the protection of women and assisting victims of trafficking and sexual and gender-based violence. On the humanitarian side, the protection of vulnerable groups, including women and children, is a priority for the European Union. The needs of the 2.1 million displaced people and refugees are huge. As the number increased, the EU scaled up its relief efforts. The European Union humanitarian action will include medical and psychosocial assistance to victims of all kinds of violence, including sexual and gender-based violence. Let me conclude by underlining that the EU will continue to support the Government of Iraq in such challenging times and will increase its efforts to alleviate the suffering of innocent civilian victims of a horrific wave of violence.

These attitudes are at odds with the interests of the EU and its citizens and the spirit of European solidarity. Apart from what Juncker has said, what matters is action and these do not lay in his favour, as does his past and that of Commissioners such as Hill and Cañete.

I have today voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the Commission's guidelines on impact assessment. Impact assessments are conducted to predict the likely consequence of EU legislation on citizens and the economy as a whole. However, they are often controversial and opaque.  I believe that a major challenge facing the new European Commission is to break down its impact assessment mechanisms from political imperatives that all too often guide the preparation of its proposals and instead to rely on mere scientific evidence. There are countless examples in which European policy-makers have bickered about scientific evidence, including on extremely technical issues. I therefore believe that we need to develop a new system for collecting evidence within the Commission itself, which completely disconnects the collection of evidence from the political imperative.

The anniversary is a good time to take stock of the situation regarding respect for children's rights. In this context, I wanted to highlight the issues of protecting children from poverty. One provision of the Convention is the right of every child to a standard of living corresponding to his or her physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development (Article 27). Poverty means depriving children of these rights, as well as depriving them of the rights to survival, protection and development, including those enshrined in the Convention.  Although the number of people in extreme poverty has fallen worldwide, almost half of the poorest population is 18 years old or less. Poverty is not just about the poorest countries. According to a recent UNICEF report, more than 30 million children in the world's richest countries live in poverty. In Europe, a quarter of children under six are at risk of poverty or social exclusion. The lack of protection of children from poverty has tragic consequences for children themselves and society as a whole. Therefore, combating poverty must be a key priority for any government.

The courage of children marked this year when a young women's education activist from Pakistan, Malala Yousafzai, and children's rights activist from India, Kailash Satyarthi, were selected as nobel peace prize winners. To support children in war-affected countries, the European Union has launched the EU Children of Peace initiative, which provides more than 108,000 children with education.  The Republic of Croatia has been included among those advanced countries that have undertaken the obligation to ensure and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms.

The digital economy must respond to market challenges by increasing technological capacity, with high-performance results in multiple areas and which can bring many employment opportunities to the labour market.

Improving children's nutrition is a key factor in the development of a healthy population, which automatically also leads to economic growth and social progress in these countries. A number of researches have shown that malnutrition derives from the lack of essential elements such as calcium, iron, vitamin A, but also from problems that occur during the lactation period.

International organisations confirm that there is enough food production in the world for all of humanity and that child malnutrition is linked to an uneven distribution of food.
