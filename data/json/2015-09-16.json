I have received a request from the Commission following on from the final draft agenda adopted by the Conference of Presidents in accordance with Rule 149 of the Rules of Procedure on 10 September. In his State of the Union address, the President of the Commission announced that proposals would be made on the migration issue, including a proposal for a Council decision to introduce provisional measures in the field of international protection in favour of Italy, Greece and Hungary. I have now received the relevant commission's draft from the Council. The proposal will be officially forwarded to the LIBE Committee. I have received a request from the Council to deal with the matter as soon as possible. In agreement with the President of the Commission and after consulting the Conference of Presidents and the Chairman of the LIBE Committee, I propose that this Commission proposal be dealt with as a matter of urgency under Article 154. Ladies and gentlemen, the refugee crisis that we are experiencing certainly makes it necessary to find an immediate solution at Union level. I think it fully justifies the use of the urgent procedure. I believe that the institutions of the European Union should already make their own, that they should show the citizens who are concerned that we are acting.

I know the President agrees with this.  But following the Council meeting of Monday and the lack of consensus and urgency in reaching majority agreement on an organised and compassionate response to the refugee crisis here in the European Union, it is necessary that we respond and that we have our view and that people see Parliament doing its job. In particular, the failure to reach an agreement on the 120 000 relocation mechanism to assist with the refugee crisis in Italy, Greece and Hungary will be seen to be one of the major omissions of the Council conclusions of Monday.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for your invitation. As you know, in the face of the deterioration of the refugee crisis in Europe during the summer months, the Luxembourg Presidency convened a special session of the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 14 September. The scale of the challenge we face requires a common European response. The short-term humanitarian situation and the need for a coherent and comprehensive EU migration policy must be addressed both in the short term. The package of measures presented to you on 9 September by President Juncker forms the basis of our immediate work. At Monday's Council meeting, ministers took note of the detailed information provided by UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres and William Lacy Swing, Director-General of the International Organization for Migration, on global trends in migration flows and refugees. Both speakers stressed their willingness to work with the European Union and provide it with the assistance and technical expertise needed to deal with the current crisis.  We took a decisive step on Monday with the final decision, after Parliament's opinion, on refugees arriving in Greece and Italy who clearly need international protection. From tomorrow, we can start relocating these 40,000 people and, at the same time, hotspots must be set up in Italy and Greece. Preparations are underway in many Member States. The Presidency also reached conclusions following the in-depth discussions we had on Monday on immediate actions and on the continuation of work in preparation for the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting on 8 and 9 October. As a large majority of Member States have agreed to move forward on relocation, the Council will already meet on Tuesday 22 September to discuss the relocation of 120,000 people. Negotiations on relocation will not be easy in the Council.  Given the urgency of the situation and as announced in Parliament's consultation letter, I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that there will be a significant change from the original proposal. Hungary does not consider itself a front-line country and has informed us that it does not wish to be a beneficiary of the relocation.  Parliament will be able to take this into account in its opinion.  The Council will also begin work tomorrow on the permanent relocation mechanism and the European list of safe countries of origin.  I would like to review before you the main elements of his conclusions. The first element is our support for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and in particular his humanitarian support. In particular, we welcomed Norway's proposal to hold an international donor conference and to help Syrians displaced by the war. We reiterated the importance of effective border control, enabling better management of migration flows.  We have agreed to deploy what are called RABIT, the rapid response teams, to the field.  We need to respond positively by sending human resources and equipment to the field as soon as we receive requests to do so. This is a European way that we already have; implement it where it is needed. Greece's request for support to the EU to better manage the massive influx is particularly important. We are referring to the new proposals in the immigration package presented by the Commission on 9 September and, moreover, we are ready to do everything possible to start considering these proposals as soon as possible. I am sure the European Parliament shares this determination. Your resolution on migration and refugees in Europe, adopted on 10 September, testifies to this. The policy of return and readmission is of prime importance and will be discussed in depth at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 8-9 October, which will also look at strengthening Frontex's role in this area. At the international level, it is imperative to strengthen cooperation with third countries of origin and transit. The Valletta Summit, the conference on the migration challenges posed by the Western Balkans route and the pilot project in Niger are concrete initiatives that must continue to move quickly to achieve the desired results. In addition, we stressed that Turkey is a key partner with which we must strengthen our cooperation. Finally, the measures I have just listed must, of course, be accompanied by a large and appropriate budget and substantial human resources. Thank you, Mr. President.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 21, "date": "2015-09-16.json", "name": "Frans Timmermans", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   First Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, those of you who know Game of Thrones will know the expression ‘winter is coming’. It is meant quite literally and it is meant metaphorically. This expression can be applied to the situation the European Union is in now vis-à-vis the refugees. Winter is coming, quite literally. But winter might also be coming metaphorically for the European Union if we are incapable of action in the next couple of days and weeks. (Applause)  This issue, left unresolved, will undoubtedly lead to human suffering for the refugees, to political turmoil in our Member States, to strife between Member States and to tensions which Europe cannot afford to have. So we have a strong, strong responsibility – Parliament, Council and Commission – to make sure that what we did not achieve last Monday in the Council will be achieved without delay. Yes, a lot has been achieved so far. Yes, it is difficult to have far-reaching results within five days of the Commission making proposals, but we have no time to lose.  I want to salute this Parliament and its President for your courageous steps forward, in line with the Commission proposals. I want to express my gratitude to the President of Parliament for having organised a vote, which will send a clear signal to all Member States and all capitals that the Parliament that represents the peoples of Europe wants action – and it wants it now – and so does the Commission.  I want to add one more point, which to me is very important. The Commission is willing to build bridges between the different positions of Member States. We cannot afford the luxury of finger-pointing. We cannot afford the luxury of accusing one another of not wanting to reach a solution. There is no time for that. We have to have the skill, the openness and the willingness to build bridges to help countries come to a common solution which will express solidarity and responsibility.  My plea is also to all of you to please explain to your constituents, and to your people back home, that our proposals are not just about a distribution key to express solidarity with those states who are really suffering today. They are also about the European Union being able to better guard its external borders, the European Union being able to offer more support to those states which bear the brunt of this crisis – states like Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey – which deserve far more support from the European Union. The European Union is also about offering the perspective of a sustainable migration policy and refugee policy. We can deal with this if we are united, but we will fail if we are – and continue to be – divided.

It is not just one more debate on reporting back from the Council: it is mostly about sending a strong political message ahead of the Council meeting on 22 September. You, Members of Parliament, have stressed that more action at European level is needed. This action is needed now, and the Council next week is the opportunity to make an important step forward all together. I therefore join my voice to what Frans Timmermans said before: I urge you to send the message of political urgency outside of this Chamber to your governments, to the media and to the European citizens. The debate on the refugee crisis is often linked to fake dangers and fears. This is something that we – all politicians – need to address.  Let me start from where we stand. The European Union’s agenda on migration represents a comprehensive approach which equally responds to all the issues of the migratory challenge, because, as we have stressed many times, solidarity goes hand-in-hand with responsibility. Safeguarding our citizens’ freedom of movement also requires ensuring their security by protecting our external borders. At the same time, we need to fulfil our humanitarian obligations and respect international law when it comes to asylum seekers. We also need to be pragmatic and accept that we have to respond together, united, to this crisis.  The second implementing package that we presented to you last week serves this goal: to respond to the emergency situation in our borders by enhancing both the responsibility and the solidarity aspects. This House warmly supported this package in its resolution last week. In the Council on Monday we made some progress as well. On most of the proposals there is broad consensus, there is no doubt about it. Member States are clearly in favour of returning persons who do not have the right to stay on our territory. The European Union’s action plan on return outlines the short and mid-term measures to be taken to enhance the effectiveness of the EU return system. The EU list of safe countries will alleviate the pressure on Member States’ national asylum systems. The Commission proposals in this respect were welcome and will be further discussed. We will also send more support to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey to provide better conditions for the refugees.  The High Representative/Vice-President Mogherini attended the Council meeting this morning, showing that internal and external policies go hand in hand. Also, when it comes to the protection of our borders, all Member States agreed to use existing tools like the RABITs (Rapid Border Intervention Teams) mentioned before, as well as to enhance them by strengthening the mandate of Frontex.  The first hotspots are being set up and will become operational shortly. It is important to ensure that the most affected Member States will have our full support to register, fingerprint and manage the arrivals of thousands of persons every day.  On relocation, the Commission welcomes the decision to relocate 40 000 persons in clear need of international protection that was adopted on Monday and can now be implemented. I can assure you that we will work closely and with all Member States to have swift results. Hot spots will be bases to make this approach a success. The first relocation will start immediately, but for our proposal to relocate 120 000 additional persons from Italy, Greece and Hungary, we do not have the agreement we wanted. There was a willingness of the majority of Member States, but not all, to move forward towards an agreement on relocating another 120 000 persons.  I would like to thank the Luxembourg Presidency for their hard work to find a compromise. As you know, there will be another extraordinary Council meeting already next week. We cannot fail on this. It will be a crucial meeting and the Commission is ready to provide full support to enable decisions on the files. The objective of the Commission is to preserve the unity of Europe. We are in contact with all Member States and we are ready to work with them over the coming days so that all Member States will go the extra mile to find a European solution.  I would like to underline that the European Parliament is participating fully in this process for the framework, for the crisis and location mechanism, as well as for the list of safe countries of origin. You will be co-legislators. For the emergency relocation mechanism, your positive opinion sends a strong political signal, the same strong political signal that you sent today ahead of the extraordinary Justice and Home Affairs Council by deciding to adopt the opinion on the relocation of 120 000 persons in fast-track procedures. To finish, I will not hide from you that I felt disappointed and frustrated on Monday evening, even though progress was made. It was not enough: it is nothing compared to the magnitude of the crisis. It is nothing compared to the moral obligation of Europe to stand up to its values and to respond to this historical call to show solidarity towards people who are fleeing war and persecution. These people will not be stopped by any cold sea, any fence, any army. They will just risk and find ways to cross borders in order to find a safe shelter for them and their children. What I want to say is that the migratory pressure will not just go away if we pretend to ignore it. Our neighbourhood is on fire. This concerns us all. The only pragmatic and humanitarian response is an ambitious European one and a comprehensive one. There is no single solution to this crisis. We need to address all issues, to fight the root causes, to support and cooperate with the neighbouring countries, to better protect our borders, to fight smugglers with all the means we have, to increase the reception capacities in the countries most affected and to ensure solidarity when it comes to finding for them a safe refuge. It is time for each and every one to take their responsibilities. As I said yesterday – and I will repeat it on every occasion – if we fail, it will not be the institutions that fail: it will be Europe that will be failing, and we should not allow this to happen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 23, "date": "2015-09-16.json", "name": "Esteban González Pons", "mepid": "125027", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, there are at least 120 000 people in Europe suffering and waiting for us to stop talking and start acting.

There are at least 120,000 people in Europe waiting for the Commission's proposal to be approved or rejected by this Parliament. And there are no extremist responses, which are cruel and also useless, of the type \"no one must enter\" or the type \"we have to let everyone in\".

President Schulz was right to convene this plenary as an emergency, because that is what we are demonstrating, we are ready. The European Parliament is ready. Let the Council also be ready in the next few days to approve the measures that await the citizens of Europe, which are solidarity measures, but they are also security measures for our citizens!

Let us also think of a foreign policy which will stabilise the Mediterranean. Let us also consider helping in the work of repatriation. We also think about organizing hot spots.  So there is not only solidarity, but there is also responsibility and therefore a balanced position that should be supported by all the Member States. I continue to appeal to all The Member States, including those who are most recalcitrant: let us not delude anyone that through barbed wire, through walls, we can face such a great and important challenge.  We have been with some socialist and democratic colleagues on the Serbian-Hungarian border and seeing the barbed wire and seeing the refugee camps we have experienced great bitterness and great pain. We want Europe to redeem this image, to share this image and to rediscover itself. Europe to come back and make Europe again! Europe to become an agent of solidarity again! Europe to become an example again in the world for human rights! Europe that once again becomes a great gentle power and a great civil power!

EU actions and decisions should therefore be taken in a spirit of consultation, not unilaterally declared by one or two leaders who then expect everyone else to follow. Those Member States who believe there is more than one solution are currently accused of being less European than others. It is simply not fair. By imposing emergency relocation schemes on countries that are – for many reasons – opposed, we are storing up trouble for any future proposals which offer the best long-term solutions. As First Vice-President Timmermans just said, no finger-pointing, but the reprimands and the ad hoc and rash decision-making that we are seeing are causing us to lose focus on strengthening our cooperation and vital actions to tackle the roots of the crisis.  Much of the Commission’s proposal is correct: improving reception centres, speeding up processing and returns, tackling human trafficking, and looking at how Europe can be a force for good in assisting those countries where 97% of the refugees are located. Countries that disagree or cannot accept a quota system should be asked what other contributions they could make to help lessen the pressure.  But I believe that resettling the most vulnerable refugees straight from the camps in their home regions is the most responsible thing all the Member States can do.

We did not reach an agreement even though, in my opinion, it is in fact a topic that could be decided with a qualified majority, and I am very doubtful that on 22 September we are going to get a deal.  In my opinion, it is an issue that has to be tackled at the level of Heads of State or Government and no longer on the level of ministers of the interior alone. It is not an interior security issue alone. It is a refugee crisis – the biggest that we have ever faced – and I think it is for the prime ministers and heads of state to take the responsibility to come together and elaborate a comprehensive approach for this problem.  In that respect, we are now stuck in a debate between Visegrád prime ministers, who refuse common responsibility, and mostly Western politicians and prime ministers. We have to come out of this debate, and the only way to come out of this debate is not only to talk about this shared responsibility – that is one of the elements, and we are going to vote on this with Parliament – but it is to have a broad approach. We also have to tackle the other issues, such as that there is no economic migration policy in the European Union, and so economic migrants are abusing it because of the lack of a European Union economic migration policy. There is no common border agency. Frontex is not a common border agency, it is our people that we take from a number of Member States for Member States – Italy, Greece and so on – and they are doing the job, while it should be a mandatory system in which all 28 Member States participate. There is also, at the same time – let us be honest – no common policy to be engaged to try to tackle the sources of this refugee crisis, to be engaged to stop the Syrian war, to be engaged with more money to tackle the problems in different parts of Africa.  I think you can organise whatever meetings you want on 14 and 22 September, and then maybe a week later on 3 October, but I think it is time that the Heads of State or Government under the leadership of Mr Tusk and Mr Bettel, as the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, start with a real summit to tackle the whole issue and to have a comprehensive approach. Only then, Mr Asselborn, will you have a chance to convince the Visegrád countries: when they see it is part of a global approach, and not starting by saying that they have to take 20 000 or 25 000, and that is all. In my opinion, that may not be the right tactical move.  Finally, there are two urgent problems we have to face. The first is the funding of the different UN camps in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. They have no money for the moment: they have to reduce the allowance from USD 30 to USD 13, so there is going to be a huge flow to Europe again. My appeal to the Commission is that they fund the United Nations immediately, on an urgent basis, within the possibilities inside the budget, and that they hand over the money that is necessary in the coming days so that we can find a way to improve the conditions of these refugees in Lebanon and in Jordan, because there cannot be a new flow.  Finally, Marielle de Sarnez and Natalie Griesbeck, two of our colleagues, went to the Hungarian border, and I can confirm what Mr Pittella said: that what is happening there is a shame. It is shameful that it is happening in the European Union. The Commission also has a task and a control function on that, and you have to act on Hungary.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current situation and the challenge posed by refugees from war and persecution are causing strong and contrasting emotions in our societies.  Yes, like all of you, I see, I hear fears. I hear and see the manifestations of fear, rejection and even hatred. My concern is when these reactions open the doors of the chanceries. When heads of state or government, instead of peddling the challenge we face, feed and flatter these fears. That is what leads to the blockage. It is this which has made finding a consensus solution in the Council so difficult. But what I also see in our societies is the manifestation of an outpouring of solidarity in a series of Member States: citizens who spontaneously help and welcome these refugees from war and persecution.  I would like to invite not only all of us but also the Heads of State or Government to draw on these reactions in order to find a common solution in Europe. Yes, this solution must include all the measures proposed by the Commission. It must certainly include a permanent distribution key. Finally, it must put an end to this Dublin system, which is ultimately the organisation of anti-solidarity in Europe. It must, in fact, - as Guy Verhofstadt has said - create legal paths to the European Union. This is the best way to put an end to the smugglers' business.  But I would like to call on the Commission to be as enthusiastic or even bold on the front of solidarity and social justice within the European Union, as when it is responding today to the challenge of migration. The two are linked because I understand the concerns of our fellow citizens about the additional burden that the reception of refugees will place, in the short term, on our social protection systems. Systems that themselves are under unprecedented strain due to rising unemployment, inequality, exclusion and poverty.

We heard from Juncker last week in Strasbourg that the European Union lacks the Eu ropean Union and lacks Europe. Well, we add that there is also a lack of will to have union and Europe, or this will is probably found for other interests, such as economic interests.  Well, we are endeavouring, as a 5-star movement, to ensure that an alternative is possible, to ensure that there is another Europe, but unfortunately the facts force us to think that this conviction must become a utopia, a broken dream, an illusion. Well, do we often hear ourselves wondering what Europe is doing? So let us give this Europe a first and last name.  We are facing a humanitarian crisis and what are we doing? Germany suspends Schengen and reintroduces internal border controls, Hungary builds barbed-wire walls on the border with Serbia, Romania, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia are opposed to the relocation of the 40 thousand migrants, which was already a derisory figure in itself and reduced the number to 32 250, and the United Kingdom has availed itself of the opt-aut clause and will not participate in the decision.  Well in conclusion, no to compulsion, no quotas, no to the relocation of asylum seekers from April, but since August 2015. So, since yesterday, since the last landings, no to 40 000 but to 32 000 asylum seekers to be relocated.  It's a disgrace! Each Member State must take responsibility for the decisions it takes.

Merkel realized her mistake and suddenly Germany introduced border controls. However, we had time to get a glimpse of what will happen in a Europe of open borders.

Madam President, I have listened with great interest, a great deal of respect, sometimes a great deal of astonishment, and it has been a little comforting to see that the gap in appreciation in the European Parliament is ten times greater than in the Council. I do not agree with the results of the Justice and Home Affairs Council last Monday. That is why I have decided, on behalf of the Luxembourg Presidency, to take a new momentum. This must, in my opinion, be decisive. One MP asked why we did not vote last Monday. We could not vote because we respect the European Parliament and the treaties. To vote, you need the opinion of the European Parliament and this opinion, you will give it tomorrow, in a vote after 10 o'clock. I hope that on 22 September it will not be necessary to vote and that everything will be done - at least by the Presidency - to reach an agreement by consensus. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, respect for rights is enshrined in the charter of the European Union. Anyone who knocks on our door and is prosecuted has the right to the rules of the Geneva Convention. Despite all the problems in society, in France or elsewhere, I think that the European Union would lose all its credibility if it turned a blind eye. In the same vein, we must not criticize a country or politicians for their generosity.  I also think that the Commission - and I look at my friend Dim-tris Avram-poulos - its president and its commissioner have done a perfect job. The Commission has proposed something very palpable, I will not remind you of that. I just want us in the European Union in 2015 to show the same zeal to show our solidarity as in the Yugoslav crisis, where there was a great deal of solidarity between east and west, south and north. I would like to say that we obviously do not have the right to lose the Visegred Group states because we would then lose the historical challenge embodied by Europe. It is therefore necessary to do everything possible to change the approach of the Visegred group. The few hundred or even a few thousand refugees fleeing poverty and brutality in Syria are not elements that enter the society of these countries to break it down. That is certainly not true. It may be difficult to explain, but you have to be patient but also have a certain strength to talk to those responsible and perhaps also to the people of these countries. In any case, the Presidency will listen, work with the 28 Member States, by 22 September. Madam President, I do not entirely agree with those who believe that a European Council is the best way. I am not against a European Council. Of course, I have no right to be against it, but we must remember the month of June and we must also have in mind that, since the Lisbon Treaty, we must let the councils of ministers work. We have failed, I agree with you. On Monday, we will overcome this failure, at least in terms of the distribution of 120,000 refugees. As for the 40,000, you know we have found a solution. If we succeed, I believe that the European Council will have plenty of time to explain itself afterwards. Pressure must now be maintained on the Justice and Home Affairs Council next Tuesday. With regard to Mrs Hohlmeier's last question on the financial envelope, we will already have, through the Commission, next Tuesday, more concrete figures, whether to help Turkey or to help Greece. This is very important so that there can be reception facilities in Greece, because most of the people who are now asylum seekers in Europe, we do not know where they really come from, nor who they are; we have not received them with dignity and it has to change very quickly. That is why, after Greece's request to be helped by the Commission, EASO, UNHCR and the Member States as well, we have responded positively to this request. I think it is in the interest, not only of Greece, Dimitris Avramopoulos, but also of the whole of Europe.

As I said at the beginning, it is a very important debate.  I notice that we all agree that we are confronted with a multifaceted crisis. Yes, it is a crisis of refugees and migration, but it is also a crisis that has to do with the European Union and its institutions in general. It is a crisis that tests the values of the Union, the credibility of Europe and the validity of the principle of solidarity, but also the capacity of our institutions to react and act. I can assure you that in the Commission we are fully conscious of our duty and, from the very beginning of the life of this Commission, we have welcomed that. In a period of only seven months we delivered by presenting the European Agenda on Migration with the contribution and the approval of this House.  Let me also say that it is not about finger pointing. It is about finding a consensus. It is about keeping Europe united. It is true that it sometimes takes more effort, but our role, the role of the Commission and of the Presidency – as Mr Asselborn said – is to discuss, to explain and to overcome differences.  Many of you made special reference to Schengen. I want to tell you that the temporary reintroduction of border controls is explicitly foreseen in the legislation for exceptional situations and as a temporary measure. The Commission is closely following developments and is also informing Parliament at every stage. It is not the end of Schengen. Schengen is the most important, tangible achievement of Europe integration and we shall protect it.  Talking about Schengen and borders, I would also like to stress that guarding borders with violent means is not compatible with European values and principles. We are here to preserve and guarantee freedom of movement in Europe, but we also need to secure our external European borders. This is why the Commission’s comprehensive approach needs to be adopted and swiftly implemented.  Yes, I expressed my frustration at the outcome of the recent Council but, with your support and the excellent work done by the Luxembourg Presidency, we will all go this extra mile united. We are determined – as Frans Timmermans said – to build bridges and to prove that Europe is up to the challenge, that Europe is credible, and that Europe is determined to stay  united, resolved, solid and humane.

Madam President, it would be easy to move on like this to another item on the agenda. But it turns out that this item on the agenda, which we are going to deal with now, is not unrelated to the one we have just discussed.  Of course, this debate has focused on refugees who are the victims of conflicts, terrible wars that are tearing a number of countries apart. But a number of MEPs have noticed that among these refugees, of course, there are also people who are described as refugees or economic migrants, as if poverty, as if the absolute deprivation they often face, is not a reason to seek a better life elsewhere.  What about those young people in Africa or elsewhere who have no prospect of finding a job, who have no prospect of having a decent life? In the end, are these young people not right to leave, to get started as well? Of course, we are talking about economic migrants, migrants who would have fewer rights. Yes, perhaps, they have no rights under the Geneva Convention, but is absolute poverty not a reason to leave and seek a slightly better life elsewhere? So I take a little bit of what President Juncker said last week: who are we Europeans to condemn those millions of people who want to go elsewhere? Not so long ago — because in history, a century or a century and a half is finally a relatively short period - millions of Europeans set out because they were poor, because they had no economic and social perspective in Europe, because they had nothing to offer their children. They went looking for a better life elsewhere and turned in particular to the new world that welcomed them. Therefore, you have to understand. It should be noted that one third of the Luxembourg population , I believe that there are other countries that are in similar situations - went to the United States because they could not survive in Luxembourg. Therefore, poverty concerns us. And the poverty elsewhere concerns us. This is the reality of a globalized world. Migration is part of this globalized world and especially in a globalized world where, finally, even those who live deep in Africa have information, ways to communicate, ways to get an idea of what his life could be like if he could live it elsewhere. This debate therefore affects us and, in a way, prolongs the previous debate because the answer, again, to these migrants called economics cannot be the construction of new walls, the construction of new barbed wire or the use of tear gas, at the moment, we do not know what will happen next.  The answer to this problem is development. It is a global economy that does not condemn millions, if not billions, of human beings in total destitution, not to mention climate refugees, refugees who are already victims of climate problems and global warming. It is for this reason that the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is so important and must be a top priority for Europe, because, again, we are at the forefront if we fail to effectively combat poverty among our neighbours, among our African neighbours and others. Following the work of the Addis Ababa Conference on Development Financing, the Sustainable Development Summit in New York is the second major milestone of 2015, which I believe hopes are to be concluded by the adoption of a universal climate agreement in Paris in December at COP 21. The end result of the post-2015 process can be considered generally satisfactory. Indeed, the main objective of the European Union, that of adopting a sustainable development agenda that is ambitious, transformative and sustainable, has been achieved or almost achieved. We are still awaiting the final adoption by the summit at the end of this month in New York.  This agenda includes a set of objectives that integrate the three dimensions of sustainable development in a balanced way and pursues a primary objective: the eradication of poverty. In this context, we can congratulate ourselves that the action programme resulting from the Addis Ababa Conference on Financing for Development is the mainstay of the means of implementation of the 2030 Agenda and includes both financial and non-financial means to transpose the future development agenda.  I would like to acknowledge Parliament's role in this collective success and thank you for your support throughout the process of Negotiation. In this context, I would like to mention, in particular, Mr Stier's work on your November 2014 resolution on the overall post-2015 development framework and that of Mrs Theocharous on the role of local authorities in development cooperation. We must now take action, that is, the implementation of the 2030 agenda. To do that, we must first look at all the instruments we have and determine whether they are adequate. This programme represents a significant change from the Millennium Development Goals, in particular by its universal nature, which means that it will have to be implemented by all and at all levels of development. It is not just for developing countries, it is a sustainable development agenda. We find this idea that we all live on the same planet and that there is not, on the one hand, the haves and, on the other, those who unfortunately do not have the chance to be have the haves.  In this context, the Commission will have to examine all EU legislation in the various sectors concerned and present the appropriate legislative proposals to the European Parliament and the Council if necessary. For their part, Member States will also need to revise their sustainable development strategies and instruments in light of the 2030 agenda. The implementation and monitoring of the 2030 Agenda concerns not only governments and administrations but all actors, including civil society and the private sector. The programme incorporates a robust monitoring and monitoring mechanism that was one of the biggest challenges in the negotiations. We now have a framework that will allow us to assess progress and report back to citizens. In implementing the 2030 Agenda, we must also ensure that the balance between the three dimensions of sustainable development - economic, social and environmental - is maintained and I count on the support of Parliament. On the Council side, ministers from the development and environmental sectors will have the opportunity to discuss the further process and the coordination of the process on 26 October in Luxembourg. There are also strong links between the 2030 sustainable development agenda and the COP 21 conference, which will take place from 30 November to 11 December in Paris.  For the Luxembourg Presidency, it will be crucial to ensure that we build on the progress made in Addis Ababa and New York to ensure that the Paris conference is also a success. With regard to this Paris conference, reconciling development and climate action is possible, but it is not only possible, it is absolutely essential. That is why the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has created a new goal: urgent action to combat climate change and its consequences. This goal calls for an ambitious and universal agreement in December at COP 21 in Paris. The preparation of COP 21 is one of the main priorities of our Presidency and, on Friday, the Ministers of the Environment and Finance will discuss the issue of climate finance at their meeting. The Environment Council will adopt conclusions as of this Friday, which will serve as a mandate for COP 21. The position of the European Union and its Member States is clear. The 2015 agreement should be, first, a universal and legally binding agreement to effectively combat climate change and contain the rise in the planet's average temperature, at least below two degrees below pre-industrial levels. Second, an agreement made to last, which offers a long-term vision of the necessary transformation to low-carbon resilient societies and economies that can withstand the effects of climate change. Third, a flexible agreement with the capacity to respond dynamically to the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge, responsibilities and capabilities and enable broad and effective participation. Finally, an agreement with mechanisms to measure progress and deepen its ambition. We need a strong regime, based on rules including rules on monitoring, emissions verification and clear compatibility of emissions applicable to all countries. The actions of the parties must be irreversible and progress towards low carbon emissions. An agreement with a long-term goal, which must send a strong signal to the transformation of countries' development trajectories so that they can are becoming low-carbon economies that are resistant to the effects of climate change.  I would add that financing will be an important element with, at the heart of the scheme, a public and private commitment of $100 billion per year by 2020 by developed countries for poor and vulnerable countries, and more broadly, a shift in investment towards low-carbon and economically viable technologies. This is a great prospect to revive our economies and make a real technological leap and support sustainable growth.  Finally, I would like to stress that we welcome the support, here too, of the European Parliament and its rapporteur, Mr Gilles Pargneaux, to help us reach an agreement in Paris soon.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 139, "date": "2015-09-16.json", "name": "Frans Timmermans", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   First Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, I will make some specific comments on development—related elements for the Summit on Sustainable Development and COP 21, but before doing this, I want to make a more general remark.  It is almost a year ago that, in the course of the hearings in this Parliament, President Juncker decided to hand me responsibility for sustainable development in a broad sense to create coherence in our policies. I want to point to the fact that one of the factors that will determine whether we will be successful with these policies is whether we are able to create coherence between the different elements – and we lack coherence.  We lack coherence in my institution, we lack coherence in this institution, in the Council, in the Member States, in the international world. I think my first plea to you today would be, let us work together to create coherence between the actions of the DGs in the Commission, the different committees in the European Parliament. Let us face it, sometimes the policies that come out of different DGs and different committees have contradictions. That is a reality, so let us try and do away with contradictions. I am at your disposal, I say to the Members of this Parliament, to do better than we have done up till now.  I really want to make sure that we are coherent, because sustainable development has three main aspects: obviously environmental; but also economic, and social. These elements have a role inside the European Union, and obviously worldwide, and as long as we are not able to create coherence between these different dimensions our approach will not be successful enough and will, if it continues to be contradictory, also lead to a waste of financial resources, human resources, political resources.  The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development is going to be a landmark achievement, I think, because it has an inclusive nature already. It is something the European Union has been advocating for a long time and I think this time, for once, citizens, parliaments, civil society, made the contributions, not just governments, and the way this Parliament was involved in the process testifies to that different approach. The European Union had an instrumental role in shaping the agenda; a lot will be expected of the European Union also in New York, and President Juncker has asked me to lead the delegation.  There are 17 Sustainable Development Goals which follow and expand on the MDGs. As I said, they would have to integrate economic, social and environmental dimensions, as well as human rights, gender equality, the rule of law, good governance and peaceful and inclusive societies. Let me come back to this point because I think it is crucial. A holistic approach is what we need, but there is always a big danger in a holistic approach. If you say you need to do everything you end up doing nothing. But if you only leave the different silos on their own you might achieve something in one silo, nothing in another, etc. So the challenge here is to be precise on the specific issues without ever forgetting that you need to integrate it with other policies.  Parliaments will have to have an important role to play in that, and governments as well, but civil society should never be forgotten, because integrating policies is actually better done mostly in civil society than at governmental level. We have agreed a global partnership, it is ambitious, and I think we are determined to change, to integrate our internal and external policies, to make sure that, also in the future of the Europe 2020 strategy and other areas, we are coherent with what we agree in New York.  Of course we need to look after the most vulnerable. If we do not look after the most vulnerable sooner or later they will draw the conclusion that they have no future where they are and will look for a future elsewhere, which will exacerbate the problems with migration we already have. In that context I think those countries which are now facing huge financial challenges because of the migration crisis, had they decided a long time ago to follow the UN’s guidance and go up to 0.7% of ODA, I think we would perhaps be looking at a different situation. So I would urge, through you, all the Member States finally to try and reach our objective, which is still in my view a modest one. It would inspire the rest of the world if Europe were also to lead in this area.  It is not just about aid and support. Huge parts of the world that used to depend on aid and support are now self-sustaining, are going through incredible growth cycles, incredible growth figures, but very often this growth is very unequally distributed. People migrate not because their country’s economy is shrinking or in trouble but because the wealth in their country is unevenly distributed, because they have no say, because democracy is thwarted, because their human rights are trampled upon. So there also we need to have an integrated approach involving all actors.  And we need a strong and inclusive follow-up and review mechanism. All too often we are good at coming to agreements, promising all sorts of things, but we are weak at following up, weak at presenting what we do and weak at being accountable for what we need to do, so we need to put up that strong and inclusive follow-up and review mechanism. On COP 21, very briefly, on development-related aspects, I have three remarks. First, we need to deliver the 20% of climate-relevant finance for our development budget, including the Development Cooperation Instrument and the European Development Fund, which will result in more than EUR 9 billion in climate finance between 2014 and 2020. This is more than double what was delivered during the previous period. We are making a significant effort to reach this target and have actively contributed to the climate finance report the OECD is preparing for the special World Bank and IMF meeting in Lima in October. Second, we are preparing to launch specific new climate-relevant initiatives, including a new phase of the Global Climate Change Alliance with a budget of at least EUR 350 million that will support adaptation to climate in vulnerable countries, notably least-developed countries and small island developing states. It will also provide support to accessible low-carbon energy through: bilateral and thematic programmes with around EUR 3.6 billion, including the new innovative Electrification Financing initiative, (ElectrFI), which will help mobilise private investment in this area; support to sustainable agriculture and food security, EUR 8.8 billion; and up to EUR 50 billion of investment through our blending facilities, with our Climate Change Windows being a key mobilising more climate finance from other public and private investors. This will include EU funding of at least EUR 2 billion in the period 2014-2020.  Finally, we plan a number of targeted side events in Paris to present these initiatives and raise awareness among our key partners in order to maximise their participation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 140, "date": "2015-09-16.json", "name": "President. –", "mepid": "28314", "text": "   Now we will go to the speakers’ list.

The European Parliament has already adopted a resolution, contributing to the definition of a new development framework after 2015. The European Union has also dedicated this whole year to promoting development policy, calling it the European Year of Development. As we observed in the previous debate, this year we could also call the European year of migration. And of course development policy is an important aspect in defining the response to the current refugee crisis and the long-term migration challenge. In this regard, I welcome the European Commission's announcement to create a €1.8 billion special fund for Africa in addition to the already existing Syria Fund. However, the allocation from the European budget or the European Development Fund is not sufficient, but requires a financial contribution from Member States to these funds. In terms of financing development cooperation, it is also necessary for Member States to reach the target of 0.7% of domestic income as soon as possible rather than waiting until the 2030 deadline. Year. At the same time, development policy must focus more on peace and security support projects, as well as promoting good rule, building effective impulsive institutions, combating corruption. The millennium development goals framework so far has not addressed these issues, but that would have to change in two weeks in New York. The new global framework is therefore much more demanding than the current one and focuses on the very causes of poverty and underdevelopment, not just the symptoms. Issues of peace and security, respect for human rights, an effective judiciary and the issue of migration are becoming part of a new framework that, unlike the Millennium Goals, will be universal, i.e. also mandatory for The Member States of the European Union.

They are right to do so, because what we are doing in New York is talking about the right of everybody on this planet to live to live a decent life in the future. What I would like to see come out of New York is a commitment to finish the job that we started when we agreed the Millennium Development Goals: to put poverty eradication at the heart of our development policy and an agreement which recognises that ‘business as usual’ on the environment and climate change is simply not enough to guarantee a future with sustainable economic growth. The good news is that we have got a text. There will be no haggling at the last minute in New York. But I hope the easy agreement does not mean that some governments imagine that the text can be forgotten, put away in a cupboard and pulled out every now and then and that they can pick and choose which of the 17 goals and 169 targets to focus on. I am pleased, Commissioner Timmermans, that you have talked about how the EU will go ahead and implement that deal here inside the EU because there are two aspects, as you said. Firstly, how we make it relate to our development policy and our external action and, secondly, how it relates to our other environment and climate change objectives. So the first task is to get the right indicators and to get a common methodology, and I hope you will involve Parliament in those discussions in the future. Finally, a word on the COP agreement in Paris. As things stand today, the emissions cut pledges on the table do not add up to the 2°C target. In fact, they deliver us a 3°C rise in temperatures. This is simply not enough. I know from having been in Africa that people in the poorest countries are already living with climate change, and it is they who will pay the price if we do not act. So we have to get a proper commitment on the actual pledges on climate change. On the financing, as the minister said, it is not enough to say that we will commit. We have to see the money.

We went from having a development program to a much more holistic and effective approach. The great challenges we face right now, such as immigration and radical extremism, are rooted in a field paid for by poverty, inequality and corruption. We need to give shelter and an immediate humanitarian response to the thousands, the hundreds of thousands, the millions of refugees who are at the gates of our borders, but it is crucial to work on the origins of the problem. We have to go to the roots. And how? Demanding that the human rights clauses reflected in our trade agreements be respected; promoting good governance and transparency in those countries that need it most; promoting the participation of civil society in all democratic processes; ensuring that all of our policies pay special attention to those who have it most difficult, who are children and women; ensuring responsible and sustainable management of environmental resources; applying the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities; and, of course, giving priority to Article 208 of our Treaty, which is the principle of political coherence.

I know that my colleague, Commissioner Arias Cañete, was here in July, when he presented the summer package, and that Parliament held an in-depth discussion with him in both the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI). I will therefore try to avoid technicalities and explain what makes the summer package such an important milestone in the Energy Union’s roadmap. In fact, the summer package illustrates the Commission’s determination to decarbonise our economy and to give consumers and our citizens a central role in Europe’s energy transition. As Members will know, in the past months I have been visiting our Member States in the framework of the Energy Union tour. I have had a lot of meetings with national and local governments, market stakeholders, civil society organisations and citizens.  I can report back to Parliament that, having already visited almost half of the EU Member States, many concerns and ideas which have come up are very similar, regardless of geography. These concerns include the citizens’ and companies’ interest in having the possibility of producing their own energy without insurmountable bureaucratic hurdles, and also using this to lower the price of their energy bills at the same time. I also heard the clear call from industries for regulatory stability and predictability in the investment climate. I think that we all agree on the need to boost innovation in the market and address the drop in carbon prices. Therefore, I am very glad to say that the four elements of the summer package directly address these concerns. The new electricity market design will provide a truly European dimension to security of supply. It will offer clear price signals, facilitating investment and better integration of renewables. It will promote regional cooperation on energy policies and support schemes to renewables. Our upcoming proposals will also take into account the ongoing competition sector inquiry on capacity mechanisms. The new deal for consumers will make sure that lower wholesale prices are really rolled over to consumers’ bills, empowering them to know more, choose more and, above all, produce more energy by themselves. Knowing more also means an up-to-date system of energy efficiency labelling. Finally, the revision of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) for post-2020 reflects our deep commitment to decarbonisation and to the COP 21 Conference in Paris. This is in line with President Juncker’s priorities and with Parliament’s priorities in the area of climate policy and attaining our climate goals. It is very important to know that carbon leakage provisions will also continue for the post-2020 period and that the free allocation will be provided at adequate levels. However, we also have to underline that the number of free allowances available under the EU ETS is limited and will continue to decrease. Therefore, we must use free allowances in a smart way and in such a way as to ensure a healthy and innovative industry in the European Union. We will also continue supporting the development of low carbon innovation through an Innovation Fund and will modernise our energy industry in lower—income Member States through the new Modernisation Fund. This package is the first of an ambitious list of legislative proposals which we presented on the energy union roadmap. By the end of next year we will deliver 90% of these actions because we want to make sure we have enough time to work on the proposals with Parliament and with the Council, to turn them into actual legislation before the end of the Commission’s mandate.  The summer package was therefore presented just two months ago. This week we adopted the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan, which was very much anticipated, especially by the research community. The SET Plan is, however, only the first step towards a comprehensive research and innovation strategy, including energy, but also transport and industrial policy. Let me conclude by saying that, in order to keep up this pace and to maintain our ambitious plan, we need to continue strengthening the dialogue we have between Parliament and the Commission. For all these reasons, I would be happy to pursue this exchange of views in November, following the adoption of the State of the Energy Union report. As a reminder, this will be the first edition of an annual report on our overall assessment of how we are coping with all five dimensions of the Energy Union.

There are people who say that the whole policy is a circus. What do we see in the circus? If this were circus grass, there would be a rope stretched from one side of the hall to the other, and one could walk on that rope, trying not to fall to the right or to the left—somehow to get ahead. In fact, what we colleagues need to do with this creation of an energy union - and thank you to the Commission for the concrete first four proposals that have now emerged - we must walk along this rope without falling to the right or to the left. In this case, the 'right, left' would mean that, on the one hand, we need to balance the need to promote the competitiveness of the European Union: prices, energy prices and so on, and, on the other hand, we need to think about reducing CO2 emissions. We can't enter one ditch and fall or the other ditch and fall off because, friends beloved, we don't know if this network is underneath us. So with all due respect to the Commission, that at last these concrete proposals are.  Colleagues, this is a big challenge for us, but there are not only, as they say, these internal considerations here: competitiveness, CO2 emissions, but also external considerations. So what happens to our energy security? In the European Union, we know that we are very dependent on imports. And what makes me apprehensive is that my group is apprehensive, and the news recently emerged that Gazprom has entered into an agreement with several large European union energy companies on the expansion of the so-called Nord Stream 2, which would actually expand, deepen Europe's dependence on a single supplier. So I also call on the European Commission to raise the issue of this aspect and to consider whether this is not in the interests of European consumers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lv", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 193, "date": "2015-09-16.json", "name": "Kathleen Van Brempt", "mepid": "5729", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – In these uncertain times, it is important that we can show that the European Union has added value. I do not want to make too many connections between the dramatic humanitarian crisis we are facing and the energy union, but there are. First of all, because energy is the theme on which we must prove during this parliamentary term that Europe has added value. But also because this energy union is a holistic approach to climate, energy security and also social aspects, such as the price that people pay. In this way, we can ensure that people see a future in that European project again and also make a link with the climate. I think that is extremely important. I think it is very important that we have a Commission that does what it promises. Commissioner Šefčovič, together with his colleagues, promised at the beginning of the parliamentary term that the Commission would work on the Energy Union. That concept is now in place, and at the moment we in Parliament are discussing it at length in order to strengthen it. But the Commissioner has also said that I am systematically coming up with packages to actually implement the energy union, and since June the first package has been in place. That is not an insignificant package. There are some technical files in there, but that is important to propping up the whole. In the introduction, you did not happen to pay much attention to the emissions trading system. This is also an extremely important dossier for this Parliament and for my group, and I am glad that it is there. We are going to discuss it at length in Parliament, but it has ambition and it is important that it is there now, in the run-up to COP 21. In so doing, we in the European Union are proving that we are in favour of adapting our own legislation in such a way that it becomes more efficient. This also applies, of course, to the other dossiers in the summer package, such as the energy labelling directive, which focuses on consumers and which aims to lead them to the right choices. That has nothing to do with regulation, that has to do with the right vision. The same applies to the \"new deal\" for consumers or the new market design. This is a somewhat technical but no less important dossier, and for our group, energy efficiency and renewable energy are again at the heart of the discussion.

This is essential in the light of the agreed Energy Union, which aims to ensure equal treatment, solidarity and security between Member States in terms of energy supply. However, we were surprised to hear of the construction of a new northern gas pipeline \"Nord Stream 2\" connecting Russia and Germany, which will supply another fifty-five billion cubic meters of Russian gas. It is astonishing that the largest companies in the European Union are involved in the project. The biggest surprise, however, is due to the fact that this investment was financed through Deutsche Bank, Germany.

I think it is so clear how good we have been in the European Union to create a common market for everything that is physical products. For everything we can put in a box, put on a truck and drive to another country, we have a well-functioning market. But when it comes to, for example, more intangible things or energy, we have not succeeded at all. This means that in some parts of the European Union we have a surplus of energy that we cannot sell to our neighbours. It means that we have energy losses. This means that we have financial losses and we also have environmental losses. In the North Pole area, which concerns Scandinavia and now also the Baltic states, we have come much further on the road. We have now also got a cable in place for Mr Kariņš in Lithuania. It will work and be operational from December 15. This means that we create greater energy security. This means that we create greater incentives in Sweden to continue to produce more green energy that we can sell to our friends in Lithuania. It also creates a better economy throughout the North Pole region. While we are creating the common market, I think it is important that we do not get too messy in the details. It will look very different in different parts of the European Union in terms of the type of energy mix and we must continue to be a national competence. What we have to do, however, is to deal with the general rules. Make sure the interconnectivity works. That we get functioning market systems. But also that the control system that is so important for the climate in ets works better. Here we can see how, as Mr Van Brempt mentioned, we worked hard with the MSR to get it in place and get a better order. I think we need to do more here. The system needs to be simpler. It needs to be more market-oriented, but there must also be a mechanism in the system that means that when we have large surpluses, allowances disappear from the market so that we steer in the direction that we need going forward.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 196, "date": "2015-09-16.json", "name": "Miguel Urbán Crespo", "mepid": "131507", "text": "  GUE/NGL Group. – Mr President, Mr Eef-Soviet, the energy union, which you intend to reduce European external dependence, really only means a change of suppliers, but not a model.

Whether this summer package will be a milestone for the implementation of the Energy Union, as you said today, I would like to wait for legislative implementation. Let me explain this by referring to the four key elements of this summer package. Reorganization of energy labeling. Yes, it is good if consumers have easier access, if this is simplified. But please bear in mind that there will be more and much more administrative burdens for retailers and producers if all this has to be done anew. This is not better regulation. A positive point is the new deal for consumers. The second point of the package is that if energy becomes cheaper and when people use less energy, this is a positive thing. If you take action here, with more information, that is a good thing. The third point is rather critical. New energy market design – yes, we need this for a reorganisation of the electricity market.

And ETS – as has been mentioned – is really very, very bad and will lead to a huge loss of jobs in Europe if it is implemented as it stands now.

I would like to congratulate the Commission on the summer package it has presented. I believe that the proposal on emissions trading in particular is ambitious and it was important that it came before the summer recess. Climate change must still be at the top of our agenda. In view of the dramatic refugee crisis that we are experiencing, John Kerry, the US Secretary of State, has said that we must take active action against climate change, otherwise we will see even greater refugee movements in the future as a result of climate change. But how we do it, we have to discuss exactly. We want at least 40% CO2 reduction. And the Commission is already putting a very heavy burden on some sectors with its proposal. When I think of the fact that, for example, steel and cement, the reduction potential is very limited, even physically, and they still have to bring a 43% reduction in the package – ETS must bring more than non-ETS – we have to see if we can find other shoulders that can support it. I still believe that we need to do more in air transport. Nor does what happens to the International Civil Aviation Organisation really help us. It cannot be the case that steel and cement bring minus 43% and air transport is virtually nothing. Take a look at this and then improve! Finally, a sentence on labeling. Here, too, I welcome the European Commission's proposals. A labeling measure will enter into force next week on the basis of the old legal basis. In the case of heating equipment, what happens next week alone will save us as much energy as 47 nuclear power plants produce. So, energy efficiency has huge potential. And then we can save money. We can then put the money into our industry and our craftsmen who make energy efficiency, and we do not need to send it to Putin or to the oil sheikhs, who, unfortunately, are also financing things that cause us great problems.

Having said that, the ETS as a main pillar of EU climate policy needs to be a very reliable instrument which can help us reduce emissions and fight climate change. For this to happen, however, we need a reformed ETS which sets a price on carbon that encourages polluters to clean up their act.  Under the current Phase 3 Trading Period, free allowances are allocated too generously and in an inflexible manner. Handing out free emission allowances that exempt industries from reducing emissions is definitely not a solution. Free allocations alone cannot solve the challenges the ETS poses for industry, and this is an issue that we need to pay attention to in the upcoming discussions.  For climate change mitigation up to 2030, ETS is definitely important, but energy efficiency for household appliances is extremely important too.

However, consumers need to get that information about prices and about suppliers, and also about the possibilities of switching between suppliers. Therefore, I believe that data-driven technologies such as data hubs should play a big role in empowering consumers. Data hubs get the DSOs to share information publicly about the different suppliers and their possibilities, and also about the way that consumers can switch between them.

Parliament must be an all-round institutional actor, through a binding legal framework and a system of indicative national targets, because without democratic control the achievement of the objectives is also jeopardised.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 215, "date": "2015-09-16.json", "name": "Ashley Fox (ECR).", "mepid": "96957", "text": "   – Mr President, the Commission’s summer Energy Package contains some sensible suggestions that will help the internal market for energy.

I do wonder why it was changed in the first place. It is, though, important that the EU be consistent in its approach to energy efficiency. The recent European Court of Justice ruling against the United Kingdom’s preferential tax rate for energy-efficient materials runs counter to the Commission’s drive to reduce emissions.

We were waiting for him. We are now waiting for legislation. Consumers are the most important point of this package and it should be. Our citizens should know why we are creating an Energy Union, how important it is to them, how it can increase their confidence that there will be no shortage of energy supply. But prosumers are also important, and it is good that the European Commission has drawn attention to this, because prosumers can provide both energy supply, all over the European Union, as well as, very importantly, atmospheric protection, climate protection and environmental protection.  It is therefore important to design our common energy market well, because this gives our consumers an opportunity: the flexibility of this market, the carousel flows that need to be eliminated, the direct and indirect prices of CO2 elimination.  All this is very important, but work is also important for consumers. They want to have a job and the ECJ must be designed so that heavy industry does not leave the European Union, because that really threatens us, up to thirty percent. Finally, a Community approach is needed to ensure gas supplies to the European Union.

The Energy Union will need to ensure security of supply, enhance the creation of high—quality jobs and develop new export markets through further investment in research and innovation. Finally, we want the Energy Union to guarantee secure, stable and affordable energy for European industries and citizens, with a particular emphasis on job creation and – an issue close to my heart – tackling energy poverty among our most vulnerable citizens. In Europe, recent studies showed that only 12% of the most vulnerable consumers are put on the lowest energy tariffs.

This is the situation that awaits my country, Poland, among others, and I am here to oppose it.  The adoption of the rules proposed by the Commission will only deepen the differences in the civilisational development of individual European countries.

It is essential that the consumer participates, because other words energy efficiency and energy savings will be impossible. One of the areas where there are the most gaps is precisely that related to consumers. And I will point out two aspects: energy efficiency technologies allow to reduce bills, but the consumer will only take those measures if they actually reduce invoices, and today we find many designs of national markets in which they do not have an effective impact on the consumer invoice. At the same time, the interoperability of the equipment is essential, as well as the possibility to compare the offers of the different operators.

And the energy label is also a European model of success that makes it easier for consumers to buy the most energy-efficient products. It is available in every household and is actually known to most consumers in the EU. Surveys have also shown that more than 80% of EU citizens know the energy label. Therefore, particular attention must also be paid to consumer protection when revising the energy label. The energy labels for the various product groups are above all misleading today and no longer do their job as a consumer-friendly tool for saving energy. For example, A+ is the best classification for some product groups and the worst efficiency class for others. And in addition, the product groups almost all have completely different scales – from A+++ to A+, G, in short, there is actually a mess in the market. The Commission's proposal is a good one.

I can assure them that I will be very happy to bring that message back to the Commission in the Berlaymont, and to make sure that things continue at the same pace and with the same ambition for all subsequent proposals, which we promised we would deliver – and we will deliver them on time. The autumn will be devoted to the very important conference Members referred to in several of their interventions – COP 21. It is very important that the EU remains the leader in these efforts and that it makes sure that in Paris we get an ambitious, legally—binding agreement which would clearly put the world on a healthier and more sustainable path than in the past. Therefore, we accept these diplomatic activities, which we will be taking part in together – the Member States and the Commission. The French presidency wants to reconfirm our ambition in those efforts by working on additional legislative proposals. We have been discussing with several Honourable Members the importance of a cooling and heating strategy. I am very glad to inform the House that we are working hard on that, to deliver it on time. In the spring we want to present to Parliament another important package, which is strongly linked to the issue of energy security highlighted by several speakers. We want to present a new gas package, in which we want to tackle the issue of energy security through a new or revised directive on the security of gas supply, including the transparency of commercial contracts and the new proposals for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on intergovernmental agreements, to make sure that once such agreements are signed they are fully compatible with European law. Then, of course, summer will come. In the summer we would like to deliver two very important packages linked with what I hope will be good results from Paris – with how things would work in the non-ETS sector, with our transport, our buildings and our agriculture, and how we would make sure that we deliver on what we have already promised in the summer package in the ambitious proposals on the redesign of the electricity market. I think that there we can reflect some of the concerns which have been presented here concerning the fairness of the system, clear billing and energy poverty issues, better integration of renewables and, of course, underlining the principle of energy efficiency first. Therefore, I would like to assure Members that citizens facing poverty in the area of energy are a top priority and very much on our mind when we are preparing these legislative proposals. Concerning the ETS, Mr Duncan referred to his mother who could divide the cake in such a way that everybody thought that they had got the biggest piece. I think we have to learn from that wisdom and make sure that the system is fair for everybody, that we respect different starting positions and that we see it as a collective effort, which will be good for Europe, for the planet, for our citizens and for our industries. We have a very solid proposal on the table and we are very much looking forward to working with Members on this very ambitious proposal for the future. Several Members referred to the issue of Nord Stream 2. As I am sure they have noticed, since the beginning of the year we have heard several declarations on different ‘Streams’. The Nord Stream proposal is another project which raises a lot of questions. It raises the question of why we need additional huge capacity to be built when the current transport capacity for Russian gas to Europe is used at only 50%. Why do we need such big capacity if we want to preserve the transit route through Ukraine? Here I am very glad that not only the Commission, but also the Foreign Affairs Council, declared very clearly that preserving and maintaining the gas transit route through Ukraine is of strategic importance for the energy security of Europe. We have to say very loudly and clearly that it is very important for us that any attempts to shut down this transit route through Ukraine would have very negative consequences for the energy security of the European Union and for gas balance, especially in Central and Eastern Europe. It would have devastating consequences for Ukraine, in terms of the possibility of getting gas from different sources through reverse flows and, of course, in terms of the very important loss of revenue from transit fees. Therefore, it is absolutely clear that we have to get more details on this project, assess it very carefully and make sure that European law, especially the third package, would be fully applied to this project as well and that in the future it will be important for the European Union – for our Member States, but also for European companies – to make sure that, when we are looking for projects in the field of energy security, we look for the solutions which offer comprehensive security for all Member States, for all European countries and not just for a few.  Allow me to conclude by talking about my experience yesterday. I was in Bulgaria, where we had a huge conference which was also attended by the energy community of the Western Balkan countries. They are also looking with great hope to our Energy Union project. They told me that it seems that they will probably join the Energy Union before they join the European Union. I welcomed them. This is exactly what we want to do, because we believe in cross-border cooperation. We believe in the integration of our energy systems and we are ready to look for solutions which would be beneficial and positive for the whole of Europe and all European countries.  Thank you very much once again for giving me the opportunity to present the summer package. I would like to thank Members for their support and to assure them that we will be working according to our ambitious timetable. I am very much looking forward to discussing these topics with you. I believe that the next big occasion will be when we present you with the first Energy Union report, which we would like to turn into an annual event so that the issues of energy, climate change, transport, energy poverty – all subjects which are so close to the hearts of our citizens – will be permanently on the table of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 229, "date": "2015-09-16.json", "name": "El Presidente. –", "mepid": "125032", "text": "   The debate is closed.

Mr President, Mr Vice-President, honourable Members, at a time when this sector is going through a difficult period, I would like to reaffirm from the outset that agriculture is a fundamental sector for the European economy in terms of employment, social cohesion and sustainable development. The farmers, those who were at the gates of the Council on 7 September, those whom I met several times in preparing this Council and on the margins of the informal meeting in Luxembourg yesterday, those who report their difficulties in many Member States, are waiting for concrete answers, answers that go beyond simple technical measures and ensure the viability of the sector. That is why, after an initial discussion in July on the evolution of the main agricultural markets and on avenues of action in response to unfavourable developments, we convened this Council in September to examine the package of measures drawn up by the Commission. We continued our discussions yesterday at the informal meeting of agriculture ministers in Luxembourg, in which the chairman of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development participated. It also seems to me essential that Parliament contribute to this reflection and I am aware, in particular, of the recent contributions of its Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the dairy sector. As you know, since July, the market situation has worsened. The year 2015 will have seen unfavourable weather conditions, in particular one of the worst droughts since 2003, which affected almost half of the Member States, the presence of health risks, such as those related to swine fever, the extension of the Russian embargo and insufficient demand in view of current supply. All this contributes to a particularly depressed price level in Europe, particularly in the dairy, pork and fruit and vegetable sectors, and also affects other sectors, such as beef. Various initiatives, in the short and medium term, can be suggested to respond in solidarity to this situation. These responses must come from the national level as well as from the European level and must be able to use all available means on the two pillars of the CAP. As far as the European level is concerned, the measures presented by the Commission, to which President Juncker referred to you in his State of the Union address, amount to EUR 500 million, mainly to the benefit of the dairy sector. They are based on three axes. First, respond to farmers' cash flow difficulties; second, stabilizing markets; and, third, to improve the functioning of the supply chain. I think it is important to look at the method before deciding on these measures. Firstly, the financial envelopes made available to Member States aim to provide a fair, targeted and effective distribution with particular attention to Member States and farmers who have been most affected by market developments. Secondly, even if, given the diversity of situations and to avoid micro-management from Brussels, it is desirable to give the Member States a great deal of leeway, it is important that this aid does not call into question the market orientation taken by the new CAP, particularly with regard to the dairy sector since the end of quotas. Finally, in this first year of the implementation of the new regulatory framework, I would like to stress that the task of national administrations is already daunting. It is therefore desirable that they have some flexibility. I am thinking in particular of the possibility of anticipating the payment of certain essential payments for the short-term cash flow of farmers. In the same spirit - and our two institutions have committed to it - the CAP simplification programme, if properly conducted, with adequate priorities, can lead to a reduction in costs for farmers. The critical financial situation of many farmers naturally leads to an emphasis on the short-term financial side of the measures. However, I believe that we must also think about the implementation of actions such as those that involve the conquest of new export markets, the enhancement of products covered by geographical indications and other value-added products, the removal of non-tariff barriers, particularly those related to health risks, or even a more systematic use of the opportunities offered by producer organisations. , for example, to access the funding provided by the Regulation on the European Fund for Strategic Investments.  With regard to the short term and the package of measures drawn up by the Commission, I am pleased to be able to inform you, at the end of the informal meeting of agriculture ministers yesterday in Luxembourg, of the broad support that this package has received, at least as a first response. But beyond short-term measures and even if medium-term forecasts seem more encouraging, the fact remains that a reflection on more structural elements is needed. I am thinking in particular of ways to ensure a more balanced functioning of the food supply chain, for the benefit of producers, a quicker assessment of the milk package put in place in response to the 2009 crisis, since, under the current circumstances, we cannot wait until 2018 for a new assessment to be carried out , or the development of financial instruments in response to increased price volatility in agricultural markets. Finally, I will conclude by underlining our determination to put in place a solid package of measures and to continue to reflect with Parliament, in particular on measures that contribute to the sustainability of the sector in the medium term.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 237, "date": "2015-09-16.json", "name": "Phil Hogan", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I am very happy to be here this evening with the President of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, Fernand Etgen, and to outline the Commission’s response to the difficulties currently facing European farmers. As the public representatives of the European Union’s 507 million citizens, Members are only too well aware of the challenges facing not only farmers, but the wider challenges facing the Union. Just last week, President Juncker made his State of the Union address to this House and, inevitably, much of that address was focused on the refugee crisis. To deal with this crisis, the President said that we ‘require a strong effort for European solidarity’. The European Union has shown solidarity in its response to many crises and our response to the situation in the agricultural markets is a demonstration of solidarity with European farmers and particularly with those most affected by market developments over the past year. The Commission has proposed a comprehensive support package for all 28 Member States, which is worth EUR 500 million, and which is described by President Juncker as ‘a EUR 500 million solidarity package for farmers’. The Commission’s response reflects our commitment to support European farmers and European food production. I welcome the support for the package by the Council yesterday and I hope that I can count on similar support from this House. In response to some concerns about the source of the funding for the package, I am happy to confirm that the money comes from within the existing margins of the agricultural budget and will not require recourse to the Crisis Reserve.  For those who question the adequacy of the package as an effective response, I would say there are always some for whom any amount is never enough, whether it is EUR 500 million or EUR 1 billion, but now that we have this package announced, my focus is on delivering it. This is about what the Commission can do for farmers and getting that done quickly, particularly to address the immediate cashflow challenges of the sector. The Commission’s response must also be seen against the other budgetary pressures, particularly arising from the refugee crisis. Indeed, an element of the Commission’s package is to make available EUR 30 million to ensure that EU milk will be available for the nutritional needs of refugees. We have been dealing for over a year now with the effects of the Russian ban, which it is acknowledged has had repercussions on the farming sector. In addition to the continuing impact of that ban, we also have weakening demand in a number of key existing and prospective markets, notably China; we have a global oversupply of milk, to which all producing regions are contributing; and we have an impact of drought in certain Member States. These issues have had a wide impact on farmers, particularly dairy farmers, who number about 700 000 right across the Union.  The Commission’s package is an appropriate mix to meet the challenges being faced by different sectors and farmers in Member States, and rather than focusing on individual measures I would urge Members to look at the package as a whole. It is a package that is designed to address the cash-flow difficulties faced by farmers, on the one hand, through EUR 420 million in direct targeted aid for all 28 Member States, and on the other, by allowing Member States to advance 70% of direct payments and up to 85% of area-based rural development payments from 16 October without the need for on-the-spot checks.  The package will stabilise the market, through a new and very generously—resourced private storage scheme for skimmed milk powder and cheese as well as a new private storage scheme for pigmeat. Additional funding will also be provided for the promotion of dairy products and pigmeat. The package will reinforce the work on improvements for better outcomes at all layers of the food supply chain – production, processing and retail – by promoting full use of the milk package, for example through exchange of best practices, including on unfair trading practices, as well as by thoroughly reporting on all aspects of the milk package already in 2016 and through a new dedicated High-Level Group that will look at specific measures such as risk hedging instruments for agricultural products and credit for farmers The package will also respond to societal challenges, like completing our work on the School Milk Scheme programme and the additional funding for refugees. These measures are taken in addition to the EUR 820 million that is being allocated in Member States – 17 Member States in all – through Voluntary Coupled Support for the dairy sector. I am confident that the necessary resources to cover all measures are available to ensure that it is an effective response, which will deliver on its objectives. The allocation of EUR 420 million in Member State envelopes has generated some inevitable reaction, but I want to emphasise that the distribution key that was used ensures that the envelopes are fair, and in a spirit of solidarity it provides a top-up for those Member States that are most greatly affected by the negative circumstances, including the fall in pigmeat prices, the summer drought and the ongoing impact of the Russian ban.  Last week, President Juncker said that without farmers Europe would not survive, and he gave a commitment that he would not leave farmers out in the cold. The Commission’s package delivers on that commitment. It is a robust and decisive response.  I want to emphasise the imperative need for rapid action and appeal to Members for assistance in ensuring that this package is delivered quickly for the benefit of our farmers. The Commission is already publishing the draft legal instruments, the delegated and implementing acts, and I encourage them to support these measures, particularly in relation to targeted aid, to ensure that the available funding can be provided quickly to those who need it. I do not believe that farmers should be left waiting for the urgent help that they need and which we can supply today, and I ask the House to support me in this approach.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 238, "date": "2015-09-16.json", "name": "Albert Deß", "mepid": "28228", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner Phil Hogan, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his excellent work and for the work she has done. Many thanks to all those involved who have made it possible for today's debate on the current situation of agriculture in the European Union to take place. On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we have written to you, Commissioner, about the difficult situation in the field of milk, as well as in the case of pigmeat, fruit and vegetables. I am grateful to Mrs Esther Herranz Garcia for the initiative she took during the summer recess. One of the reasons for the market situation, as you mentioned, is the Russian embargo imposed on EU agricultural products. The Baltic, Finnish and Polish farmers were immediately and most affected. Very quickly, however, it has had an impact on the whole of European agriculture. Falling demand from China and drought in certain areas exacerbate the situation. That is why the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has written that the Commission should react and take appropriate market action. A specific demand is that the EUR 900 million from the sub-levy be used for market measures in the agricultural sector and, as a matter of priority, to stabilise the milk market. On the subject of the intervention prize, there are different opinions in my group and even in my party. Personally, I think very little of this and I am grateful to you, Commissioner, for agreeing with it. A system in which the Commission can withdraw ad hoc quantities from the market at a certain price would be more effective. It would be an efficient instrument for unsettling the retail chains and thereby limiting market power. For example, if a large retail chain tries to reduce the price of butter by 80 cents per kilo, and the Commission decides overnight to withdraw 50 000 tonnes of butter from the market, the price reduction is likely to be in the sand. We must respond to the new challenges with new instruments. With the intervention instrument of the last century, we cannot cope with the current situation. Thank you, Commissioner, for your reaction. I hope that further measures will follow.

A first response to farmers who are facing deep crises, not least because of the Russian embargo, not only in the milk sector, but also, for example, in the pigmeat sector and in the fruit and vegetable sector.  Among the measures proposed, we welcome the increase in the promotion budget to help our producers find new markets, while we see that as far as private cheese storage is concerned, it would be more logical and rational to distribute resources between countries according to production, only of hard cheeses, because they are the only ones interested in this measure.

The problem arises with that amount of money when it gets down to individual Member States, and then when it gets down to the regions of those Member States, and indeed when it gets to those regions and to particular farms in those Member States. That is the point at which farmers are facing pain.  In my own constituency of Northern Ireland, we have an exacerbated situation because of the weakness of the euro against the pound sterling and the lack of any move on the intervention price. I fear that by refusing to review the price of intervention, the measures rolled out by the Commission could prove insufficient. How many of our farmers will be out of business, and how long will it be before these long-term measures take effect?  There are a number of areas I would like you, Commissioner, to maybe elaborate on. Is there any role for money from the super levy? Is that part of this package? Is it coming in to pay for the package? On aid to private storage, how long do you estimate it will take from withdrawal of the product before it has an impact on the market? Can I say I also welcome the new PSA scheme for cheese, and that unused allocations can be redistributed within three months. It may not be possible, but why not make that two months and make it even speedier? State aid, in my opinion, is something of a misnomer and I fear that all it will do is uneven the playing field – bad enough as it is at the moment within agriculture – and bring more inefficiency into the sector. Advance payments can be a poisoned chalice. What happens if the inspections are inadequate? Will they be given a bye ball? The payment agencies need to know. In Europe, too often the attitude is ‘if in doubt appoint a high-level group’, but again, whatever the merits of the long-term solution, it is a long-term solution like the MMO and other ideas, when what we have is a short-term problem.  Can I finish by commending the Commission proposal on the EUR 30 million which will be used to take advantage of displaced refugees in European countries neighbouring war zones.

In response, some Member States immediately choose to go back to the past by demanding market intervention. I am pleased that the Commissioner has kept his back straight and has not immediately referred the market-oriented agricultural policy to the bin by, for example, raising the intervention price. However, the Commission has one leg in the past and the other in the future. More Brussels support is not a structural solution, but a wipe against bleeding. Farmers need a better competitive position and the space to do business, innovate and compete on the world market. You can achieve this through fewer rules, simple rules and a level playing field, also with third countries. The best solution is therefore free of charge: to simplify agricultural policy. It doesn't cost anything. I therefore think it is a missed opportunity that the European Commission has not taken up this gauntlet. In addition, the nitrate directive must also keep up with its time. Farmers need to dispose of manure while supplying fertilizer, while there are innovations that allow farmers to turn animal manure into high-quality fertilizer substitutes. However, now that the Commission has opted for a support package, it is important that the Commission maintains a level playing field. The preconditions of the aid package are too unclear. I am opposed to the aid package being used as direct income support in some Member States. This leads to unfair competition. The Commission must stand its ground, maintain a level playing field and prevent additional national contributions from being added to the aid package.

It was an opportunity to show that this Commission is capable of proposing measures that would make a real difference to farmers, not just during this period, but measures that would actually tackle the huge price volatility that is fast becoming the hallmark of European agriculture. Commissioner, this package represents an opportunity wasted: a one-off aid package that represents, for instance, EUR 13.7 million for Ireland, most of which, if you remember, will actually come from fines imposed on farmers in the first place; advance payments of monies that farmers were already entitled to; limited state aid measures. None of this represents solidarity or the radical action that was required not just to resolve this crisis, but to provide the certainty that is necessary for farmers to manage their livelihoods into the future.

I would like to tear up your speech though, if I could read it, José. All actions have consequences, and if you encourage people to have hopes that cannot be fulfilled then you will invite resentment and hostility. The European Union does this all the time. The EU unsettled the citizens of Ukraine and Russia retaliated with a ban on Western food imports. Who pays the price for this? Not the well-paid EU officials but farmers across Europe, who have lost a significant market, have found themselves in a situation of oversupply, and experience the inevitable crash in income. For – make no mistake – as Russia bulldozes illegal ham and cheese into the ground, the EU must appreciate that this is the consequence of its own actions. Severe punishment, of course, will be meted out by the Russians to those of its own citizens who facilitated the sanctions-busting – and God knows what they are going through at the moment – but again the EU officials will not feel the pain. The recently announced rescue package to agriculture to compensate farmers for their losses will do no such thing.  There is one glaring contradiction in the proposals. The Commission has promised farmers access to financial and risk-hedging instruments as part of the package. Farmers have always had these in the form of futures markets. However, the EU is, at this very minute, making participation in futures markets much more difficult in its MiFID II legislation. I have to say to you José – and Martin Häusling over there – that you have campaigned in the last six years for the abolition of futures markets in agriculture, and yet these help us enormously. Exemptions for farmers are essential if the tools are to benefit at all. So please do not promise what you cannot deliver. The EU has long pursued a policy of market intervention, generating hopes and expectations, which it can no longer afford. Responsible supply chain management is now required, and not handouts.  The failure to understand basic economics leads me to the new face in British politics. Until this month, Jeremy Corbyn made Herman Van Rompuy look high profile. And what is Mr Corbyn’s first action on food and farming? Well, he appoints a vegan – that is somebody who does not eat meat, milk or eggs – as the spokesman. I very much hope that the new Labour spokesman, Kerry McCarthy, comes to Brussels to brief Paolo de Castro and the Socialist comrades into her way of thinking. I would love to be a fly on the wall in that conversation. I hope the EU’s protesting farmers will, in turn, let her know theirs.

It's a tough time for us, for everyone who works in agriculture. I think we are all sorry about the crisis we are in now, and at the last show of farmers in Brussels a strong signal has been given that this situation must stop. In several new halves, MEPs, we have asked the European Commission to take into account the new situation in the milk sector, following the end of the quotas. It has been five months and we are still talking about the negative impact that the embargo has on Russia. Before the Commission, in Brussels, German, French, Belgian farmers, favoured by the nearby court, were able to participate and demonstrate against the crisis situation that the milk sector is going through, as well as that of pig and beef and cereals, due to the drought.  Not all European farmers were able to do this. From Romania only a few representatives could be present but, under no circumstances, could they bring a tractor, they could not afford it. So even publicly expressing his opinion has started to become a luxury. You have to be financially in, but that's not what this is about. Although this also influences the situation the imbalance between European countries in the agricultural field. We are all in crisis, but now I ask you one thing: let us not support differentiated, depending on the power of manifestation. If we have a common market, let it be common. In conclusion, I ask for your support in finding sales outside the Community, otherwise we will kill each other in an oversaturated market of products. I want to go to the supermarket and buy milk from local production. If we have extra milk, let's find a third-party market. We need to adopt those regulations so that hypermarkets reduce margins and taxes. During the last strike by farmers in Brussels in front of Parliament, young farmers informed citizens about the situation in the milk sector and give you a simple example: the cost of production 0.40 cent per litre, the price per farmer 0.25, and in the supermarket, for citizens, 0.50.

At the same time, excessive sanctions against Russia hinder any export activity. This situation is expected to deteriorate even further if and when TTIP is signed.

It is difficult for all farmers, yet this crisis is felt far more strongly in new Member States where a farmer must give 3 l of milk for 1 l of water.

In addition, Croatian farmers pay up to 5 times more interest on loans than their Western European counterparts and are in a state of debt bondage.

A significant minority – maybe even a majority – of EU customers want to help our EU farmers. This could be achieved if we had an independent fair price certification scheme, similar to the existing Fairtrade mark which guarantees a fair price is being paid to the farmer in the developing world. Such a scheme would enable the customer to easily identify our farmers’ products, even if this means paying an additional, slightly higher, price. Many will do so.

Commissioner, milk production in the Azores is a structural pillar of our economy because because of our natural constraints we have no alternatives.

By 'we' I mean not only the Commission and the Members, by which I also mean farmers and dairies.  Our intervention mechanisms are too slow, cumbersome and planned. Dairies must be able to store milk powder and butter on their own. And we also need to bring more market economy into pricing.

First of all, can I acknowledge to everybody in the House that there are difficulties and I have said that all along, contrary to what my good friend from Ireland stated earlier. I said there were going to be challenges, there were going be difficulties and volatility in 2015, and there is. All of you have demonstrated in your contributions this evening the empathy that you are showing to your sector. That is why the agricultural sector is receiving a package of EUR 500 million.  We do not have an unlimited budget as this House, and indeed the Council will verify, but we have some resources and I have put a package together of EUR 500 million in response to the concerns that have been expressed, not because there was a protest in Brussels but because you have been saying it for a number of months, and indeed in the Nicholson report in that debate in July we clearly signalled that the challenges ahead may require a multi-faceted response, and that is what this package is about.  Number one, I would like to remind people – and particularly my good friend from Galicia, when he talked about the banks getting EUR 40 billion of a bailout – that we give farmers EUR 40 billion a year per annum in direct payments, which is 42% of all the income of many of our farmers in the European Union, so we should not allow that to go unnoticed: that we do make a major contribution to the income of keeping as many farmers as possible in rural areas, by providing the value added in terms of employment to the 46 million people that are employed in the food sector, and providing good quality food for our consumers, as Mr Brannen, my colleague from the UK, rightly pointed out. There are four major areas that this package is going to be targeted at. Number one, there is an immediate cash flow problem for farmers. We have responded to that by relaxing the controls, and I hope that the members of Committee on Budgets who are here tonight will be able to understand that in two years’ time, when we come to scrutinise the performance of the department of DG AGRI and myself in relation to budget controls: that this is an exceptional situation which required an exceptional response in relation to relaxing some of the controls, to allow Member States to be able to pay money up to 70% in the case of direct payments, and up to 85% in rural development monies. Because to help cash flow, farmers need money now. They do not need a response that is going to take months and months. These measures that we are speaking about can be put in place with your help and support in five weeks. It is a matter for the Member States to be able to pay out that money as quickly as they possibly can.  Secondly, in relation to cash flow, there is a figure of EUR 420 million in terms of targeted aid. The criterion we used for that was the milk deliveries in the last milk year. We responded to the pigmeat crisis as well in terms of the fall in prices. We responded to the lower price in many countries, particularly in the eastern part of our European Union and Belgium, where we had a considerable reduction in the milk price, below the European average. We included for the first time, I would say to my Polish colleague, drought as a criteria. I am the first Commissioner to actually give money to Poland or anywhere else for drought, and it is probably a precedent that may come back to haunt me in the future. It is not a large amount of money, but it is certainly a clear indication of the difficulties faced by farmers who have been afflicted by drought, and it contributed to the envelope that Poland received in respect of that matter.  The second set of measures, then, are market measures. I could have decided to go down and agree with the temporary intervention price and an increase in the reference price. That would take, in the legislative process, about 18 months, so that is kicking the can down the road. If that is what you wanted to do I certainly was not prepared to do that. We needed immediate measures, and the private storage aid measures under Article 219 is what I invoked, where I developed a new scheme that was much more flexible and 100% financed from the European taxpayer.  This is going to be broadened to include skimmed milk powder and cheese and we are putting Member State quotas in place because we learned from the last experience that a few Member States could gobble up the entire quota. We are giving an initial quota to every Member State, but then allowing Member States to come back in after three months if they require more quotas. I think that is a fair distribution and a fair way of giving every Member State an opportunity in the first instance under this PSA scheme.  Could I say to the people who are saying that the market orientation is wrong that if I heard a lot of speakers tonight after the reduction in the Fonterra Global Dairy Auctions, I am sure over the summer months I would hear a lot of people saying that our market orientation is in trouble, but over the last four weeks there have been three auctions. The first one in August was 14.9% of an increase in prices, two weeks later 10.9% of an increase, and yesterday 16.8% of an increase in global dairy prices. So that hopefully will, in the true traditions of the marketplace, be able to feed itself in to higher prices – albeit there is a lag time before getting that to the farmer. But I think it is positive in terms of the market sentiment that this will create, and hopefully that will feed itself into farmers’ pockets.  In relation to the food chain, can I say to my colleague Mr Flanagan that I know he does not know a lot about hurling in Roscommon, and I would not expect him to, but coming from a county that knows the score a little, I hope you do not end up as a hurler in the ditch in this food chain issue because we are going to make, I think, major strides in this area in terms of engagement with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI Committee) and the Council. The President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, in the State of the Union speech, said quite explicitly in his speech that there is a problem in relation to the food chain, and that is a recognition about what everybody has been saying here, about the fact that the producer is not getting a fair crack, to put it that way, in relation to the outcome of the particular transactions in agriculture.  I gave a commitment at my hearings, and indeed since, that I will promote, with other Commissioners the opportunity, legislative or otherwise, to ensure that we are actually going to redress the balance in favour of the producer in the context of the actors in the food chain. I know that Ms McGuinness is preparing a report for the AGRI Committee and that my colleagues Commissioner Bieńkowska and Commissioner Vestager are certainly more engaged than ever before with me in relation to seeing what we can do in order to improve matters in the food chain.  So the experience in Spain and the experience in the UK are models we can look at and see how best practice there can be implemented, perhaps, on a European-wide basis. If it is working well in a Member State, then let us see what is the best value we can get out of an evaluation of those particular schemes to see what can be done to replicate them around the European Union.  The fourth aspect is a societal response. At a time when we have huge demands on financial resources in the European Union, with the biggest crisis in the European Union for decades in terms of migration and refugees, we are responding with product, through charities and existing structures in the World Food Programme, and in various other ways through DG ECHO in order to respond to that. EUR 30 million is a modest amount of money, but it is certainly a contribution that we are making and we may be expected to make more in the future in order to deal with this particularly appalling humanitarian situation.  On the School Milk Scheme – with which Mr Tarabella has been quite extensively involved – and on how we can broaden the scope of that scheme, we are certainly ready to assist in completing that work as soon as we possibly can, with additional finance if necessary as well, as mentioned, the value of EUR 20 million. Targeted aid, may I say to those Members who mentioned it, can be used with a maximum flexibility. Member States can use this particular envelope for whatever they effectively wish in order to ensure that farmers are certainly getting the benefit, and also they can use it for structural reforms. Madam Herranz García from Spain mentioned, as well as others, that there is no point in throwing money at a problem now, and then hoping that we will have no problems in 2016. We need to use some of this money in a targeted and focused way to reform the sectors, to reform many of the structures that badly need reform, including more producer organisations and a more flexible approach in relation to that to get people more organised in collective bargaining. Agriculture is a cyclical business, it is unpredictable, and this is its hallmark for people involved in that business, and we will certainly have to be flexible and nimble in order to deal with it.  I do not subscribe to the notion that we have to invoke the Crisis Reserve at the moment. Farmers are getting lower prices and why would people be advocating that they should take a reduction in their direct payments as well at a time when they need a cash flow increase rather than a reduction in payments? I cannot understand that logic at the moment and why we would deal with it in that way.  The co-legislators decided in 2013 that we were adopting a reform that was going to be market orientated, and I am doing whatever I can through the various mechanisms that I have at my disposal to implement that particular policy faithfully. I am implementing what you required, and I can say to the French delegation that the quotas are gone; supply management issues are gone. That is what was decided some time ago and we are going to respect that, but we have tools at our disposal that we are using – some I have already explained – but in my view the French situation is considerably exacerbated by the problems in the food chain. There is a reasonable price being able to be received for milk, but it is not getting to the farmer. It is getting to everybody else in the food chain but not enough is going to the farmer. Maybe there are national as well as European responsibilities that we can collectively look at to try and help the French – and the UK situation is no different – so that we can get a reasonable return for the producer. As I have said many times, if we do not have a producer, then we will not have a product and we will not have product for employment as well as for the benefit of the consumer. In relation to the Azores, I think Madam Ribeiro knows my views very well. EUR 4.8 million has been allocated in a targeted aid package to the Minister for Agriculture in Portugal. It is a matter for the Member State government to decide how that is going to be allocated. So your job is to ensure that the Azores, as well as the regional government of Azores, get a fair proportion of that particular assistance that is now available to Portugal, because the maximum flexibility in the distribution of that is a matter for the Member States.  Can I say in relation to Galicia, and many people have mentioned Galicia, that it has a very serious problem in relation to its dairy sector but I know that Minister Tejerina has implemented a proposal in recent times of EUR 300 per cow in order to assist income and resolve the short-term difficulties – hopefully they are short-term – in relation to the dairy farmers in Galicia. That is a meaningful response and I congratulate her on doing so. Can I thank everybody for their contributions. I acknowledge that we have challenges. I acknowledge as well that we will continue to monitor the situation very carefully for the future, but I am also saying that we made a meaningful response of EUR 500 million in very challenging financial circumstances for the European Union. I am glad that we were able to secure that with the help of President Juncker and I hope that Member States will spend it well on behalf of the farming community.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 298, "date": "2015-09-16.json", "name": "Fernand Etgen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  President-in-Office of the Council.

The Presidency has taken the situation seriously and, as of 24 July, we have convened an extraordinary meeting of agriculture ministers for 7 September. We discussed again the package of measures presented by the Commission at our informal meeting in Luxembourg yesterday. First of all, I note that, in your speeches, some questions and suggestions overlap broadly with those of the Council. I encourage the Commission to pay attention to this. Despite differences of opinion on some issues, it is now up to our two institutions to contribute to the finalisation of this first package of measures as quickly as possible, and in the first place on three points. Firstly, as part of the ongoing budget negotiations for the 2016 budget, as soon as the Commission has sent us the letter amending the budget so that funding is available. Secondly, as part of our respective procedures for reviewing delegated acts corresponding to certain measures. Finally, by proceeding quickly with negotiations on mechanisms to assist in the distribution of fruits and vegetables and milk in schools. This is only the first step. It must be deepened and, without questioning the market orientation of the CAP, to continue the effort of solidarity with the actors of the agricultural world. The Commissioner answered a number of questions and comments. So I'm going to limit myself to a few considerations on a number of points. In response to Jan Huitema, as I already pointed out in my initial speech, a well-conducted simplification programme can lead to a reduction in costs for farmers, at no additional cost to the EU budget. As some of you have also pointed out, this package of measures must be put into perspective and the amount must be assessed in the context of the other challenges that President Juncker mentioned before you in his State of the Union address. Finally, I would like to point out that many measures such as improving the transparency and fairness of the food chain can also contribute to the sustainability of the sector without having a direct budgetary cost. Several speakers talked about a possible increase in the intervention price. My first point is that given the differences in production costs between Member States, or even between regions, it is difficult to define an effective price level. My second point is that any change in intervention prices requires a proposal from the Commission in one form or another. At this stage, although calls have been made for an increase in the intervention price for milk, this interest is far from unanimous. On the other hand, I note that the Commission considers that this is not an appropriate response and that there are other instruments to respond to the market situation. In conclusion, I can assure you that the Council intends to carry out an initial assessment of the deployment of the measures at the November Council and that we will carry out a rigorous evaluation of the effectiveness of this package in the coming months.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 299, "date": "2015-09-16.json", "name": "Przewodniczący. –", "mepid": "28372", "text": "   I close the debate.

Livestock farming and the resources used for milk production are very vulnerable and, as a result, buying-in prices are lower than production costs. As the safeguard mechanism in place in the European Union has failed as a sufficient rescue in the event of a fall in milk prices, on 7 September 2015 there were mass protests in Brussels organised by the European Milk Council and copa-COGECA. The campaigns required fair prices for agricultural production, with particular attention to the milk, fruit and vegetables and meat sectors. The agricultural sector has been the hardest hit by political events, but there is also a surplus of production in the dairy sector, which is leading to falling prices. The European Commission is proposing a support package to address farmers' disadvantages. Farmers must be guaranteed the movement of cash flows, as well as targeted support to the dairy sector, especially in those countries where the crisis has hit hardest. It is essential to maintain demand promotion and supply reduction. To this end, it is proposed to extend the current private storage scheme and the period of public interventions. It also promotes the strengthening of supply chains. It is proposed to set up a high-level expert working group to engage in credit for farmers and mechanisms for reducing financial risks.

As if that is not enough, some countries such as Denmark are adding a decisive crack at implementing EU rules in this area considerably more stringently than their neighbouring countries.  The agricultural crisis is also very much a crisis for the outlying regions of Europe, where agriculture is a very important profession in terms of jobs, economy and culture.

I thank the European Commission, and in particular you, for delivering EUR 420 million in emergency aid to EU dairy farmers and pig farmers. However, this is only enough to relieve the fire, not to put it out. It is not yet seen when the fall in producer prices will end. The two effective instruments that can now be deployed alone are the increase in the intervention price for skimmed-milk powder, butter and pigmeat, at least temporarily, and the temporary activation of export subsidies.  In my opinion, you are right that regular increases in intervention prices in the dairy sector would send the wrong message to farmers who are already overprot producing milk. They would further increase their production, thus creating really butter mountains and milktavas. However, the problem is so great that it is only by using the above tools that the above tools can be meaningfully helped. The artificial increase in the price of raw milk would be compensated in the medium term by the slow growth of demand on the world market, in particular in the Middle and Far East.

At particular disadvantage are small farmers who make up the majority of agricultural producers in Croatia, the smallest Member State, who find adapting to the new regulations more difficult. For example, the production of most major types of fruits and vegetables in Croatia decreased in the last year. Dairy farmers are particularly affected by the abolition of quotas.

There is a need not only to develop emergency solutions, but also and above all to put in place a long-term sustainable migration policy, including a permanent relocation mechanism to be activated in the event of an emergency.  Other objectives that are all challenges presented in this resolution are the mobility of workers that the Commission must present before the end of the year, a European definition of tax havens based on OECD criteria, an ambitious climate and energy framework for 2030 and, of course, the aid to farmers through new market instruments to anticipate and absorb market shocks.

A very serious problem arises, however, when the measures contemplated go beyond the stated objective and prepare the ground for tax harmonisation. This goes against the interest of peripheral regions and islands having limited endowments. When adopting European regulations they have, among others, removed protective trade barriers, adopted consumption taxes that follow continental models, phased out state aid, adopted stringent budgetary rules and abandoned exchange rate autonomy. This has severely curtailed their competitiveness. The only element that remains for them to safeguard this is fair tax competition. The resolution on the Commission Work Programme for 2016 endorses a mandatory common consolidated tax base.
