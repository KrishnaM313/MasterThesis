It is true that the ECB is an independent institution which, within its mandate, is implementing the target of achieving inflation close to 2%, but it is true that, in recent times, we are having severe problems in placing target inflation on that long-term benchmark. Still a few days ago we knew last month's data that reflected an additional reduction in inflation, up to 1.3%, and it is true that the forecasts place that 2% well into 2019. In turn, according to growth data, it is true that the euro area is recovering capacity, but we have an excess of potential ahead, an excess of sufficient growth capacity: the Monetary Fund, the European Commission itself collect in their output gap estimates a very wide space to continue to grow without tension inflationary. Therefore, this House, in that report, respecting — as I say — the clear independence of the ECB, I think it places where the debate should be in order to guide that work over the next year too. As I was saying, it is true that the euro area is growing better, but monetary policy is not enough: we need a proper fiscal policy, which will allow the diversification of the positions of each of the governments in the economic cycle in order to provide the euro area as a whole with a consistent fiscal policy. It is true that we also need reforms that activate, improve productivity throughout the Union: reforms that are socially responsible, socially policies with a future. But the report also points to the need to consolidate the internal market. We need to improve the consolidation of the Capital Markets Union — which is being promoted by the Commission with the support of this Parliament — and we also need to consolidate the Banking Union. It is an agenda for reforms, some already legislative proposals, which are on the table of the European Parliament, which need the support and debate of all our colleagues. We therefore call for an accommodative monetary policy in the good sense, in the right direction, reforms that are still pending. Moreover, the report contains, of course, some side effects of that monetary policy, and it therefore calls on the ECB to also monitor them on a timely basis. I am referring to the problems of redistribution of income and wealth; I am referring to the problems of financial stability to maintain a flat rate curve for a long time; I am also referring to the control and monitoring of potential bubbles that may be being identified in some segments financial markets and real estate markets. And we therefore call on the ECB to monitor these side effects of its own monetary policy. But the report clearly points to new transparency instruments, the need for the CSPP to have clear eligibility criteria to avoid problems of discrimination between large and small businesses. We need to improve the implementation of the Commonwealth, to give it credibility and robustness throughout the euro area, and we need to improve the monetary dialogue, the control that this House exercises over the work of the European Central Bank — which is an institution, as the report recognizes, which is also bound by the Paris Agreement, which has signed the as a whole of the European Union.

Today’s debate represents a good opportunity to take stock of progress made and discuss the way forward. A decade ago, the global financial crisis was starting. Today, while further efforts are needed to overcome its legacy, the euro area economy is expanding and employment is rising. Your draft resolution points out that monetary policy has played a key role in this recovery process. The ECB has indeed acted decisively, in line with its mandate. We have addressed financial fragmentation and supported the economy, enabling inflation gradually to converge towards our objective. The draft resolution also notes that the independence of the ECB has allowed us to take resolute action within our mandate. But independence is just one of the cornerstones of our institutional framework. Accountability is its necessary counterpart. And you, as the representatives of the people of the European Union, are the heart of our accountability. Together, independence and accountability underpin our effectiveness and our legitimacy. In my remarks today, I will focus on two particular issues that have been raised in the draft resolution. First, I will elaborate on economic developments in the euro area and the role of the ECB’s monetary policy. Second, I will discuss the state of the financial sector and the measures needed to further strengthen its resilience. The euro area economy is expanding robustly, with growth rates stronger than previously expected and significantly above potential. According to preliminary data, euro area real GDP increased by 2.5% in 2017, compared to the 1.7% that had been foreseen in our December 2016 staff projections for the same year. The economic expansion is broad-based. The dispersion of growth rates across countries and across sectors is at its lowest level in 20 years. Accordingly, we see positive growth in over 85% of the sectors in the euro area economy, compared with a historical average of 75%. Employment growth has recently strengthened, as well, in all the main sectors, namely industry, construction and market services. These developments bode well for economic growth, as expansions tend to be stronger and more resilient when growth is broad-based. The number of people employed in the euro area has also increased by around 7.5 million, since hitting a low in mid-2013. Employment has now reached its highest level since the introduction of the euro. The unemployment rate continues to decline and now stands at close to a nine-year low of 8.7%, down by 3.3 percentage points from its highest level. As more people find jobs, household incomes rise. This has helped to strengthen private consumption growth, which in turn is boosting business investment. In addition, a number of other factors have supported investment. These include higher demand for euro area exports, rising corporate profitability and an increasing use of installed productive capacity. These positive developments have been fostered and reinforced by the pass-through of the ECB’s monetary policy measures, which have eased funding conditions for households and firms. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular have benefited from our policy measures. The growing inclusiveness of this economic expansion is partly due to the renewed vigour of small businesses, which are a key engine of income creation in our economy. While our confidence that inflation will converge towards our aim of below, but close to, 2% has strengthened, we cannot yet declare victory on this front. After increasing to 2% in early 2017 due to a rise in energy prices, headline inflation has fluctuated since May last year between 1.3% and 1.5%. Measures of underlying inflation, which exclude the most volatile components, remained subdued and have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. Also, new headwinds have arisen from the recent volatility in the exchange rate, whose implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability require close monitoring. On the back of improved economic conditions, the financial stability situation in the euro area has also continued to evolve positively. As I will explain in more detail, for the time being we have little indication that generalised imbalances are emerging. Overall, while we can be more confident about the path of inflation, patience and persistence with regard to monetary policy are still warranted for underlying inflation pressures to build up and inflation to converge durably towards our objective. That is why – at our last meeting – we reaffirmed the decisions taken at our October monetary policy meeting last year. Accordingly, our net asset purchase programme, running at a monthly pace of EUR 30 billion, will continue until September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.  In parallel, we will reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time after the end of those purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary. We expect our key interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. Looking forward, we remain fully committed to our price stability objective and – in line with our monetary policy strategy – we aim to stabilise inflation around levels that are below, but close to, 2% within a meaningful medium-term horizon.  As always, our monetary policy will continue to be guided by our assessment of the progress made towards our objective. Our forward guidance continues to provide a stable framework for our monetary policy stance and its outlook. In line with that guidance, monetary policy will evolve in a fully data-dependent and time-consistent manner. Let me also say a few words about the financial sector. Your draft resolution also considers several aspects related to the euro financial sector and I would like to follow up on some of them. Let me first of all emphasise that our monetary policy and a healthier financial sector are mutually reinforcing. By supporting the economic recovery, our monetary policy measures have had a positive impact on the credit quality of banks’ loans to businesses and households, and have helped banks further to reduce their provisioning costs. Moreover, a stronger economy generates greater volumes of sustainable bank lending. Both factors have therefore strengthened the solidity of the European banking sector. A better integrated and sounder financial sector has also been able to transmit our policy impulses more evenly across the euro area. The improved health of the banking sector, coupled with our credit easing measures, has brought about a marked improvement in the transmission process, as shown by the reduced heterogeneity of bank lending rates across countries, and by the improved borrowing conditions for SMEs. A more robust financial sector has also allowed us to pursue an accommodative policy for as long as necessary, without any build-up of significant financial stability risks. The draft resolution points in particular to the risks stemming from possible asset bubbles. We are closely monitoring developments in some market segments, such as prime commercial real estate and housing markets in some countries, and corporate bond markets for lower-rated issuers. As we explain in our Financial Stability Review, asset price increases in euro area markets have so far not been accompanied by excessive credit growth. Although credit flows have been recovering, growth rates are still far below anything we saw before the crisis, and on the low side of the range of growth rates historically seen during recoveries. So there is no evidence of systemic credit-fuelled bubbles. The efforts we have made in recent years to strengthen prudential regulation and supervision, above all with the establishment of the banking union, have certainly played a role in protecting financial stability. In particular, ECB banking supervision plays a key role in ensuring the safety and soundness of banks. It enhances the banks’ resilience through strengthened prudential regulation. It also fosters cross-border financial integration and provides a level playing field by harmonising supervision across the euro area. Also, on the macro-prudential side, we see national authorities in close cooperation with the ECB being very active in further mitigating the emergence of possible systemic risks, especially in respect of residential real-estate developments. Despite the improved cyclical environment, improved market sentiment and the substantial strengthening of its shock absorption capacity, the European banking sector continues to face structural challenges, as you also state in your resolution. Indeed, overcapacity and cost inefficiencies continue to weigh on bank profitability in certain banking markets. Moreover, the high stock of non-performing loans (NPLs) needs to be further reduced and any future build-up needs to be avoided. Non-performing loan levels have been declining for more than three years and good progress has been made on the EU Council Action Plan, although there is still a considerable way to go. Additional efforts by banks, supervisors, regulators and legislators are needed to create an environment in which non-performing loans can be effectively managed and efficiently disposed of. Strengthening the resilience of the euro area financial sector also means adapting to a changing operating environment. The resolution mentions, for instance, the growing role of fintech companies. This means more competition for banks, including in the field of lending and payment services. At the same time, new technology presents an opportunity for banks to increase the value added and the cost-efficiency of their services. Another factor shaping the euro area financial sector is the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union. At this stage, we do not have clarity regarding the shape of the UK’s future relationship with the EU. Well-managed preparations are thus essential for dealing with frictions in the transition from the current situation to the new eventual equilibrium, especially in the event that no transitional agreement is reached between the EU and the United Kingdom. Banks and financial institutions are not the only ones that have to prepare for an operating environment in a state of flux. Policymakers too, at national and European level, have to make sure that the regulatory framework is fit and ready to safeguard the resilience of the financial sector in the face of new challenges. Let me mention two examples. First, finalising the banking reform package is crucial. The package will strengthen the regulatory architecture, reduce risks in the banking sector and increase financial stability. It will introduce into Union law new internationally agreed standards, such as the leverage ratio requirement, which will restrict the build-up of excessive leverage in the banking system, and the standard on total loss-absorbing capacity, otherwise known as TLAC, which will strengthen the resolution framework. As co-legislators, you play a vital role in this process, and I would encourage you to aim for consistent implementation of the internationally agreed standards, so as to ensure a level playing field worldwide and to reduce options and national discretion as much as possible. Second, it is important to complete the architecture of the banking union by putting in place the agreed common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund and by establishing a European deposit insurance scheme (EDIS). These are two fundamental pieces of the banking union project and their implementation should not be postponed. The backstop should ensure that sufficient funding is available at all times to guarantee orderly resolutions. A fully-fledged EDIS is an indispensable counterpart to the single currency as everyone in the euro area should be able to have confidence that the money in their bank account enjoys the same level of protection, regardless of where the account is held within the euro area. Let me conclude. We pay close attention to Parliament’s resolution on our annual report, and we will respond in detail to the issues you raise there when we publish our ECB Annual Report for 2017. The strong relationship between Parliament and the ECB not only demonstrates the importance of accountability, but also bears possible lessons for reflection on the future of Economic and Monetary Union, the strengthening of which should remain a priority. A well-designed and effective policy framework requires clear institutional architecture, measurable objectives and the tools to achieve them – and it needs to be accompanied by strong accountability. This is not only essential to ensure that policies are effective. It is also crucial if the public is to understand those policies and play an active role, in particular via their representatives in Parliament. Thank you for your attention. I am now at your disposal for questions.

It is a pleasure to be here today to discuss this with you and President Draghi. An ex-post debate on the ECB’s activities by the European Parliament is an expression of democratic accountability. So let me start by saying that the Commission largely shares the general thrust of the report prepared by the ECON committee. The Commission shares the report’s views that the ECB’s independence in the conduct of its monetary policy, as enshrined in the Treaty, is crucial to the objective of safeguarding price stability. Accountability and independence are intertwined, and in this report the Commission shares the views that the ECB’s responsibilities and tasks require transparency towards the public at large. The Commission also shares the views of the ECON report that the ECB’s unconventional monetary policy actions, such as forward guidance and quantitative easing, improved the transmission of monetary policy. They also had a positive impact on the overall financing conditions in the euro area and certainly contributed to the start of the ongoing economic upswing. The implementation of the above-mentioned ECB policy measures is expected to keep on gradually improving the financial conditions and contribute to bringing inflation closer to the ECB’s objective of close to but below 2%. We also share the ECON report’s views that a prolonged period of low or even negative interest rates could represent a challenge to the profitability of various actors in the European financial sector. That said, the low interest rates were necessary to support the recovery and had some positive impact in the short term on financing costs and capital gains for banks. These introductory remarks sum up our main points on the report. I am looking forward to a fruitful debate today and I trust that you will confirm the constructive engagement that has developed between the Parliament and the ECB over the years.

As you have said, President Draghi, the euro area recovery continues at a steady pace; unemployment has continued to decline and has reached the lowest level since January 2009; domestic demand has strengthened, and we have seen 18 quarters of consecutive growth. However, the positive economic outlook still has to translate into higher public and private investments and we still have to progress on reaching our inflation objective. We are still concerned about the risks of the persisting low interest rates for the insurance and pension sectors as well as for private savings. This is an important element of the European Parliament’s report with regard to the ECB’s activity for 2016. This is why the ongoing tapering is necessary for the economy to get back on track and to be self-sustaining. Unconventional monetary policy tools have reached their limits. Monetary policy cannot and shall not be the tool to resolve all of the EU’s economic and financial shortcomings. I agree with President Draghi when he says that Member States have to increase their efforts in implementing growth-enhancing structural reforms, while at the same time maintaining sound and responsible budgets to support the economic recovery. Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Jonás Fernández, for his work on this report, and we are sending – with the debate today and with its adoption tomorrow, hopefully with a large majority – a clear signal to the ECB on the Parliament’s position on your activity in the year 2016.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 22, "date": "2018-02-05.json", "name": "Pervenche Berès", "mepid": "1985", "text": " on behalf of the S&D Group. — (FR) Mr President, Mr President of the Central Bank, Mr Vice-President, dear rapporteur, this is an important moment for monetary policy, but also for economic policy that this meeting around the annual report of the Central Bank is an important moment. As you said, Mr President, this time, basically, the economic environment for the European economy is improving, yet monetary policy has yet to help sustain economic activity. From this point of view, our report invites you to contribute to a reflection that we feel is emerging among experts on the reality of inflation, while a new air is blowing. Indeed, your mandate defined around 2% corresponds to a mode of production, a state of globalization which we can see that it may be questioned. It seems to me that the Central Bank has a score to play in this area. Beyond what monetary policy can do independently, it seems to us that the messages you send should be supported when it comes to encouraging the Member States to review their wage policy, to review their structures in the banking sector, and also this issue which has finally been mentioned so much in Davos, which is that of the fight against inequality. Among the new challenges, we see more and more states and banks concerned with the issue of cybersecurity and virtual currencies. Here, too, we expect prospects from the institution you preside over.

Here we are now, three years later, EUR 2 000 billion later, because of your monetary experiment, Mr Draghi, your quantitative easing, an experiment we have never seen on that scale in the European Union before. And finally, for the first time, there are votes to stop that experiment. Its legitimacy is being questioned and the experiment is therefore being put to an end in September. This is very necessary and very important, because if we have too low interest rates for too long, debts are piling up. Public debts and private debts are swinging out, and that cannot continue. These debts are breaking records and the consequences we have seen before in 2008, with the beginning of the financial economic crisis. Those who look closely today will see that there are also fewer rosy figures and elements that we can quote. Your free money policy has ensured that the richest have lived for seven fat years and that the less rich, the middle class, have had to bite the poorer people on their teeth.

At the same time this is probably also a good point to say that the Member States don’t always do what they should to increase the resilience of the system.

There is still an urgent need for deep structural reform of the euro area banking system, as institutions remain too big or too interconnected to fail.

Whether Barnier or Verhofstadt like it or not, the City of London is the banker of Europe, if not the world, and it will remain so after Brexit. By not organising a proper deal, Verhofstadt and Barnier are threatening the stability of the eurozone. As euro fanatics, Barnier and Verhofstadt would rather damage the economic future of the people of Europe than in any way upset the European project, which is their sole objective and fanaticism. Barnier’s job is not to negotiate a deal but to nobble, destroy, damage Britain’s ability to embarrass the European Union by running an effective market—driven economy rather than the European command economy envisioned by the European project which has failed so miserably in eastern Europe over the last 50 years.  Mr Draghi, more than anyone, as an Italian banker, should know the precarious situation many Italian banks are in, and that creating problems in the City of London and making it harder for Italian banks and people round Europe to obtain credit may well damage Italian banks and push them over the edge into bankruptcy, followed by the eurozone. This will hardly help small businesses all over Europe.  Why should Britain care? Well, quite frankly, we don’t want an economic basket case on our frontier. We want to trade with you. We want to do business with you. We want to be friends with you, but we want to retain our own bank accounts and our own economy as we are quite entitled to do.

For the National Front, there are six zones of danger to the world economy, over which the ECB has an influence. First, the volume of private debt in OECD countries is Himalayan. The rise in long-term interest rates will have a catastrophic effect, with chain bankruptcies. Secondly, the risk of financial market collapse, even greater than in 2000 and 2008, will materialize when central banks cease their injections of overliquidity. Thirdly, the out-of-control expansion of shadow banking: the political and financial elite is trying to trick public opinion on the pretext that the banking system would now be safer thanks to the Basel rules, but paradoxically shadow banking, this shadow finance, is at high risk. Managers of assets, hedge funds and insurance companies, in particular, have never been so extreme in their implications. Fourth, CCPs: these clearing chambers of global financial markets are real time bombs. More than ever, they concentrate all market risks and interoperability, i.e. the interconnection of CCPs, multiplies the risk of a domino effect until the collapse of the entire global financial system. Will the ECB stop such contagion by the bankruptcy of a CCP? Fifth danger, the parallel world of block chain, and finally cybersecurity, with terrorist cyber attacks of the system.

And yet the challenges do not fade. Technological developments in the financial markets are currently taking place at a breathtaking pace. In recent weeks, the significant price fluctuations of cryptocurrencies and the accompanying large losses of many investors have reminded us once again that virtual currencies have long ceased to be play money for a few technology enthusiasts. Many financial institutions — including major European banks — are now asking us to act to curb the relatively new virtual currency market with its drastic price fluctuations. First of all, however, it is important to identify the need for regulation without too much limiting the scope for innovation and development in the digital marketplace. Mr Draghi, virtual currencies will also be one of the major challenges of the ECB of the future.

As you said, President Draghi, if the results however are undoubtedly positive, we cannot yet declare victory, and the decision to continue the securities purchase program until September, and besides if necessary, it is therefore fully shareable. Of course, monetary policy alone is not enough to ensure the shift from a cyclical recovery to a structural one.

In 2016, in response to a question from my colleague Mr Bullmann, the ECB stated that it was monitoring the situation. In 2017, I put the same question and got the same reply, namely that you were monitoring the situation. Now it is 2018, do you consider that the situation in Hungary has been remedied or is there evidence of a violation of Article 123? My second question is as follows.

The ECB's Annual Report 2016 identifies four key risks to financial stability in the euro area. These are the increase in global risk premia, the low profitability of banks, the sustainability of sovereign and corporate debt and the liquidity risks in the area of investment funds. Unfortunately, not much has changed in this initial situation for 2018. For example, the 10-year yield of Italian government bonds has risen by 0.7 percentage points to 2% since 2016. The ECB now holds significantly more Italian and French debt instruments than the national central banks' capital key provides. This usually indicates that the yields of these bonds are under high upward pressure. In addition, there are structural problems in the Member States of the euro area. Economic growth and unemployment are uneven, and the inflation rate remains below the targets. Against this background, the ECON Committee adopted an own-initiative report in November last year, which calls for greater transparency and greater accountability to Parliament, that is to say a better monetary policy dialogue.

When one looks back at the last 10 years, significant progress has been made in getting the eurozone economy to a much better place. We look at the job numbers, we look at GDP growth, especially in the last three years, and we look at the emerging investment which is taking place. Getting inflation close to 2% is not just important in terms of reflating the eurozone economy, but it is also important in helping to reduce debt piles, which are very significant in countries that went through a bailout programme such as my own, so I recognise that progress. I also recognise the very significant impact that you have made, President Draghi, in terms of the bond-buying exercise that you directed with the Governing Council, and that sends out a strong message of trying to reflate the economy at a time when we needed funding.

It is very encouraging for our work that you stress how our measures have contributed to the recovery and to financial stability. You noted in the report that the institutional framework enshrined in the Treaties allowed us to take decisive action in line with our price stability mandate, and this has been the objective of our monetary policy throughout. It still is the objective of our monetary policy. In the course of exchanges we are often told that our monetary policy affects one category or another, but our objective is price stability, defined as an inflation rate which is close to, but below, 2% for the whole of the euro area, not necessarily for one specific country. That is how our monetary policy should be judged: whether in the medium term we reach this objective. I would like to thank Commission Vice—President Dombrovskis, and all of you, for this very relevant and useful debate. The debate shows that, while we are now seeing the positive results of our policies, we should not be complacent, but should rather strive for continued improvement. I apologise in advance that, given the short time I have, I cannot comment on each and every statement, but let me touch on some of the issues that you raised. One issue raised by several honourable Members concerns the effects that our monetary policy has on the distribution of income and wealth. So let me say a few words about the effects of quantitative easing (QE). It is quite clear that QE raises asset prices. The holders of assets are generally wealthy institutions or wealthy people, so in the short run you have a worsening of distribution. At the same time, to the extent that QE is successful, it increases employment – as I have said, and I am going to say it again – and it is by far the most powerful measure for decreasing inequality in any economic system. From this viewpoint, even though in the short run one has some negative consequences, in the medium and long term the positive consequences outweigh, very consistently and significantly, any short-term negative concerns. This has been shown, by the way, in several studies. The best way to decrease inequality is to increase employment, and that is what we have done, contributing to increasing employment by 7.5 million jobs over three-and-a-half years. When we look at wage growth – and that is very important for us because it is, in a sense, what tells us whether inflation is moving towards our objective in the medium term – annual growth in terms of compensation per employee increased has gradually from 1.1% in the second quarter of 2016 to 1.7% now. It is still below its historical average, which is 2.1%, so we have to be more patient, but looking at what happens in other jurisdictions – for example the United States which is, by the way, far advanced in the business cycle – we see that wage growth picks up in the end. The recent data in the USA show exactly this. We have to be aware that we have weak productivity growth, ongoing impacts of labour market reforms implemented in some countries during the crisis and certainly a much bigger labour supply coming from stronger migration flows and higher participation rates. Participation rates of women and older people especially have increased considerably. Also, the low-inflation environment that has prevailed for a long time is now influencing current negotiations. And, by the way, one thing that is quite important in explaining this light response by wages is that even though we had a significant increase in employment, when we go and look at the quality of this increase in employment we see a lot of part-time and temporary arrangements. I am listing all these factors, because they are explanations of why the nominal wage-growth response is going to be lower than we had expected. But we know by looking at other jurisdictions which had, by and large, the same problems that, in the end, nominal wages are going to go up, and they are going up, albeit at a subdued rate. As regards the effects of our monetary policy, some speakers questioned the effectiveness of this policy. We have estimated that our measures have made a substantial impact on the economic performance of the euro area. Considering all the measures taken between 2014 (and even before, in 2013) and October 2017, the overall impact on EU area real GDP growth is 1.9%: 1.9 percentage points over three years. One Member pointed out that investment is still low. We are coming from very, very low levels of private investment but, if anything, over the past three or four quarters, private investment has picked up and it is actually increasing at a much more satisfactory rate than in the past. Since the end of May 2014, lending rates for households and non-financial firms have declined significantly. There is one thing I said in the introductory statement which is very important: during the crisis we observed widely differing lending rates by banks in different parts of the euro area, but this difference has now shrunk and rates are very close nowadays, as are growth rates, by the way. One measure we often look at to determine the strength of the growth process and expansion is how different the growth rates are in different parts of the euro area. Well, the degree of difference now is something like we had in 1995—1996. In other words, it is a historical low. All countries nowadays are growing. By the way, some Members questioned the effectiveness of our monetary policy for SMEs but, in fact, the lending conditions for SMEs have improved significantly across all sectors and countries. The gradual recovery in loan growth is continuing. The recovery started about four years ago and then really picked up, and it is continuing, though we are not seeing anything like we had before the crisis. So growth rates in lending are good, but nothing euphoric like we saw before the crisis. One point that was made was that we are focused on buying southern countries’ bonds. That is not true. We do not favour certain countries over others in the implementation of our programme. Our purchases are guided by the ECB’s capital key, which takes into account GDP and population. But if one focuses on purchases at specific points in time, for example on 2017 only, this is bound to yield wrong interpretations. The overall stock of euro system holdings is the relevant metric for any assessment of the programme, and not the recent purchase flows. So, in fact, if you look at the stock, you will see that, as far as German bonds are concerned, we are above the capital key for that country. By and large, one should consider the design of the programme: it is flexible and the distribution of actual purchases on any given day often deviates from the ECB capital key. But just consider: this was in the original design of the programme when we had countries like Greece, whose bonds we did not purchase. Of course, then, we had to deviate from the capital key. Some other observations concerned the side effects of our monetary policy. I just wish to reiterate that our measures are proving effective but, at the same time, we are aware of potential side effects and we have to differentiate between the various ways in which they affect economic actors. For example, for individual savers, an accommodative monetary policy means that they accrue fewer nominal returns on their savings. However, such a policy also supports economic expansion and this bolsters employment, income, returns on investment and tax revenues. It therefore benefits households in their capacity as workers, entrepreneurs, investors, borrowers and taxpayers. There is no one specific country that has benefited most from our monetary policy. Everybody has benefited. Public sectors in all countries saved billions on interest rate payments; private sectors across countries and sectors saved billions on interest rate payments to banks; and purchasers of houses could have access to mortgages with much lower interest rates than at any time in the past. This has not only boosted the construction industry but has also boosted investment for the purchase of houses. So we see benefits accruing right across society and not specifically located in one country. When the monetary policy is successful, both creditors and borrowers benefit from it. Similarly, let me continue now on savers. There are several channels through which our policies affect pension and insurance schemes. Beyond the effect on the liability side, it is important to see what happens on the asset side. Our monetary policy has had a beneficial impact on this side of the equation, as the value of the investment portfolio has increased. But, having said that, I completely agree there is a need to put pension systems on a stable path because the survival of any single country’s pension system cannot be dependent only on the proper configuration of interest rates. It must be actuarially sensible. I have already addressed, in my introductory remarks, the issue of possible asset bubbles currently being formed in the euro area. For the time being, we have little indication that generalised financial imbalances are emerging. There are no signs of general asset-price misalignments in the euro area but some segments do need close monitoring and one of them is the prime commercial real-estate market, where we actually see stretched valuations. Also, in some large cities and in some countries real-estate prices have increased at a faster pace than household incomes. This certainly requires monitoring.  Finally, yields in the euro area corporate bond markets, especially for some of the lower-rated issues, have started to look exceptionally low by historical standards, but what are we going to do? Are we going to change monetary policy because of these side effects which are not, by the way, systemic? No, the answer is to enact macro-prudential policies which are the best tool for tackling these challenges – also given their country-specific and sector-specific remits. In late 2016, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) issued a set of country-specific warnings on medium-term vulnerability in the EU residential real-estate sector.  Now a word about Brexit. We are not party to these negotiations but we are certainly monitoring their evolution and, clearly, I agree that much depends on these negotiations and possible arrangements. Of course we always prepare for any eventuality and, at the same time, we are assessing the direction, the probability and the potential impact of risk, but the bottom line is that either this transition is well managed and there will not be substantial risks, or it is not, and the risks will be there. We are certainly looking at that and we have to be prepared for that. Let me also add that, as far as our role as supervisors is concerned, our good cooperation with the Bank of England is important in coping with the potential risks, and especially the risks of any cliff-edge effects. Certainly, transitional arrangements along the lines of the December European Council guidelines could be useful to smooth out the Brexit process but, as we all know, the materialisation of the transition period is still exposed to political uncertainty, and that will remain for some time to come. On financial supervision, I welcome the review of the European system of financial supervision, including changes to the European supervisory authorities. Some of your comments touched upon the issue of transparency. Here, let me reiterate that we are in complete agreement about the importance of ECB transparency vis-à-vis the European public. We have continuously assessed where we need to further strengthen our transparency framework, and we have demonstrated our commitment, improving our framework as necessary. Just briefly, let me list a few of the actions we have taken. The accounts of Governing Council discussions are now published four weeks after each monetary policymaking meeting. There was none of that a few years ago. Since 2015, the Executive Board members, as well as the Chair of the Supervisory Board, publish their diaries covering professional meetings with external parties. None of that was in place until a few years ago. And in 2016 we decided to disclose the agreement on net financial assets (ANFA). Last year we also published the text of the emergency liquidity assistance agreement. We have announced transparency in relation to our purchase programme, especially transparency on the corporate sector purchase programme. Some of you made reference to the European Ombudsman’s recommendations on the interaction of members of the ECB decision-making bodies, including myself, with the Group of 30 (G30). We have certainly taken note of the Ombudsman’s letter and we will respond in time, but let us remember that the European Ombudsman has already concluded that the ECB must conduct dialogue with market participants and that there is no evidence that the G30 meeting could have directly influenced, or have had an adverse impact on, the ECB’s supervisory tasks. The Ombudsman has also confirmed that the ECB has a robust system of safeguards in place to manage its contacts with the financial sector. Again on transparency, we publish on our website extensive documentation on all these interactions with markets. We disclose agendas and summaries of the discussions, so I can assure you that the ECB is, and remains, committed to reviewing, adjusting and updating our transparency framework. One or two speakers touched on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Let me first say that we are not observing a systemically relevant holding of digital currencies by supervised institutions – by banks, in other words. Actually, the credit institutions established in the European Union are showing a limited appetite for digital currencies like Bitcoin, notwithstanding the high level of public interest. However, recent developments, such as the listing of Bitcoin futures contracts by US exchanges, could lead European banks too to hold positions in Bitcoin, and therefore we will certainly look at that. However, we should understand that Bitcoin and other digital currencies are in the unregulated space and should be regarded as very risky assets. Virtual currencies are subject to high volatility and their prices are entirely speculative. Banks should measure the risk of any holdings of digital currencies in their portfolio accordingly. Right now, digital currencies are not subject to a specific supervisory approach. Work is under way in the Single Supervisory Mechanism to identify potential prudential risks that these digital assets could pose to supervised institutions. There were some other specific points. We are going to consider the possibility of having a Charlemagne commemorative coin. On monetary financing in Hungary, we will assess the existence of monetary financing in our report. As you know, the ECB is accountable to the European Parliament, but members of its Executive Board, myself included, have accepted invitations to discuss our monetary policy generally and broadly in national parliaments, so I would be glad to accept an invitation from the Irish Parliament if I were to receive it. I think I have gone through most of your questions.

These were private tests commissioned by the German car industry, and the Commission condemns them in the strongest possible way. The EU has always been highly committed to animal welfare. The EU legal framework in this regard provides for very strict requirements and barriers and, of course, there is no provision for animal testing in the legal framework for cars. The legal follow-up to this unacceptable case is in the hands of national authorities. We are happy to see that the German Government will urgently investigate the matter. This testing of animals and humans adds a new and, I have to say, a much sadder dimension to what we saw during the ‘dieselgate’ scandal. It was just two-and-a-half years ago that we found out that car manufacturers had cheated in emissions tests. Then we read in the press just last year that private emissions tests had been conducted on animals in the USA and on humans in Germany. When I first heard it, I frankly couldn’t believe it. I thought it was just a very unfunny joke. But I have to say, again very personally, that this is the second time the car sector has shown that it is completely untrustworthy. One has to question the ethical behaviour of the German car industry. Is this really, yet again, just an incidence of misbehaviour by a few individuals in a company? I have to say, frankly, I doubt that. There is a systemic problem in this industry. The industry promised us – during our investigation into the emissions scandal – a cultural change: that it would be transparent and would investigate. Yet, once again, we find out about this situation via the media. We should again, and say very strongly, that we must not accept breaking the law, and equally we must not accept the breach of ethical standards. I have repeatedly asked for full transparency in the wake of ‘dieselgate’. Unfortunately I have had to hear, at very regular intervals, that yet another car manufacturer is being investigated for cheating, or that another car recall is being commissioned. At the moment the tools available to us to remedy this situation are still limited. The Commission has launched infringement procedures against some EU Member States. I have also repeatedly asked – and I am repeatedly asking in writing and via Ministers in the Council – for Member States to cooperate fully and inform us fully about the state of play in the investigations and about the remedial action they are taking. I am afraid to say that their willingness to do so has been at best very limited. In the Commission we work very hard, hand in hand, on air quality and our citizens’ health, so I want to say first that I fully support Commissioner Vella in his most recent efforts to accelerate compliance with long-overdue emissions limits. From my side, and with the strong support of the European Parliament – for which I thank you very much – we have put a legal framework in place that would largely prevent future emissions cheating. This should assure consumers and should make the car industry more competitive, as I have repeated many times. However, more ethical behaviour by the car industry now has to follow. This is a must because, as the unacceptable behaviour reported last week shows, changing the legislation alone will not be sufficient: the car industry needs to assume full responsibility for its behaviour. European industry must mean quality – on different levels, including quality in terms of ethics. In this context I will ask Member States to verify the information about testing on humans and animals, to establish whether this situation was occurring in Europe. We know about the testing on humans, but we don’t know whether animal testing has been occurring. And we owe it to our citizens to investigate.

I do not think that animal testing has been done here at all acceptable, as well as the healthy volunteers — I do not know what the point should be. That is why I agree with the view that this was completely unacceptable and that we need to criticise this clearly.

But Mr Liese was right to say that we also have to think about the causes. I can think of a company that keeps getting out: Volkswagen. We'll have to talk about this for a moment today. I remember very well that a few years ago, the Volkswagen Board of Management hired an employee of General Motors to get to the secrets of General Motors. He was severely punished for this. As Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen, Gerhard Schröder has appointed an IG-Metall member and appointed Board of Management. This IG Metal member then systematically fixed works councils, paid them the prostitutes and eventually even hired the mistress of one of these works councils. A few weeks ago it emerged that Volkswagen's works council received an extremely high salary, which nurtured the suspicion that this could be fraud. In the meantime, his salary has been cut back. Then came Diesel Gate — it was pointed out — and finally now this monkey theatre. You have to be ashamed. What is one of the reasons for Volkswagen? Whenever politics and business are together, they bounk, something like this comes out. It begins again and again with bailling, then there is corruption and finally the neglect of morals. It's time for Volkswagen to clean up. The first thing that needs to happen is that the company must be privatised for once again.

The complacency or even complicity of those who knew that the tests carried out and the reference values had no way of being proven was evident in this process.

Without the car industry taking responsibility and admitting that what they are doing is immoral, we will not achieve everything that we can because of course legislation and changing the legislation is not sufficient. I want to state once again very clearly that once we have the legislation – because for now we do not have tools as the Commission to interact and to react in such a situation, but agreement on the type approval was reached in December so I am happy that we will have it – the situation will of course be different. But, as far as animal and human testing are concerned, this is another situation again. So now the national authorities must check what the situation looked like in Europe, whether testing on animals took place and whether we have evidence of this. We probably have the evidence of testing on humans, but again the only link we have is the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. On animal testing we have the legislation for the cosmetic industry and I will discuss with my colleagues in the Commission whether to perhaps extend this testing to cars and the car industry. But as far as extending the emission tests on cars to the health issue, of course politically I support the idea, but technically we should look at all emissions, not only from cars. This requires a much more holistic approach, including specific car tests on health. We can of course discuss it, but again I will come back to this. Without morality in the industry, I do not think we will cover the whole range of problems that may appear one day or another. I will do my best because I will soon have – or my successor will soon have – tools for emissions and for the things that are under the type approval regulation, but animal testing is much wider than we thought during the emissions scandal. As you probably know, I am very dedicated to enforcement. We are currently – I think for three or four months now – analysing information after the first packet of infringement procedures that we opened against five Member States for failing to fine Volkswagen. So, regarding the second package, we are currently analysing the information and data provided by the Member States and I can again reassure you that, if Member States do not cooperate – and they are not so very open on this – I will go ahead with the next step of the procedure. We are not ready for this yet. On the hardware update and the list of equipment, we do not have the technical data in the Commission to provide such a list. If you ask me to do so, I can ask the Member States to provide this information for us, but I can assure you it will take a few more months or even years. For the list of equipment and hardware, I am very open to this. I have only recently heard about this list of equipment and hardware updates, so I can ask the Joint Research Centre whether they are ready to prepare this for us. On recalls, maybe you know that under current regulation the Commission has no power to issue EU—wide mandatory recalls. This will change with the new type approval framework. It is still currently the joint responsibility of Volkswagen and the Member States. I have written a few letters over the last few months calling on Member States to issue mandatory recalls. After this letter the number of Member States with mandatory recalls increased from four to seven, but of course the results of the recalls are not the same everywhere in Europe. In those Member States where the recalls are mandatory they are much higher and much better. If the situation does not change in the next couple of weeks, I am prepared to take further steps on our side and of course again it is legal action against Member States where recall rates are very low and definitely for those where the recalls are voluntary the rates are very low. On the comparison with glyphosate and with the other tests or studies that were submitted, I want to underline that these tests on animals that we are discussing now are not required by our EU type approval legislation. So in the context of EU legislation in other areas and other domains, industry has to submit the studies. This is mandatory. It has to submit the studies when applying for approval of the substances and this was what happened with the glyphosate. Here with private testing such an obligation under our EU type approval legislation does not exist so I think this comparison with some other cases is not relevant. Regarding the response to the written questions to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI), I was told that the current horizontal rules did not foresee such a submission of the written answer ahead of the regular exchange of views, but I can assure you that I will provide you with this response this evening or tomorrow morning. I have been told that we can only provide written answers ahead of the inquiry committee. That is why I am very open to having this exchange with the ENVI Committee, but I was told that horizontally the situation is not appropriate, but we will provide you with the answers to the written questions at the latest tomorrow morning. I want to finish by reiterating what I said at the beginning. We cannot fix mistrust only with a regulatory framework and with legislation. This must come from the industry itself, but it is not happening for now. This is not happening for now and I think this is the biggest shame and the saddest thing in all of this because, after the diesel scandal and after the whole discussion we had with them, I thought that this transparency would be everywhere. Unfortunately, even if I compare the dates, I see that the moment the diesel scandal occurred, it finished. This was about the moment when they were testing on animals and humans – it was 15 and 14, I checked it – so it was at more or less the same time. We will do our best on type approval and emissions. I will discuss testing on animals with my colleagues in the Commission because this is joint work with the Commissioner responsible for health and consumer protection. We will of course discuss it together, but I will still repeat that, without proper discussion with the industry and without a proper admission by the industry that they were doing the wrong things, we will not achieve 100% success because life is much broader than we can imagine. Could you imagine a month or two ago that something like this would be discussed today? No. I was not surprised because I have been living with this for the last two years so I know how things are going, but still I was shocked. Can you imagine what will happen in the next six to ten months? Again we will try then to prepare legislation and to change the legislation. The legislation is extremely important but it is not the only thing. We have the legislation in place. Member States have the legislation in place.

There are days when you should enjoy, when you should feel satisfaction. Today, we have a day like this, because today crowns the work of many people, many institutions, many organizations. Today we can say that we achieve something measurable for the citizens of the European Union together, something that will really affect the lives of each of us. Almost two years ago here, the current commissioner Andrus Ansip proposed a ban on refusing online sales on the grounds of nationality or because of the location of the customer. Because, after all, it is not normal that in a united 21st century Europe, where we move freely between states, there are still such meaningless restrictions in the world of e-commerce. Today we can say that we are going for success, success still incomplete, because there is very much to do, but thanks to the new law, each of us will feel concrete changes for the better. Tomorrow, please, we vote. No more refusing to sell when buying goods or services online because of the customer's residence or nationality. End technical barriers to access websites and applications. No more auto-redirecting to a seller's website in another country without customer consent. No more use in the same store of different conditions of sale of goods and services, including prices, depending on the nationality or place of residence of the customer. No more refusing to sell because of the country of credit card issuance. We have also taken care of the dealings of the If the entrepreneur does not direct his offer, if he does not direct his business to the country, then the consumer is not still geoblocked, but arranges himself to collect the goods, and thanks to this solution small sellers do not need to know the regulations of each of the 28 countries The European Union separately, because we have not yet harmonised these rules. I'm not hiding, we wanted more. We have taken the Commission together for inclusion to this regulation at least non-audiovisual content, those protected by copyright: iBooks, music, software, games. Unfortunately we failed to fight the resistance of the Council. I am grateful to my colleagues and colleagues for their cooperation and for their willingness to compromise, because by doing so, geoblocking — for now only physical products — passes to the past. I direct my words of appreciation to the representatives of the Estonian Presidency — such a small country and its excellent representatives have shown how efficiently complex negotiations can be carried out, even more than more challenges faced by the Council partners than during negotiations with Parliament and the Commission .

You have demonstrated your belief in this proposal and how it will benefit Europeans. Thank you for helping it become reality. The Geo-Blocking Regulation lies at the heart of the e-commerce package that we designed to remove barriers for consumers and companies trading online. It will end artificial segmentation and unjustified discrimination based on nationality or residence. Using either of these as a reason to deny access to websites, goods or services will finally no longer have a place in Europe’s single market, either online or offline. Today, only 37% of websites allow consumers to buy from another EU country, because people get blocked and rerouted elsewhere. This situation cannot exist in a digital single market, and we have to end it. Our aim is that, by Christmas, all Europeans will be able to enjoy online shopping without being blocked, rerouted or discriminated against. That is why we need to adopt this regulation without any further delay. I would also like to ask for your support and commitment to make the entire digital single market a reality on the ground. Again, the clock is ticking. We have to move quickly, and adopt and implement initiatives where the co-legislators have already reached agreement. We are making good progress on e-commerce, and European consumers should soon feel the benefits of recent political agreements, which need to be implemented quickly. From 1 April this year, new rules on the cross-border portability of online content services will allow Europeans to access their music and e-books when they travel to other EU countries. To make sure this happens, companies should comply with the rules as from their dates of application. We recently agreed on new rules to make prices for cross-border parcel delivery services more transparent and affordable. Consumers and companies, in particular SMEs, will be able to send and receive products across the EU with greater ease and confidence. It is also essential for the success of the Geo-Blocking Regulation that we work as hard as we can for this regulation to be quickly and formally approved. In December, new rules on VAT for electronic commerce were adopted. They will facilitate VAT collection when consumers buy goods and services online and make it easier for online businesses to comply with their VAT obligations. Member States should now work quickly and efficiently to transpose this directive. In addition, it is vital that we make progress on other proposals that are still being negotiated and are necessary for the digital single market.

Congratulations to you too, Mr Vice-President, for having remained ambitious that we now have practical access to better prices and an end to discrimination between European citizens themselves, which was not easy. Sometimes it was easier to export to China than to overcome the obstacles that existed in the European Union market. Indeed, the now mandatory acceptance of credit cards will facilitate online transactions, without excluding countries with restrictions on capital movements. The removal of these barriers is a decisive step for the benefit of citizens and we are also creating new opportunities for businesses, so that they can develop their activities and promote their quality products within Europe.

One of the main reasons is precisely the geo-blocking practice, and we need to get rid of this. EU citizens have a right to be able to shop online in another EU country just like the locals do. That is the core idea behind the digital single market that we have been working on in the European Parliament. I would like to thank the EPP rapporteur, Ms Róża Thun, for her commitment and a great job during the negotiation process with the Commission and the Council during the Estonian Presidency. The agreement between the Council and the Parliament will remove barriers to e-commerce by avoiding discrimination based on a consumer’s nationality, place of residence or place of establishment. It will prevent discrimination for consumers and companies based on access to prices, sales or payment conditions when buying products and services in another EU country.

I believe that the text we are about to adopt is a good compromise, which will make it possible to take another step towards a deeper and more efficient digital market for the benefit of consumers. Because I would like to point out that the internal market is one of the pillars of European integration and that, if the internet changes consumption patterns, it should not be a way to return to the foundations of our Union. In particular, discrimination between consumers in the internal market is unacceptable. When I go to a bakery in Belgium or when our colleagues here go to a business in Strasbourg, they should not be denied a refusal to sell them what they want to buy, on the pretext that they are Italian or Belgian or because they reside in another Member State. On the Internet, this is exactly the same thing and I am glad that this regulation will put an end to situations of discrimination. This regulation will therefore result in a wider choice for consumers and an additional benefit for them. But just as discrimination is unacceptable, it would have been equally unacceptable to unfairly lessen consumer protection on the pretext that it is an online purchase. Fortunately, this regulation, as our group has requested, will maintain a high level of protection for consumers engaged in cross-border transactions. I also wanted to stress here that it was important to be careful about the impact of this regulation on specific sectors, with a specific economic model. I therefore welcome the possibility that the cultural sector can be assessed at a later stage as part of a possible upcoming revision.

This concept is widely disregarded by the European legislature, who defines it as — and I quote — discrimination on the basis of nationality or place of residence. The regulation simply wants to prohibit the use of it to professionals.

Then 27% of those lucky people who got access to those websites were not able to register because their IP addresses were wrong addresses: they were from France, from Germany, from Austria, from Poland – from some EU Member State that was wrong in some way. Then 32% of those lucky people who were able to register were faced with delivery problems and to find solutions for those problems we launched our parcel delivery proposal, and I am happy that we were able to find consensus on that proposal. But even 26% of those people who did not have issues of any kind with delivery problems, could not pay because their credit cards were issued in wrong the countries: in Sweden, in Finland, in Latvia, in Lithuania, in the United Kingdom – in some EU Member State that was wrong in some way.  All in all, just 36.6% of all those people who tried to buy some goods and services from another EU Member State were able to conclude those purchases successfully. This is not the single market we would like to have in the European Union when only every third person is able to conclude those purchases successfully. We have to hurry up.

Member States reply heavily on value added tax (VAT) revenues to finance their public spending. However the VAT gap between expected revenue and revenue actually collected is estimated at more than EUR 150 billion per year. It has also been estimated that cross—border fraud alone represents an annual loss of revenue of around EUR 50 billion, money that could be spent on public services. The current VAT system is not only prone to fraud, but also too fragmented for a growing number of businesses operating cross—border. Therefore the Commission decided to renew the VAT system as part of its agenda for a fair and efficient tax system in the European Union. In particular, the Commission is proposing to create a single European VAT area that caters for the challenges of the 21st century. I recall that the weaknesses of the current system were acknowledged also by this Parliament in its resolution ‘towards a definitive VAT system and fighting VAT fraud’ of November 2016. In the same resolution Parliament shared the Commission’s view that the definitive VAT system should be based on the principle of taxation in the country of destination, which addresses tax competition between Member States. I am proud to say that the Commission has delivered on all its commitments made in the Action Plan on VAT of April 2016. The first proposal of the Action Plan, which will modernise and simplify VAT for cross—border e—commerce, was adopted by the Council in December last year. This is very good news for businesses. Furthermore, between October last year and 18 January this year, the Commission adopted the last five proposals announced in its Action Plan. I will present these five proposals to you today by focusing on their three main objectives. Firstly, to create a single VAT area that establishes a level playing field for EU businesses and in particular for SMEs. Secondly, to create a single VAT area that is fraud—proof, with tax administrations working closely together. And thirdly, to create a single VAT area that treats Member States equally and grants them more freedom in setting VAT rates. So to start with the first objective, a level playing field for businesses, I would remind you that our current VAT system is fragmented, complex for a growing number of businesses operating cross—border. The latter have VAT compliance costs 11% higher than companies having only domestic activities. We have to open the borders of VAT and create a real single VAT area for EU companies. The proposals adopted in October 2017 represent the cornerstone for a new system, based on the principle of taxation in the country of destination, which will result in taxing cross—border sales the same way as domestic sales. The main simplification is that companies selling cross—border will deal with their VAT obligations via a one—stop—shop. That means that traders will make declarations and payments using a single online portal.  The Commission also adopted in January 2018 measures to simplify VAT procedures for SMEs, which represent over 98% of all EU businesses. Currently the cost of compliance under the present VAT system hits SMEs much harder than it does big business. The proposal we made will extend the benefits of the VAT SME exemption to all small businesses, irrespective of whether they are established in the Member State in which the VAT is due or not. The new rules will also simplify compliance for a larger group of SMEs – exempt and non-exempt from VAT. All businesses with a turnover of less than EUR 2 million per year will be able to benefit from simplified registration, invoicing, reporting and book—keeping obligations. We estimate that this proposal will result in a compliance cost reduction of up to 18% for SMEs. The second main objective of our VAT reform is to address the unacceptable problem of VAT cross—border fraud which, as already mentioned, represents around EUR 50 billion per year. Criminal networks exploit the weaknesses of the current VAT systems. Journalists have also established links between cross—border fraud and the financing of terrorism. This is no longer acceptable and we should put an end to this phenomenon. By eliminating borders for VAT procedures, the new definitive VAT system should eliminate much of the large—scale cross—border VAT fraud. As implementing a new regime will take time, we need to take urgent measures to contain cross—border VAT fraud. This is why the Commission proposed in November 2017 a proposal to enhance the cooperation between national administrations and close loopholes in information sharing. This proposal, which is now being discussed in the Council, aims to build trust between Member States by allowing them to exchange more information, in a more efficient manner, so as to better detect and identify fraudsters. This proposal will also boost the cooperation between national tax authorities and law enforcement authorities such as customs, OLAF, Europol and the newly created European Public Prosecutor’s Office. Eventually our intention is to reduce complexity around the issue of reduced VAT rates. Although there are general rules, over 200 reduced and zero rates still exist in all Member States, that were initially intended as temporary derogations from the general rules. In the frame of the definitive system based on the principle of destination, which will address tax competition, Member States would have more freedom to set their VAT rates under harmonised rules that will treat all Member States equally. One of the major changes proposed by the Commission is to replace the list of goods and services to which reduced rates can be applied with a negative list to which reduced rates cannot be applied. The main advantage of this negative list is that it is to be structured according to the statistical classification. The same statistical classification will also be used to collect and publish structured information about reduced rates applied in all Member States via a web portal. On these grounds the web portal will allow all businesses to easily retrieve information on VAT rates.  Further harmonisation concerns the use of reduced rates. They must clearly be for the benefit of citizens, who are the final consumers paying VAT. To prevent revenue erosion the Commission will protect VAT as an important source of income for Member States. Indeed Member States will have to ensure that they apply an effective average weighted VAT rate of at least 12%, which is the lowest applied today in some EU Member States, and the requirement of a minimum standard VAT rate of 15% will become a permanent requirement. Finally the proposed amendments to the VAT Directive as regards reduced rates will enter into force only when the definitive regime is effectively in place. To conclude, let me say that these proposals represent a win for both Member States’ revenues and European businesses. So it is our responsibility to act and therefore I call on Parliament to take the lead and show ambition for real reform of the VAT system.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 134, "date": "2018-02-05.json", "name": "Luděk Niedermayer", "mepid": "124701", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, losses in tax collected have very serious consequences for our economy as well as for society. It is not just a shortage of government revenues; it distorts competition, sometimes it helps to finance illegal activities and, if losses are too high, it can push up the tax rates in other categories. That is why I am very happy that this area is one of the priority of EU and in last years, we made significant achievements. After focusing on income tax of large corporations and later on addressing the issue of anti-money laundering and transparency of ownership, now the Commission is coming with the action plan and the proposals included in the VAT package. It is very important because of VAT is one of the largest sources of government revenues and, as it was said, we are losing a lot of money. I am glad that an important part of the proposal is the simplification of tax compliance, especially for small and medium sized businesses. We need to collect taxes better just not more expensively. I call on the Finance Ministers to reach agreement on the package and to go forward really quickly. I believe that better collection of taxes should not be used for increasing the government revenues. I believe we do not need to spend more, we just need to spend better. In my view, money gained should be invested mainly in the reduction of public debt and the reduction of the most devastating taxes for the economic growth. This is the way how we will benefit the future of our citizens and the growth of the EU economy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 135, "date": "2018-02-05.json", "name": "Pervenche Berès", "mepid": "1985", "text": " on behalf of the S&D Group. — (FR) Madam President, Mr Vice-President, thank you for this package, as we say in European language. Of course, it will get attention when you help SMEs in the maze of taxation that sometimes overflows them. However, I would like to focus on the issue of reduced rates, because it is a politically extremely sensitive subject on which this European Parliament has often asked you. You make a proposal that puts us at the heart of our contradictions. Rather than debating and negotiating around an annex, you propose to give Member States more flexibility, with the risk of having a completely variable geometry depending on the Member States and thus an impact on a logic of the internal market which, in turn, will be called into question. This, however, addresses a number of concerns, including the issue of zero rates on a number of products or the alignment of paper book taxation with the digital book, which, from a cultural point of view, is a critical issue. I want, however, to draw your attention to two points. First of all, I would like to ask you how you identified this minimum rate of 12% VAT collection from the Member States. What is the current rate per Member State? Finally, I think that, from the point of view of the cross-border impact on a number of products, this flexibility left to the Member States will call us to put in place mechanisms to counter the effects of this competition that could take place in border areas.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 136, "date": "2018-02-05.json", "name": "Lieve Wierinck", "mepid": "183022", "text": " on behalf of the ALDE Group. — (NL) Mr President, I welcome the work of the Commission. As shadow rapporteur on CCTB and DAC6, fair taxes have been an important part of my work in recent months. It can no longer be that honest, hard-working entrepreneurs pay the price for a system that does not function properly. As the Commission has shown, we only lose EUR 50 billion in revenue every year in VAT. This is money that needs to be taken out of the illegal circuit and go to crucial infrastructure, health care and research. Goods, services and capital have long stopped at the borders of our Member States. A solution must therefore be cross-border and based on cooperation through the exchange of information, with the help of the relevant agencies, but also with the agencies. This is also an opportunity to simplify current systems and procedures and thus reduce the administrative burden on our companies. Such simplification would be a relief for our SMEs in particular.

All that is true, but with regard to this reform there are a number of problems: the first is what we are currently seeing from this trend of the European Commission acting mainly in a transfer of the collection of direct taxes to indirect taxes. It should be the exact opposite, because only direct taxes guarantee that there is real redistribution. The second problem has to do with this definition of minima. The definition of minimums does not eliminate the profound inequality that exists in taxation at European Union level, and therefore the taxation of capital income has not stopped falling in recent decades while it is so much on those who work. And then there is the fundamental problem, Commissioner, and with this I finish.

My colleague Molly Scott Cato has lobbied very hard for this and the Parliament did this, so this is really the right direction you are taking. But I have to say that we have concerns concerning the increasing number of exemptions which are possible under the new regime.

As I mentioned in my introduction, since the first package of reforms in 2016 the Commission has gradually adopted proposals that would allow a fundamental reform of the VAT system in the EU. But there is no time to rest on our laurels; we still have a long way to go.  First of all on the Commission’s side. Before this summer the Commission will come forward with two legislative proposals: one introducing changes in the VAT Directive, which will contain detailed arrangements putting into practice the cornerstone of the definitive regime adopted in October 2017, while the second one will address the issue of VAT fraud in online sales. Secondly on Parliament’s and Member States’ side. The debate is now in your hands. At the highest political level we need an ambition to deliver the real reform of our VAT system, to create a level playing field for EU companies, to support SMEs so that they can grow and benefit from the opportunities of the single market, and to put an end to cross—border fraud which steals public revenues and finances criminal organisations or possibly even terrorist activities. On VAT reduced rates; we are proposing to give more freedom to Member States in a framed manner, so I will come back to some of the concerns which were raised in this regard. Indeed it is very important that this does not lead to revenue erosion or distortion of competition. That is why we have put safeguards in place in terms of the minimum effective VAT rate, in terms of negative lists which mainly concern high value, easily portable goods, which are the ones probably most prone to being moved across borders, and this proposal would only come into force once a definitive VAT system will be in place. We are, of course, are ready to discuss with co—legislators whether those safeguards are sufficient and what is the best way to address potential risks of revenue erosion. Now as regards the broader issue, I think we share the need to reform the current VAT system in the interest of Member States, of EU businesses – mainly SMEs – and of European citizens.

It is high time we put an end to the possibility of VAT fraud. Currently, there are 28 types of tax systems in Europe, with different rules and loopholes. The payment of VAT resulting from the free movement of goods and services in the common market and the lack of transparency of the rules is a huge problem, in particular due to the lack of cooperation between Member States. In EU Member States, unpaid VAT amounts to around €150 billion a year, i.e. more than the EU's total annual budget is missing from the budget of the Member States. Moreover, EUR 50 billion of this is linked to VAT fraud, such as the cross-border circular VAT fraud known in Hungary. The system proposed by the Commission reverses the rules on VAT payment and refunding. If the EU accepts the proposal, cross-border VAT payment and recovery will also have to be treated as if they were within borders. The difference would be accounted for by the Member States, thus simplifying the administration. This requires much greater cooperation between Member States.

Due to inefficient tax collection, uncoordinated cooperation between Member States and fragmented VAT rules, the VAT gap between expected revenues and VAT revenues in the EU is estimated to be €150 billion per year. Cross-border fraud costs Member States €50 billion per year. The Commission therefore intends to reform the current VAT system to create a fairer and more efficient tax system in the European Union. An important element of the VAT package is an EU system for simplified VAT compliance. Tax compliance costs for cross-border European SMEs are 11% higher than for SMEs exclusively engaged in domestic activities. The Commission's proposals would reduce compliance costs by 18% through simplified registration, invoicing and accounting rules for SMEs with a turnover of less than €2 million per year.

I would like to thank the Council and their hardworking team and, of course, all my wonderful hardworking colleagues here in Parliament. Nothing is ever perfect, and the emission trading system (ETS) is certainly no exception to that, but it remains the cornerstone of our EU policy to combat climate change and we have done our best to agree an ambitious update. The ETS has had a chequered history. There have been many detractors over the years. We tackled many problems – from a carbon price that was clearly too low to make the market function to the extremely difficult issue of striking the balance between our environmental ambition and the protection of energy-intensive European industry. This is always open, and we are always discussing it, but it remains a system operating in 31 countries. The rest of the world has sometimes been disappointingly slow to catch up, but now we have some momentum going. We have the recent agreement with Switzerland, we have President Trump to thank for the call to action in the United States, which has meant some ambitious plans in California and their tie—up with Ontario, and indeed even movement in China, where I know the Commission has been very active in terms of helping with their own putative system. So we are making this agreement in the context of a world that is moving forward. It would be nice, actually, to be criticised at some point for not being the best system in the world, so we look forward to that in the near future hopefully. However, the background to this update is challenging. We must have a system that can deliver the EU’s Paris commitments, but sometimes reality is at odds with this. We were working against the background of the 2014 Council conclusions, which was not always helpful. There are challenging internal politics around the relationship between the EU 15 and more recent accession states, with a lively discussion on the absolute amounts and on the conditions that would be appropriate to impose in providing the flow of funds to assist these Member States. We also had the difficult issue of indirect cost compensation, warmly embraced by some Member States and not by others, leading to a fundamental question as to whether, if some Member State governments are prepared to support their industry financially and others are not, EU funds should be used to iron out the differences. We await further developments on state aid rules to illuminate this question. I welcome the compromise that we reached on this, but we did not settle the matter. The discussions will continue. I do not intend to list all the final conclusions of the deal, just a couple that are highlights for me. The 2023 review – in line with the global stock-take of the Paris Agreement – will include a possible increase in the 2.2% linear reduction factor. This is a major achievement. Secondly, there is the substantial withdrawal of excess allowances from the system. And, thirdly, what is called the ‘Duncan mechanism’ in tribute to the rapporteur who preceded me – I think we should now call it the ‘Lord Duncan mechanism’ – comes in if the cross-sector correction factor is applied. If it is not needed, then additional funds go to the Innovation Fund and the Modernisation Fund. We have changes to benchmarks and carbon leakage lists, offering a fine balance between carbon leakage protection and ambition. These are just a few points. There is a clear stamp of the European Parliament on this agreement – new thinking and new mechanisms which have been taken on board – and I thank my colleagues for this. But sometimes what defines the role of rapporteur is the most frequently asked question: what did you want that you didn’t achieve? Well, for me, there are two clear things here: the important issue of environment performance standards – we did our best, we made advances but we didn’t get the specific, clear numerical limit we wanted – and the issue of shipping. We got our recital on the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), but we wanted more. I think Parliament has made a very clear statement that this is not good enough.

So I think we have to take a note in the European Parliament about how much we are going to continue to water down this system, which we have done in several ways. What the money and values this market creates is actually supposed to be used for, I think is a base question. The second is how many more funds can we look to create to do things that perhaps not at all the ETS system is really meant for.

The European Union ETS remains the most important instrument to realise our ambition of a reduction of at least 40% in greenhouse gas emissions within the European Union by 2030. With the political agreement reached in early November last year, we can proudly show to our citizens and to the world that the European Union is delivering and turning political words into legal commitments. The trilogue agreement on this proposal is the result of a long, complex and thorough negotiation process that necessarily involved compromises from all sides. The support and active engagement of the rapporteur, Ms Girling, and also of the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Belet, Ms Guteland, Mr Gerbrandy, Ms Konečná, Mr Eickhout, Ms Evi and Ms D’Ornano, was crucial in this regard. I would like wholeheartedly to thank Ms Girling for her skillful work on this challenging file and congratulate her on the result. Only the constructive spirit of the negotiators of both institutions made it possible to reach a solid compromise and I am happy that the Commission could facilitate this trilogue agreement as an ‘honest broker’. As I said, the agreement required compromise from all parties involved. It strikes a proper balance between strengthening the European Union carbon market and incentivising industry to decarbonise with innovative solutions and renewable energy, while being mindful of the specific challenges of lower-income Member States, in particular regarding the modernisation of their energy systems. The European Union ETS is a great example of a forward-looking regulation where European legislation enables innovation and modernisation of our energy system. The European Parliament has greatly contributed to the final shape of the trilogue outcome. Each side of the triangle of issues at the core of the discussion clearly carries the European Parliament’s signature. The political impetus for strengthening the European Union ETS originated in the European Parliament. The temporary doubling of the feeding rate for the Market Stability Reserve and the limitation set for the validity of allowances in the reserve will ensure that market balance will be restored swiftly and that the carbon price creates incentives for long-term low-carbon investments. Regarding the free allocation to avoid carbon leakage, a free allocation buffer of around 450 million allowances was created, at Parliament’s request, to avoid a cross-sectoral correction factor. This provides European industry with certainty in terms of free allocation and a reliable planning horizon. And finally, because of the European Parliament’s insistence, the modernisation provisions will also enable activities fostering a just transition of labour on the way towards a low-carbon economy; and, as an additional safeguard for investments, no support from the Modernisation Fund will be granted to coal-related energy generation, with the exception of district heating in Bulgaria and Romania. I could continue this list, referring to other issues such as a larger Innovation Fund, but I think that, together, we can be proud of the result of our joint effort to agree on an improved and robust architecture for the renewed European Union ETS. I invite you to lend your support to the political agreement in tomorrow’s vote to ensure that the legislation enters swiftly into force and the necessary changes are in place by January 2021. There is no time to lose in the European transition to a low-carbon economy. This is what we have promised to our citizens.

Where thing has its time and I am one of those who has been fawned and really been tough in the negotiations to make this be a sharper climate legislation, but today I thought to be happy. I think it is important for new faiths ahead in climate legislation that we also celebrate when we have tightened legislation and put a better one in line with the Paris Agreement. These have been long and tough negotiations, and it is clear that the views on climate are thudged, both in the European Parliament and in EU member countries. On one side are the progressives who see the possibilities and who want to do more to solve the climate threat. On the other side, we have the Conservatives who want to continue to tuck their heads in the sand and are happy to hug old fossil fuels and maintain emissions reform. We Social Democrats and the S&D Group have been driving in the negotiations. By scrapping up to 2 billion allowances, we are running out of current inflation in the system and we make it more expensive to emit; that's a good thing. For us, it has also been important to make the transition into a climate-smarter society in a more equitable and socially sustainable way. Everyone should follow along, and especially in regions where the conversion is difficult because of major challenges to leave the fossil, it is important that there is support for workers so that you can join the conversion. I am also pleased that the rules clearly signal that all sectors must contribute. No one should go stingy on other people's improvements. Climate work concerns all of us.

The European Union is leading the world in the fight against climate change. We're not allowed to turn winners into losers. The agreement is certainly a step forward in this respect compared to the original Commission proposal, but for us protection against carbon leakage could have gone even further.

Well, only the future will tell us whether what we have been doing has been sufficient. We do know that the price of carbon credits has gone up by about 20% so far, so it might be successful. Surplus of allowances, we tackled that. I think the coal phase-out in Germany, the Netherlands and Italy is easier to achieve now. The Innovation Fund has been increased, which is important; and I think one of the major improvements that Parliament has made is that the Modernisation Fund is not applicable to coal-fired investments. That is very successful. But there are two elements I would like to stress. First of all, carbon leakage. We are still handing out 95% of all allowances for free to industry, even for sectors that have no real trade or carbon intensity. That is still something that is not too good.

On the other hand, a measure protecting any increase in industrial production in the EU or exemptions for the protection of our steel sector. Yes, I can still see a number of non-add-ons that we couldn't remove for various reasons. Such as the outstanding issue of protecting European industry from imports of raw materials and products from states that do not share our position on combating climate change, such as carbon adjustment mechanism. It would be good for the next few years the European Commission to finally resolve this issue once and for all, having failed to do so here.

Thanks to this reform, quotas will be distributed more fairly, to be in line with real emissions from industrial sites and this will allow the creation of the Fund for the Modernization of our Electricity Sectors and to mobilise in an innovation fund the equivalent of more than 400 million quotas for innovation in Europe. It's fundamental. Thus, we respect our commitments following the Paris Agreement, but at the same time we are defending our industrial sectors that are facing difficult international competition.

As I have said before, we can be proud of the result of our joint efforts and I count on your support in tomorrow’s vote. The European Union Emissions Trading System (ETS) is a key instrument of our climate policy and we all managed to agree on a solid and robust framework for the next decade to ensure that we meet our ambitious emissions reduction target, while preserving the competitiveness of our industry and fostering low-carbon innovation and modernisation.  Internationally, many are looking at us and our European Union ETS as a model to develop similar forward-looking climate policies, and by putting in place the necessary legislation to renew and strengthen the European Union ETS, the European Union confirms its determination to lead the way in the fight against climate change and honouring our commitments under the Paris Agreement.  Let me make a final comment because there have been some interventions relating to the need for a centralised fund for indirect cost compensation. I know that this was a particularly difficult chapter in the negotiations, with almost irreconcilable views on issues such as a fully harmonised system. Indirect cost compensation will be continued in the form of state—aid schemes. We will not, however, see a mere continuation of the past. The continued use of a state—aid scheme is accompanied by substantially enhanced and timely transparency in reporting requirements.  Every Member State providing state aid will, as soon as the legislation is in force, have to publish, within three months of the end of a calendar year, the actual amount of compensation paid out in total and the benefiting sector, and this is a substantial improvement. The enhanced reporting that has been agreed will already start this year, and as part of future reviews the ETS Directive clearly foresees that the Commission should also consider whether measures in relation to indirect cost compensation should be further harmonised. I hope that all of you will support this ETS new system because we have made a big effort to seek compromise. Our rapporteur did excellent work, as did all the shadow rapporteurs, and in this spirit of compromise we have improved the system that, as some of you said, has not worked perfectly in the past, but really this time I think we are going in the right direction and I hope it delivers as much as we expect from the work we have done.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 179, "date": "2018-02-05.json", "name": "Julie Girling", "mepid": "96956", "text": "  rapporteur. – Madam President, I would like to thank everybody who spoke.

So we have to bring ourselves back to basics and remember that the cap-and-trade system gives us the opportunity for an increased carbon price, which creates the incentive for industry to invest. It also creates a huge amount of money for Member States to invest in their own industry around the whole issue of decarbonising technology.

We continue to debate energy issues. Energy is known to be the most important issue for the economy. It's hard to function with an uncharged phone, a car without petrol, cold radiators or non-working apparatus in factories, offices or hospitals. We want to have security of supply — that is the basis of our operation. We want to burden the environment as little as possible — it's about climate, but it's also about eliminating phenomena like smog. And finally, we want prices for energy not to be too high — we want to keep the industry competitive. We have a clean energy package on occasion and the very name of this package tells you what energy, what energy future and what transformation in the European Union is about. If we take all this together, then we can basically cope in the long run just by the fact that we're going to invest in new energy technologies. This is a fundamental matter for our future and the future of energy transformation. For sure, we want to free up public investment, private resources, as well as citizen activity in assisting our efforts towards new energy solutions. It is also about the technological neutrality that was guaranteed in the Paris Agreement. Three points seem most important to me in terms of investing in new technologies in the European Union. First of all, simplification of EU programmes and funds. Let's talk about this for a long time, but if we really want to benefit in the long run from funding for new energy technologies, we must necessarily do so. And we need to increase funding for energy, new energy technologies. In the Framework Programme, we would like to see at least €120bn, but the idea is to increase energy funds by a percentage of 50%. Finally, more national expenditure is very much needed, but it is absolutely essential to coordinate national expenditure and European expenditure, because we often repeat the same studies and are not effective enough. Please note that we have our European clean technology institute, which deals with innovation and technology, and half of its activities serve to improve energy technologies. We should use this institute. We also have a Centre for Clean Coal Technologies, which has been funded by European money. We have digitisation, we have problems in transport, in construction, we have our environmental policies, our regional policies, we have infrastructure connections — we need all these programs to connect. Only such an action can really bring us change in the transformation of energy technologies, because we are transforming not only our energy market, but we are also transforming technologies.

The suggestions proposed confirm and reinforce the Commission’s position and will be instrumental in the ongoing implementation. We have presented the progress made last year in the Communication on the State of the Energy Union, but the coming year will be crucial. To this end, the Commission will continue to focus on the four flagships that we decided on in the Communication: e—mobility, decarbonising buildings, renewables and – last but not least – storage. In doing so, as noted in your report, coherence of EU actions is absolutely necessary. We are focused on building and reinforcing synergies across funding instruments and stakeholders, and on aligning our policies to support innovation and not hamper it.  Your report is clear: public procurement can be a powerful tool to support the market uptake for clean energy innovation. Within the Commission we are looking at ways and mechanisms to incentivise EU public bodies to use demand as a tool to foster innovation. I am also pleased to see that we are aligned on the need to provide long—term financing certainty to better support and align incentives for innovators and investors. As you know, discussions on the design of FP9 are ongoing, and we take note of your suggestions with regard to the budget. Your assessment that funding for clean energy research and innovation will require a tremendous increase are the same as our conclusions. We agree with you, other international organisations agree with you, and we have to fight for that. On your point on the EU’s global clean energy leadership: we are the leaders. Europe is the leader and we should shout more about it. How many people are still surprised when we say that 40% of the patents in renewable technologies are European? Our leadership is also clear in the Mission Innovation initiative, gathering together 22 countries and the EU. At the time, I was introduced by the US Secretary of Energy as someone coming from the only country in the world that was able to run for four days straight on renewable energy alone. That is European leadership.  We are also working closely with other global initiatives, such as the Breakthrough Energy Coalition created by Bill Gates, which is now exploring a public—private collaboration with the Commission and four other Mission Innovation members.  Our views also coincide on the citizen’s central role in energy innovation that you referred to. There is a need for a transformation of mindset and the development of new skills. The role of the Commission is to facilitate, but also to take account of more interdisciplinarity and user innovation in future calls. The legislative package you are currently negotiating with the Council reflects the central role given to consumers in all aspects: innovative services, technology, products and integration methodologies. We cannot do it alone, so thank you very much and I hope to keep working together for the future.

However, we all know that action is urgently needed in the areas of sustainable energy and climate change — apart from our colleague, Mr Korwin-Mikke. More than ever, we are faced with all the negative effects of our past decisions. However, despite international commitments and despite the advancing climate change, various Member States are still doing far too little for the energy transition. Against this background, I would like to encourage the Commission to send the following request to the governments of the Member States: subsidies for fossil fuels must be abolished as soon as possible.

We have traditionally been at the forefront, as Commissioner Moedas has pointed out, but we need to do more because other areas of the world are catching up. For instance, China spent USD 44 billion on investment in clean energy projects in 2017, up from USD 32 billion in 2016. So, while we can be happy with ourselves, the rest of the world is probably moving quicker. Therefore, I really agree with Mr Buzek when he calls for an increased budget for FP9. Horizon 2020 did not make enough funds available.  We also need to look at ensuring that those funds are easily available. As Jerzy Buzek pointed out, we have too many financial instruments and in some of the seminars, etc., that I have held in my own constituency, the point was made to me several times that applying for funds is too complicated. There are too many streams and they need to be coordinated and simplified.

And I would like to say that the clean energy we want in connection with the Clean Energy for All Europeans package may not have matured in many respects, perhaps sometimes not so well known. That is why, Commissioner Moedas, research is so important to move forward here. For example, because I deal a lot with maritime things, I think of energy from the ocean. For example, we already know offshore wind energy plants. However, research is being done on wave energy, tide energy, and many say that the fuel of the future for an aircraft may have been produced from algae, and then also very environmentally friendly, even CO2 neutral. We can still accomplish a lot of things. We need technology neutrality, we need a lot of research. We also need to recognise that research is clear that even smaller companies and smaller research institutions know exactly where they can apply for something if they want to move forward, and that we are also using the resources in research as efficiently as possible. Then we can move on with it. In order to really drive innovation, we also need a competition of different energies. Pushing subsidies are good, but not permanent.

And it is that this report is born with an original sin, in our view, which is the concept of technological neutrality. I mean, the same thing we're investigating today in fossil fuels as in photovoltaics. What is being done is to color the coal green; paint a windmill to the gas; or put a smoke vacuum on a power plant and call it clean coal. It is not enough just to nurture the illusion of false solutions, nor is it enough just to rely on the market. To encourage this innovation in clean energy, it is essential to set ambitious objectives — which is not done by this House or the European Union itself as a whole, because there is an inconsistency between words and facts. Last month, in this House, large groups agreed to set energy efficiency and renewable energy targets of only 35%, which are not binding on States, that is, little more than market trends mark.

Firstly, we have to simplify; as Mr Buzek rightly said, we have to be simpler. We have to create our own brand of innovation that everybody knows.

For the first list, the Council revoked its decision on 23 January 2018 and removed Tunisia from that list together with seven other countries, including Panama. Of which act. But for the other, the Commission maintains its position, and I was not convinced by its arguments at the LIBE-ECON meeting on 29 January. That is why, on behalf of my group, I have tabled this objection so that the plenary could speak. The issue is not the fight against money laundering or the financing of terrorism — we all agree to move forward and even more — it is a question of posting and priorities in this area. At the beginning of December, the blacklist included only eleven countries, five of them from MENA, all at war. Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen plus Iran, but not Libya and no Gulf country. What is Tunisia coming to do here? We are told, of course, that other countries will come, including European countries. Let me be skeptical. We are also told that listing on this list is not worth sanction, but increased monitoring. That's true, but what signal do we send to investors and creditors in Tunisia? What damage will have been done until the Commission returns to its delegated act? Will she do it? And if, yes, when? Tunisia remains economically fragile; it is moving step by step in its democratic transition. Should we recall that its new institutions did not really start their work until 2015 and that the amendment of the legislation on these subjects was among the first steps taken? This which initiated the FATF procedure! It's a big one! Is it really the best way to support Tunisia, as we continue to proclaim, than to put it on this list? The FATF assessment on which the Board's decision was based was in May 2016. However, a new assessment was published on 6 December 2017, prior to the publication of the delegated act. The FATF itself has just drawn the consequences by taking Tunisia out of high-risk countries and putting it on the list of countries under surveillance, which endorsed the Tunisian government's progress and commitments. More than 26 commitments honoured at the beginning of December and more since! So why does the Commission want to keep Tunisia on this list at all costs? Are there no other countries, more dangerous for the European Union, to register more urgently? Is it so complicated to redo the delegated act? How does the Commission work on FATF countries and on what priorities? Mrs Mogherini reiterated, even today, that the stability of Tunisia and the full realization of its democratic transition are priority issues for the European Union, which will always be alongside that country. We must act in this direction, Commissioner. I am personally concerned that the stakes are different and that we are trying to put pressure on Tunisia to implement more quickly other reforms, including some so-called “structural” reforms.

This Parliament, in particular, has fought hard to ensure that our rules against money laundering set a gold standard for the world, most recently in December when we reached agreement on the latest upgrade of the Anti-Money-Laundering Directive. The list of high-risk third countries plays an important role in the EU’s framework and in protecting the EU financial system against the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing. As regards Tunisia, the situation is clear. Tunisia still shows strategic deficiencies in this field, which today justify its inclusion on the EU list of high-risk third countries. The Commission welcomes and supports Tunisia’s efforts to remedy the situation. An action plan was agreed between Tunisia and the Financial Action Task Force in December. The Commission strongly welcomes the fact that Tunisia is now accelerating the implementation of those agreed actions. We are in close contact and have regular meetings with the Tunisian authorities in this regard, but there is still work to be done, notably as regards regulation and supervision of the non-financial sector, transparency of beneficial ownership and targeted financial sanctions. We count on Tunisia to remove those deficiencies swiftly, on the basis of the action plan agreed with the Financial Action Task Force, and the Commission stands ready to provide support. The Commission exchanged views on this issue in a joint meeting of the Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) and Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) committees last week, and the Commission made a formal declaration, describing the situation as I have just done and making a commitment to support Tunisia in this process. Today, I would like to reaffirm that Tunisia is a privileged partner for the European Union, and we commit to reassessing Tunisia’s progress as soon as possible during this year of 2018, with the aim of Tunisia being de-listed both by the Financial Action Task Force and by the EU. However, we are not there yet. There is still work to be done by Tunisia, and until then we have to fulfil our responsibility to protect the European Union and its financial system against the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing.

It is important to recognise that this is one of the legacies of the kleptocracy that for decades oppressed and ungoverned Tunisia.

Sri Lanka shows deficiencies in international cooperation, in particular the provision of mutual legal assistance, inappropriate regulation and supervision of the non—financial sector, customer due diligence requirements for designated non—financial businesses and professions, weakness in risk—based supervision in the financial sector with a low level of sanctions, shortcomings in access to beneficial ownership information for legal persons, as well as for legal arrangements or inadequate regime on targeted financial sanctions and some other deficiencies. Turning back to Tunisia, the Commission would like to welcome again the high—level commitment shown by Tunisia and its efforts in addressing its strategic deficiencies in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. Strong rules in the area help ensure security and stability, especially in the current context of terrorist threats in the EU and its neighbourhood. They are also necessary to ensure a sound, stable and solid financial system, which is a condition for sustainable growth. The Commission is therefore fully committed to support Tunisia in these efforts. This is something I can promise in this place. We are committed to support and to help. The European Union and Tunisia have a privileged partnership and we are here to support our partners. It is in our mutual interest. Our experts are in close cooperation to provide this assistance.  I hear the concerns expressed by Members of this Parliament today. I also confirm that we will work together to ensure that Tunisia can be rapidly removed, but the actual timing will depend on Tunisia’s own efforts. At the same time, I want to reassure you that the EU listing has no punitive intention. It will not hinder our development policy, it will not restrict trade relations, and it will not block financial transactions. Finally, Parliament has called on the Commission to have a more ambitious and autonomous assessment of third countries’ risk. We have to ensure the success of this important process by showing from the beginning that the EU’s autonomous assessment is objective and based on facts.

We are talking about political criteria, subjective and hardly quantifiable, which can function as a pretext to reduce funds for Member States. I know the efforts Romania is making to ensure its citizens a better life and I know how much these efforts depend on the cohesion funds. I wish that any decision being discussed at the level of the European Council and the European Commission should take account, first of all, of the development needs of the Member States. The stronger their economies, the stronger the European Union is.

The elections in the Czech Republic were referred to as a referendum between heading west or east. Yes, President Zeman pulls us a lot east and is welcome in Moscow as well as Beijing. But his election was still related to something else. The Czech Republic is well off economically. Still, many people aren't happy with their situation and feel that they don't profit from economic development, that they don't actually participate in it. GDP in Prague highly exceeds the average of the European Union, but in many places in the Czech Republic people have wages that are half that of the minimum wage in France or Germany. People are afraid of unmastered immigration, the current and future. Even as Central Europeans, we may have become accustomed to a higher standard.

I believe it is a mistake to reduce the funds of the Union's main investment policy, in a Europe still rehearsed by the economic crisis, which has heightened the disparities within itself economic, political and social. For poorer regions, such as those in southern Italy, it would mean losing between four and six billion euros, considering the CAP cuts announced by the German Commissioner. On the contrary, we should strengthen investment, also adding new resources on security and defence, excluding national co-financing from the Stability Pact, bind the disbursement of all funds from the European budget for respect for the rule of law and intra-European solidarity. Rather than subverting and frustrating cohesion policy, let us strive to provide the European Union with adequate resources through serious reconnaissance and identification of own resources.

This list has finally been published by the Council in December last year and this is a step in the right direction. I welcome the decision by the Council, but there are a number of doubts about firstly, the criteria that have been used in order to establish this list. Let me remind you that only 17 countries or territories have been included on that list, whereas we have evidence that many more jurisdictions should also be considered. But more important is the fact that just after one month, in January, the Council has removed eight countries from that list. So my proposal to the Council is, firstly, to give us a precise list of criteria and, secondly, to tell us how this list will be developed in order to fight tax evasion and tax avoidance across the world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 234, "date": "2018-02-05.json", "name": "Julie Ward (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124963", "text": "   – Madam President, the UK arts sector is a hugely significant industry, contributing over GBP 87 billion to our economy and providing jobs to more than two million people. It returns more than the automotive, oil and gas, aerospace and life sciences industries combined. Our membership of the EU has been key to that success, with the majority of the sector voting to remain. So Theresa May’s hard Brexit will have a devastating impact on our creative industries. For example, music tours are programmed years in advance and the UK Government’s negative position on key policy areas, such as membership of the single market and the customs union, is very damaging.  Already, we have seen two top orchestras leave Britain because of Brexit, relocating to Belgium and Italy, and more will follow. I recently attended the Association of British Orchestras’ conference in Wales, where the sector made it clear that freedom of movement is vital. The costs of a hard Brexit will fall directly on producers, with many tours becoming unviable, and this scenario will be replicated across the whole of the creative industries and mean fewer concerts by our favourite bands and musicians. As Billy Bragg says, ‘music can heal the wounds of Brexit’. Let’s ensure it can.

In the case of HIV alone, according to the Office of Surveillance of HIV-AIDS cases, in 2017, there was an increase of 5.9% per thousand of the infected population. In this context, I believe that we need to raise an alarm signal in the direction of the urgent review of the European Union's health policies and we need to get the EU Health Commissioner to speed up the implementation of the recommendations of the European Parliament resolution of July 2017. Without a generalised programme applicable across all Member States and without subsidising tests and treatments for disadvantaged categories, in a few years it will probably be impossible to control the spread of these diseases.
