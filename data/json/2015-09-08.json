Mr President, I would like to thank the First of all, I would like to thank my co-rapporteur, Giulia Moi. We have worked very well together and are united in what we are now presenting to Parliament for a vote at first reading. We want to turn two proposals for directives from the European Commission into a single regulation that applies equally in all Member States. This is particularly important on an issue as fundamental as cloning. All Member States must act equally. This is what the common internal market requires. Our proposal is very consistent. We want to ban cloning in principle, because cloning is animal cruelty. The success rate is exceptionally low: ten percent, says EFSA. This varies according to animal species, but ultimately a minimal success. Why is that? Cloning technology has not matured, and in the last twelve years there has been no progress at all on this technique. The mortality rate remains the same. Live-born animals – the few born alive – suffer to a large extent from deformities, malformations of internal organs or external extremities, they suffer from immunodeficiency and, for example, from problems of the respiratory tract. As a result, many of these live-born animals die in the first few weeks, before they are put down. And they die agonizingly. Can we allow this to happen? Is it not also our job to ensure the welfare of animals? As I said, this technique is used even though it does not work. Yes, it is not applied directly in the European Union, but in third countries – in North America, I think perhaps also in South America, in China, for example – and we benefit from it, because we can import so far. We can import reproductive material or the descendants of cloned animals. Is that right? Is it right that we say: yes, we have nothing to do with cloning technology, it is not used in Europe, but we would like to have the propagating material. That is a sham! We wash our hands of innocence and let others do the dirty work, but we want to profit from the success. And is the success really so great? As I said, mortality is extremely high. And in our opinion, the progress of breeding is extremely limited. Because there are biological limits in animals. At some point, the body of a farm animal is exhausted, and everything else – still more production increase, more muscle packs still put on an animal, still more milk on the animal – is ultimately animal cruelty in livestock farming. After all, cloning impoverishes the gene pool of our farm animals worldwide. Can we allow this to happen? Incidentally, it is not only the cloned animals themselves that survive, but also the mothers who suffer. This, too, must be taken into account. The removal and re-insertion of the oocytes is not harmless and there are a high number of caesarean sections. At the end of the day, there is something that moves us here, and the European Parliament has always moved, just as it worries our citizens in the European Union: it is a fact that every reproductive technique developed for farm animals has ultimately reached humans. And it is precisely this concern that is driving people in the European Union around. That is another reason why they are against cloning. They do not want this, because it is precisely this fear that cloning will eventually be applied to humans, once it works properly. So: Defend the beginnings! It actually touches the roots of our own, our human existence. Nor do our citizens want to have the meat of cloned animals on their plates. But they may already be cheered on. That is why we want to ban everything. We want to ban not only the use of cloning technology in the European Union, but also the import of reproductive material, the import ation of clones and their descendants. And we want, in principle, a labelling requirement for what may have already landed on our market. Is that unrealistic? We think: No. Traceability is possible, as experience with GMOs has shown. In the case of animal feed and food, it was easy to introduce a traceability system for third countries worldwide. And if the European Commission now says' 'Oh, but this is not possible with farm animals', then we do not think that is true. Especially in farm animals there are breeding books. Farm animals are therefore even more traceable according to their origin. That is our view, and we think that all is feasible. I would therefore ask the European Commission to: to reconsider the whole thing. Above all, I would ask my fellow Members in this House to give massive support to our joint report , the report by Giulia Moi and myself. You are doing something for animal welfare, and you are also doing something for the European Union's community of values. We have a responsibility here as Members of the European Parliament. Sometimes politics has to set limits, and today it is. Please help us to draw this line!

We are well aware that the directive deals with farm animals and that our farmers are now facing strong foreign competition, due to under-controlled practices such as cloning; But we also know that Europe bases its value on the quality of its products and not on quantity alone. The production and marketing within the European Union of products derived from cloned animals is a matter of concern to us and to which we must pay due sensitivity, but without underestimating the health and welfare of animals, offspring and what unsead DNA can cause in human health.  Known are the cases of premature death of clones, mutilation in the offspring, intoxication of surrogate mothers, subjected to strong hormonal and antibiotic treatments. But if all this is known to us, there remains doubts as to the nutritional intake that a cloned food, or rather a food that derives from the offspring of a clone – which is what we then import from third countries – can give, and what consequences the human being can be subjected to after its continuous administration. We are therefore called upon to protect the well-being of our citizens, to take responsibility for marketing, importing or using these foods. Are we ready to turn our families and future generations into experiment guinea pigs?  Today we are living in a time when the food system already lends itself to paradoxes such as overnonutrition or malnutrition, we cannot continue to aggravate it with products that are not scientifically proven. We have therefore decided in the text of the report to exclude this practice within the Union, to label products derived from clone offspring, knowing that in the past the European Commission has already prepared a system for this. We have also decided not to allow this practice to be used for profit and gaming purposes, as is unfortunately already the case for racehorses. We should make this Europe better, not make it worse, venturing into roads from which it would then be difficult to go back.  I hope that the sensitivity shown by myself and my colleagues in dealing with this issue and in working on this report will match the same sensitivity that will guide your vote today. Ladies and gentlemen, I beg you, there are no certain studies on the use and administration of foods obtained from the offspring of cloned animals. Today you have a great responsibility, especially towards your children, your families, their future. You can vote today on whether to have sick children in the future and whether your children will be the lab guinea pigs of a few companies that will make a profit on your skin.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, first let me thank the two rapporteurs, Renate Sommer and Giulia Moi, for the report we have in front of us today. I very much appreciate your hard work and commitment. I am also pleased to see that Ms Sommer and Ms Moi fully support the ban on cloning which has been proposed. I also agree that any measures taken now would need to be reviewed at a later stage. These points aside, I am sorry to have to recognise that the amendments would leave little of the initial Commission proposals. Let me remind you that the Commission had proposed to ban the use of the cloning technique in the European Union for five species, as well as the import of live clones from third countries. I must reiterate my support for these initial proposals. I am confident that they protect the health and welfare of animals, allow for innovation where desirable and take account of citizens’ concerns. The report that we are discussing today seeks to enlarge significantly this reasonable ban, to include descendants of clones as well as food and feed from descendants of clones. It also seeks to enlarge the ban to include all animal species and their products. Mr President, honourable Members, last February we discussed all aspects of cloning. I remember that on that occasion I explained that the proposal was shaped in the light of comprehensive analysis of the legal powers available, rigorous impact assessment and consideration of the principle of proportionality. The current Commission has upheld these proposals because they are well balanced and respect the legal framework within which we all must operate. Unfortunately, I am afraid that many of the amendments in the report which we are discussing are legally impossible or disproportionate. Allow me to explain some of the Commission’s reservations. The report seeks to enlarge the scope to include descendants of cloned animals. However, descendants of clones are conceived through conventional methods and therefore give rise to neither food safety nor animal welfare concerns. It follows that all measures proposed regarding descendants of clones, and food or feed obtained from such descendants, can be justified only with reference to ethical presumed concerns. To support the view that such extended ethical concerns exist, the report points to the 2008 Eurobarometer study. It can, indeed, be inferred from this study that a majority of European Union citizens disapprove of cloning. However, if we look closer, it reveals that half of those interviewed thought incorrectly that animal cloning involved genetic modification. If half of the interviewees formed their opinion on incorrect presumptions then the outcome of the study has to be treated with a great deal of caution. Indeed, the results have insufficient credibility to justify far-reaching measures with a significant impact for our agriculture. In addition, the line of argument to justify measures on descendants appears to be that even if animal welfare is not compromised in cloned descendants, their very existence is an animal welfare concern for ethical reasons. Allow me to express the Commission’s doubts as to using this distant link to animal welfare concerns as a justification for such a wide ban. The Commission, as guardian of the Treaty, has an explicit obligation to respect the legal limits of the Treaty. In the case of cloning, the Treaties do not provide specific powers to address the ethical concerns that are the motivation for most of the amendments proposed in the report. Measures that are motivated essentially by ethical concerns can be proposed only under Article 352 of the Treaty – the flexibility clause. The flexibility clause allows the Union to act beyond the power of action conferred upon it by the Treaties if the objective pursued so requires. For that reason, any proposal based on Article 352 must be adopted separately under different legislative procedures. Mr President, honourable Members, I recognise that the idea of manipulating animals as if they were mere objects creates resentment and is perceived as morally wrong. At the same time, however, I firmly believe that the Commission has proposed sound and justified measures that represent a balanced workable approach to address the issues of animal cloning and to reconcile science and ethics. Therefore we should proceed on this basis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Jude Kirton-Darling", "mepid": "124953", "text": "   rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. – Mr President, millions across Europe are saying that they will not accept global trade any more if it means trading away the rules and standards we hold dearly. In showing that we can still decide for ourselves and keep – or even strengthen – the protections that we deem necessary, while of course respecting our international commitments, this legislation demonstrates that we can regulate globalisation for the benefit of people and the planet. In the Committee on International Trade we reviewed this proposal to ensure that it was absolutely compatible with WTO rules. We even found that we could go further than the Commission had initially proposed and ban not just the cloned animals, but also their offspring.

Personally, I think it is a perfectly expendable technique, except for the conservation of some endangered species, but there we have it, and the European Union needs legislation on this. This is a great report, and in this House we agree to ban the technique of cloning for animal welfare reasons and for the negative position of public opinion on this technique. However, we should point out that the scientific reports of the Food Safety Agency indicate that there are no food safety problems with products from cloned animals – meat or other products – and that there is currently no distinction between the meat of a cloned animal and that of an animal that has not been cloned, since there is no genetic modification and there is currently no valid analytical methodology , accredited and harmonised to differentiate them.  However, the legislation applicable in the European Union must also apply to the products we import, because we cannot subject our farmers to conditions other than those of third-country farmers. For all this, and although we think this is a great report, in the Committee on Agriculture the members of my political group differ by two points. In particular, we believe that the importation of genetic reproduction material from cloned animals or their offspring should be allowed by administrative authorisation. At the same time, the importation of the first and second generation of cloned animals, descendants of cloned animals or their products should also be authorised by appropriate labelling and import certificate. Finally, I think we have a big problem, but in any case we must approximate our positions and come to legislation that is coherent, because it is of no use legislating if this legislation cannot then be applied or cannot be verified to be applied.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Madam President, you were right to say that the consumption of meat from animals that have been cloned does not pose any health risks. Their two arguments against cloning were, firstly, animal welfare considerations and, secondly, the public image of cloning. I believe that we should agree that the image is not a sufficient reason to ban an innovative technology in principle.  Animal welfare, on the other hand, can be guaranteed by animal welfare legislation in cases where cloning actually leads to a burden on animals.

It would not be good for our scientists and our scientific system, because we will not allow them to move forward in this area. But it's public opinion.

The problem is the cloning of animals for food, and we've been at the same point in the past mandate. At that time, the institutional deadlock could not be overcome and we were unable to regulate the issue of cloning, because each institution supported a different point of view. But we have to start from what people want.  It is clear that Europeans do not want to consume food from cloned animals. 70% of Europeans believe that the production of food from cloned animals should not be encouraged and only 15% of europeans feel the opposite, according to the latest Eurobarometer on the subject.  Unfortunately, the Council and the Commission seem to have set out to introduce the cloning process into the food chain without taking into account this desire and despite the fact that we cannot anticipate the long-term consequences of this decision. We are called upon to decide on an issue that will impact many generations and we are not allowed to play with their future. It is not enough to prohibit cloning, we must also prohibit the import of these foods. We do not need cloning to provide the European Union's food needs. To do so, it is enough to encourage a fair agricultural policy and to support producers.

When it comes to EU policy—making our core guiding principles should be quite simple: follow the science. Evidence-based policy—making should be at the heart of what we do. For example, we have to take into account the impact of a ban if it were to include germinal products of cloned animals – their descendants – and embryo clones. That could have serious consequences for animal breeders and scientific research in Europe. In 2008, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) found no indication of any differences in food safety between food products from healthy cloned animals compared to those from conventionally—bred animals. A ban on the import of these products would be challenged according to the existing WTO rules. This is a very sensitive issue, I am aware of that, and there are legitimate concerns about animal welfare.

It's morally reprehensible and it should be banned. European citizens do not want it, consumers do not want it. The farmers don't need it and the animals pay the price. That's what cloning is about. First of all, consumers. They reject it en masse and want a free choice to refuse it. So if it's already on the market, they want good labelling. It will lead to many problems in the agricultural sector, much more than we already have, because it will lead to the demise of small farmers. Moreover, there is immeasurable animal cruelty. Because the only goal is to create offspring of highly productive animals. Even after three decades of research, no progress has been made, when it comes to animal welfare, in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. A vast majority of animals still die at birth and only a small percentage make it through the first year of life, suffering from diseases and abnormalities. Many surrogate mothers suffer unbearably, they suffer from the procedure themselves and they all have to undergo a caesarean section.

An earlier third reading in the novel food dossier simply failed because of the Commission's rigid attitude in this matter. The Commission - let us be honest - has waited far too long for these proposals, which are far too late and, moreover, split into two pieces, two directives whose second directive was actually tabled with a legal basis which we can only call scandalous. All we could do was agree and the Member States had to decide unanimously.  We know that some in the Barroso Commission actually wanted to come up with a stronger proposal. Tonio Borg also wanted this, but that has been prevented by a number of Commissioners, including the Belgian Commissioner for Trade, under pressure from the TTIP context. I am very pleased with the proposal that is now before us. I think we are sending a very clear signal to the Member States and to the European Commission. It is very good that we are making these two proposals for a directive into a single regulation. Parliament wants a clear ban on the cloning of animals for food production. We also do not want the import or sale of cloned animals, and perhaps the most important message is that this Parliament wants a ban on the marketing of food from cloned animals and indeed, Mr Andriukaitis, of their descendants.  What are the reasons for that? They have already been mentioned in the debate. Cloning has a disastrous effect on animal welfare, leads to greater mortality, more risk of disease, genetic abnormalities. Moreover, in the long term, cloning poses a risk to genetic diversity, and as has been said, European consumers do not want to know about this kind of food either.

Democracy must take precedation of animal cruelty.

We do not need EU legislation on what British farmers can do and on what British consumers can eat – but ‘British’ consumers is the key word: it is up to them. If British consumers do not want to eat clones and the products of clones, they can make their wishes known to the retailers, as they did about battery chickens 40 or 50 years ago. The retailers can then incorporate non-cloning into their assurance schemes and this will guarantee that there are more British products on British supermarket shelves. That is the way to approach it. In any case, I do not think cloning is going to catch on to any great degree for two reasons. The first is that it assumes perfection – that you have ‘got there’ – when in fact there is always somebody somewhere who will produce something better, and the clone becomes redundant. The second reason I do not think it will catch on is because of the difficulties involved. We have heard about the deformities and mortality. These represent costs, and it is quite likely these costs will outweigh any benefit of cloning. Finally, I would like to say that we should never dismiss a technology out of hand.

I would remind you that countries that practice animal cloning have never kept a record of which animal is derived from a clone or not. As the text is presented and amended by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, we will not be able to ensure that products from cloned animals or their descendants do not reach our plates. It is therefore clear that the declaration provided by this text is not sufficient to provide this guarantee because, in the absence of a lineage register, exporters may be mistaken in good faith.  Let's be clear and dare to tell consumers the truth. To date, there is no technology to verify whether or not a product is from a cloned animal. The only way to assure citizens of the absence of clone products is to suspend imports of the affected products from the countries that allow their trade, including under the TTIP under negotiation. So I tabled an amendment for the ENF group to protect consumers. Any elected official of common sense or rejecting the TTIP should support him.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 21, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Zoltán Balczó (NI).", "mepid": "96877", "text": "   – Animal cloning is such an intervention in the natural order created that ethically based rejection rightly arises.

The legislation tabled by the Commission cannot be adopted and is quite rightly rewritten by the rapporteurs' amendments on fundamental issues. The ban on cloning will be extended, expanding the range of farm animals named by the Commission. The amendment would prohibit not only the cloning of animals, but also the import of reproductive material from third countries and the marketing of food from animal clones and their offspring. This is linked to the planned EU-US Free Trade Agreement. Quite rightly, the ban would not only be introduced temporarily and would be a regulation instead of a directive, closing loopholes in transposition.

Personally, I also very much support this report. Cloned animals suffer. And it is a requirement – it is not private ethics, it is a commandment – of the treaties that we take animal welfare into account. That is why it is also legally imperative that we do something about this. Now, of course, it can be argued that at some point this technique may be improved and is more \"effective\". But let me be very clear: this is the direct route to the cloned person. Because everything that works in animals without problems is done in humans. I don't think anyone wants to pave the way for the cloned person here. The question arises: how can we control legislation? This is important. I have already dealt with genetics scientifically in my doctoral thesis, and I am currently legislating for medical diagnostics, which also includes DNA diagnostics. My shadow rapporteur, Mrs Boszan, is sitting there, as are many other Members. I have therefore asked the companies dealing with DNA diagnostics: if we pass such a law, can you bring a test? \"Yes, we'll have the test in three to four months.\" So those, the Commission or some colleagues who say that it is not demonstrable, should really talk to the experts. I would like to say one thing to you, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen: it is, in any case, ten times easier than to detect feed or food that has been modified by means of genetic engineering. This is much easier. And, with all due respect, Commissioner – as you know that I personally appreciate you – to make a proposal for a national ban on the marketing of genetically modified feed and, at the same time, to say that what we are asking for here is undetectable, that is absurd. In other words, we will adopt the Sommer/Moi report by a large majority, we will be willing to compromise.

The difference today in the debate is very much about whether there should be an eternal and total ban, or whether we should have a temporary ban. In the nature of the temporary ban, when technology may develop with the future and we make scientific progress, we must, of course, make a balance and see if we need to change our legislation. In this respect, I think that the Commissioner has struck a much better balance than our two rapporteurs-general in the European Parliament. The most problematic thing for me is when we make the great extension of the concept to include offspring of cloned animals. Here we see that there is quite a large part of European agricultural production today, where we import genetic material into our own meat production or milk production. This means that you certainly eat cheese on a daily basis or drink milk derived from the offspring of a cloned animal. There is a scientific fear as soon as we look at our agricultural sector. However, if we are to be able to feed more mouths on this earth, we must continuously develop our methods and ensure that European agriculture is also more efficient in the future. However, this must not be at the expense of animal welfare. That is why we are in favour of the temporary ban, but not an eternal and long-term ban, which, in my view, is not based on any type of scientific ity but is only driven by people's fear of science in agricultural production. Since the day we started domesticating animals, having domestic animals, we have been trying to breed and increase production, get more meat from our meat animals, get more milk from our dairy animals. Even when it comes to our crops, we have ensured that they have become better and more viable. We have refined them continuously. We must be able to continue to do so in the future.

As a result, diversity and livestock are now at a threat. On the other hand, we have a genetic concentration by companies.

In 2010, however, the Commission considered, I quote, \"appropriate\" the establishment of traceability measures, which are required not only by us, the citizens, but also by the Council.

We have discussed the public opinion on cloning here in the plenary, but let me just recount a story: earlier this year in Ireland, we had a report of a famous show-jumping stallion called Cruising who passed away, but whose owner had kept genetic material and created two colt foals from this wonderful show-jumping horse. The public reaction was very positive, because they liked and appreciated the skills and attributes of that fine animal and that they had been preserved through cloning. It is an expensive technique: it cost over EUR 100,000.  I bring that to your attention to say that sometimes the public have different views on the one issue, depending on the species. I share Mr Federley’s earlier comments. We have a concern in agriculture, which is ‘how do you trace back’? Do you close off an avenue for genetic potential, mindful – and I am very mindful where there are animal welfare concerns – that we cannot allow animals to suffer.

Research and studies carried out today show that more than 80% of the population of the European Union does not want to consume food from cloned animals. In those circumstances, the traceability of foodstuffs, as well as germination material arriving on the internal market of the European Union, must contain all import licences to ensure that they do not come from animals or descendants resulting from this process.  On the other hand, animal cloning is practically not only a new technology, which is not well known, but also a welcome method of research, even if we stop only on the conservation of endangered animal breeds, the production of medicines, and not only.

However, as the European Parliament is now doing, calling for a total ban on all-time food from clones and also their offspring of all generations is directly irresponsible. I will give three reasons why: firstly, it is unscientific and anti-technology because technology is evolving and progressing. To say that there has been no development in this area for 30 years is downright disingenuous. If that were the case, we would not have had this debate here today. Secondly, it is impossible to control, because we do not eat what are clones, except possibly their offspring. How could we know if an animal's ancestor's ancestor was a clone? It's as impossible as knowing if someone's great-grandfather was a identical twin. My third reason is that, in practice, this only means a ban on imports of food from more and more countries in the world. Protectionists may think that is a good thing, but do not forget that we are net exporters of food. Our bans on them will be answered by their ban on us.

I believe that this is an important part of the work against the shadow economy. Although this document seems a little technical, it does have great meanings of principle.  Olaf, the European Anti-Fraud Office, has estimated that the European Union and its Member States are losing a couple of hundred million euros in tax revenue every year due to cigarette smuggling alone. This is a lot of money and it is important to get to grips with this, not only because of the civic morale, but also because of the economy. How do we get to the smugglers? Firstly, a common EU database and a modern container movements monitoring system will now be created. Digital technology will help in this. It is possible to monitor the movements of containers and that is important. As I said at the beginning, it is tobacco, alcohol and energy products that are usually linked to fraud. However, the challenge was to ensure the security of sensitive export data and then to open this export data in a common database. We reached a compromise. We came to the end that the export data stored in the registers would be limited to excise goods, in other words tobacco and alcohol, which are essential. We also accelerated the investigation into fraud. Member States must provide immediate information and documents in suspected cases of fraud within four weeks. These data protection rules were also aligned in accordance with EU regulations. We included an inspection clause, according to which it will be possible to assess this whole in a couple of years' time. As a whole, this will provide olaf, the European Anti-Fraud Office, with a modern tool for combating fraud and will enhance the effectiveness of investigations. This is a positive example of new regulation, which, if implemented, will bring a significant amount of euros into the EU and Member States' budgets.

The Commission has always appreciated the strong support from Parliament to protect the European economy and European taxpayers’ money from fraud and this is now a shared commitment for both the Commission and Parliament.  Customs-related fraud is a cross-border phenomenon which needs to be tackled centrally. Therefore, it is important that the relevant customs authorities of the Member States be equipped with the right tools to cooperate between themselves and with the Commission and to pursue fraudsters effectively at European level. It was against this background that, in 2013, the Commission proposed a number of improvements to our basic regulation governing the cooperation of customs authorities in the fight against fraud. This regulation came into being almost 20 years ago and it is important that we keep it up to date with modern technologies.  Information sharing is a key element in that respect. The lack of available information on, in particular, container movements, can lead to customs fraud detrimental to national and European budgets and cause serious damage to the European economy. Our proposals will enable us to curb this fraud and strengthen both the detection and investigation of fraudulent activities in the area of customs. The Commission has paid particular attention to striking a careful balance between the necessity to have a fraud-proof system on the one hand and avoiding overburdening businesses on the other.  We are grateful for the support from Parliament and the Member States for the Commission’s proposal. I would also like to take this opportunity to commend the diligent work of Parliament’s previous and current rapporteurs on tax, especially Ms Liisa Jaakonsaari. The constructive attitude of Parliament, but also of the Council, has allowed for a swift negotiation and conclusion of the legislative process.

The adoption of this Regulation on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and of the European Commission is intended to contribute to the proper application of the rules on customs and agricultural matters. The main objective of the Regulation is to improve the detection and investigation of customs fraud and thus to combat customs fraud effectively throughout the European Union. Greater emphasis should also be placed on preventing and intensifying the exchange of information and available evidence between Member States. It is important to improve the availability of data on imports, exports and transit, as well as data on container movements at national level. As customs workers currently have no possibility of verifying whether the declared origin of the goods coincides with the container route, stepping up cooperation between member states' administrations would reduce the abuse of the transit system and allow for better exchange of information that could serve as evidence in criminal and administrative proceedings in the Member States. This Regulation shall also avoid delays and unnecessary time losses at the investigation stage. It will also ensure that legislation is brought into line with the Treaty of Lisbon as regards the protection of personal data, in particular in the area of procedures and time limits.

National customs authorities should talk to each other and should also exchange information with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).

This Regulation brings improvements as it aims to simplify and speed up the processes in the review of goods used by consumers in the European Union. At the same time, it is trying to reduce or remove unnecessary bureaucracy, which often presents obstacles and problems at customs. Until now, customs officials have had difficulties in determining whether the declaration of origin of the goods corresponds to the actual course of the container route. Despite the inspection of the documents and also the visual inspection of the goods, the checks were of a limited nature. Many cases of falsified declarations, as well as poor, limited supervision, have left the European Union and its members with quite a few financial consequences due to financial losses, which of course also has a significant impact on budgets. I believe that the inclusion of 'export data' in the regulation is a very important provision, as this will make it easier for Member States to combat fraud. OLAF has identified clear and irrefutable information that some of the products exported, such as tobacco transhipped to and back to third countries, have been back in the EU. Which allowed for tax avoidance. And as a member of the Greens Group, I have advocated the inclusion of 'export data' in the regulation, as this reduces the possibility of fraud. In such cases, of course, transparency is needed and, above all, transparency is ensured, which we also wanted to achieve through the regulation. For this reason, I think that, of course, this regulation must also be supported, because we have managed to reach a compromise that more satisfies all parties. I am thinking here, in particular, of including 'export data for sensitive goods', such as tobacco, alcohol and minerals, in so-called directories, which, with the establishment of this regulation, will be more, easier to control and the competent authorities will have access to it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 89, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Margot Parker", "mepid": "124945", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Madam President, for this proposal at second reading we have tabled a complete rejection of the whole idea. This is for two reasons.  The first is because we, the elected members of this Parliament, have the duty to be held accountable to our electorate who democratically elected us here to represent them. I firmly believe that we owe it to our constituents to see how their representatives have voted. Sadly, due to the democratic process in the EU, this can only be achieved by tabling a complete rejection of the proposal.  The second reason for rejecting the proposal is because we are opposed to this over-reaction to customs fraud, and to the centralisation of powers and delegation to the Commission that this report brings. Do not get me wrong: I am absolutely in support of combating customs-related fraud, but I am wholly against this proposal, which serves only to plaster over the cracks and does not address the origins of the customs-related fraud. To deal with customs-related fraud issues is not to add bureaucracy and burdens for Member States, but to question the fundamental pillars of the single market, the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital between Member States by establishing and maintaining a database that will contain detailed information on imports, exports and transit of goods, including those within a Member State.  The EU is raising great data protection concerns for businesses, to say nothing of the additional costs that come as a result of starting up a project like this. We are, as sovereign nations should of course be, encouraging greater mutual assistance and cooperation in the second fight against fraud but I say it once again: this does not require a centralised EU database to be established.  The whole approach to combating customs-related fraud feels awfully similar to the idea of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

I would like to return briefly to three aspects which seem to me to be the most significant. The first, of course, concerns certainty for consumers: the control guarantees those who will use those products that they do not have in front of them in disguise products that have been altered, counterfeited and therefore different from those that are perceived or how they are presented.  The second issue also concerns competition between companies, all counterfeiting has the immediate, almost automatic effect of altering relations between companies, between those who behave loyally, produce according to the rules, respect them and those who, instead, by placing second-level products on the market, do so through alteration processes that lead to negative consequences, both on people who then consume , but also on the economic relations between companies.  Finally, there is one aspect that I would not like to be forgotten, and that is the fight against crime: where there is counterfeiting there is normally an illegal activity that stimulates crime.

As information on around 30 000 cases of suspected fraud is not available, the actual scale of the problem is considerably greater. This system urgently needed reform because it became clear that the introduction of e-customs in 2011, in which the background documents on imports and exports are no longer left by customs administrations but by economic operators, has led to delays in investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office in the customs field, because in order to obtain these documents, OLAF needs the mediation assistance of customs administrations. Although consumer protection is at a very high level in the European Union, it is very important that work is constantly being made to improve it and make it more effective.

This Regulation brings improvements as it aims to simplify and speed up the processes of the examination of goods. At the same time, it is trying to reduce or remove unnecessary bureaucracy, which often presents obstacles and problems at customs. Until now, customs officials have had difficulties in determining whether the declaration of origin of the goods corresponds to the actual course of the container route. Despite the inspection of the documents and also the visual inspection of the goods, the checks were of a limited nature. Many cases of falsified declarations, as well as limited controls, have led the EU and its Member States to financial losses. I believe that the inclusion of 'export data' in the regulation is important, as this will make it easier for Member States to combat fraud. OLAF has identified clear and irrefutable information on the lack of exported products, such as tobacco, transhipped to third countries and then back to the EU, which allowed tax avoidance.

Visual checks and the checking of documents are limited. In my opinion, this second reading report provides a solid basis for taking a more stringent approach to this customs-related fraud, with an eye for the protection of privacy. By setting up a registration system for products covered by excise duties in the form of a European database and by improving border surveillance systems, lost tax revenue can be kept to a minimum.

Following a complaint from Canada and Norway, the WTO decided that the BMR exception should be deleted and the IG exception should be specified in order to take a clearer view of the protection of the Inuit tradition. Compliance with WTO recommendations and decisions is of great importance for efficient global trade, and discrimination against individual trading partners is opposed to free trade.

In 2009, the European Union completely banned the trade in seal products, with two exceptions.

The Commission's proposal completely rejects the MRM exception to the Provision and constitutes a new criterion for IC exclusion. As there are nevertheless several members of the Baltic and Nordic countries who support amendments to restore the modified MRM exception, this may cause legal problems with the World Trade Organisation.

In line with the rapporteurs' views, I am also of the opinion that the negative consequences of cloning, inter alia, on animal welfare are incomparably greater than any possible positive impact.

Our ENF MEPs have amended the text to ensure the safety of European citizens and, in the absence of technical checks, it is preferable to suspend imports of products from countries that authorise the trade in cloned products.   I abstained on this text because even if it puts some brakes on imports, there is still no real traceability of cloned products (certificates are guaranteed only on the good faith of breeders and there is no evidence that the products are not indirectly derived from cloned animals).

The European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) considers cloning primarily a danger to animal welfare associated with the low efficiency of the technique.  EFSA has seen animal welfare issues related to the health of surrogate mothers and clones alone. Surrogate mothers especially suffer from placenta disorders, which contributes to increased levels of miscarriage. This contributes, inter alia, to the low effectiveness of the technique (6-15 % for cattle and 6% for pigs) and the need to implant clone embryos in several females to obtain a single clone. Likewise, two Eurobarometer surveys from 2008 (in particular the cloning survey) and 2010 (on bio-technology with specific questions on cloning) resulted in a negative perception by Union citizens of the use of the technique cloned for production purposes.  I therefore agree with the proposal for this directive, which provides for the suspension of the use of cloning techniques for the purpose of food production and the marketing of live animal clones. This will limit temporary bans on production techniques, which cause suffering in animals, to areas where they appear to be of particular benefit.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 758, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Miroslav Poche (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "124699", "text": "  Writing. \\u2012 I supported the draft report proposing a tightening of the Commission's original proposals to stop animal cloning.

Parliament has not only refused to clone animals, but is also calling for a ban on the import of cloned animals, which is not the commission's original proposal, offering only a half-hearted solution. Cloning is, in itself, primarily an ethical problem. On the one hand, while it makes it possible to work more effectively with quality animal cuts, on the other hand, a very negative impact on donors and, above all, recipients of cloned eggs is shown, mainly in the form of an increase in health problems and frequent high soreness. In addition to animal cloning, the EP report proposes a ban on the production of germ products (semen, oocytes and embryos) from clones for the purpose of procreation of animals (descendants of clones) by traditional reproductive techniques. There is scientific evidence that cloning practices also cause poor living conditions for breeding females and clone offspring in the case of farmed fish and poultry, albeit less significantly than in mammals.

The report underlines the importance of setting a meetable deadline by which each Member State should nominate its candidate and to make the hearing process more interactive, including the use of social media. In practice, parliament as a whole formally votes on the Commission as a whole, and the opinion of each committee on certain Commissioners has no legal significance, but the composition of the Commission or the division of portfolios may change.

I have warned that parts of the report stigmatise companies too much because they operate in countries that have a poor human rights record. Trade, investment and good economic relations in general can contribute in the long term to improving the human rights situation and promoting democracy in a country. We, as ALFA MEPs, have proposed a number of amendments to present a balanced approach that combines human rights, public security and parliamentary control. Many of these proposals were not supported. That is why I voted against this report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1252, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Kateřina Konečná (GUE/NGL)", "mepid": "23699", "text": "  Writing. \\u2012 I supported my own-initiative report from my colleague Schaake mainly because of two points. Firstly, it calls for clarification of the standards and standards used by private operators to develop their systems. The report points out that private actors play an increasingly important role in the digital field in all spheres of social activity, but there are still no safeguards to prevent them from excessively restricting fundamental rights and freedoms. Moreover, given that private actors therefore play a more active role in assessing the legality of content and in the development of cybersecurity systems and surveillance systems, their activities can have a negative impact on human rights worldwide. Second, the report did not conceal the activities of the US National Security Agency (NSA) brought to light by Edward Snowden. For example, the report notes that the NSA has collected a large number of zero day exploits – vulnerabilities in IT security that the public or product vendor do not yet know about, which weaken encryption protocols and products and thwart global efforts to improve IT security. , revealed by Edward Snowden, has seriously undermined the credibility of EU human rights policy and undermined global confidence in the benefits of information and communication technology.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1253, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Petr Mach (EFDD)", "mepid": "84175", "text": "  Writing. \\u2012 I voted against this resolution, which calls on the Commission to take further action (Sections 16, 38, 44 and others), the creation of expert panels (§ 54) and even the creation of a new fund (Section 8).", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1254, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Ivana Maletić (PPE)", "mepid": "119436", "text": "  Written. ‒ Technological advances in the context of human rights are a double-edged sword, so I did not support MP Schaake's report.

With regard to simplification, this report aims to establish a single audit mechanism in order to establish a single chain of controls, from the final beneficiaries to the EU institutions, and calls for an integrated approach to controls so that all obligations on a farm can contain the number of inspections and reduce the concomitant cost and burden in terms of resources and time.

I therefore support this call for increased quality above quantity with regard to financial controls, which will not cut a significant part of the CAP’s budget, in the form of the Single audit scheme. The controls need be effective as to secure financial interests of the European tax payers and need to be less burdensome and costly for the very same reason.

As you know, 75%-90% of businesses in the countries of the South are family-friendly and the vast majority of them are small and medium-sized enterprises. As small and medium-sized enterprises, they were the first and most important victims of the economic crisis. It is therefore imperative both to deal directly with the problem at Community and national policy level and to launch a new initiative.  In this context, the report chooses a thorough and balanced approach, with the aim of either addressing all the factors leading to the exclusion of these enterprises from support measures or exempting them from production obligations because, in principle, their specificities have not been analysed and have not been given much attention and because Community and national policies for small and medium-sized enterprises have proved in any case inadequate and ineffective in dealing with the crisis and the phenomenon of de-investment. The absence of a legally binding and statistically acceptable definition at European level of what is a family business therefore results in the inability to collect statistical and comparable data and to quote good practices, the absence of studies focusing on their specific characteristics, the lack of an assessment of the administrative impact of the regulatory framework and, above all, the absence of associations or structures representing their interests.

One such area is, for example, biotechnology. Of course, this kind of exploitation should pay attention to the sensitivities of marine ecosystems. The environmental, ecological and social functions of the seas and oceans therefore require a strong role for states in the sustainable management and conservation of resources in order to prioritise the public good over the interests of individuals.

Madam President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour of presenting to you the Council's position on the European Union's draft budget for 2016, which was unanimously adopted by the Council on 4 September. The main objective is to support economic recovery, investment and job creation, on the one hand, and to stimulate the financing of migration policies of the Union's external action, on the other. The budget is therefore a reflection of solidarity inwards and outwards. I will give you a three-part presentation. The first will be devoted to current events, the second will take up the seven main principles that guided the Council's agreement and, finally, the third will contain the highlights. In view of the tragic events we are facing, and in view of the tens and tens of thousands of refugees who have fled the war and have put all their hopes in Europe, it is important to me to underline the support that the European Union is currently providing, in addition to the initiatives of the Member States. European aid to the current migration situation and the crisis of asylum seekers is one of the variations of this internal and external solidarity. A few figures: the two main funds in shared management are the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and the ESF, which are endowed with 3.1 billion euros and 3.7 billion euros respectively for the period 2014-2020. In 2015, more than 45 national programmes were approved for just over one billion commitment appropriations. Just over $210 million in pre-financing has already been released by the Commission. In addition, the \"emergency assistance\" component of these two funds has helped to unlock just over $60 million.  The Council and the European Parliament jointly approved the European migration agenda in May 2015, which is based on four pillars and aims to improve the management of migration flows. We also approved amending budget number 5 for this purpose.  The European Union is finally one of the main donors in the region surrounding Syria: 855 million euros have been allocated to humanitarian aid for refugees from Syria in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey for 2016. With regard to the relocation of refugees, commitments of EUR 150 million to Greece and Italy have been accepted in their entirety by the Council. These topics will certainly be discussed tomorrow by Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in his State of the Union statement, where he will also highlight and outline a new package of measures in this area.  The second part will focus on the seven main principles that guided the Council's work. First, we felt it was important to address and address the problem of arrears of payment, which can be resolved by the end of 2016. The Council's position includes the necessary appropriations to implement the payment timetable agreement in 2015 and 2016.  The second major principle is that the Council has selected all the allocations planned to support the European Fund for Strategic Investments in 2016, which is a top priority.  Thirdly, the migration policy is endowed with significant appropriations, including temporary measures for Greece and Italy for the relocation of 40,000 refugees on their soils, and the Migration and Integration Asylum Fund, which will be endowed with 515 million euros, an increase of 35% in 2016 compared to 2015.  The fourth major principle is humanitarian aid. Payment credits increased by 16% in 2016 compared to 2015 to reach more than ONE billion euros.  The fifth principle: the credit cuts that have been carried out according to guidelines based on several parameters, namely a rate of progress of the projects' programmes, the past and expected rate of implementation for the projects and, finally, the predictable and realistic absorption capacity for the various programmes. The sixth guiding principle is that the budget lines adjusted by the Council are mainly those for which the Commission had proposed very strong progress. So it is to these very high numbers that we have applied downward adjustments. But if you look at the absolute increase in credit in these areas, you will find that the increases remain substantial. Seventh and final principle: in the face of political and sometimes dramatic instability around the European Union, the Council has decided to keep sufficient room for manoeuvre in the event of escalating tensions and conflicts. I'll go through reviewed very quickly the details of the Council's position, which was unanimously agreed on 4 September. The proposal covers commitment appropriations of $153.3 billion and payment appropriations of $142.1 billion. For payment credits, this is an increase of 0.6% and for commitment credits, a decrease of 5.4%. Knowing that the Commission had proposed a 5% reduction, we are therefore very close. The position we have chosen reduces the gap between commitment credits and payment credits and, therefore, the famous remains to be liquidated, and therefore reduces the risk of arrears of payment.  Let's move on to the highlights by topic. In the \"competitiveness for growth and employment\" category, which is at the heart of the political priorities for investment and employment, payment credits increase by 8.6% and commitment credits by 7%. To achieve the European Fund for Strategic Investments, which is a top priority, redeployments have been selected on the following points: the Horizon 2020 programme and the Mechanism for Interconnection in Europe (MIE). Funding for major infrastructure projects has also been reduced, including Galileo, ITER and Copernicus, as well as joint ventures. Despite the reductions, payment credits for Horizon 2020 increased by 9.3% (840 million) compared to 2015, to reach 9.9 billion euros, a considerable figure.  The Council has also slightly scaled down the mechanism for interconnection in Europe. However, commitment appropriations increased by 53% (760 million euros) and payment credits by 14% (203 million euros), which is very close to the Commission's proposals.  The popular Cosme and Erasmus programmes were not affected by the cuts. I would point out that the Erasmus programme will be endowed with EUR 1.8 billion in 2016, an increase of 30% over 2015.  In the \"economic, social and territorial cohesion\" category, credit fell very slightly by 0.45 per cent. In the \"sustainable growth: natural resources\" section, there was a slight reduction of 0.45 per cent in payment credits and 0.32 per cent in commitment credits compared to the Commission's proposals.  In section 3 \"security and citizenship\", which I have already insisted on in my first part, commitment credits increase sharply compared to 2015 (8.7%) and payment credits are up more than 15%. This increase mainly relates to actions in the field of migration, a political priority of the European Union. The Council also accepted the use of the flexibility instrument. In heading 4, the Council largely took up the Commission's proposals. Payment credits increased by 22.4% to more than 9 billion euros. I would like to point out that the Council has aligned itself with the Commission's amounts in key areas such as humanitarian aid, civil protection, macro-financial aid to third countries, the External Action Guarantee Fund and support for the Palestinians. Under heading 5 \"administration\" the proposal foresees a moderate reduction of 31 million which will not affect the functioning of the institutions of the European Union. The Council has not changed the administrative budget of the European Parliament, but will remain vigilant about the planned 5% reduction in staff until 2017. A meeting was decided at our budget trilogue in July so that Parliament, the Commission and the Presidency could discuss this issue together. In conclusion, Madam President, dear Members of the European Parliament, aware of the challenges ahead, particularly on the migration front, and in view of the growing conflicts around the European Union, the Council considered it essential to find a compromise, balanced and responsible, which retains some leeway to deal with the aggravations that are obvious. The budget is therefore under the sign of this internal and external solidarity, which is close to our hearts all.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2419, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Corina Crețu", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like first of all to thank Minister Gramegna for his presentation of the Council’s reading of our draft budget for 2016. The Commission fully shares the view that budgetary discipline and sound management is what people expect from us, but our citizens of course also expect that we attend to urgent needs in these times of many ongoing crises. President Juncker will present tomorrow, in his State of the Union speech, proposals for the refugee crisis. Furthermore, in response to recent market developments in the dairy sector, the Commission announced yesterday a comprehensive package of measures for EUR 400 million of EU funds to be used for the benefit of farmers immediately. The financial impact of the migration package and the agricultural basis will be reflected in an amending letter to be proposed in October. This amending letter will include the higher-than-expected surplus in the agricultural sector. Let me now turn to the original proposal of the Commission on which the Council reading was based. The draft budget for 2016 is a comprehensive proposal covering all political priorities: to stimulate investment, growth and jobs, through the agreement reached on the European Fund for Strategic Investments, Amending Letter No 1; to improve our capacity to meet the collective challenge of migration; to reinforce Europe in the world. Our proposal still leaves a margin of EUR 2.1 bn in commitments and EUR 1.6 bn in payments below the already tight MFF ceilings. All in all our draft budget for 2016 is a proposal for a responsible budget, a budget for the many competing needs of Europe, and a budget that has a margin for unforeseen events. Regarding payments, we have a draft budget that respects the agreed payment plan and that will bring us back to a sustainable budget for cohesion policy. The Commission welcomes the Council’s reading with regard to the 2007-2013 budget for Cohesion Policy programmes in heading 1b. However, we are concerned about the proposed cuts on a range of selected budget lines across headings, supposedly justified by low implementation rates in mid-June.  Our proposal aims at reversing the effect of payment shortages from the last years, including in headings for external actions. For many of the budgetary lines affected by the proposed cuts, the situation has radically changed since last year. We now have high implementation rates, especially under Heading 4, instead of delays, and from our point of view as a result there is no reason to reduce these budget lines. With regard to commitments, I see with satisfaction that the Council is endorsing the Commission proposal on migration. Let me stress that important actions were already taken in 2015 to address migration challenges. Twenty-three multiannual national programmes under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and the Internal Security Fund are approved, and some EUR 205 million of pre-financing has already been paid out to our Member States for both funds – EUR 122 million from the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and EUR 83 million from the Internal Security Fund. Money will now be able to flow. What we propose in 2016 is a continuation of the amending budget proposed in 2015, and more must be done in the next years. Regarding Heading 1a on growth and jobs, the Commission does not share the Council’s view on the reasons why the substantial cuts on programmes such as Horizon 2020 or the energy strand of the Connecting Europe Facility, are decoupled from political priorities like the Energy Union, or the spirit of our agreement on the financing of the European Fund for Strategic Investments.  Under Heading 4, cuts are proposed in our main programmes for the neighbourhood, pre-accession and development cooperation. Reducing the extent of our assistance in the Mediterranean will not increase security and will run contrary to the overall political goal for the economic development of this region so close to us. On administrative expenditure, for a number of years already the Commission, as well as a number of other institutions, has shown self-restraint and sound administrative management. We have continued working with limited increases in administrative expenditure. We are progressing towards our achievement of a 5% staff reduction target over five years, yet the Council’s position seems to ignore these efforts. I will just give you one example. For the Commission, if we were to undergo the Council’s proposal to cut EUR 19 million we would have to freeze 206 posts on top of a 4% staff reduction to be achieved by 2016. Likewise, cuts to administrative support expenditure, research staff and executive agencies across all the headings would be extremely harmful for the proper implementation of programmes. Let me conclude my statement with some elements regarding the process. In mid-October, the Commission will present an amending letter containing an update for agriculture and the budgetary implication of the new package on migration which President Juncker will announce tomorrow before this European Parliament.  We look forward to Parliament’s reading and trust that by the end of the conciliation period we will find a common way ahead for the 2016 budget.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2420, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "José Manuel Fernandes", "mepid": "96899", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Madam President, I would like to greet the Commissioner, the representatives of the Council, the Representative of the Council, all and all colleagues. Parliament is united in this respect. Parliament has a clear mandate and several resolutions - the last of July - adopted on this matter and we are consistent with our priorities. We defend employment, business, entrepreneurship, we defend internal solidarity and external solidarity. It is in our position, of our resolution.  This has consequences. It has consequences in terms of heading 1a, it has consequences in terms of Horizon 2020, the Connecting Europe Facility, the Youth Employment Initiative, which we want to continue. But we must not forget at this moment that, on our part, there is no minimum of hypocrisy and, as I was saying, we are consequential. We have already said this: migration, the refugee problem, must be in line with the budget. Solidarity does not live on proclamations. Solidarity is done with actions and, listening to the Council representative, it seems that the Council has not made any cuts, it seems that the Council defends the cause of migration.  Under heading 4, with instruments and programmes linked to the resolution of this problem, the Council cuts EUR 450 million in payments. Heading 4 cuts the instrument for pre-access assistance by EUR 119 million, cuts the European neighbourhood instrument by more than EUR 100 million, cuts a line of poverty support, combating poverty in the Mediterranean by EUR 50 million, cuts the Development Cooperation Instrument by EUR 143 million. By the way, the Council cuts eur 1.4 billion from the Commission's proposal. And I think that the Council representative was making a comparison perhaps with a budget of 1980 or 1990, and not with the budget of 2015, and it is good to note that, unanimously, a programming of the European Union budget - the 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework - has already been adopted annually.  The Commission, in the proposal, has reduced and the Council has made further cuts to this reduction. A Council position which is unacceptable, which is incomprehensible, which is incoherent, goes against its proposals, which goes against its priorities. The Council cannot say - I am already done, but I had four minutes, Madam President - the Council cannot say that it saves the lines where there is good absorption. This is not true, because it cuts through Horizon 2020, where there is excellent absorption, because it cuts the Connecting Europe Mechanism, where there is excellent absorption, because it cuts these instruments that are needed and where there is excellent absorption and I do not understand how these proclamations are made and if you have these taken here in the heart of the chamber without a shred of shame , without at least a little bit blushing, because this, the proclamations, the speech, are not in line with the Council's proposal and the cuts that the Council has once again made.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2421, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Gérard Deprez", "mepid": "1473", "text": "   Rapporteur. Madam President, you said four minutes, sorry for this joke. Madam President, Mr President of the Council, Commissioner, Mr President of the Council, I share your relief, at least for 2015 and 2016 with regard to payment appropriations. Last year, we spent almost all of the budgetary authority's negotiations with the Commission trying to find a solution to the dramatic problem of payments. Now the situation is not good for 2015. It's bad but stabilized. It will improve in 2016, but it will not last. Between now and the end of the current financial outlook, you will see a surge in payment credits because, structurally, nothing has been done to avoid the situation we will find ourselves in before the end of the current financial outlook.  With regard to the 2016 budget, Mr President of the Council, we have three main priorities which I believe are common to almost all policy-makers: the need to stimulate growth, the need to deal humanisticly and effectively with the unprecedented wave of refugees seeking protection in our territory and, as you have forgotten today, but I imagine it is not voluntary. , the need to remain alert to the terrorist threats that continue and will continue to weigh on us. I will not talk much today about this third challenge, other than to remind you of the need to strengthen the human and technical resources to be made available to the Union's organs, such as Europol, Eurojust, the Eu-LISA Agency, which play a very important role in the exchange of strategic information to combat terrorism and avoid further attacks.  We consider that the means that you have provided at Council level and even at the Commission level are not sufficient to ensure optimal effectiveness for these bodies. Having said that, the major and most urgent problem we face today is the unprecedented influx of refugees seeking protection on the territory of the Union. We have been pleased to hear the statements of Mr Juncker, a number of politicians, whose guidelines we share - I am not talking about Mr Orbon - but, Mr President, budgetary resources must follow. For 2016, the Commission's draft budget does provide for an increase of EUR 169 million compared to 2015, but this will not be enough. This will be all the less than the cost of distributing or relocating refugees will skyrocket. If Mr Juncker announces tomorrow his proposal to add 120,000 relocation beneficiaries to the 40,000 already planned, it is not far from 960 million euros that will have to be mobilised to comply with the provisions of Article 18 of the regulation establishing the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund. So don't think we're going to get away with this. One last word, Madam President, and I will be done. I regret, as do my colleague José Manuel Fernandes, rapporteur, that the Council has still felt the need to reduce certain budget lines of the Horizon 2020 programme and the mechanism for interconnection in Europe, while, according to all the information in our possession, these lines are the subject of proposals - 36,000 for \"Horizon 2020\" for the period 2014-2015 - which unfortunately cannot be responded favourably because of the conditions you have created. I think that is a profound mistake.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2422, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Pierre Gramegna", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  President-in-Office of the Council. Madam President, I believe that this is not the time today to enter into a substantive discussion on the Council's proposal and on the remarks made by the two rapporteurs, Mr Fernandez and Mr Deprez, whom I thank nevertheless for their commitment and dynamism in defending the various appropriations.  I would just like to point out that the reductions made by the Council have been made in relation to the Commission's proposals, which themselves represent considerable increases on most of the points that have been mentioned. In particular, I would like to say that, for example in section IV, we have payment credits up by 22.45 per thousand per 22 per share. So when we talk about cutting, these are not cuts from the previous year's budget, but they are downward adjustments to amounts that are increasing significantly. But as I said, we are not going to go into the details of the negotiation today. I'm glad to hear that I've had lyrical flights. I, for one, felt that I had been extremely down-to-earth, but I will try to do better the next time I am with you. I would just like to point out that we will be working hand in hand with you and listening very seriously to the proposals you are going to make. I would also like to add that I am reaching out to you for frank and constructive cooperation in order to reach a compromise that will be all the more difficult to find because we know very well that other expenses are waiting for us because of worsening situations and unforeseen events. Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker will present the Commission's new package of measures on all migration issues tomorrow. This will not be done at zero rates. On agricultural policy, as the Commissioner has announced, there will also be ways to mobilise. The budget will therefore be difficult to close and I believe that the only assurance I can give you today is that we will be playing cards on the table and trying to find tenable and responsible compromises in the interests of solidarity with the outside world and investment, jobs and growth within the Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2423, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "La Présidente. –", "mepid": "96952", "text": "   The debate is closed.

These are solid assumptions to meet realities and needs. For example, I consider it a good sign to increase funding for programmes related to culture and educational development, such as Creative Europe and Europe for Citizens. However, I do not share the Council's view that it recommends cuts to Horizon 2020, thus separating it from the main political priorities, such as the Energy Union project.  It is good that the Commission's proposal leaves a margin of €2.1 billion in commitments and €1.6 billion in payments below the already restrictive ceilings of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020. We are already clearly experiencing the need for financial reserves. The current migration crisis, which has engulfed the whole of Europe, is an example of this. In addition, recent protests by farmers in response to market developments in the dairy sector have resulted in the Commission granting a comprehensive package of €400 million for immediate use.

The Member States' budget, based on a general reduction target of four per cent since 2013, is characterised by sometimes massive cuts. At the same time, however, the Member States are calling for substantial increases in funding, an additional EUR 500 million alone to deal with the refugee crisis. Another 500 million in emergency aid to dairy farmers affected by the lifting of the milk quota and the Russia sanctions – in addition to the annual subsidies of 50 billion. An additional billion will be spent on building up a fund for African countries, and in general the Council's budget foresees a 22.5 per cent increase in funding for foreign policy measures, while the funds for programmes that increase competitiveness are only expected to increase by 8.6 per cent.

Representatives of the European Council and representatives of the Member States who have voluntarily joined the European Union.  You and all of us have joined forces with the idea of human rights, freedom, justice and solidarity. And it is precisely these European values that my report is about: human rights, because we are talking here about people who have fled war and persecution and are seeking protection here, about human rights for these very people. For freedom, because these people are looking for a life in peace and freedom. That is right, because refugees have rights, they are not packages that we can send criss-crossing Europe without asking what interests and desires they have. For solidarity, because all Member States are called upon to make their contribution. Solidarity is what holds us together. If one is in need, the other helps. All of us can be in a position to be in a position to show solidarity at any time.  We in Parliament – and I would like to express my thanks to our shadow rapporteurs for this – have negotiated this report in a mad time, in a few weeks' time. We in Parliament are calling for the binding distribution of 40 000 refugees, and we are saying quite clearly that this can only be the beginning. We call for the interests of refugees to be taken into account as far as possible. We as a Parliament, we have done our job.  And the Council? It is nothing short of a disgrace that the Member States have failed to agree on 40 000 places. First of all, they said that it was binding, that this is not possible, solidarity, that must be voluntary, and then they still promised that the 40 000 would come together – but it was nothing, just 32 000 came out of it. 32 000 places for refugees. We should not forget that more than twenty thousand refugees arrive in Greece every week. Nor should we forget that Lebanon is home to more than a million refugees, and Lebanon, God knows, has other problems and only four million inhabitants, while Europe has 500 million inhabitants.  A large number of these very Europeans are showing us what a rake is! The people of Hungary, Austria, France, Germany, Finland and all the other Member States are showing in practice what solidarity and empathy means. As Members and governments, we and you should not be left behind! That is why it is right that the Commission should propose another emergency allocation instrument, with 120 000, and this time Hungary will also be taken into account. This is the right step, but we cannot stop there. We finally need a permanent distribution key in the event of an emergency, and we must be able to decide and move forward when this emergency is there and not be blocked by various Member States.  However, we also need a far-reaching reform of Dublin at long last, because there is the catch: Dublin is not working, Dublin is dead. We have to come out, we finally need a fair distribution: fair for the Member States, but also fair for the refugees.  Europe is facing a major challenge, and many are even talking about a real crisis. And yes, the challenge of taking in and caring for many thousands of arriving refugees is not small. But we should never forget that the real crises are elsewhere, that the real challenge is borne by the refugees who take on this challenge. People fleeing Assad's bombs, from the terror of Da'ish, from dictatorial regimes – that is the real challenge, that is the real crisis.  And helping these people must be our job. Europe, as one of the richest regions in the world, can only fail in this task if we give ourselves a leg up, and we should not do that, we should not let it happen!

It concerns the positive opinion of Parliament on the first emergency relocation mechanism. However, as Members know, the Commission is adopting a new package on migration which will be officially presented to them tomorrow. As I have repeatedly said, both I personally and this Commission are committed to accelerating and enhancing our actions to face the migratory challenge, which is a European one. The proposal for the emergency relocation of persons in clear need of international protection from Italy and Greece is an important part of the measures we are already putting in place to address this unprecedented situation. Therefore, allow me to express my appreciation to our rapporteur, who has led the discussions on this complex file in a very constructive and engaging manner.  The aim of this proposal is twofold: to relieve the pressure on Italy and Greece and to ensure the dignified treatment of the persons concerned. The Commission welcomes the approach Parliament proposes to take.  The interests of the applicants should, as much as possible, match those of the Member States. The system has to be implemented in such a way as to create a win-win situation and to prevent secondary movements. This is why, in deciding which Member State an applicant should be relocated to, specific account should be taken of the qualifications and characteristics of the applicant, such as language skills and other individual indications based on family, culture or social ties which could facilitate their integration. At the same time, our aim is to have something as simple and efficient as possible in order to ensure that these persons can be relocated as quickly as possible. This will ensure the proper protection of the applicants concerned while alleviating the burden on Italy and Greece.  The Commission shares the concerns of Parliament when it comes to vulnerable persons. It is foreseen that they should be the priority in the implementation of the scheme. The special needs of asylum applicants, including their health, should be of primary concern, and the best interests of the child should always be a primary consideration.  As you are aware, the Council reached a general approach in our proposal in July. Member States, in general, made considerable efforts to show solidarity and agreed to the relocation of 40 000 persons over two years and, as a first step, to the relocation of 32 256 persons. I am confident that the Member States will update their figures by the end of this year so as to reach 40 000, in line with the commitment that they have taken. The discussions in the Council confirmed that this remains a very challenging topic, but we should be able to feel proud as soon as the results are achieved. The refugee crisis is a reality and no one can pretend that it does not concern us all.  Such results would not have been thinkable only a few months ago. Indeed, it is the first time that Member States have collectively – and not just bilaterally – agreed to relocate persons in clear need of international protection. It is now of utmost importance that we proceed quickly to the implementation of the scheme, including by the establishment of the hotspots. I am personally engaged in assuring an accelerated and effective rollout of the hotspots as soon as possible, and certainly before the decision enters into force.  The hotspot approach is not only necessary for the implementation of the relocation decision but is, more importantly, a key measure of solidarity vis—à—vis the most affected Member States that rely on the coherent mobilisation of European agencies. The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) will provide support in the processing of asylum applications and the registration of migrants. Frontex will help with the return process, while Europol and Eurojust will assist in the investigation of criminal networks.  It is crucial that we provide holistic support to Member States under pressure and ensure ownership and build trust with other Member States. The first hotspots have already been set up in Sicily, Lampedusa and Taranto. One more is going to be set up within the next few days in Piraeus in Greece. A workshop organised by the Commission, together with EASO, for the Member States on relocation and resettlement will take place on 1 October. The third relocation and resettlement forum will also take place this autumn to continue the discussion on the technical modalities.  We can all agree that the recent developments – unprecedented arrivals of migrants and asylum applicants – will require further action. Members have clearly called for a permanent relocation mechanism based on a distribution key. Parliament will this time be co-legislator on the file and I look forward to your engagement. This proposal will already build on many of the ideas put forward by this House during its debates on relocation. In this respect, I would like to thank you for your valuable contribution.  Let me underline that, more than ever, we need to work in a comprehensive way as there is no single solution. The Commission will continue and speed up the implementation of all the aspects of this common challenge, as set out in the agenda on migration.  I wish to thank Members very much for their attention and am ready to take note of their remarks and answer their questions.

I had really hoped - and perhaps I was a little naïve about it - that after everything that has happened last summer from Calais to Austria and from Bodrum to Budapest, we would be discussing this issue in a different atmosphere. But if there is one thing the Member States have proven, it is that a system of voluntary redistribution simply does not work. At a time when 20 000 refugees a week are arriving on an island like Lesbos, but we are unable to redistribute 16 000 refugees from Greece on a voluntary basis to other countries, then it is simply the case that voluntary action does not work. Then we must move towards a binding system, and I am pleased that this Parliament is strongly supporting it. But let us not fool ourselves: redistributing refugees is only one part of a European migration agenda. If we do nothing, if we cannot make progress on all other aspects, such as efficient return policies, better agreements with third countries, tackling people smugglers, tackling the root causes of the unrest, then we can talk about redistributing refugees for a very long time to come, but then we have done too little on the original causes.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2431, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Iliana Iotova", "mepid": "38605", "text": "  On behalf of the Group of S and D- Madam President, the events of the past few months have shown that we cannot make a policy only for the Mediterranean.

In my opinion, this is still underestimated and too much seen as a technical problem. But we're not talking about numbers, we're talking about people - people like you and me, not people in a different category. It was only because politicians did not want to tackle the issue for a long time that this chaos arose. This must stop! It is therefore necessary to remind our Heads of State of five fundamental principles. Firstly, fundamental rights. At the end of the day, people are always behind the debate about categories such as migrants, refugees and asylum seekers. Every human being, whether registered or not, has fundamental human rights at all times, such as the right to dignity and the right to life. Secondly, the Peace Project Europe. It is precisely the unstable situation in the Middle East that must also remind us of the value of European integration. That is the only reason why we can live in peace, prosperity and security today. From this position of security, we can help other people. Thirdly, the construction of walls. Viktor Orban is not the only one currently building fences. Other politicians, such as David Cameron, are also building demarcations, even if they are not barbed wire. However, the past 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall has clearly reminded us that such demarcations merely demonstrate powerlessness and are not a real solution. The underlying causes cannot be eliminated by foreclosure. Fourthly, the power of numbers. For a serious discussion, we need serious figures. The populist numbers game with exaggerated arrival numbers and multiple counts distorts the discussion and only benefits the fear-mongers. And fifthly, a pan-European perspective. The refugee issue is a pan-European issue. The border issue must be linked to a strong security and foreign policy. Open internal borders and stable external borders also require an active common European foreign policy.

Madam President, the European Union, in fact, lacks a policy to deal with the refugee issue. This absence of policy is co-responsible for the fact that more than 2,000 people have lost their lives trying to reach the European Union. The Commission's proposal to relocate 40,000 people in need of international protection from Greece and Italy to other countries is also a drop in the ocean. In Greece, which has welcomed more than 260,000 people since the beginning of the year, these figures sound like an insult, especially when you consider that the Council is proposing the relocation of only 32,000 people, deliberately ignoring the situation on the Greek islands, which are sinking under the weight of the people who arrive daily on them. We therefore need a permanent and compulsory relocation mechanism and the elimination of the first entry criterion from the Dublin Regulation. Above all, however, we need a peaceful solution in Syria and, by extension, in Iraq, because that alone can be a permanent response.

In other words, what we need is a system – the Dublin system no longer works, it must be replaced by a system of solidarity – legal access and a binding distribution of refugees.

As many sections of the civilian population in Austria, Germany, but also in Hungary, have done in the past week, who have asked what they need and helped them to move forward.

Secondly, that we can expect the quota numbers – fair quotas – to be respected and not to be undermined by an arbitrary choice on the part of the migrants to which country they want to go to.

As I said in the beginning, the relocation scheme is only one part of the comprehensive approach as described in the agenda of migration. Ms Sargentini, Ms Wikström, this House has always had a very strong opinion about solidarity in practice. We agree. I agree with you, and we are working towards the same goal. You have mentioned the Council; allow me to be optimistic and confident that the Member States will soon take brave decisions. The challenge we are facing requires it. Mr Díaz de Mera, this House – the European Parliament – will be co-legislator for the permanent relocation mechanism. Even concerning the emergency mechanism, which – as the name itself reveals – had to be adopted urgently, the Commission did take the opinions expressed by Parliament into account. I am grateful both for the suggestions and for the support of this House. Many of you have referred to the need to revise the Dublin Regulations. I would like to stress that many of the measures that the Commission is proposing recognise in practice the need to act above what Dublin foresees. Regarding its possible revision, as I promised at the very beginning, a thorough assessment will be done in the course of 2016. Then we will decide the route to follow, the way ahead. Mr Deprez, would you agree? Indeed, EASO and liaison officers from different Member States will be fully involved in the selection procedure. Let me remind you that migration will be the main point of President Juncker’s State of the Union speech tomorrow morning, after which we will continue our discussion in detail. Allow me now to switch to Greek, since I was asked by some Greek deputies about the situation in Greece. Ms Spinelli asked me a question about the financing.  Within a short period of time the government, through a prime minister, pledged to proceed quickly with the necessary procedures.  I am pleased to inform you that these have been completed. Greece has appointed the managing authority responsible for managing the funds. You know from your experience that when money is made available in a country, there must be a managing authority. This was only communicated to us today. Greece has also requested emergency funding to meet immediate needs and this funding starts immediately. Greece is also accelerating the launch of the hot-spot in Piraeus, from where experts will rush to those islands where aid is needed. Reception areas are installed on the islands which are main gateways. Greece also called for the activation of the civil protection mechanism. I repeat that these are prerequisites, not only for Greece but for any country that needs the help of the European Union. I would like to take this opportunity to tell you that on this major and important issue of unprecedented proportions, which is perhaps the biggest crisis we have faced since the Second World War, Europe has not been apathetic. From the very first moment, as you may recall those of you who are members of the committees with which I had the honour of working at the beginning of my term of office, we made commitments and in record time on European data the Commission has completed its work and tabled the new European agenda on migration. It is up to the Member States to implement it. Today, during the debate, much has been said about the responsibility of the Member States.  The new agenda on migration is the framework. As I said a moment ago, it is only a matter of hours before you learn about a new package, in addition to what you already know, and I refer to all ten points of the action plan that we adopted and announced some time ago.  Taking the initiative, we moved quickly forward, but we were caught up, it is true, by these dramatic developments that accelerated the events. At this time, however, we must all demonstrate in practice both our solidarity and our responsibility - two basic principles governing the functioning of the Union. Solidarity is not only a moral concept; It is a concept that defines our internal functioning from the very beginning and is enshrined in the Treaty. We must prove this in practice: solidarity between us, responsibility of the Member States but also solidarity with those unfortunate people who, in their quest to escape war, the destruction of civil war, persecution, have chosen a very difficult and dangerous and, in many cases, deadly journey to reach our own great country, Europe. We will continue in one direction, on this path towards tackling the crisis, which unfortunately will not be solved overnight, but will require many efforts for many years perhaps. We'll work together. I'm not hiding that I'm personally. I am grateful to the European Parliament for supporting this policy from the very beginning, demonstrating in practice its sensitivity to the humanitarian dimension of the whole issue and its responsibility to lead us - through dialogue - to make the right decisions.

There are people fleeing for very good reasons – from wars, from conflict, from persecution – and let us never forget that the majority of all refugees worldwide are not here, they are in Lebanon, as I mentioned earlier, they are in Turkey, around two million refugees in Turkey alone, they are in Pakistan, they are in so many other countries, let us not forget about Chad, the refugees there, or in Kenya.  We are actually talking about a very small proportion of worldwide refugees that make their way to Europe and we, as a strong, as a rich region, need to do our share in helping those people. Those refugees are indeed human beings, they are like you and me, as has been mentioned before, and we are just lucky not to be in their shoes.  It is EU law but it is also human sense to help those people, and that is all we ask for today. People all over Europe have shown us how to do that, how to show empathy, how to show solidarity – and relocating 40 000 people from Italy and Greece is not a big task. If we fail in that small but important task, then how are we going to succeed in other tasks that lie ahead? Because we do indeed also need to look at structural problems, we need to act together on much more than just relocating 40 000.

I am very much in favour of the principle of the distribution of migrants in quotas and I am in favour of their redistribution among the Member States. This decision, however, deals with the problem of immigration in a completely superficial way: just think that Europe not only does not distinguish between economic migrants and refugees, but that in dealing with the central issue of relocation, it will not take into account the arrivals of illegal immigrants prior to its entry into force. In short, Europe will not take account of almost all the landings in 2015 and therefore does not introduce the certainty of returns.

The Commission's proposal is hypocritical because deciding which country this country should go to, not that refugee, discriminates against themselves. The standard of living is very different between member states and I do not think that you can force a refugee to stay in Bulgaria, Hungary or Romania.  The current approach is wrong because in practice the EU cannot yet clearly distinguish economic immigrants from genuine refugees. Before the summer, we talked about 40,000 refugees, today about another 120,000. And tomorrow? The quota principle of redistribution of refugees is not a solution to the refugee wave.

Dear Commissioner, Dear Colleagues, The European Commission's cohesion reports are milestones in the history of cohesion policy. This is no different with the Sixth Cohesion Report, which examines the EU's regional development policy in the light of the devastating economic and financial crisis and closely links it to achieving the europe 2020 objectives. Cohesion policy is the EU's number one investment policy, the most controlled and valued expenditure area in the EU budget, with a budget of more than EUR 350 billion for the period 2014-2020. Its effectiveness and indispensableness are particularly evident in crisis situations. After all, cohesion policy can offer a real and immediate solution, even in exceptional situations, for growth and job creation. Against this background, I would like to underline here, at the very beginning of what I have to say, that cohesion policy must continue to play an important role beyond 2020, and that economic catch-up and solidarity within the Union cannot be abandoned. In my report, there was an increased emphasis on the idea of putting an end to the recurring liquidity problems in regional development policy. We need to eliminate the very significant payment arrears. By the end of 2014, €24.8 billion in payment arrears had accumulated, undermining the effectiveness, credibility and sustainability of cohesion policy. The second idea, which was emphasised in my report, is to strengthen the original role of cohesion policy. The objective of cohesion policy, as set out in the Treaty, is to promote economic, social and territorial cohesion in all EU regions, in particular less developed regions. It is understandable that the objectives of cohesion policy have evolved over time and that the policy has become increasingly closely tied to the union's current strategy. At the same time, I believe it is important to give greater prominence to the original objective of cohesion policy, to reduce development differences and to ensure that the contribution to the union's current overall strategy remains compatible with reducing regional disparities. The third thought that I highlighted in my report is the future of cohesion policy. 2019 will be decisive, as a newly elected Parliament and a new Commission will have to cope with the final tasks of the Europe 2020 strategy, the development of a new multiannual financial framework and the creation of a framework for post-2020 cohesion policy. The debate on the cohesion policy of the future must therefore be started now. In addition to the three main ideas, I would also like to briefly address some of the defining aspects that have received increased attention in my report. I consider it important to take measures to ensure efficiency, simplification and results orientation. I would like to highlight the importance of simplification, as a significant number of irregularities result from opaque standards and requirements. Reducing the administrative burden on beneficiaries would be a huge step towards increasing efficiency. Results orientation is reinforced by thematic concentration, but the concretisation of objectives also requires the preservation of sufficient flexibility in order to provide answers tailored to the needs and problems of the regions. In my report, particular attention will be paid to the issue of unemployment, in particular youth unemployment and the ability of small and medium-sized enterprises to create jobs. Finally, I believe that the territorial dimension received little attention in the Sixth Cohesion Report, despite being an indispensable tool for strengthening economic, territorial and social cohesion. Dear colleagues, as I drafted my report, I have been able to work very constructively with the shadow rapporteurs from other political groups, with the Members who tabled the amendments – I would like to thank you for this cooperation here and now. The Sixth Cohesion Report is an excellent opportunity to give new impetus to EU cohesion policy and to draw attention to its effectiveness and usefulness. I would like to reiterate that, after 2020, EU cohesion policy must continue to play an important role and eu budgetary resources for policy should not be reduced. Only a properly funded cohesion policy can ensure eu solidarity, catch-up of less developed regions, the creation of new jobs and the development of the economy. Thanking you for your attention, I look forward to your comments with interest.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2497, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Kerstin Westphal", "mepid": "96839", "text": "   Rapporteur. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done on this report. Three out of four people in Europe live in cities and suburbs. Cities are indeed engines of growth, and that is why they are particularly vulnerable, on the one hand to social problems, but on the other hand to environmental problems. In fact, 50% of ERDF funding will be invested in urban areas over the next few years. Good development in our urban areas is fundamental to the future of Europe. I would like to emphasise very clearly that the term 'city' must be broad. This is not just about big cities, it is also about small and medium-sized cities, and it is about all cities. But it is also about rural areas. We are not against rural areas. On the contrary, the surrounding area is important for the development of cities. The European debate on urban policy has been going on for over 20 years. I therefore very much welcome the fact that the Commission has launched an 'urban agenda'. In my report, I call for the urban dimension to become an integral part of all European policies. We need to think about cities all the time and everywhere, in all policy areas. Precisely because so many policy areas affect the lives of cities, there are also various measures and funding opportunities, which are often not coordinated. This is very often very confusing and very unhelpful for cities. That is why we want a task force within the existing structure of the Commission, such as a kind of 'one-stop shop'. This will enable us, on the one hand, to ensure greater internal coherence in all projects involving cities and externally to ensure that there is something like contact persons. For many cities, European funding and European standards are still a book with seven seals. In addition, cities need to have more say. Their opinion and expertise must be better heard in European legislation, and from the outset. Those who have to take care of the implementation in the end should also be able to have their say right from the start! What is also particularly important to me in the discussion is that a European urban agenda should not be confused with the fact that there are new requirements. I don't want any additional burdens on cities. We want a kind of \"toolbox\" for cities. Cities need contacts, but cities also need platforms for exchange. What we do not need are new requirements. These would be very difficult to implement in practice. That is why we want any new European legislation to look at the consequences for cities, which are often very diverse. In our report, we do not even try to emphasise any challenges or, on the other hand, to make a particularly small statement. Every city is different. Ladies and gentlemen, I think it is a great pity that the mission letter from President Juncker to the Regional Commissioner makes no mention of urban policy. In this regard, we urgently need someone in the College who explicitly makes urban policy. The Commissioners for Digital, Transport, Energy, Social Affairs – they all have ideas for cities. What we need is coordination, a person, a kind of 'Mister or Misses urban policy' in the Commission. I think it would be nice and good if that were the Regional Commissioner, Mr Creu, who will then have to be given the powers accordingly. But I think it can also be a vice-president who explicitly takes care of, organizes and coordinates urban policy. That is what our cities in Europe need!", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2498, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Corina Crețu", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would first like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs, Mrs Westphal and Mr Deutsch, and, of course, the Committee on Regional Development, for these excellent reports, which bring to the heart two major issues for cohesion policy: the sixth report on cohesion and, of course, the urban dimension. Cohesion policy, as you know, is the European Union's main source of investment. Together with the national co-financing side, it will mobilise more than EUR 630 billion in the 2014-2020 funding period, with the aim of supporting efforts by Member States and regions to implement structural reforms and laying the foundations for a sustainable recovery.  In many Member States, particularly those facing a reduction in income and an increase in social spending, european Union funding has become the main source of public investment. We have economies in the European Union, where our funds contribute almost 85% of all public investment in these countries. Our objective now, as Mr Deutsch's report also shows, is to ensure that these funds reach people as quickly as possible and generate growth and jobs as soon as possible. In this respect, I am pleased to say that almost all cohesion policy programmes for the funding period have been adopted and the corresponding pre-financing amounts have already been transferred - there are only four operational programmes to adopt by the end of the year.  Now, sure, the key word is implementation. We must act at all levels - national and European - to ensure that these programmes are translated into quality projects capable of generating economic growth and creating new jobs. The operational programmes adopted will certainly meet this challenge, as they are results-oriented, all programmes offer a wide range of indicators and objectives that allow us to quantify expectations from our investments. These programmes must also respect a number of ex ante conditionalities, which are essential to enable Member States and regions to better exploit the potential of funds, and last but not least, these programmes have been specifically designed to contribute to the Union's most important priorities: job creation, investment and prosperity, the Digital Single Market or the Energy Union and climate change.  I assure you that we, the European Commission, will closely monitor the implementation of the new programmes. We are doing everything necessary to help Member States implement these programmes effectively at national, local and regional level in support of beneficiaries. They are the key actors in cohesion policy, which identifies, selects and implements projects financed with European money, thus making possible real changes for the better, which matter and which are seen in the daily lives of European citizens. That is why we are preparing a number of actions to support them in their day-to-day work. Of these measures, I would now like to recall only a few points: facilitating the exchange of best practices among those in charge of the implementation of cohesion policy (we have 24 000 workers with European funds in all Member States, many have already gained massive experience and I believe that this exchange of best practices is essential to move forward) , organising seminars on State aid or financial instruments or starting joint actions with the Court of Auditors with a view to improving the public procurement system. Of course, the responsibility for using these instruments lies almost exclusively with national, regional and local authorities. Like the rapporteur, Mrs Kerstin Westphal, I would also like to congratulate you on this report on the urban dimension. Like you, I sincerely believe that, just as the major challenges of society are also found in cities and functional urban areas, we can also find the right solutions there. I share your view: we need to pay more attention to this urban policy. We have already had a meeting with all the mayors of capitals in Vienna, and also a few months ago, before the holiday, we organised the biggest event in Brussels related to small and medium-sized cities, because, as you said, it is very important. Of course we are not addressing directly, but through operational programmes, basically what you say is happening: we address the problems of cities. There is also this subject of subsidiarity, you know very well that many cities and some national governments are opposed to having a separate lye, but I think it is our duty to develop this urban agenda that you were talking about.  I want to assure you that the new programmes already contain a set of innovative instruments and clear provisions to ensure massive involvement and more sustained support for urban areas, based on partnership and the principle of decentralisation. We estimate that at least EUR 80 billion from the European Regional Development Fund will be invested directly or indirectly in urban areas. Specifically, EUR 15 billion will be directly managed by cities as part of sustainable urban development strategies.  This is the first time that, with the help of the regulations that you have approved here in the European Parliament, we have this mutual confidence in providing cities directly with budgets for investment. I believe, indeed, as you say, that we can and must do more. As I was saying, we are preparing the EU's urban agenda, we want to help mobilise the potential of cities, which will become the promoters of job creation, social inclusion and sustainable development. Of course, you know very well that we are working on this to ensure better coordination of eu actions and synergies in this area. We have already established a public consultation, organised, as I said, a series of conferences and laid the foundations for an agreement from all Member States.  I am pleased to note that the Presidency of Luxembourg and also the Dutch Presidency place a great deal of emphasis on urban policy, and I would like to assure you of the European Commission's readiness to work with you on all the issues raised in both reports. As you know, the time allocated for intervention is limited, so I will end for the moment and I am definitely looking forward to the debate and dialogue with you on these issues.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2499, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Κώστας Μαυρίδης", "mepid": "124691", "text": "   Rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Mr President, cohesion policy is linked to the principles of the European Union and in particular to solidarity, which is a reason for the existence of the European Union itself. With a view to bridging the gap between private and public spending, cohesion policy is becoming even more urgent because of this economic crisis that we are experiencing. We call on the European Commission to create a coherent and more effective investment framework.  That is why I am focusing on two key points, Commissioner. Firstly, the close interconnection of funding with the budgetary and macroeconomic adjustment of the Member States essentially reverses the logic of solidarity on which cohesion policy was based and at the same time counters its regional character and will therefore have a negative impact on the achievement of its objectives. Instead, we propose to exclude funding. I shall end with a second point, Mr President, to say that the result of the ideological opposition of some conservative circles was the fact that we did not have a report from the Committee on Finance.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2500, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Danuta Jazłowiecka", "mepid": "96781", "text": "   author of the draft opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. – Thank you very much, Mr President. Recent years have shown that cohesion policy implemented by the European Union has proved itself in a period of economic collapse. It mitigated the effects of the sharp decline in public investment and ensured stability for the regions through an influx of funds at a time when access to finance was hampered. Cohesion policy funds accounted for nearly 60% of public investment in the countries covered by cohesion policy during the crisis.  So if we see the regional disparities that have been widening in recent years, we must also remember that they would have been even greater had it not been for the Structural Funds. Now that the economy is starting to stabilise and grow again after the economic crisis, we must ensure that the Structural Funds are spent as efficiently and efficiently as possible. Hence my call on all Member States to implement cohesion policy smoothly at national level. In the face of such high unemployment, especially among young people, every day of delay is causing social damage. It is also important that the European Commission tackles late payments. Given that the costs of these delays hit small and medium-sized enterprises generating the majority of new jobs the most, it is legitimate to say that every day of delay worsens the situation on the European labour market.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his excellent work and for the work EU policies and urban policy are not two shamheads that coexist. No, it is becoming increasingly important to improve the coherence of EU policies with an impact on Europe's cities. As the rapporteur, Kerstin Westphal, has already said: 72% of Europe's citizens live in cities and urban areas. Two-thirds of GDP is generated in cities: that is, three call signs for the Commission's tasks!  In view of the major economic and social, but also humanitarian, challenges facing Europe, it is important to address them where they arise, namely in Europe's cities, in urban areas. That is why it is so important to involve representatives from the cities themselves in the whole of EU policy-making.  From an employment point of view, I would like to call on the Commission to review the possibility of greater budgetary flexibility for cities, particularly with regard to public expenditure to combat unemployment, especially youth unemployment, poverty and social investment. As we can see, not all means of combating youth unemployment are being exhausted. Why not, for example, consider making these funds available directly to cities, directly for projects, instead of letting the money be sumbed more or less, as I say in Viennese?  A future EU Urban Agenda should also consider the issue of combating gender discrimination and include the promotion of equal opportunities. I am thinking of gender budgeting. As a Viennese in particular, I can tell them wonderful examples that would really be worth analysing at European level. That is why I call on the Commission to set up a network for the exchange of best practice examples on gender budgeting.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2502, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Νεοκλής Συλικιώτης", "mepid": "124689", "text": "   Rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. – Commissioner, the economic crisis has undeniably very serious coincidences in the cohesion of the European Union in the fields of industry, energy and research.

New policies are therefore needed in order to achieve real economic social and territorial cohesion in the Union. Measures must be promoted to boost the real economy, to promote growth and to create new quality jobs. It is important to support public investment but also to pay attention to the states most affected by the economic crisis.

Today I ask you to ensure that programmes at national and regional level contain these indications and push them forward for what is also a challenge – for example, the digitalisation of cultural heritage rather than the cultural and creative industry. We have asked as a committee for a review of the EUR 5 million limit adopted by the European Commission for fixed investment projects in equipment and infrastructure for culture and tourism; many countries have objected to this and it would be good to leave more flexibility.

In this report, the European Parliament appreciates what has already been done in the past, as well as the issues in the 'Cities of Tomorrow' report, as well as the actions on the urban dimension in 2014-2020, and appreciates that the European Commission has taken action on the 'Urban Forum', regular meetings and so on. At the same time, however, this report also makes it very clear that we expect the declarations made by the European Commission to be turned into action. This means, for example, that the issue of innovative urban activities, i.e. 0.2% RDF, will be completed.  We also expect some actions to be integrated. We have the feeling that, for example, smart cities, 'smart cities', are very much supported in the Commission, but we do not see too much how this is coordinated with issues relating to urban transport, environmental protection in cities, social issues in cities and so on.

It is also important that regional policy should be used as efficiently as possible in order to support investment in sustainable development and the creation of good jobs. Allow me to make a slightly different comment: more than a third of the European budget is spent on cohesion policy. This is a sign of immense solidarity between the regions of the European Union. But we also need this solidarity in other situations. We need them, for example, in welcoming the many refugees who are now coming to Europe. Here, too, solidarity is needed, and solidarity cannot be a one-way street. Cohesion policy is really a good example of this. Please also follow this solidarity in other areas.

European cohesion policy is really the most important policy area for investment in our economy. These investments provide economic growth and jobs. For new jobs and for economic strength. In its sixth cohesion report, the Commission refers relatively little to the territorial approach. This mainly concerns cross-border cooperation. It is precisely in these European border regions that there are enormous opportunities, in particular for increasing labour mobility. The challenge would be to create a single real European labour market where there are still 28 different labour markets. We can therefore expect the European Commission to achieve a genuine European territorial agenda and to be reported extensively in the Seventh Cohesion Report. There is also a major role to play, when it comes to this territorial agenda, for our urban areas. These are - as Mrs Westphal quite rightly said - the engines of our economic growth. These are precisely the places where solutions are devised for social tasks. Whether, for example, smart mobility in those cities or sustainable forms of energy generation. It's being conceived in the cities.  These are also the places where European regulations, where European policies land and must be implemented. Let us therefore involve the cities better in the development of European policies. Let us therefore involve the cities in the preparation of the policy.

And I am not reluctant to add that the economic system and austerity policies are no strangers to this, but responsible for that trend.  The question is whether we will continue to accept the dismantling of the productive fabric in some parts of the Union. The question, of course, is the negative impact, in my opinion, that will link cohesion to macroeconomic conditionality, causing only a few regions to continue to move forward and develop.

This is also high time, because cities are engines of social, economic and sustainable development. Now the fine words should be followed very quickly by deeds. On the one hand, as Mrs Westphal has already said, this must also be actively supported by the institutional upgrading of cities in the institutional structure, but also by greater consideration of EU policies in general for the real problems of cities. I confess that we Greens would have preferred a broader approach to the report, for example, as Mrs Regner has already mentioned, to include a gender perspective, but also to address real challenges – for example, one of the key issues facing cities, namely their financial capacity to act. Like Mrs Regner, I come from Vienna, one of the wealthiest cities in the world. Vienna, too, is feeling the effects of the Stability and Growth Pact massively and is finding it increasingly difficult to meet the active challenges, such as rising unemployment, working poor, poverty through investment.  We must look at this and see that EU policy actually supports cities and does not create new problems here the other way round. In other words, it is now the Commission's turn to take up this strong signal from the European Parliament and to bring the urban agenda to life.

I am talking about the regeneration of historic centres.  In view of the forecast of a population increase in cities between now and 2050, it was necessary to encourage all those actions aimed at preventing our urban centres from emptying, it was necessary to discourage the construction of new concrete monsters in peripheral areas, often poorly connected, which turn into real ghettos, with very serious social, cultural and economic consequences, but it was decided not to do so!  With regard to the sixth cohesion report: a brief but bitter consideration: it is September 2015 and almost two years after the start of the new programming, there are still regions – I am thinking of Campania, Calabria, southern Italy – whose administrations have not yet been able to present a decent operational programme. It is therefore essential to ensure that the less developed regions have the skills and competences to plan on time, or it will continue to happen that in order to avoid automatic disengagement and without taking into account the real needs of the territory, we will try to spend the billions of euros in the last six months and quickly.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2514, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Steeve Briois", "mepid": "124757", "text": "  on behalf of the ENF group.

The sixth cohesion report makes it clear that one of the important pillars of cohesion policy – territorial and cross-border cooperation – is barely mentioned. But it is precisely territorial and cross-border cooperation that helps to overcome borders and bring people together. To this end, the new regulations on territorial cooperation and the European grouping of territorial cooperation have created wider and improved opportunities. These instruments can now also be linked to the Neighbourhood Policy, which is even more important in the current situation. I am therefore very grateful to Mr German for giving an outstanding tribute to this policy area in his report, unlike the Commission. However, the sixth cohesion report also says that cohesion policy programmes should make cities more heard. Mrs Westphal's report provides an important impetus for this.

I would also point out that for the poorest regions, such as my region, Podkarpatta, in a low-competitiveness Poland, the subsidising nature of cohesion policy is very important, and regional funds should not be used to fund and guarantee new Commission initiatives, as was the case with the Connecting Europe Fund.

That is why I want to tell you that it is quite difficult for me to understand why this cohesion policy is so under attack, because I understand - because I have been part of the European Parliament for eight years - I understand the differences between political groups, but I want to tell you that, in my opinion, cohesion policy has no political colour, and I think we should join forces to make it more effective and to see exactly how the funds are implemented.  I think we should be very proud of these successes, but, of course, learn from the mistakes of the past, so that in the current programming period we can achieve much better results. To ensure that European funds are easily accessible to beneficiaries, simplification has been a high element of yours here, being a key element for cohesion policy. We have decided to set up a high-level working group, which will make concrete proposals from next year in terms of both the current and post-2020 programmes. On the other hand, this is also where the issue of fraud has been raised, and we need to find the exact balance between the need to simplify and the need to have very strict control over the way European money is used. There are programmes where 30 signatures are needed and this is not a requirement of the European Union. It is simply a measure taken by local authorities. The first meeting of the Working Party on Simplification will take place on 22 October and, in this respect, I am also relying and relying in particular on your contribution and experience as Members of the European Parliament. Another aspect we are working on is the preparation of the next programming period. By the end of this year, we will present a report that will assess how Member States have complied with the requirements imposed by the Partnership Agreements. This information will be particularly relevant for future strategies and, as I said, the European Parliament is a reliable partner. I would like to tell you a few things, for example, about migration, another subject raised by some of you. We have, of course, all seen the terrible images of immigrants seeking in Europe the peace, safety and well-being lost in their countries of origin, whether Syria or Libya or Eritrea. We are currently looking at how these funds and the Union's policies could contribute to the social integration of these immigrants, but I would like to tell you that we are already contributing, to a great extent, to social integration through the Regional Development Fund. I have visited, for example, the suburbs of Berlin, I have visited the suburbs of Paris, there are many communities that, through European money, have managed to integrate, to find a job. In the Netherlands, for example, we have a very nice example: a single Jordanian mother who managed to bring traditional Jordanian products and place them with The Help of European Funds on the Dutch and behold, now this mother with five children, who left for a better economic situation, manages to live alone and take care of the future of children in the Netherlands. Therefore, the challenges posed by the migration phenomenon can also be addressed and working with Member States in territorial cooperation actions, through the Interreg Programmes and macro-regional strategies.  I agree with Mr van Nistelrooij that, at this time, this cross-border cooperation between regions is gaining much greater importance. I am pleased to invite all of you who are interested to come from today in a week to Luxembourg, where it will be the 25th anniversary of cross-border cooperation. I think it's a very important topic at the moment. Last week there were many members of the European Parliament in Greece. I would like to say a few words: I enjoyed being in the REGI Committee last week. I believe that we have a duty to do everything in our power to support Greece, and I would like to thank the members of the REGI once again, for understanding the need for the Commission to adopt the measures proposed for this country as a matter of urgency and have decided to adopt them on the basis of the simplified procedure, so that EUR 35 billion ends up being invested in Greece as soon as possible. You know, Greece is one of the countries where investments from European funds account for 75-80% of public investment. Another high topic is youth unemployment. It is a challenge that must remain a priority: over 26 million European citizens really do not have a job and, thanks to the Youth Initiative and the Youth Employment Initiative, which we have fought together here in the European Parliament and which was likely to be adopted by the determination of the European Parliament, many young people will find work in the coming years. With regard to Mrs Westphal's report on the urban dimension, I understand that Parliament expects an even more active role from the Commission in promoting the urban agenda, but there are also separate opinions, whereby it is practically considered an undemocratic practice. I believe that the European Union must support cities in preparing and implementing their policies. Most of the challenges we face come from cities and urban areas, but that's where solutions come from. I want to tell you and assure you that, as a Commissioner from the country with the largest rural dimension in the European Union, the country I know very well, it is, I believe, my duty to defend the rural dimension as well. In a way, I agree with you that there is somehow a contradiction in terms between urban concentration and the need for urban concentration that we have in the legislation adopted by you and the fact that we are not succeeding in a better correlation with rural areas. We have proposed to Commissioner Hogen to see, we will also have a conference on this in October, to what extent we can contribute to rural development with our funds. Urban-rural will be a conference in Ireland that will allow us to see and analyse, on the basis of the legislation that you have drawn up, how we can, however, pay more attention to rural regions. I would also like to add that the Riga Declaration on the setting of the urban agenda, adopted last June by all Member States, with the participation of the European Parliament, the Commission, the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee, is a cornerstone, and I look forward to the Amsterdam Declaration, and I said, including in my opening word , that I appreciate the importance that the Dutch Presidency attaches to the urban dimension, and I assure you that we will continue to work on this with Parliament, with the Council, with the Committee of the Regions. I know time is limited. I take advantage of the fact that I only have one minute speech left and I would like to add a few more words. As I said, zero tolerance to fraud. We need to ensure the balance between simplification and control. Cross-border cooperation - I hope to have the opportunity, colleagues, to come here and talk about regional policy. As I was saying at one point, I think we need to make a great coalition to defend this policy, which has changed people's lives for the better. I know, as I was saying, that there are political reasons, but there are undeniable reasons: thousands of kilometres of infrastructure, schools, hospitals, tens of thousands of jobs. The thematic concentrations that you asked me about yourself have established here: science, technology, SMEs: So I think we need to think about where Europe would have been if all the Member States had started using these funds 40 years ago, when this regional development fund was established. You are right - disparities, social inequalities have deepened. But what would the European Union have been and what would these regions have looked like if it had not even been these investments? Let's see Greece, take pictures, photos, what Greece looked like before entering the European Union and what it looks like now. It was the last century. So let us not underestimate the importance that European funds have had in our countries, in our regions and for our citizens. Thank you very much and I rely with all my heart on your support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2551, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Tamás Deutsch", "mepid": "96826", "text": "   Artist. – First of all, I would like to thank all the contributors for their valuable thoughts in enriching the exchange of views. Nearly a year of work will end with tomorrow's vote, it was a joint work, the result is shared. When the European Commission prepared its sixth cohesion report, it was the opinion of the profession that it had put a valuable document on the European Parliament's table. Without wishing to praise the European Parliament and my fellow Members on our merits, this joint work has been able to prepare a better parliamentary report than the European Commission's report. This parliamentary report, in which there is complete agreement between the factions, showed the results of cohesion policy, showed the serious problems of cohesion policy and clearly showed what needs to be done. Therefore, the most important conclusion from today's exchange of views is that it is time to act. We no longer need to talk about these issues, but the Commission must act, national governments must act, regional local decision-makers must act. And obviously the point of this action is to allocate cohesion resources to local developments as quickly as possible, with as little red tape as possible. Of course, we, the European Parliament, the Committee on Regional Development, the Members, must also act. We must act in terms of doing our job, monitoring the work of the European Commission, encouraging it to act as quickly and efficiently as possible. Let us carry out legislative work that can further support the effectiveness of cohesion policy, the mid-term review work of the seven-year budget cycle and the preparation of the post-2020 cohesion policy.

It is good, and it has been fun, that so much attention has actually been paid to the cities of Europe today. Incidentally, this fulfils one of the objectives of the report: urban policy comes into the minds, into the minds of Brussels and Strasbourg, and sustainability is indeed required. It is sometimes helpful to the colleague who has already left, who is so afraid of strengthening cities, I can only say. This also applies to the report, to the city report, and many of the questions it has raised have been answered.  Personally, I look forward to continuing to work with the Urban Agenda.

We have written a lot into the report and it would not look the way it looks today. The same thing for me is that we must give cities less ballast and much more scope for action. Our cities are central spaces in our society, and they play a crucial role in the future.  This is particularly true right now. Cities face great challenges in helping the many people who come to us out of fear, hardship, suffering and fear for their lives. We must not leave the cities in the rain here!

However, the subject of Active Ageing and Intergenerational Solidarity is not only a timeless one, but also an extremely important issue in today's demographic development in Europe. The report therefore looks not only at 2012, but also focuses on a number of concrete recommendations on how to continue promoting active ageing and intergenerational solidarity. I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups for their very good and effective cooperation in drafting this report.  The European Union is facing unprecedented demographic, social and structural changes. The ageing of europe's population is a reality and it is high time to tackle this reality. Older people are an active asset to their families, peers, communities and nations. They therefore deserve to create a favourable environment for full-fledged operation. And in this sense, the ageing of the population must be seen as an opportunity and not a disaster. It must be acknowledged that the 2012 targets have been partially met. Best results have been achieved in awareness-raising initiatives and events. The concrete positive benefits of the European Year are the EU Pact on Demographic Change and the Active Ageing Index, the development of national policies, strategies and comprehensive programmes aimed at active ageing. We also need the Commission to adopt an EU strategy on demographic change to coordinate EU action in order to maximise benefits for European citizens, the economy and job creation, as well as for the protection of the human rights of the elderly in all European Union policies. We must not be relieved here. Criticism is directed against the late approval of the European Year and against the low budget. Because both of these things have made it difficult to run smoothly this year and that's a shame. There is a need to further strengthen the coordination triangle, which consists of all levels of decision-making, including EU, national, regional and local levels, civil society and the private sector, including sectors that provide innovative goods and services to promote independent living. We also need proper statistics on the situation of seniors and on demographics. In this report, we call on the Commission to do so. We are concerned about unemployment among over-50s and the rising long-term unemployment rate, as well as the growing not only disparities between Member States, but also between regions. The second part of the report focuses on concrete recommendations to improve active ageing and intergenerational solidarity. I would like to mention that we must combat discrimination. Older workers often continue to be subjected to discrimination based on age, stereotypes and obstacles. I would also like to mention that volunteering has added value, and I am disappointed that the Grundtvig programme supporting older volunteers has been interrupted. Ladies and gentlemen, active ageing brings new social needs requiring investment in a variety of public services and in the area of health and care for the elderly. It also opens up economic opportunities arising from public and consumer spending, coupled with an ageing population, and from specific products, services, innovative solutions and needs that create new jobs. We have a lot of work to do, so the initiatives mentioned need to be followed up with concrete political decisions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2556, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Marianne Thyssen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, first of all I wish to thank Mr Kukan for his report. It reflects, usefully and insightfully, the achievements of the follow-up to the 2012 European Year for Active Ageing. Firstly, the European Year 2012 has contributed towards firmly establishing active ageing on the European agenda and on many national policy agendas. It is now widely recognised that active ageing is key to preserving solid welfare systems and strong solidarity between the generations in our own ageing societies. Secondly, the European Year 2012 left an important legacy in the form of the guiding principles for active ageing and solidarity between the generations, and in the form of the Active Ageing Index, a tool to measure untapped potential and the successes or failures of our active ageing policies.  The Commission is committed to promoting active ageing, and it does this in various ways. Many of them are referred to in the report. Let me mention some of them. First, in the context of the European Semester, the Commission calls on the Member States most concerned to take measures that will raise the labour force participation of older workers. Indeed, this is a success story. The employment rate of older workers has increased even through the crisis.  Secondly, the importance of promoting independent living in old age has been highlighted in a joint report of the Commission services and the Social Protection Committee on adequate social protection for long-term care needs in an ageing society. This report included proposals for future activities in the areas of long-term care. They should address the lack of good empirical evidence – a precondition for closer cooperation and mutual learning among Member States, as well as for any policy initiatives at the European level.  Thirdly, the Commission has launched a joint project with the OECD on measuring the adequacy of social protection against long-term care needs. It should develop a methodology for cross-country comparisons of the extent of social protection against long-term care needs. Fourthly, the Commission started a new project with the European Network of National Human Rights Institutions to promote greater respect for the human rights of people in long-term care. Specific measures to support active and healthy ageing are being developed with parts of the business community in the context of the European Innovation Partnership on active and healthy ageing. Active ageing also became a higher priority in the new funding instruments, such as the European Social Fund.  The European Year was a milestone, but your report, Mr Kukan and dear Members of Parliament, is also a timely reminder that we must continue to build on these achievements of the European Year, and that we must not relent in our efforts to promote active ageing.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2557, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "David Casa", "mepid": "28122", "text": "  F'isem the PPE group. – Sinjura President, l-ewwel nett irrid nibda jien ukoll billi nirringrazzja lir-rapporteur tagťna lis-Sur Kukan li llum gťandna dan ir-rapport quddiemna li jiena ngťid huwa rapport importantťafna gťaliex jitkellem dwar il-popolazzjoni tal-Unjoni Ewropea illi qiegťda tgťix aktar u hija aktar b'saťťitha u din hija xi żaża pożittiva, but mill-band l-oťra, l-anzjanità ťafna drabi tiżi kkunsidrata bťala theddida lis-soèjetà, l-aktar minťabba l-impatt li tťalli fuq is-sigurtà so-jali , u gťaldaqstant dan il-fenomenu qiegťed iqajjem ťafna mistoqsijiet: kif nistgťu, pereżempju, ngťinu lin-nies sabiex, jibqgťu attivi u indipendenti anke meta jkunu qegťdin jikbru fl-età?

Indeed, the European Year for Intergenerational Solidarity and Active Ageing has been important for our people, as it has given impetus to both solidarity between generations and the further formulation of active ageing policies in the Member States. This has reaffirmed that older people are certainly not a burden on the economy and society, but an asset, first of all, because of their experience, because of their achievements, because of their knowledge. Qualifications, experience, wisdom, loyalty to the employer are those great values, so we need to encourage employers to accept and retain older workers in the labour market, to help them improve their qualifications and to adapt their working conditions. Member States must also ensure the sustainability of pension systems while guaranteeing people an adequate income in retirement so that they can live both with dignity and proactively. Unfortunately, poverty among older people has increased in some EU countries over the last five years, endangering the proper nutrition, health of those people, and finally facing energy poverty. Some appropriate solutions are therefore needed, both at European Union level and at national level. At the same time, Member States must strengthen quality public infrastructure for older people – I mean day centres, home assistance, quality inpatient care and care services, finally adapted public transport system. And for certain, we really need to use the European Union's Structural Funds. Honourable Commissioner, I appeal to you to examine the problem of unemployment among people over 50, and the Commission, together with the Member States, local authorities, the social partners, must analyse the causes of unemployment among older people and propose concrete measures to increase their employment. And to conclude, it is certainly unreasonable to link the retirement age solely to the increase in life expectancy. The situation of the European Union's labour market must be assessed and, finally, the physical ability of a person to remain on the labour market for as long as possible. Is there no risk that, by reducing the number of pensioners, moving away from retirement age, will we only increase the ranks of the unemployed?

Countless associations, institutions and churches have taken part in the actions. The logo was present throughout Europe. And I think a lot of the impulses that have been initiated are sustainable, they still reverberate to this day. In the report on the European Year, the European Parliament insisted on taking the solidarity of generations into the title, in addition to active ageing. One cannot discuss one without the other. Families in particular are the place of a lived solidarity between generations. Mothers in particular make active ageing possible, and they deserve special thanks in this context. But in Germany, they often end up with a minimum pension. I want to achieve a European family strategy so that mothers, but also parents as a whole, can enjoy their age with dignity.

We know that regulating the situation of older people under the principle of subsidiarity is the responsibility of the States, so do we have something to say at Community level? No doubt- yes! The report warns that the fundamental objective of improving the situation of the elderly and disabled is not just to prolong their ability and will to participate in the work process. But it is about having the opportunity to be active, integrated into society, considered and healthy. We expect the Commission to put forward a sensible and achievable strategy to respond to demographic change and the ageing of europe's population. A healthy and productive intergenerational relationship also includes adequate pensions and secure pension funds. It must not be the case that, in times of crisis, these funds and pensions are a reserve to cover budgetary losses, and it is therefore essential to ensure independent supervision of the management of pension funds. The report calls for intergenerational solidarity, a systematic help to those older people who are no longer able to do so without help, such as the elderly with dementia.

We believe, yes, that the increase in average life expectancy is an achievement of civilization and a factor of social progress and should not be seen as a burden on society. Now, what the expression \"active ageing\" should mean is, not that people have to work late, but that older people should not be abandoned, as is currently the case in so many countries. But first, they must be able to actively participate in social life, they must be able to exercise their citizenship and, in order for this to happen, they must necessarily have access to decent pensions, which guarantee them independence, and to public services, including public health services, which guarantee them quality of life, an indispensable condition for them to actively participate in their communities.  We do not agree that the ageing population should lead to what is here called a reform of social security systems. We know what this means in practice: raising the retirement age and privatising Social Security, benefiting banks and insurers. What is required for the sustainability of social security reform is the strengthening of public social security systems, which must be supportive and universal, which means that those who have the most and who profit the most have to contribute more to them and that unemployment and precarious jobs, decapitalization factors of social security systems, must be fought and eliminated.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2562, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Tatjana Ždanoka", "mepid": "28619", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, I also want to congratulate Eduard Kukan for the report, which – pointing out that the 2012 European Year succeeded in its goal of mobilising the relevant actors around the topic – considers that these initiatives need to be followed now by concrete action. The high unemployment among people over the age of 50 is an extremely worrying phenomenon. Yes, Commissioner Thyssen, I agree that the employment rate for elderly people has risen somewhat but it is not yet satisfactory, and therefore we call on the Commission to address the problem of reintegrating dismissed middle-aged workers, using the new European financial instruments.

What hinders us above all in this system is your willingness to consider our elders as a raw material that should be exploited and profitable to produce wealth, what you call the seniors' economy, by hiding behind the usual shock argument of single thought, that of age discrimination, this time around.  On the contrary, we believe that our elders have the right to enjoy the few years they have left, to take time, to take the time to travel and discover the world they have shaped, to take care of their families and grandchildren; we believe that they have the right to finally live for themselves and for themselves.

For the first time, concrete measures for young and older people were put together at European level into an overall package. This includes the European Youth Guarantee. Member States could undertake to offer every young person a job, apprenticeship or other training after unemployment of a maximum of four months. It has become an important tool for dealing with the consequences of the economic, financial and social crisis. The report by my colleague, Mr Kukan, shows that it helps to prevent a lost generation.  Another building block was the proposal to create a European Year of Active Ageing, which the European Commission proclaimed in 2012. Among other things, older workers should be able to enter the labour market for longer if they so wish. A large number of events have impressively demonstrated that older people are not a burden, but a gain for society because of their experience and knowledge. A small downside: the budget of EUR 5 million was too small to meet the great interest of the citizens.  Some points are still awaiting implementation: intergenerational balance sheets for mapping cash flows between vintages and, of course, the European Pact 50plus to increase the employment rate of workers over fifty years of age.

It is important that we keep people in active employment until they retire, otherwise we will create even more poverty in Europe. The role of the social partners is also very important here. In order for older workers to be able to keep their jobs or even get a new one, we need changed jobs with good health and safety, part-time opportunities and lifelong learning.

The year 2015 is coming to an end, with youth unemployment soaring and we, instead of 'emptying their seats', as we would quite simply say, are now wondering whether our guidelines for raising the age limits have succeeded. I wonder what solidarity we're talking about? This is not solidarity either with the elderly who are forced every two years to add an extra year until they receive their pension, nor with young people whose unemployment exceeds 20%. It is not, therefore, a question of solidarity, but of punishment for both the new and the previous generations. This is yet another contradictory policy that forces weary people to seek work up to their 70s, at a time when millions of young people are being denied the chance to take their lives into their own hands.

French demographer Alfred Sauvy wrote: \"The ageing of the population will be the most important social fact of the second half of the 20th century.\" In a century, we have seen a near doubling of life expectancy. It was therefore simple to infer that the so-called active ageing of the population would be one of the major challenges of our 21st century. But since that observation, what is the Member States' record in this area? It is up to us to decide whether this ageing population should be an opportunity or a burden on our society. To properly accompany aging can, I am convinced, be a real generator of economic growth. It can also be, through intergenerational exchange, a pillar of social cohesion on our continent. Demographic ageing is also a responsibility; a society is often judged by the way it treats its seniors.  In most Member States, the answer to unemployment among the over-50s is based on mathematical arrangements with published rates. Pension systems are sometimes totally outdated. The gap between the supply and demand for geriatric infrastructure is stark, particularly in rural areas. The autonomy of seniors, on the other hand, is despised. How can we also explain the near absence of pharmaceutical research for patients over the age of 70? The European Union therefore has a great responsibility in this area. We call on the European Commission to study the case of each member country and to provide it with clear recommendations in these urgent areas, including the dissemination of best practices.

It therefore seems to me necessary to share the need to review active labour and training policies for the promotion of other areas of good employment and quality work, using and transferring competence and knowledge to the new generations, rethinking local development models, rebalancing attention to recover lifestyles within a new socio-economic vision of rural inland areas , to give back protagonism to the elderly.

Commissioner, i would like to thank you very much for Dear! I am very pleased to be able to refer to the excellent and very important report by Eduard Kukan, which talks about the importance of recognising active ageing as a very important challenge in Europe. It is important for improving the quality of life of seniorcitizens, but also for building a competitive, prosperous and sustainable Europe. An appropriate policy in this area, common to the European Union, is one of our important tasks. It is very important that seniorcitizens are independent, that they are economically independent, and therefore, among those tasks that are already mentioned as already more detailed in the report, it is right to emphasise the prevention of digital exclusion and the prevention of falling out of the labour market of people over the age of 50. I am also pleased that the report takes into account one of the most important problems in the European Union, the 39% pension gap. The fact that the average European woman receives a pension almost forty percent lower than the average European is our shame, and this undoubtedly contributes to the fact that older women are much more likely than older men to be poor and suffer poverty.  The report also rightly emphasises the importance of social enterprises developing services for the elderly and rightly calls for the work on the European Commission document on the accessibility of older people to transport and housing services and products based on information and communication technologies to be accelerated. I think that universal design here can be helpful and the wider introduction of common European legislation in this area would certainly help in terms of accessibility and mobility of those who already have some health problems. The actions of the European Commission are also important. These are recommendations to Member States in the framework of the European Semester in the fields of employment, pensions, social inclusion and long-term care for the elderly.

Personally, I think it is necessary to recognise the potential of older people and their experiences, as they have a valuable impact on all social sides, including the economy. However, in the face of all the challenges of an ageing society, I would like to highlight the problems associated with ensuring the stability of pension systems. It is true that pension systems are regulated by each country in their own way. Many countries, including my country Slovenia, use the so-called Pay as You Go system, where young people pay for the elderly. It is right that the creation of pension systems is still in the hands of the Member States, but these systems are becoming so unsustainable that this is becoming a problem for the whole of Europe. I therefore, of course, think that europe as a whole should be more involved in surveillance and also in the recommendations on how Member States should design their systems, all with a view to making these stable in the long term and that we have decent pensions guaranteed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2574, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Richard Howitt (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "2073", "text": "   – Madam President, I was proud to hold a European Year event in Bedford, in my constituency, with Britain’s Age UK, about the importance of staying warm, and to take part in exercise programmes called ‘Fit as a fiddle’ in Luton and in Ipswich.

How can British pensioners heat their homes when two million of them – paid the lowest pensions as a proportion of GDP of all European countries except Latvia – live in poverty, and when the pre-election promise to cap their social care costs has been cruelly broken less than three months on? Sadly, British pensioners are simply some of the worst victims of cuts in welfare levels, which the Commission Report on Ageing says will decline Europe-wide by a further 2% this year.

In my region, Aragon, as well as in other Spanish regions, there are very aging municipalities that are joined by low population density and high dispersion, which hinders and makes public services more difficult and more important and threatens their survival. The excess cost in services such as education or health becomes five times that of the capital, so an improvement in territorial vertebration or existing infrastructures will help to fix the population, protect its survival and promote active ageing, regardless of where it is living.

There's another way. It's got to be different.  The second point is that in Europe, many people are retiring. Two retired and one younger one back.

Firstly, there should be an increase in funding for social security systems and public infrastructure for the elderly, such as nursing homes. Particular emphasis should also be placed on sparsely populated and island regions, such as the Aegean islands, which have fewer means and infrastructure to promote active demand, as well as more generally for regions with demographic handicaps.

And we must invest in this evolution, which is a view that the Commission shares with you. Ageing of the population and the associated challenges will increase in the coming years. Because we know that the baby boom cohort is reaching retirement age and we must now use the momentum of the European Year to step up our efforts and improve the quality of life of older people in all respects; Parliament's report indicates the right direction for this, for which thanks.  Attention has been drawn to the special position of the unemployed among the older population group. I can tell you that in the coming weeks we will be putting forward an initiative to combat long-term unemployment. Long-term unemployment is also a problem among the older part of the population. They are having a hard time getting back to work, and I hope that this initiative will certainly benefit them as well. At least I believe in that.  There has also been talk of pensions. Pensions must not only be sustainable, in the financial sense of the word, namely that governments can still pay them, but they must also be adequate and they must reach a decent level. That is, a level at which people can continue to have a decent standard of living, even when they leave the labour market. But to achieve this, more people will have to work, more people will have to work and people will also have to work longer and we also know that this is not easy. This has an impact on the organisation of work. This has an impact on the workability of work. We will also look at this together with the social partners, because we must ensure working conditions and safety and health at work in order to make this possible. Skills have been talked about. People need to keep the necessary skills to keep working. We must pay particular attention to this. Lifelong learning, skilling, reskilling, that's something that's definitely going to be addressed in the skills agenda that we're going to be proposing in 2016. And in doing so, we will pay particular attention to the group of older workers or older people in society.  As far as the question of a strategy is concerned, I can reply that, in line with its previous strategic communications between 2006 and 2009, the Commission has certainly made a serious contribution over the last 15 years to raising awareness of the challenges posed by an ageing population, thus helping Member States to be prepared for them. Demographic change is something that has been mainstreamed in the Commission's policy in various cases. We support adapting to demographic change in areas such as social policy, employment, education, transport, ICT, research, but also in the context of economic, fiscal and regional policy. And adjusting policies in a democracy does indeed require change; this remains an integral part of our Europe 2020 strategy and is also clearly present in country specific recommandations. We will make sure that that attention does not slacken. Initiatives such as the White Paper on Pensions, a 2012 initiative, or the social investment package launched in 2013, offer prospects and guidance for the future to policy makers on how best to address the challenges. I am convinced that the strategic orientations we find in them remain valid. The priority now is that these strategic orientations are properly implemented and properly addressed in each of our policy areas. That requires constant attention. This requires a concentration on this problem. That also requires a kind of cultural change. But if we continue to work on that, Then I am sure we will succeed.

This applies not only to issues such as the efficiency of pension systems or the need for health services. The new demographic situation requires innovative solutions, including the equalisation of age-related fitness deficits using new technologies and the introduction of more flexible forms of employment. An important dimension is the quality of life of older people, the promotion of their active participation in all dimensions of social and economic life and the taking of actions conducive to cooperation, understanding and mutual respect between representatives of different generations. Awareness of the huge contribution of older people to social and economic life is still low. Older people are a significant group of consumers, stimulating the development of sectors such as tourism and health, care and rehabilitation services, as well as stable, loyal employees with expertise and experience.

It is one of the few fisheries agreements in the European Union that allows access to mixed fisheries. The country has enormous wealth in resources, but is considered one of the least advanced countries. It is estimated that two thirds of families live below the poverty line. Its gross domestic product per capita is one of the lowest in the world. Its economy depends heavily on agriculture, in particular cashew. Artisanal fishing, including subsistence fishing, ensures the survival of thousands of fishermen.  Although it signed the first fisheries agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau 35 years ago, the results achieved so far, by sectoral comparison, are clamorously scarce. 3/4 of the approximately 1,500 vessels registered in 2009 were canoe-type, made from tree trunks.  We consider a more detailed assessment and consideration of this agreement, its history and future prospects necessary. Considering the role and competences of the European Parliament in this area, we consider it appropriate and necessary to approve a non-legislative resolution on this agreement. The agreement should promote a more effective and sustainable development of the Guinean fisheries sector, as well as related industries and activities, in particular small-scale fishing, which contribute significantly to food security and sovereignty and local livelihoods, increasing the added value in the country and contributing to improving the quality of life of the population , as a result of the exploitation of its natural resources.  Mechanisms should be set up for greater transparency, accountability and participation of the local population, in particular fishing communities practising small-scale artisanal fishing, including the possible revision and increase of the component of the agreement for sectoral support, alongside the creation of others and better conditions to increase and ensure that the positive repercussions of this agreement fall , preferably in local communities.  Persistent and lasting efforts are needed to produce positive results and, in line with, as examples of areas to be supported, institutional capacity building, vocational training, artisanal fishing, a greater focus on gender policies, with a recognition and appreciation of the role of women, distribution, marketing of fish, conservation, first processing.  As with other countries in the region, it is considered necessary to improve the quantity and reliability of catch information in general on the state of conservation of fisheries resources, in addition to support for the development of own capacities by Guinea-Bissau. Finally, we stress that this Parliament must be immediately and fully informed, at all stages, of the procedures relating to the Protocol or its renewal. It is proposed to report annually to Parliament and the Council on the results of the multiannual sectoral programme referred to in Article 3 of the Protocol and on compliance with the requirement for declarations of catches.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2591, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Peter van Dalen", "mepid": "96809", "text": "   Rapporteur. Commissioner, please note that you can be there today.  I present my report on the council's draft decision on the conclusion of a Protocol between the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde establishing fishing opportunities and financial consideration; In addition to a draft legislative resolution, I have also tabled a non-legislative resolution. It is precisely because of this that Parliament can say more than just yes or no to the fisheries agreement. I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the European Commission, and certainly the secretariat of our Fisheries Committee for cooperation.  Unfortunately, Cape Verde is not a highly developed country. It ranks 131st on the UN Development Index, which has a total of 187 countries. The economy is growing a bit, especially tourism. It is a regret that just last week the archipelago was hit by a major hurricane for the first time in more than a hundred years. Fortunately, the damage from this hurricane was not so great. But what you do see is increased uncertainty. Are such storms more likely to occur, does that possibly have to do with climate change? As far as the draft legislative resolution is concerned, I recommend that Parliament approve the new protocol. I think that is advantageous, both for the European Union and for our fishermen who use it. But it is also important for Cape Verde to get economic returns from the fisheries stocks in their waters. Fortunately, Mr Ponga, on behalf of the Committee on Development, and Mr Fernandes, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, also came to this finding; thanks to both rapporteurs for their opinions.  The European Union concluded a fisheries partnership agreement with Cape Verde in 1990 and six protocols have been implemented since then. So we are now dealing with the seventh protocol, which has a duration of four years. The total amount involved in the agreement is EUR 3.3 million and can be roughly divided into EUR 1 million to compensate for access to the waters, eur 1 million for sectoral support and 1.2 million compensations from ship owners.  Compared to the previous protocol, the amount of sectoral aid in particular has increased enormously. It has even doubled, and that means more projects for better monitoring of fisheries and also combating illegal fishing.  In addition, there are projects for increased safety for local fishermen in particular and for the training and training of these people, and I also think it is positive to report that European ship owners are also going to contribute more to the quotas they use. Then the sharks. That is an issue for which I have tabled a non-legislative resolution. Because the catch of sharks has increased sharply in these waters off Cape Verde, even doubled. 1700 tonnes in 2008, 3300 tonnes in 2012. This worrying development has led to three measures being included in this Protocol. 1. The number of longliners is reduced from 35 to 30, and these are the fishermen and the fishing methods that bring out many sharks.  2. Shark catches are tracked and thresholds of 1500 and 2000 tonnes are built in, after which management measures can be taken. 3. There will be an investigation into the life of the sharks in that area there.  Of course, I know that this is a sensitive issue, and these measures in the protocol are a first step, but I think the thresholds built into these measures are quite low. They'll be made quickly. I think it is important for this Parliament that we keep our finger on the pulse by following developments closely, and I ask the Commission to do the same. There is a real need to take steps, because sharks are a vulnerable fish stock and should not be overfished. They are part of God's creation and vital in the ecosystem. That is why I am asking you to support my amendment which will make this text a little more.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2592, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Ricardo Serrão Santos", "mepid": "124741", "text": "   Rapporteur. – Madam President, a special greeting to Commissioner Vella. The second half of the 20th century was paradigmatic in terms of the management of the seas and oceans. The visionary United Nations International Law of the Sea was agreed, based on values as relevant as the precautionary principle, peace-building, resource sharing, the protection of biodiversity, sustainable development, the ecosystem vision, the idea of an ocean.  But we also witnessed, and despite the law, the excess of fishing and the collapse of wild springs. Associated with the decline of resources in traditional fishing grounds, some industrial fleets, many of them European, migrated to the high seas and the deep sea. European countries have developed from the largest distant fishing fleets, have established fisheries agreements with many ACP countries. It should be noted that the International Law of the Sea provides that countries that do not use their renewable marine resources should make them available to third countries. Cooperation agreements for the fisheries area are thus ambassadors of the European Union for maritime issues. But fishing agreements cannot be a leak forward in order to recover the ecological footprint we leave behind. They must be ambassadors for sustainable development cooperation and good fishing practice. Unlike others, European fleets today comply with legal frameworks based on environmental accountability, based on better scientific knowledge and ecosystem approximation. Fishing agreements are now better prepared today than 40, 30, 20, 10, or even 5 years ago. They address issues such as identifying living springs, respect for workers' rights, stimulating local fisheries sectors and respect for environmental constraints. In the event of failure – and there are failures – the different legal regimes of European countries tend, by very recent provisions, to be increasingly inflexible and efficient. For example, I would remind you that one of the European governments increased the maximum penalties to EUR 11 million for non-compliance. I am convinced that the fisheries agreement with Madagascar, of which I am rapporteur, can help to improve the conditions of a country with enormous difficulties while benefiting European fleets. This partnership agreement is based on the rules laid down by the relevant fisheries organisations and includes fishing opportunities for 94 vessels. More than 15,000 tonnes of fish are expected to be caught in the waters of madagascar's Exclusive Economic Zone and, in return for its use of this area, the European Union will finance Madagascar and its fishing sector, in particular for more than EUR 6 million over four years. In the case of the Cape Verde agreement, in which I am shadow rapporteur, I am concerned about the level of uncertainty of the impact of fisheries on shark populations, as my colleague van Dalen has already said, but I welcome the provisions of the agreement to study this subject in detail. The amendments to the report reinforce these aspects and will have my support. Although I am not directly responsible for the Guinea-Bissau report, I think we will have to take particular care in monitoring this agreement. The political instability of this country is worrying and this agreement should be another factor of rapprochement with local authorities and development communities, particularly fishing communities. It is therefore important to monitor these agreements by the Commission, ensuring that negligence and corruption are escaping. At first, I think it is necessary to invest in inadequate infrastructure, which runs the risk of being scorned or out of step with outdated infrastructure. These are important issues. But smaller, when compared to the major problems of international fisheries. Abuse of labour, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, including the use of flags of convenience and the use of technologies not assessed from an environmental point of view, are gaps that have to be addressed. I applaud the efforts made by the European Commission, but I stress, with the same wisdom that has been used so far, we need to go much further.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2593, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Karmenu Vella", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, it is a pleasure to be here for this joint debate on the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements and the associated Protocols with Madagascar, Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde. I welcome this opportunity to discuss these protocols with you, and I would like to thank, first and foremost, the rapporteurs – Mr Serrão Santos, Mr Ferreira, who was represented by Ms Senra Rodríguez, and Mr van Dalen – for their reports. I am also pleased to note that the reports adopted in the Committee on Fisheries recommend that Parliament give its assent to the three protocols we will be discussing today. I can assure you that I have taken careful note of your suggestions for improvement. Our strategy underlying fisheries agreements is to consolidate and possibly extend the network of agreements, in particular tuna agreements. These agreements will allow our fleet to rely on a real continuum of agreements in the three main regions concerned – basically the Atlantic, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific – bringing stable and consistent rules for its fishing operations. At the same time, they will ensure the sustainable use of fisheries resources. They will support effective fisheries management and they will contribute to the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, and they will help the development of local industries and guarantee good value for EU taxpayers’ money. Let me now say a few words on each of these protocols. The biggest of the three fisheries agreement, as has been mentioned, is the one with Guinea- Bissau. It is essential for the EU fleet and it is also vital for the economy of Guinea-Bissau, which is highly dependent on fisheries. Under the new protocol, the EU fleet has been able to resume its fishing activities in Guinea-Bissau after an interruption of over two years, and these fishing activities are sustainable: the stocks are considered to be in a good state and fisheries indicators such as catch levels and fishing effort have remained stable over the past years. Fishing opportunities were, in fact, slightly reduced and we took specific conservation measures. Having said this, it is clear that the situation needs to be monitored very closely. Scientific cooperation with Guinea-Bissau should also be intensified, as well as scientific cooperation at regional level. Sectoral support to Guinea-Bissau has been programmed mainly to improve the management of fisheries resources, to further reinforce control and surveillance capacities, to improve sanitary conditions and to promote artisanal fisheries. Allow me to turn now to another partner in the region, Cape Verde. Although this fisheries agreement is the smallest in financial terms, it is of strategic importance for the EU fleet because of high catch volumes and its position in the regional network of tuna agreements. As Mr van Dalen mentioned, the sustainability of shark fishing was a concern under the previous protocol. Several measures are therefore included in the new protocol to regulate shark catches by EU vessels more effectively. Firstly, the reduction in fishing opportunities for longliners is expected to reduce or at least ‘freeze’ the number of shark catches. Secondly, the protocol provides for a monitoring mechanism for shark catches and a study on the situation of sharks in Cape Verde and the wider region. We will monitor closely the implementation of these measures, which should also be seen in the wider framework of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). The new sectoral support programme will focus on reinforcing Cape Verde’s monitoring, control and surveillance capacity through the installation of a new vessel monitoring system (VMS) and the introduction of electronic catch reporting. Let me now turn to the EU-Madagascar Protocol. This protocol is an important part of a broader network of fisheries agreements with coastal states in the south-western part of the Indian Ocean. Let me highlight just two of its key elements: first, its contribution to the development of the Malagasy domestic fishing sector, in particular its small-scale component; and, second, its provisions on sharks and the protection of the most vulnerable species. In terms of sectoral support, the protocol aims to strengthen the monitoring and control capacities of the Malagasy authorities nationally and also at the level of the south-western Indian Ocean. This should help make Madagascar one of the major regional players in the fight against IUU fishing. Here too Mr Serrão Santos raised the concern about sharks. On shark fishing, the protocol very clearly defines the scope of authorised shark fisheries. Allowable species show either stable abundance indices or slight positive trends. In addition, through its catch limits, the protocol will clearly constrain fishing mortality on sharks in Malagasy waters. With regard to protection of the most vulnerable species – and I am referring here to sharks, sea-turtles, marine mammals and seabirds – the measures in the protocol go beyond management conservation measures adopted by regional fisheries management organisations. The protocol specifically defines prohibited species in relation to capture and retention on board. On top of this, EU ship-owners have put in place best practices to decrease incidental catches and to handle vulnerable species caught incidentally in fishing gear. Let me thank you again for today’s opportunity to debate three of our fisheries agreements.

I will rather insist on the Madagascar agreement since I have been rapporteur on this issue. I believe that this is a win-win relationship between the European Union and Madagascar, since, on the one hand, the agreement allows Europeans to continue fishing in territorial waters and, on the other hand, it allows Madagascar above all to benefit from a whole scheme and the implementation of good practices.  I believe that this is a very interesting agreement which allows Madagascar to find itself at the heart of a system in the Indian Ocean, which is a mechanism to maintain the population of the fish in question and, above all, to evolve and take advantage of this situation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2596, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Alain Cadec", "mepid": "96849", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the objective of transparency and mutual interest must guide the external side of the common fisheries policy. Since the adoption of the reform of the new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in 2013, new fundamental principles on the external component have been set in stone. The principle of the mutual interest of the parties, sustainable governance, revision clauses in the event of human rights violations or commitments made in the fight against illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing, and also, finally, respect for the surplus, defined by the latest scientific opinions, that European vessels are allowed to fish.  The conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources is at the heart of these fisheries agreements. The CFP must promote sustainable fisheries governance at European and international level. The international presence of European industry in the countries with which we have sustainable fisheries agreements allows us to supply the European market while developing local fishing activity in third countries. The joint agreement with Guinea-Bissau is particularly important because of the diversity of species caught. The European market is the world's largest market for fish products. We import more than 70% of the fish products consumed in Europe. We must therefore enable its supply of quality products while respecting the principles of sustainable fishing in its environmental, social and economic dimensions.

And that is, I believe, a clear success of the objective of this fisheries policy. I wanted to focus especially on Guinea-Bissáu.

The main problem with the tuna agreements is that over the years they have come to include ever greater by-catches of sharks. Attention has been drawn to these two agreements, and there are clauses in both agreements to reduce shark by-catch. We will therefore support these agreements.

This so-called new protocol negotiated after the political situation stabilised in Guinea Bissau is nothing more than an old protocol. It looks exactly the same as the protocol that was suspended in 2012, when there was a military coup in Guinea Bissau.  A lot has happened over these years. New Chinese boats have been added, there have been cheating supints with false tonnage certificates, and there have been reports of illegal fishing. The Commission has been in such a hurry when it was free to negotiate again that it did not consider itself to have time to re-evaluate. Everything is based on the old evaluation from 2011.

In this area, I intend to make proposals for you very soon, Commissioner. We must be satisfied because this is the first time that there has been a section on sustainable fisheries partnership agreements in the regulation of the common fisheries policy. This is a substantial change. In the past, fisheries agreements with third countries focused almost exclusively on trade; today, with greater transparency, the focus is on partnerships, governance and cooperation, with these agreements being subject to regular evaluations.

In partnership with the contracting countries, such as Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde and Madagascar, on the one hand, and with the Member States of the European Union on the other. What does that mean? The European Union receives a certain amount of fish, and in return the people of the contracting countries receive the appropriate money to improve their livelihoods. The European Union can only fish as much as it can grow, and only the surpluses not used by a third country. With our agreements, we call on our partners to guarantee the Cotonou Convention, in particular Article 9 on human rights, democratic principles, the rule of law and good governance. I say this also to Guinea-Bissau. If our partners do not respect this, it is possible to suspend these agreements. All of this has been the case since 2014 and is crucial for us. We too, the members of the European Union, have given new rules to our fishermen. If our trawlers do not comply with the rules of the CFP, namely to end overfishing, we can deprive them of their fishing rights for up to two years. I therefore assume that in future Europeans will fish fairly and that the terrible images in the media of how we are emptying the seas of the Third World will finally no longer have to be shown.

More than the economic aspect, the European Union should use these agreements to strengthen cooperation instruments and promote the development of these countries in the social and environmental fields. Such cooperation instruments should therefore focus on combating corruption of holders of public office with responsibilities in the fisheries area, and the European Union should suspend agreements where there are political changes that violate human rights or the principles of democracy. They should also implement programmes to combat unreported and unregulated illegal fishing, as well as the sustainable and responsible exploitation of local resources and their monitoring.  In summary, that fisheries partnership agreements naturally benefit the countries of the European Union, but also contribute significantly to the development of the countries with which they are concluded and are therefore to be supported and increased. The point is that they are not used as an incentive to feed what the European Union itself has been working to combat: illegal fishing and the degradation of the oceans.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2606, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Ian Hudghton (Verts/ALE).", "mepid": "2338", "text": "   – Madam President, in the past fisheries agreements have seemed too often to be primarily a mechanism for exporting surplus fleet capacity from certain EU Member States.

For those reasons and some others, I have most often in the past voted against such agreements in principle. However, one of the key improvements of the common fisheries policy was supposedly to place fisheries partnership agreements on a sounder ethical footing. They are now supposed to adhere to sustainability objectives. Nevertheless, each agreement has to be taken on its merits, and it is regrettable to say that the Guinea-Bissau Protocol is now founded on well out-of-date data, a situation that is avoidable and should have been avoided.

On the one hand, they assure the Union fleet of the continuation of economic activity through sustainable exploitation and, on the other hand, help the development of the third country's fisheries sector in many different respects. By mentioning the Agreement with Guinea-Bissáu, I would like to emphasize that it has benefited, inter alia, that part of the Spanish cephalopod fleet harmed by the exclusion of the Mauritanian Agreement.  And focusing now on the Agreement with Cape Verde, I would like to point out that it is a very important agreement for the fleets of Spain, France and Portugal. It benefits a total of 71 community ships. On the question of sharks, I would like to stress that the Protocol already lays down measures to ensure the sustainability of populations in Cape Verde, and that we will have a report next year, in accordance with the decision taken by the Joint Commission in March this year.  I will also say that the ICCAT reports, which are the body responsible for monitoring shark populations, say that both dry cleaning and dientuous marrajo, which are the two species fished in Cape Verde, are not overexploited and that biomass is well above that which guarantees maximum sustainable yield.  I believe that, in shark matters, this fishing should not be demonized as long as, logically, legal species are captured. And I'm done.

In order to meet our sustainability and development challenges, our fisheries agreements can be powerful levers, but to do so we need to be bolder in order to demand more control, strengthen scientific monitoring of species and, of course, promote development in third countries.  Of course, we must welcome, and indeed credit it to the Commission and Parliament, the very positive development of these agreements. However, the Commission too often forgets about fishing when it negotiates international trade agreements. The delegated act with the Philippines opening the floodgates to seafood without traceability or control or the agreement with Thailand, a country listed as employing enslaved fishermen on board ships, shows the urgency of reversing the terms of our trade agreements, which should integrate these environmental and social issues.

That is why these fisheries agreements, which the European Union will conclude with the developing countries, are very important in two respects. On the one hand, these are development measures, that we are advancing the fisheries sector there in Madagascar, Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau, that they are getting economic development. And on the other hand, that the European fleet can fish there and, of course, according to the rules it has given itself: basic regulation, a ban on discards, complete monitoring and even monitoring. We have AIS, the automatic ship identification system.  In Europe, we know what is happening to our fishing fleet in the Indian Ocean. When it comes to quotas, they are not simply taken out arbitrarily, but the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission determines how many tonnes can be caught. In this respect, we also have a positive development with regard to these treaties, the fisheries agreements, including with the Republic of Madagascar. I will vote in favour tomorrow!

It is true that since there has been a fishing fleet with modern vessels, with freezers on board, fishing has been global. It is fished globally, by the EU, by Asian countries, by many. For a while, it was really exploitation. It was the case that modern vessels in poor countries were emptying the coasts, and the local sector had no chance of getting on its feet. Fortunately, this is different now. In recent years, the EU has done a very good job, even if not everything is perfect. Now, in fact, only what the countries on the ground cannot fish on the ground is being fished by the EU. The money that countries receive as compensation from the EU is used to build up the sector. This is also very good for the situation on the ground. Finally, sustainable fishing is a condition for the EU for these partnership agreements.

In fact, the financial compensation that the Union promises to guarantee Cape Verde is manifestly insufficient, as the Commissioner has rightly said, to ensure a fair and adequate standard of living for Cape Verdean fishing communities, to boost the fish processing sector and to enable the diversification of cape verde's economy.

It is good to note that there is substantial support from the European Parliament for these agreements. The European Union’s fisheries partnership agreements (FPAs) promote sustainability and the development of the partner countries’ fisheries sector, particularly in these developing countries, and they are not simply a transfer of money in exchange for access to fishery resources. Here I would like to make three points. Firstly, the sustainable fisheries partnership agreements are a regulated and transparent tool which allows us to frame the activity of the EU fleet in partner-country waters in full observance of the principles of sustainability, good governance and fairness. They are now being recognised as such by most of the stakeholders, including many NGOs. Secondly, our bilateral fisheries agreements are true partnerships, and the sectoral support provided to the partner countries is tailored to the individual needs of each country. Sectoral support has, for example, been used to support artisanal fisheries, to reinforce partner countries’ monitoring, control and surveillance capacity and to improve the availability and quality of scientific data. Thirdly, as implementation can sometimes be challenging, as a result of the limited administrative capacities of some of our partner countries, the Commission monitors the implementation of sectoral support closely and also provides technical support and training. Some Members had reservations in relation to Guinea-Bissau, and the Commission takes note of the nomination of a new government in that country. We remain concerned about the political and institutional situation there and we encourage all political leaders and institutions to work together to overcome the existing divergences and to find a stable solution allowing a peaceful continuation of the reconstruction and reform process. For the time being, the situation has no direct consequences for the fisheries agreement between the European Union and Guinea-Bissau. Nevertheless, it is being followed closely in order to ensure that appropriate measures are taken if necessary and, as Ms Garcia mentioned, the common fisheries policy can only contribute to economic and political stability. I would like to conclude by confirming that these agreements are beneficial to the EU fishing sector and to the partner countries, and also in terms of promoting more sustainable fishing outside the EU and strengthening the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing through the introduction of better controls, monitoring, supervision, scientific research and evaluation.

Unfortunately, this is not different from what we see in other countries with which the European Union establishes fisheries agreements. The economic supremacy of the European Union should not be used to get the governments of these countries to give up their natural resources, but to contribute to improving the quality of life of peoples. We therefore insist on the need for these agreements to contribute to improving the living conditions of local people and supporting the development of artisanal fisheries and industry and related activities.

It is, of course, not for nothing that a series of measures to protect the shark stock have also been announced in this Protocol; The thresholds included in it are quite low, so we know that action is needed very quickly to better protect the sharks.

As far as this has happened here today, I believe that, and I have expectations, that the fisheries agreements with Guinea Bissau, Cape Verde and Madagascar will also be approved by the European Parliament. This is the way for me. However, I believe that the good management of living resources will have to go much further, as has been said by several colleagues. There is an urgent need to better manage European resources, fishing grounds, and sorry, including that all costs are exploited within sustainability levels. We need to reduce the pressures on habitats, we need to reduce the collateral damage of fisheries, but we must also ensure respect for human rights in the communities of the countries with which we have trade agreements, promoting them, and for the rights of workers working on our vessels. None of this should be an issue as the European legal framework already imposes it under the new Common Fisheries Policy and other European policies. Unfortunately, in the European Union there are still short-term political commitments and poor transparency of data, which undermines the sustainable benefit and security of future generations. Fishing within sustainable limits is an above all economic common sense issue. Support for the sustainable development of third countries with whom we have agreements is also good economic sense, common social sense, common sense in cooperation.

First of all, I would like to thank my fellow shadow rapporteurs and all the people involved in this midterm review for their cooperation.  We have had an extensive process with 633 amendments and it really has not been easy to come up with one coherent story with the shadow rapporteurs. But we did. I would also like to thank the staff of the various political groups, in particular the EPP Group and Parliament, for their cooperation. The first comments on the White Paper were somewhat reticent. Not many new policies and no sharp choices. But it is a midterm review and therefore intended to also highlight the continuity of policy. I think that worked out well. A European Union that would present a completely new transport policy every four years is not credible. It's a midterm review and it's about implementation and continuity.  The transport sector is very important for Europe. In the Netherlands we always say: without transport, everything stands still. The transport sector has a high earning capacity and is very important for the development of the European economy; there are hundreds, thousands of people working in this transport sector, and we must not forget that. At the same time, the transport sector needs to become more sustainable. 24% of pollution in Europe is caused by the transport sector, 29% by the energy sector. Well, then you'll understand what our position is. Sustainability is not only a threat, but also an opportunity for innovation and innovation in the transport sector, which we will have to use over the next 10 to 20 years.  Then there are a few parts of the midterm review report. Unfortunately, we have seen that the modal shift, the shift from road and air to railways and inland waterways, has so far failed. That in itself is a nasty observation, because we want more clean transport in inland waterways and on the train. In the coming years, the European Union's investments in the coming years will therefore have to give priority to railways and inland waterways, whether or not in combination with maritime transport. That is a conclusion that we all share. Then there are the intelligent transport systems. We want more innovation and we also want an electronic bill of lading by 2020; it is a great challenge for us to achieve this. There are a number of proposals, for example for doubling urban transport, which have caused a great deal of controversy, but my colleagues will talk about this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2625, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Violeta Bulc", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, let me first thank your rapporteur, Mr van de Camp, the shadow rapporteurs and indeed the European Parliament as a whole, for the really valuable cooperation in the implementation of the Transport White Paper. We have worked hard since last November with the Committee on Transport and Tourism (TRAN) on this report. The fact that there were over 600 amendments shows the high level of engagement by Members of Parliament on this topic and the report is of course very welcome and timely. The Commission is pleased with its general thrust and quality. Please allow me to comment on seven specific points in that report. First: the report emphasises the promotion of co-modality and effective use of all transport modes. We are fully supportive of this objective. This is why our policies aim at improving framework conditions, internalising external costs, completing missing infrastructure links, addressing interoperability issues at all levels, and establishing fair competition for all modes. Second: modern infrastructure. This is the area where the Commission has made substantial progress. The definition of TEN-T corridors and creation of the Connecting Europe Facility have been one of our main achievements in recent years. I am also convinced that transport projects can greatly benefit from EFSI, the European Fund for Strategic Investments. Third: transport sustainability. This is an area where the Commission will remain very active. I am thinking here about decarbonisation but also about actions against other environmental impacts – noise, air quality and similar. It is true that urban mobility is an area where more efforts are needed, but we have to be careful not to push solutions that are not tailored to the local specifications. Fourth: digital solutions. We agree that we need to improve travel information and provide integrated ticketing systems. However, I also share the view of many stakeholders that we cannot merely impose one solution at EU level; we should rather make the information available and let businesses come up with solutions matching customers’ needs. We will be there to develop standards and the necessary regulatory frameworks to allow value—added services to emerge. The report calls for a fifth element, which is placing people at the heart of transport policy. I could not agree more. I am personally convinced that transport should first and foremost serve the needs of society, the users, passengers and consumers of freight. This is something we will keep at the heart of all our initiatives. Sixth: social issues. The current situation is not satisfactory. The Juncker Commission attaches a lot of importance to addressing poor working conditions and skills mismatch, and avoiding social unfairness. Without a strong social agenda we will not be able to strengthen the transport internal market. I concur with the report in this respect. Seventh: more competitive and efficient transport. There are still too many barriers in Europe negatively affecting the functioning of the transport single market. We are working to gradually remove these barriers and to create a full single European transport area with high standards which can then be exported to third countries. This will enable Europe to keep its global leadership in transport.  Finally, the report underlines that one of the main weaknesses of our current policies is poor implementation.

The report provides many good indications for greater intermodal linking, for greater sustainability in the transport sector, for the upgrading of transnational transport links. In theory, all this reads very well. But, ladies and gentlemen, does the transport sector really have adequate political attention today? For many, the transport industry is obviously a milking cow in Europe. The European Union is also to regulate ever new ideas for charges, for levies, ever stricter environmental objectives, even urban transport. But this applies not only to regulation, but also to finances. Where would we stand today if oil taxes, car taxes, environmental levies in the nation states had actually been returned to investments in infrastructure and environmental protection and not misused into social systems? Transport is also a stepchild of funding in the European Commission. I am sorry to have to say that. But why did the EU Commission take the money from the extremely important Connecting Europe Facility to finance the guarantees for the EFSI? Transport is obviously also a stepchild in the Presidency of the Council. We have acute problems of border security, we have a dramatic underfunding of transnational infrastructures. And, you know, the next informal council meeting of transport ministers on 8 October is under the heading – with all these problems: 'the bicycle as a means of transport'.

The creation of a single European transport area is a task that can only be met with a precise action plan setting out the necessary objectives and stages to be achieved. The 2011 Transport White Paper aims to act as such a plan. Although only four years have passed since the adoption of this strategy, it is already clear that the achievement of the objectives will be delayed. This is particularly significant in the area of achieving overly ambitious and often detached from the economic realities of the assumptions on the move away from fossil fuels in transport. In order to avoid similar failures in other areas, we must take the opportunity to review the White Paper and clearly identify those problems that require increased efforts in such a way that European integration in the transport sector takes shape. Firstly, it is important to emphasise the particular importance of the projects that make up the trans-European transport network for the construction of a coherent Union transport network. The TEN-T project is crucial for deepening European integration in the field of transport, including increasing the transport accessibility of peripheral areas of the European Union. The construction of the TEN-T network should be a top priority of our transport policy in the coming years. Secondly, the White Paper as it stands does not sufficiently address public transport and urban mobility, as well as the involvement of modern forms of travel based on the principles of the sharing economy. I believe that such an important and strategic document, such as the White Paper, must not overlook such important topics. Thirdly and finally, the future of transport in the Union is also the future of workers and employers in this sector. It is worrying that some Member States are trying to protect their own businesses at the expense of the fundamental economic freedoms of the Union by camouflage such practices with social issues. This should not be the case, and I am pleased that the van de Camp report emphasises the importance of a balance between the free market and the protection of workers' rights. I believe that the European Commission will listen to this voice and take into account these and many other observations in this report when updating the objectives of the White Paper and their implementation in the years to come.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2628, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Claudia Tapardel", "mepid": "124793", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D group – Mr President, urbanisation, globalisation and demographic change in our society leads us to rethink the way the transport system works and to look at the measures proposed four years ago in the White Paper on transport. We have negotiated an ambitious agenda that will generate structural change in this system and create a genuine single European transport area. This space will have to accommodate an increasing demand for mobility and meet the needs of passengers, goods and services in the 21st century. For this reason, we brought back and put passengers at the centre of the discussion. I believe that we need to increase the quality of work in all transport sectors by setting minimum standards in the first place. In the labour market, we must use the opportunity to apply the principle of equal opportunities and make this area much more attractive to women. A transport system of the future cannot be anything other than barriers of any kind and with the use of all modes of transport in a sustainable way. That means we need both physical and digital infrastructures. All our efforts must be focused on the interconnection of border areas and peripheral regions with other regions of the Union, so that passengers, goods and services move freely and efficiently. Infrastructure investments in these areas are considered investments with a significant impact on territorial cohesion and the elimination of infrastructure development disparities between Eastern and Western Europe.  The increased urbanisation brings into question the need to improve and increase the capacity of public transport. Urban centres are at the same time the spaces where we face the negative effects of transport on a daily basis, either in the form of carbon emissions or air quality or traffic congestion. Integrated mobility services and real-time information will bring us closer to the objective of transitioning to sustainable modes of transport.

Transport is the backbone of the internal market. If we think about ordering something on the Internet, we want 24-hour delivery – without transport it is not possible at all! We go shopping, want fresh goods every day, even this is not possible without transport! Waste collection is not possible without mobility, and in general mobility is one of the fundamental rights for the people of Europe, and for that too we need all means of transport. And that's why we had this metro plan as a big throw in the last period. A metro plan that connects all the cities and major centres of Europe. This TEN-T story that we have here looks great, that is precisely the European idea that we need, that people can come together, trade, if possible without borders and without traffic jams and without any other obstacles.  A very noble goal that needs money. That is why we have put more money into the budget – all quite right. And in order to have this mobility, we need all means of transport for people and for the transport of goods. We need both the railways and the road by lorry, we need the railways, we need the ships. We also need bicycles in part. Everything is necessary, and that should then meet certain criteria. It should be as clean as possible, it should be as safe as possible, it should be as accessible as possible for all people, no matter where they live and whether they have disabilities or not, and it should be as fair as possible. As fair as possible in terms of competitive conditions, but also, for example, in terms of good conditions for the profession and also in relation to passenger rights. So it's a whole bunch of what we're looking at. We now have this midterm review.  There is still a great deal to improve, and in terms of improvement we must always see that we look at all areas in a balanced way, both for users and for providers, and that we are doing this at European level.

I am still wondering whether the customer's voice is sufficiently displayed in our conference halls and tables, which decide on a transport policy that affects the mobility of all Europeans. Sometimes it seems that transport policy is only intended to safeguard the very traditional position of operators in the sector, rather than to take new measures to ensure transport services that work, are easier and even cheaper for users. It seems funny that we sometimes completely forget that the customer is number one, we even forget to invite the industrial customer of the business community to hear about the real needs of transport. We must remember that in transport infrastructure is only a small part and, in fact, much more is happening on top of that infrastructure. We need smart solutions and resource efficiency throughout the transport system. It is sad that, even in the 2010s, it will be easier for us to build a road and tunnel through huge walls than to jointly create a regulatory environment that enables interoperable user-friendly services.

First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur and my colleague Wim van de Camp for their good cooperation. We had said beforehand that we do not want a document that is grey and that is actually a compromise, but therefore does not say anything. We want a compromise, which at the same time makes some clear points. And I think we have succeeded together and we should certainly thank Mr Van de Camp for that.

However, I do think that there are a number of points in it which are extremely important and it is also good to hear from the Commission and the Commissioner that the report is being embraced. However, there are some very clear points that need to be improved. Because if we look at the current state of transport - as Mr Van De Camp said - we are actually quite behind with that modal shift, the transition to the use of inland waterways and rail. That's not going well. And if you're going to look at reducing environmental pollution from the transport sector. That's not going well either. It is still unclear how Europe will work towards it in the longer term after 2020. There are still challenges here where we expect more from the Commission.  Also with regard to social policy, it is very important that this has been added. We all know that opening up that service market also has a social side. There is also more attention to this and the Commission is clearly invited to come forward with proposals. They have already been announced, but they are still lacking in concreteity.

There are very positive elements contained in the report that we will vote on tomorrow, such as the internalisation of external costs, avoiding double taxation; the promotion of alternative fuels; the need to take action in relation to shared transport platforms; the desirability that carriers can enjoy the weekly rest at their source; the specific nature of the outermost regions, and the important role of regional airports. Mr Wim van de Camp, the rapporteur has done a magnificent job and tomorrow will be reflected in our vote, which will certainly be positive. Just a discrepancy, which is inevitable.

This has indeed been a very constructive and sometimes emotional debate for weeks, and we can conclude it well today. I would like to mention once again – almost four years after the White Paper that we have adopted here – that we are now on the right track with regard to the objectives that we set ourselves at the time, which were and are admittedly ambitious, but we have not yet achieved them. For example, as far as the shift from road to rail is concerned, we have not achieved this overarching objective of shifting transports over 300 kilometres to rail. We are moving here at a relatively low level. For example, between 2008 and 2011, we had an average share of goods transported by road of 76.1%, and in the period 2011-2013 it was 74.9%. This shows that, although the direction is right, it is still under-represented. We must continue to make an effort in this respect. What we need to do in the social field – I would also ask the Commission to reach out to the European Parliament and demand this in the next legislation. As far as social and safety regulations are concerned, we have repeatedly put our finger in the wound and tried to work to improve this – whether that is the various transport sectors, such as bogus self-employment or air transport pay to fly, or a systematic undermining of driving and rest periods.

Firstly, the excessive concentration on further social legislation in the fields of aviation and road haulage: this would, in our view, close down the markets and is blatantly protectionist. Secondly, the unnecessary creation of a new European road safety transport agency: we do not believe that would add value. Next, the push to move forward with the Ports Directive which, as it stands, would in our view be damaging to the interests of a very successful British ports industry. Finally, I come to the reference to Gibraltar. I see that the good colleague of mine who originally put down the amendments two years ago has left. This is about a British sovereign territory which is a full member of the single market. I must say that, while Spain continues to challenge this sovereign state, there will be no movement on either the implementation – regrettably – of Single Sky or the Passenger Rights Regulation that Mr Bach has worked on.

Of course, it is not a panacea for all the ills in the transport sector, but I nevertheless believe that its recommendations provide a very good basis for the preparation of specific legislation. However, I would like to draw attention to the term 'social dumping' which has been used very often recently in committee meetings and in Parliament. We will all agree that those who provide transport services should be guaranteed adequate working conditions, including adequate remuneration, and that action should therefore be encouraged to ensure fair competition in transport.

In building trans-European transport networks, account must be taken of the ever-prevailing infrastructure differences between different regions, old and new Member States, and a fundamental improvement in cross-border connections.

The report reflects various areas of transport and emphasises its particular importance in job creation and connecting the outermost regions. Most importantly, consumers of those transport services must be at the centre of all our discussions, namely the travelling passengers and the businesses that depend on our transport infrastructure. We need to keep that to the fore in all our discussions. On the whole area of aviation, I look forward to the Commission’s package at the end of this year. It is extremely important that we recognise that our carriers are now competing on a global scale, and that needs to be addressed. The world is getting smaller, our businesses and our passengers want to travel to areas outside Europe: to Asia, the US, Australia. Our carriers need to be able to compete and we need to open dialogue, particularly with the Gulf States, that is very important.

The political and economic landscape has, of course, evolved since 2011, but the ongoing exercise shows that the main provisions of the White Paper remain relevant and are worth implementing. I understand that Parliament is in agreement with this approach. Finally, I would like to thank once again Mr van de Camp and Parliament for having decided to take this initiative.

As the Commissioner has already said, we must move towards a new balance of fewer rules, more sustainability, more earning capacity, but we must not forget the social aspect either.

The aim of the interim revaluation is not to reduce the ambitious targets that we set in 2011, but to strengthen the ambition to achieve them. I agree with the reporter that it is very important not only to talk about transport as such, but also about sustainable mobility, within which we can reduce Europe's dependence on oil, grow the economy, protect our environment, create new jobs, reduce traffic jams in our cities. This will create a more livable and fun environment around us. However, this requires better use of rail and waterborne transport, while at the same time the transport of freight traffic by lorries is not negligible.

We must ensure that the liberal professions can take advantage of the same opportunities as small and medium-sized enterprises, such as access to direct calls from the European Union and indirect calls from the regions. The role of the professional funds must also be assessed in order to guarantee funding to members.  A high-level group that I had created in my role as European Commissioner for Industry, drew up a series of recommendations in 2014 to support the development of the liberal professions in Europe, not only through better access to credit, but also through more training, with more information and with a focus on internationalisation. The time has now come to implement these recommendations, and the aim of the oral question I have drawn up with colleagues from various political groups is precisely to ask the new European Commission how it intends to follow up its commitments.  We expect a strong commitment from Commissioner Bieńkowska.

That is why it is particularly important to have a high level of qualification in this area, and it is important to ensure that there are also clear rules that also give them certainty about the quality of their professions. Like my colleague Mr Tajani, I agree that we do not need excessive bureaucracy, but we need, as it were, assurance that a high quality of services in these areas can be guaranteed. That is exactly what we need.  As part of the implementation of the Professional Qualifications Directive, you are also currently undergoing an evaluation process.

Lawyers, architects, engineers create their businesses as independent enterprises. They invest in their own assets and professional know—how, they bear the business risks and reach out for economic success. They are, of course, entrepreneurs creating jobs and providing high-quality products and services.  For this very reason, the Commission decided to make a very special commitment to the promotion of liberal professions in its Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan. In this context, a working group ‘Bolstering the Business of the Liberal Professions’ was set up to assess their specific needs as entrepreneurs and businesspeople, such as acquiring know—how and skills, access to markets or access to finance. This is almost the same as for the others, but we are very much focusing on those professions. This autonomous working group submitted a series of recommendations which are included in a report that will be finalised around the end of the year and which is built around five thematic blocks.  The first block is entrepreneurship, education and training, because liberal professionals need to acquire managerial and entrepreneurial skills. I would like in this place to highlight that liberal professionals can already benefit from the exchange programme Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs. The second block highlights the importance of facilitating access to finance, and from this perspective it also has to be stressed that they are offered money from programmes like COSME and Horizon 2020, and the use of the advisory services of the Enterprise Europe Network. The third block analyses access to markets. The fourth block invites representatives of the liberal professions to contribute to the reduction of their regulatory burden, which Members mentioned a few times, by identifying bottlenecks and best practices across the EU.  Finally, the working group expressed its wish to strengthen the representation and participation of the liberal professions at European level. Therefore, I decided that the liberal professions will be represented and invited to participate at in the 2015 SME Assembly which will take place in Luxembourg in November this year. This should enable liberal professions to be more directly informed about all the policies put in place. As far as the regulated professions are concerned, it should be said that the Commission is currently carrying out a transparency and mutual evaluation exercise in each Member State as a follow-up to the Professional Qualifications Directive. This is also, it has to be stressed, an exercise in very good cooperation with national authorities, and has already made it possible to identify more than 5 000 regulated professions in all sectors of activities and in all Member States.  This is particularly helpful since we know that a large majority of the liberal professions are regulated ones. The regulation of professions limits access to professions and may reduce employment opportunities. In this context, I want also to mentioned that the Commission will adopt – it is planning, but will adopt in a month, on 21 October – the Internal Market Strategy, and the key element of the strategy will be to address remaining barriers to services, and to further advance the integration of the single market in services, thus facilitating the economic activities of liberal professions.  I would be very pleased to discuss this further with Members once the Internal Market Strategy is adopted, because it is a very comprehensive document with some new points added by us.

Mr Tajani has made it very clear and clear how important we, as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, attach to the liberal professions in all their variations, and that is why I am also concerned that certain rules of a consumer protection nature are now being addressed in individual infringement proceedings against different Member States. However, I agree with you that we must, of course, increase mobility in the European internal market and, in this respect, these infringement procedures also provide clarity as to whether or not these measures are admissible, and so I await with interest the decision of the European Court of Justice in these proceedings. However, Commissioner, our main interest is, of course, in ensuring that the liberal professions, by their very nature and in view of their self-government, can retain their position in a European internal market. And here you, as the Commissioner responsible for the classic part of the internal market – unlike the Digital Single Market – are, of course, the Commissioner who must also speak out in defence of the liberal professions.

But for us it is clear: free professions usually have academic training and a high level of quality of qualification.

They provide comprehensive services for all citizens in all regions at performance-based prices.

It is precisely on this last point that I would like to point out to you that, on closer inspection of what is happening within the Union – including in my own country, for example – the entrepreneurial nature of the form in which the liberal professions often associate, is not basically recognised, is formally, but not entirely substantially so.

Unfortunately, in general, the strong corporate lobby in individual professions has a huge and effective impact on politicians in individual Member States, with the result that there is little deregulation in Europe. Yeah, I'm even watching the opposite. Excessive regulation, on the other hand, has many harmful effects – for example, they restrict access to the professions of new apprentices, which has an impact on the level of unemployment among people with education in a given profession. They also significantly increase the costs of obtaining and subsequently practising a given profession. More addition, they increase the prices of the services provided, since they restrict competition on the market of the profession concerned.

The liberal professions will, of course, be included in our internal market strategy, with a very strong focus on modernisation, the law and regulations. We will also try to prioritise infringement cases, as mentioned by Mr Schwab. So the internal market strategy will, and should, include a number of potential actions to address barriers – mentioned by many of you – such as disproportionate professional qualification requirements or the extensive scope of reserved activities for regulated professions. The next subject is that of mutual evaluation, which, it should be stressed, covers all sectors of activity – not just the regulated professions. The objective of mutual evaluation is to assess restrictions related to qualification requirements and to remove unjustified and disproportionate barriers.

The technical infrastructure – which was the subject of the question on EPC – and the other mechanisms in the internal market information system will be completed before January 2016, i.e. in the next few months. This was Ms Le Grip’s question. The action which will follow the mutual evaluation exercise will be announced as part of the internal market strategy. I do not want to go into detail on it here because I think we will have a lot of opportunities to discuss it at the orientation stage, after the orientation debate in the College and after adoption of the internal market strategy. I think I have responded briefly to all the questions. To sum up, I would add that there will certainly be a focus on the liberal professions in the internal market strategy.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to present, for the last time before the vote, my report on the obstacles faced by women who aspire to rise to the highest levels in the fields of research, technology, science and women who want to join boards and who seek positions of responsibility. I would like to share some thoughts with you on the subject, hoping for your support tomorrow in the vote on this important and ambitious report.  The obstacles we have been talking about have been known, for thirty years, as 'glass ceilings'. These are obstacles to the fight for equal opportunities, barriers to fair treatment that women with qualifications, competences and competences deserve when they seek, with ambition but also with honesty, to achieve the highest possible goals.  To begin with, I would like to talk about how these obstacles are born. These 'glass ceilings', these discriminations against women are due, on the one hand, to the prejudices that still exist in our society, despite the fact that we are in 2015 and we live in Europe, in an extremely ambitious society that should not normally discriminate against half the population of the continent and, on the other hand, to the family obligations that de facto take time out of the everyday life of all women. , even those who have the skills and ambitions to achieve other objectives. The result is, in fact, the under-representation of women in the science and technology sectors as well as on business boards. These are leadership positions which some women are entitled to pursue, provided, of course, that they themselves are in the necessary competitive mood and, on the other hand, that the environment leaves competition unhindered to develop. Considering some of the obstacles to women's professional development, I have classified them into some important categories. Motherhood, privilege and gift of a woman by nature, becomes an obstacle when she absorbs time that could in other circumstances be devoted to the realization of a woman's ambitions. This is an obstacle that stems to some extent from stereotypical perceptions of how much time a woman should devote to motherhood and how much time she can devote to pursuing her goals. Another category of obstacles stems from the completely anachronistic separation between women's and men's professions, at a time when so many castles have been \"dropped\" by women and indeed with extremely important results and achievements for science and technology. A third category is due to the gender pay gap, a problem which in many cases requires recourse to the courts to restore equality and equal access for women to specific positions in research programmes. Our report refers to motherhood, infrastructure, programmes and funding, citing above all the principles and values of the European Commission and the Member States, which should govern the efforts made by the European Research Institute and within Horizon 2020.  Ladies and gentlemen, I will end by referring to the two main parameters that can change the current situation, in family and in education. The nurturing of children and the education of adolescents and young people have the power to shape those mentalities that we need to finally recognise that half the world's population deserves exactly the same opportunities as the other half, that human beings, men and women, are equal to each other.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2673, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Therese Comodini Cachia (PPE).", "mepid": "124968", "text": "   – Sur President.

However, I recognise that this balance is not yet widespread in the institutions and that there are specific difficulties of the female gender, in particular those related to motherhood, which are not yet properly framed.

This discrimination is a violation of basic human rights and must therefore be combated. In particular, the Commission should, through educational programmes and campaigns, break down all stereotypes that exist against women and encourage women to head to the scientific and academic workplace.

These are real changes in mentality that must be encouraged in families, in parents, among young girls, themselves, who are too often afraid of these technical and technological worlds.

If we go beyond the mere concept of the gender gap in the discussion and ask about the background, we end up with families. Mothers with children are also disadvantaged in universities and in science. Children are a clear career risk, and parenting times are considered gaps in the CURRICULUM vitae. This must change, including for us here in Europe. Educational time is gainful employment and must be paid with a salary. We must finally enforce this, not to the detriment of governments, but these costs, like pensions, are borne by the general public.

In this case, the situation is even more cruel because the number of women who successfully start in these areas is very large – in some areas it is greater than that of men – but the invisible glass ceiling prevents them from progressing. We face another scenario of European challenge for real equality, without which there will never be social justice.  Our amendments, accepted by the rapporteur and the committee, have only wanted to stress that, in order to avoid such discrimination, we must take above all educational measures involving men in tasks considered 'female', and especially in the education of children, which are the ones that end – as has been said – to prevent women from continuing their professional development.  If a woman takes full responsibility for family life, it is absolutely impossible for that glass ceiling to disappear due to more fees or measures we take.

The draft report on women’s careers in science and university and the glass ceilings encountered is a very welcome move. It reflects well the current state of play and proposes concrete ideas to move forward. Let me share with you a few thoughts on it.  First: institutional changes. As was rightly mentioned in the report, these are very much needed to remove institutional barriers and bias. In science, men and women may have the same qualifications, but they often do not have the same chances to succeed because of persisting discrimination and stereotypes concerning the role and capacities of women. There are still practices and attitudes that produce inequalities.  Institutional changes can help on the way towards assuring that research institutions guarantee equal opportunities for both women and men at all levels. To this end, in the European Research Area, research institutions are encouraged to adopt fully—fledged gender equality plans which include a detailed account of the state of play on gender equality within the organisation, measures to address existing bias, setting targets and monitoring of progress.  With institutional changes we have moved on from women-focused programmes, which are useful initiatives but are not necessarily sustainable in the long run. Institutional changes in research organisations are today the cornerstone of the Commission’s strategy on gender equality in research. In Horizon 2020, our framework programme for research and innovation, these institutional changes are clearly pursued, but we need to do more and we need to do better. We need all Member States to engage in the same line in the context of the European Research Area. I am glad that the European Parliament is on board as its help and its role is crucial.  Second: the importance of enforcing the existing regulatory framework on gender equality. This is stated at the outset of the report, and the Commission fully agrees. It is not enough to have laws; we need effective implementation and enforcement. The Commission monitors the correct application by Member States of existing EU legislation on gender equality.  In research, we also need to address the specificities of the sector with concrete actions, both at the EU and national level. In May 2015, the Council adopted the European Research Area roadmap and called on the Member States and the Commission to implement top action priorities through action plans and strategies. Translating national equality legislation into effective action is one key priority. The roadmap also states that gaps in cross-cutting gender equality legislation at EU and national levels should be addressed. We know that national laws, strategies and incentives have a positive impact in triggering actions by research institutions. This is important, as research institutions are the ones ultimately responsible for implementing institutional changes through gender equality plans.  The Council asked for appropriate indicators to monitor the progress made at national and EU level, as does the European Parliament in its report. Again, the Commission fully agrees. The ‘She Figures 2015’ leaflet was published last July, and a full report will be published in January 2016. In this endeavour, the Commission would like to underline the need for a full collaboration from the Member States in order to produce robust indicators. Third: gender balance in decision making in research bodies and institutions. Participation of women in decision making is just as important. Women are still under-represented in decision making and the phenomenon is not self-correcting. In response to this, we see that many European states are choosing to set targets or quotas. In 2013, 18 states did so, compared to just 8 in 2008. There is a need to clearly call for improvement on the gender balance in decision making.  Before concluding, I would like to mention three important initiatives on gender equality. The first is on work-life balance. The Commission has just published, in early August, a roadmap in preparation of a broad initiative to improve work-life balance and a decision for 2016. The Commission will consider a mix of legislative and non-legislative instruments including a modern solution to the needs of today’s families. We will now start the consultation process. The European Parliament, the Member States and the social partners will have a very important role to play in this process. The second is the 2012 Commission proposal for improving gender balance on boards of listed companies. The proposal is currently supported by a majority of Member States, and once adopted by the Parliament and the Council it will pave the way for further progress on gender equality.  Thirdly, we also share Members’ concerns on the gender pay gap, which at EU level persists at 16.4%. Last year, the Commission adopted a recommendation on pay transparency aiming to assist Member States and other stakeholders in a more effective application of existing equal pay legislation. It provides a toolkit of concrete measures to tackle pay inequality and the gender pay gap.  We look forward to receiving, by the end of this year, Member States’ notifications on the national measures taken in accordance with the recommendation. We will then assess the need for possible further measures. In conclusion, both women and men are needed if Europe is to achieve its ambitions in R&amp;I for the benefit of the whole of society. The Commission will continue to do its part, but to achieve gender equality the commitment of the European Parliament in terms of the policy and financial engagement of the Member States remains essential. The Commission will take good note of all the recommendations made in the report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2681, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Przewodniczący. –", "mepid": "28372", "text": "   I close the discussion on this point.

There have been positive developments in these areas in recent years, but gender equality remains a sensitive issue in the European Union. According to the 2012 She Figures publication, women account for only 10% of all rectors, and although for several consecutive years in science, the growing proportion of women has seen a promising change - the number of female researchers remains significantly lower than that of the opposite sex. Women's contribution to society must be treated and respected in the same way. Gender equality is an aspiration, while making full use of human rights by women and girls. Only in this way can we empower them and strengthen their position in the male-dominated labour market and society. Networking support networks and sharing best practices would inspire women to strive for their careers and prevent a society run by stereotypes from limiting women's access to careers in science and academy. Parliament encourages the Commission to build on existing programmes and initiatives and to develop positive campaigns, with a particular focus on the engineering and technology sector, where, despite recent results, women's participation is below average.

It was a key contribution to achieving the document we have at hand today. In fact, that's how we reached compromises and that was our best win, putting what really matters at the heart of the discussion, namely girls and young women.  I sincerely believe that education is the best way to ensure that in the future everyone has the same rights in all areas of society and life in the future. Some will argue that we are better off than we were a dozen years ago and that time will take place to balance the rights of women and men. True, we are better, but things have progressed slowly, even here, in the European institutions. However, millions of women feel, more or less implicitly, this discrimination every day. What is intended with this report is to develop a critical spirit in women and men and this is essential for the elimination of stereotypes and prejudices. This critical and autonomous thinking has to be worked on since childhood. Young people, women and educated men can change the power structure of a society, so we should not fear this change.  This report was framed in the International Women's Day, which took education as a priority and as an instrument of emancipation, as an instrument of power. Educational institutions are also those in a better position to ensure democratic education, education for gender equality, education for freedom. However, school cultures that do not meet gender equality are still maintained as the first value of democratic Europe. Research and education showed us this in all lines of curriculum studies. That is why I am most concerned that young women and girls are still discriminated against in a Europe that is said to be civilized and a lady of fundamental values that we have inherited from an unfulfilled revolution: freedom, equality and fraternity.  That is why I set two general objectives at the beginning of this work, the first being to ensure equal empowerment of girls by education, the second to comply with the Istanbul Convention when it sees education as a tool for preventing gender discrimination.  This has been five specific objectives: to create a school culture of gender equality, to critically supervise curricula and teaching materials, to ensure gender equality with regard to personal and professional decision-making, to improve the percentage of women in positions of responsibility and in senior positions and in scientific careers, as mentioned above in the previous debate , promoting equality in terms of economic independence. I think that we will all agree here on these objectives, despite our ideological differences. We must aspire to more than mere tolerance. We reject in this report the idea of tolerated and dominant tolerant dominas. We want to make Europe the place where nothing of what is different becomes strange, we want to make sure that girls are in par with boys. Without them, the idea of equality will not be possible. Even if this is a report on the empowerment of girls, it is clear to all of us, without boys and men, in this project, little or nothing will be worth it.  This report is one of all of us who understand the urgency of protecting girls and young women from a world that still kills because we are women. I am counting on the support tomorrow for this report to be voted on in favour. What is intended with this report is to protect our girls who will soon be women.

It would be more important to have a mother of seven, a single parent or an unemployed father who will tell the children how they are living their lives and what family means.

This report underlines that education policies and practices are crucial in order to sensitise young people to gender equality and to combat gender stereotypes, sexism and gender-based violence from an early stage. For all these reasons, the Commission is pleased to see Parliament’s report in line with its work in this field. There are important achievements. There is now much greater awareness of gender equality as an educational issue. Women have greatly increased their participation in tertiary education; almost 60% of university graduates in the EU are women. In addition, women’s participation in previously male-dominated study subjects is now significantly higher.  Yet despite important progress in recent years gender inequalities still persist in European education systems. For example, while women are more likely to have a higher education degree, they are still under-represented in science, mathematics and engineering studies and careers in research. Women are not making labour market gains commensurate with their educational achievements. While there are many more women graduates, men still have a higher employment rate than women among recent graduates, leading to a 4% gap at EU level.  There are also strong gender imbalances in the teaching profession. Women are being under-represented in management positions, including in higher education, and men under-represented in the teaching force. Right now schools, universities and teachers are rarely assessed in terms of their gender equality policies and practices. The gender equality dimension is mainstreamed into the strategic framework for European cooperation with Member States in the field of education and training.  Last March, the education ministers met in Paris, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in France and Denmark, and adopted the Paris Declaration on promoting citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination through education. Gender equality was clearly and obviously identified as one of our core EU values that education ministers committed to strengthen and promote.  The gender equality dimension is also mainstreamed into Erasmus+, our current funding programme, which offers substantial opportunities for gender-related work. The Commission shares the view that gender equality must go beyond the level of political intentions and become a reality.  The Commission also welcomes the strong emphasis on teachers. The attitudes of teachers and teacher educators are crucial in facilitating change. The Commission will continue to promote gender equality through its policies and programmes. This is reflected in the new priorities proposed for cooperation with the Member States in the context of the ET 2020 strategy framework.  Faster progress is possible. We need to move from the identification of challenges to solutions. We need active policy intervention that is sufficiently resourced, guided by evidence, with concrete and measurable targets and with tools to monitor progress. The Commission is looking forward to seeing the impact of this report and of the resolution on policy debates and on policy action around Europe.

We find it essential to initiate national and supranational debates. The issues of integration and gender equality concern the whole European Union, especially given that it has around 12 million Roma and that they are the largest but poorest and least joined minority. The discussions to include addressing the problems of gender inequality in children and young people from minority backgrounds, in whose societies it manifests itself more often and to a greater extent.  We believe that education is the most important strategic priority for the integration and dignified life of minority groups and we focus on issues of access to education, early inclusion in the education system and the skillful leadership of children's society to achieve integration and prevention against gender inequality attitudes.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2695, "date": "2015-09-08.json", "name": "Fernando Maura Barandiarán (ALDE)", "mepid": "125039", "text": "  in writing. – Education is a fundamental tool for giving power to women, improving their economic and social status and promoting change towards a more egalitarian society. Factors such as poverty, social norms or gender stereotypes negatively influence the educational outcomes of women and girls, and contribute to the segregation of the labour market.  On the other hand, teachers' attitudes, classroom environments, or learning approaches can reproduce gender stereotypes that unconsciously influence students' personal development and educational choices. It is therefore necessary that we carry out studies and campaigns to raise awareness and training of teachers on the influence of these stereotypes, so that we can better identify and combat inequalities.  Similarly, we must stress the need to introduce sex education and health issues into schools where special emphasis is placed on equality and respect. In addition, it is important that we facilitate the continuous training of women so that they can grow professionally and avoid their stagnation or the abandonment of the labour market. To achieve this goal, it is essential to promote measures that facilitate work and family reconciliation where men and women cooperate and share the responsibilities of working and private life.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}]
