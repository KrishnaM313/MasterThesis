Hopefully there are a few more MEPs around because the topic is so important, boosting investments and by doing so strengthening job creation in Europe. I will not go to the root causes as to why we are lacking investments. Everybody knows many of the reasons, but I would just like to raise some points on what we have already done in order to promote investments and strengthen job creation in Europe. As everybody remembers, in the investment plan for Europe we had three different parts which are mutually reinforcing. The most important part of the plan is the removal of barriers to investments. There we have national barriers but also European-wide barriers. The Commission has paid more attention than before to investment barriers at national levels. For instance, in annual growth surveys and when analysing Member States’ economies, we have identified national barriers for investments and some of those findings ended up in the country-specific recommendations.  So we are encouraging Member States to carry out structural reforms which will boost an investment environment at national and local level. At the same time, we are putting more focus and emphasis on deepening and widening the internal market. The internal market and the whole third pillar of the investment plan, in my mind, is the most influential part in terms of job creation. We have some major projects like the Digital Single Market, the Energy Union, and the Capital Market Union but one should add to this list also the circular economy package which the Commission proposed last year and also decarbonisation of transport. They will all reshape the internal market in Europe. Just to give you some ideas of what we have already done in terms of creating a better investment environment, we are lowering capital charges for insurance companies investing in long-term infrastructure. We are also making it more possible to find venture capital in Europe for small and medium-sized enterprises by launching a new venture capital fund of funds later this year.  We are giving guidance on what constitutes state aid. We are making it easier for service providers to expand to the other Member States and creating a digital single market. So lots of things are happening on this front and I hope Parliament will support these projects. The faster we can deliver on the internal market side, the faster we can get a better business environment and a better investment environment.  A second pillar of the investment plan consists of two major initiatives. The first one is an investment advisory hub which is providing technical assistance and advice to private investors, but also to public entities. This is functioning quite well. We already have more than 100 requests, mostly from private companies. They are asking for advice and technical assistance to improve the quality of the projects. For instance, some of the investors are asking for technical assistance on how to benefit from various EU funds.  So this is a very elementary and important part of the investment plan because it makes it easier for Member States to use the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) but also the other funds and also to create investment platforms collecting together smaller investments, and by doing so it is easier to get financing for smaller projects. The newest creation under the second pillar is the European Investment Project Portal. The idea came from the UK. I visited London and the financiers, for instance investment banks, said that they are able and willing to invest more in European infrastructure but it is sometimes very difficult to find good projects from different countries. Their idea was to create a transparent open portal to which both public and private project promoters could send their projects, and the promoters could get better visibility for their projects.  So it is some sort of dating service for project promoters and financiers, and it is up and running now. We disclosed it at the beginning of June and I am quite excited to see how well it functions. We have designed the portal together with the private sector in order to make it as pragmatic and practical as possible. So over time there should be thousands of investment projects, and hopefully it functions as we have planned.  Finally, the first pillar of the EFSI plan is also up and running. So far we have used EFSI to the tune of EUR 12.8 billion for the infrastructure and innovation window but also for SME financing. This EUR 12.8 billion is expected to trigger mostly private investment, or public-private partnership investments worth EUR 100 billion. Of this, 80%, in other words, EUR 80 billion out of EUR 100 billion, comes from the private sector, so EFSI seems to function as planned. It provides risk financing mostly to private investors and by doing so it crowds in private money, which is currently peacefully resting in bank accounts.  So there seems to be a lack of risk financing in Europe. There is plenty of liquidity everywhere, this is not a problem at the moment, but because we have changed banking regulations this is one of the reasons the banks cannot take as much risk as they did a few years ago. That is why EFSI is providing something which is lacking, at least to a large extent, in the market. We have around 65 projects, I mean infrastructure or industrial investment projects, which have got financing from EFSI. In addition to this, and I would say more importantly, we have 185 agreements between the European Investment Fund (EIF) and intermediary banks, between the fund and private banks, on SME financing. These 185 agreements between the EIF, which has support from EFSI, and banks, will provide financing to approximately 150 000 European SMEs. In Italy alone we have 28 banks which have made an agreement with the EIF, and 44 000 Italian SMEs will get financing because of these agreements. This is sometimes the fastest way to stimulate the economy. There seems to be a lack of SME financing, especially equity financing, everywhere in Europe, even in the most developed markets. That is why I think in the future we have to pay special attention to this SME window, especially in equity financing, because this is something which the market does not offer that much at the moment.  Of course, we are developing the Capital Market Union in order to improve the capital market environment in Europe, but it will always take some time and meanwhile we have to address the market gap by providing EFSI financing. The UK has been very active on this issue. The UK is a country which is familiar with financial instruments and that is why British banks have been actively contacting the EIF and providing more financing to British businesses. The Commission will present a new proposal to prolong EFSI later this year. We have to analyse EFSI, its achievements and possible weaknesses, and once we have done the analysis we will make a new proposal, which will continue EFSI beyond the expiry date which we have at the moment.  The main issue in this is to focus on addressing market failure. The main issue is not to make it larger. The main thing is to focus EFSI financing on the areas where market does not function properly. Also one thing on which we have to be very careful is to provide financing for new innovations which will strengthen the sustainable development of our economies in social terms, in environmental terms, and for instance provide financing to the investments which will promote the circular economy. We are also going to propose some kind of external investment plan. EFSI has functioned very well in Europe, but we could use the same model also for external financing, especially when trying to achieve development goals. So the Commission is looking at the opportunities, how we could use existing development resources in a more efficient way by establishing a new fund which could function in a similar way as the EFSI functions but in third countries. The aim is to address the root causes of migration. Having said this I do not want to oversell the idea; we cannot address the root causes for migration overnight, or very fast, but anyway we could use our development resources more efficiently and by establishing a new external investment fund we could encourage private investment in third countries and by doing so strengthen economic structures and address the root causes of migration. This idea is at the initial stage but we will come with a proposal hopefully later this year. Honourable Members, I will stop here and I am very interested to hear your views, how you have seen the investment plan as a whole and maybe the final word here is that we need to cooperate very closely, because MEPs are representing the European people. You are representing our regions, and the more you are raising awareness amongst investors about the opportunities that EFSI can offer, the better. Even though we are working very hard every single day advertising EFSI opportunities, we are never as efficient as you are if you are meeting local investors, local entrepreneurs and bankers explaining how EFSI can help the situation in the regions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-06-08.json", "name": "Othmar Karas", "mepid": "4246", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has We have structural problems, we have high deficits, too little investment, too little innovation, too little growth and employment. The European Fund for Strategic Investments, the so-called Juncker Fund, is one of our responses. And today we can say: the start has been successful! 249 projects in 26 Member States with an investment volume of EUR 100 billion were initiated. In 185 agreements, mainly in cooperation with the national promotional banks, 140 000 European SMEs were provided with financing. I therefore also welcome the fact that the SME window is to be enlarged. But we are far from the finish line.  We need large-scale projects, more sustainability, more investment in the digital future, we need higher risk profiles. Yes, we need an extension, we need enlargement to include states outside the European Union that we are involved in, we need a strategic link between the parallel activities of the EIT and EFSI, we need an addition to an EFSI in the neighbouring countries and an Africa EFSI, and we need an increase in our projects and an acceleration.

Not blind rigour, not asphyxiation, but oxygen to small and medium-sized enterprises, responses to young unemployed people, greater competitiveness of our companies in the world. For this reason, we Socialists and Democrats asked Mr Juncker to provide for a European investment plan and voted for this Commission on the basis, above all, of this commitment. There have been important results, why deny it? But more can and must be done! There are three critical issues that need to be addressed. Firstly, additionality. This funding must be additional, not substitute. It cannot be business as usual, normal work that the EIB does, otherwise we would not have needed an investment plan and a special fund. Secondly, we must accept higher risks. I say to the EIB that triple A must not be a dogma, otherwise we would not have needed an investment plan if the higher-risk projects cannot be financial. Thirdly, relations with Parliament. You acknowledged this just now, Vice-President Katainen. We are the elected representatives of the citizens, and this plan comes from our own intuition and our request.  We need a constant relationship with the Commission and the European Investment Bank. We need more listening. Together we need to work on points of suffering, on the points of greatest need for change. We need to work together on more information than local realities, which need to know and must be able to apply for these opportunities. In conclusion, it is necessary to make this plan, through an extension, but it must not be an extension for its own sake, it must be an extension aimed at making this plan a serious, convincing and concrete response to the economic and social crisis that europe is deeply experiencing.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2016-06-08.json", "name": "President. –", "mepid": "28314", "text": "   There are already Members of Parliament who have asked to put blue card questions, but I want to inform you that I will open it up after the Group speeches, so if you still want to put a blue card question after that, please ask again.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2016-06-08.json", "name": "Sander Loones", "mepid": "128717", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. I fully understand that the European Commission wants to communicate positively about its projects, which makes sense to me. But one can still ask whether this hurrah communication today is not just a little too early. Firstly, I notice that the Commission is already informing us today that the plan will be extended. I took a look at the state of play. In particular, I see a whole series of projects that have just been drawn up or have not even been drawn up yet. I see figures on investments and jobs, which are mainly estimates, and I see that almost no independent analyses have been made. So it may be a little too early to draw all those seemingly definitive conclusions.  We have also agreed that the European Investment Bank will evaluate the plan and that it should be done within 18 months. I haven't seen that analysis, unless I've missed something. At least we have to wait for that. Only when that analysis is positive, when it shows that the objectives of the plan are being achieved, can the European Commission possibly propose an extension. But I would suggest that we should then discuss this in this Parliament, and also in the Council, how best to set it up or not.  Secondly, the theme of the day: should we extend the investment plan to third countries, to developing countries? Yes, we need to strengthen that economy and the European Union can play a role in that. But I also want to call for not being naïve. We are all aware that not all countries concerned will be equally stable and loyal partners. We will therefore have to use extra control to avoid corruption and bad investment. I am not necessarily against, but I would like to call for a move. Finally, let us not lose sight of the essence. EFSI can have a very positive impact on our economy, on the investment climate. But if we really want to bring about change, then the Member States will have to reform. I was therefore very pleased, Commissioner, that it was precisely your first and very well-worked point in your speech, which is that we need to work towards these structural reforms.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2016-06-08.json", "name": "Pavel Telička", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Madam President, I would like to underline firstly that ALDE gave its support to the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) and we remain supportive with maybe some question marks. I would especially give credit to the Commission for having had the courage to launch something that we have not seen from the Commission before. Commissioner, let me follow a little the structure of your introduction. You spoke, among other things, of widening and deepening of the internal market. I agree, but there is more to it. I think that if we speak of the investment environment, of the climate, of the conditions, then we should also look at the existing legislation, without lowering standards – this is not the point that I would like to raise – but still cutting significantly the administrative burden for businesses, especially for SMEs. This is where I would expect a serious initiative from the Commission with a serious and thorough review of the existing legislation in this respect. In terms of the financial means that have already been invested, we were aiming for EUR 60 billion – so let us say EUR 20 billion a year – and we were around EUR 12 billion for the first year. I do not think that this is a major problem. Every programme has a slow start, but it means that in the second year we have to have more than EUR 20 billion and, in the third year, most likely around EUR 30 billion if we are to meet it.  More of a concern is what kind of projects are we really financing? That is where, so far, I see the weakness of EFSI. If we look at the projects – and I have not seen any information about the last ten or so, maybe we are seeing a positive curve – but 90% of these projects are very similar to those that we would be financing from cohesion funding – let us say, low—risk EIB funding, CEF, Horizon whatever – so I am not sure that we are really meeting the objective of the added value , the additional financing and the risky projects.  I think this is something that we should focus on – or maybe I am ill informed and maybe the EIB could do better, as well as the Commissioner, in really portraying the difference between the projects that we finance from other instruments and the high-risk projects. All this is against the background that we have taken resources from Horizon 2020, as well as CEF, so we also need to balance the positive value against the background that we have reduced that sum somewhere else.  So regarding the expectations – without at the moment discussing prolongation or not – we need to review the quality of the projects and we should also maybe have a look, in terms of the review, at whether the EIB in the future should not rather be financing the lower—risk projects with a lower share, but with a higher share on the high-risk projects. I think that then we can really deliver. One final remark: you have spoken about the innovative, the creative and also the high—risk circular economy. It is absolutely clear that this has to be a key priority, which in fact could create a whole new industry. Am I wrong in saying that so far one single project has been financed? That is completely insufficient. So let us have a look at the weaknesses. We are happy to work with you on that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2016-06-08.json", "name": "Miguel Viegas", "mepid": "125100", "text": "  gue/NGL Group. – Madam President, the latest data on the implementation of the European Strategic Investment Fund confirm the criticism we made at its launch. We said then that the ratios were unrealistic, we said that this plan did not correspond to the needs of relaunching the economy, we finally said that this plan was not neutral because it has no geographical distribution criteria, favours the richest countries and represents an authentic feast for large companies through public-private partnerships.  Current figures show that most of the investment in reality is concentrated in the richest and most developed regions of central Europe, confirming a private management framework for energy transport infrastructure, which should be public and put at the service of development and not at the service of the accumulation of profits for large multinational companies.  Portugal is currently at zero in the implementation of this plan and this is despite austerity policies having drastically reduced investment, to the point that they do not even cover capital depreciation, compromising future growth.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is right that the Juncker plan should be the big deal of this Parliament, because the European economy is deeply ill with a chronic lack of investment, both public and private. But what about the cure? The means of this plan are, at the same time, so modest - we are talking about much less than 1% of European GDP - and so scattered, both geographically and thematically, that this dusting seems to me to be more homeopathy than the horse remedy that our economy needs.  In practical terms, if you want this plan to have any chance of success and to have a macroeconomic impact, it must be substantially strengthened by the Member States that have the capacity, but above all concentrated. Concentrated both in countries that suffer from a lack of investment and a lack of investment capacity - it is still incredible that we are financing countries like Germany, which has all the capacity of the world to invest - but also focused thematically on the great European value-added project, I mean the energy transition.  Energy is the heart of the economy, and the energy transition, energy independence, is a strategic, economic and ecological imperative for the Union. This is a good thing because the countries on the periphery are the ones that need the most investment, but also those with the greatest potential for renewable energy.  But the great contradiction of your policy, Vice-President Katainen, is the fact that while you are modestly pressing the accelerator with this investment plan, you are putting all the brakes on, both by the application of budgetary and accounting rules that handicap public investment, by an obsession with structural reforms that push more Europeans into poverty and exclusion every day, thus reducing aggregate demand and, even more so, by refusing to hold to account those States which deliberately have massive deficits - and I am obviously thinking of Germany - of their domestic demand.

Just have a look around at the empty seats this morning. And the idea that tens of billions of private capital are going to arrive for joint projects with you guys frankly I think is pie in the sky. Though happily Mr Cameron, of course, has committed GBP 6 billion of our money to this project and if ever you are short of money just ask Mr Cameron because he always pays up. But it is I think these grand projects that in many ways, I think, are sowing the seeds of the end of this political project. I came in here in 1999 and sat at the back and there were only three of us in the whole building who thought our Member State should leave the European Union. But it is grand projects that have turned the tide of public opinion, in particular the introduction of the euro. You know I warned you, we all warned you, that it would not work for the Mediterranean countries. It could comfortably work for the optimal currency zone in the north. But no, through massive ambition and hubris you ploughed on and you allowed countries like Greece to join a currency that they were never fit for. And what is happening to Greece now? Well they are facing the next bailout, in probably July of this year, and because you want to hold your project together you are forcing them, bit by bit, to become a third-world country. And all I can say, frankly, is shame on you. The other big grand project was to allow into this Union first eight, and then ten, former communist countries, some of them with human rights records that are frankly shocking and abysmal, and others in which corruption is so rife that these countries have not made the transition to being full Western democracies. When I was first elected here the word immigration did not even appear on my election address. We did not use that word once when the first three of us got elected here. But now, as we have allowed much poorer countries to have the free movement of peoples, we see considerable anger in Britain and in many countries across the north of Europe. And yes, it has led to the rise of parties that some may consider to be deeply unpleasant, but that is what happens when you take control out of people’s lives. And the other feature I have noticed here is the growth of what I can only describe as authoritarianism. You know, we actually saw the Prime Minister of Greece removed effectively by a coup d’état and we saw Mr Berlusconi removed by a coup d’état and in both cases represented by appointees who were former directors of Goldman Sachs. So I think you have sowed the seeds of your own destruction. We have, in two weeks’ time, what is to be the biggest event in the history of this project. It is the British referendum and it is not just about whether Britain leaves the European Union, because if we make that choice I am confident many other countries will make that choice too. I did originally believe that we should leave because we were a square peg in a round hole. When I saw what happened here in 2005, when the French and Dutch rejected the constitution and yet sneakily it was brought in through the back door as the Lisbon Treaty, I realised then that this is not just bad for Britain; it is bad for the whole of Europe.  And I hope that on 23 June it is not just Independence Day for the United Kingdom. I hope it brings an end to this entire project and in a few years’ time we could be sovereign, democratic nation states that work and trade together. I hope this is the last time I will be speaking in this Parliament from a Member State. I hope that we are going to leave this Union on 23 June.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a year ago you almost unanimously adopted the Juncker Plan, billed as the most important bailout in history, which is supposed to boost public investment and economic growth in Europe. Admit that a year later, your rescue plan turned into a smoke plan; in a word, it is total failure. This was not the case because the European Fund for Strategic Investments, with a budget of 21 billion euros, failed to drain enough private capital, since the profitability of public investment was by definition lower. This failure was the failure, as the investments financed under this European fund focused on large-scale projects in the city centres, neglecting many local projects, resulting in an increase in regional disparities. Failing, finally, because the figures speak for themselves: economic growth stalled, youth unemployment historically high and poverty taking hold all over Europe. In reality, the Juncker plan aims to create dependence on European funds while imposing a budgetary diet on the Member States, with the sole aim of uniting our peoples around your doomed project, which destroys national identities.

It is not a success, when in the 140,000 small and medium-sized enterprises and mid-caps expected to benefit from the Plan there is only one Greek and none Cypriot.  Businesses in Greece do not close only because they do not have access to finance. They are closing because they cannot meet the debts arising from the austerity policies imposed, and only these plans are not enough. Change policies!

I think it is better to be more interactive in this way.  I have just a few comments on the interventions we have heard so far. It is very important for the EIB to remain a triple-A bank, because triple-A status has a direct connection to the financing power the EIB has. But I fully agree with Members who have said that the EIB should take more risk, and for this reason we have established the EFSI. It enables the EIB to finance projects which are seen as more risky and is worth EUR 63 billion. This is what the EIB is doing at the moment. The EIB has done an excellent job. Apart from adding finance to risky projects, it has upgraded its presence in many of our Member States, including Greece, in order to help the Greek authorities, and the private sector especially, to benefit from EFSI and benefit from other financial instruments of the EIB. The EIB has done its share very, very well.  One issue I want to raise in the debate – and I want to raise awareness amongst MEPs on this issue – is that it is also possible to combine structural funds with EFSI. We already have a very good example of this kind of financing in northern France where the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region has organised an investment platform which aims to gather together a large number of SMEs and start—ups, especially in the digital field. They will use private capital, regional money and EFSI funds in order to provide risk financing for those companies. You can find this example on the website. This is a model which could be copied in the other countries, especially the cohesion countries. There we need the help of MEPs, because you know EFSI funds and you know the regions. EFSI is a demand—driven fund. I am happy that we have one genuine circular economic project which has got financing from EFSI, but I am dissatisfied that there is only one. So, again, we have to raise awareness amongst circular economy players and investors that EFSI can really provide something which the market cannot provide, or does not provide, at the moment. EFSI is a perfect instrument for the circular economy, for new innovation and new technology investments, which for some reason cannot get full financing from the market. There again, the role of MEPs is crucial. The EIB does not create projects, it only finances them, and that is why we have to raise awareness amongst investors, and also amongst the regions and cities to use EFSI for new innovations. I want to raise one issue. We are following very closely what is going on in our Member States in terms of EFSI activities and related things. I have very good information on the activities of MEPs. So far only a handful of MEPs have organised EFSI events in their regions or Member States. A very good example of these kinds of activities was last week, when I had a chance to visit Mr Pittella’s and Mr Gualtieri’s event, where southern Italian regional leaders came together. We were talking about opportunities to use EFSI for southern Italian purposes. Also, Ms Spyraki has organised events in Greece, Ms Paunova in Bulgaria, and Mr Guoga in Lithuania. This is exactly what we need at the moment. We need to raise awareness of what EFSI can do and what EFSI has done in other countries in order to make it possible to use EFSI in a more efficient way. If you want to see the projects which have already been signed, you can find all the projects on the internet. It is very good to look at them and pass the message on to the other regions about what the others have already done. EFSI will not solve all the problems in Europe. In the best case, it can provide financing or it can help to get investments worth EUR 315 billion euros. This is only one third of what is needed. That is why the other parts of the investment plans are even more important than EFSI. It is easier to talk about money when we are talking about EUR 315 billion, or what EFSI has already financed, but the rest of the plan is even more important. That is why I expect co—legislators to be as fast when implementing, or when approving, single market—related proposals as we were when we approved EFSI legislation. It took only six months to push EFSI through the Parliament and the Council. Why should we wait longer when dealing with, for instance, a waste legislation proposal or digital single market-related proposals? So the internal market-side of the plan is even more important than EFSI, even though EFSI is very much needed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 13, "date": "2016-06-08.json", "name": "José Manuel Fernandes (PPE).", "mepid": "96899", "text": "   – Madam President, the European Fund for Strategic Investments has proved in this first year of operation that it strongly encourages investment in the European Union.

In view of these data, it is easy to predict and argue that this fund should continue beyond the three years originally envisaged. It is also important, at the outset, that the EIB complies with the Regulation with regard to additionality, with regard to the selection of projects, which should take into account territorial cohesion, job creation.  I insist that no minimum amounts for project eligibility are defined in the Regulation. No one is obliged to apply for this fund, but member states and local authorities need to be encouraged to do so, to set up regional, national and transnational investment platforms to promote the geographical dispersion of investments as much as possible.

Error number one – and I would ask you to take a closer look there, also as EFSI's governing body: we have the impression that the European Investment Bank is using the funds that Parliament has made available, among other things, to scale back its own activities. That is not the point of EFSI. We are in need in the European Union, more investment is needed. So, please take a look at what the European Investment Bank is doing in its normal programme.

There is not one mentioned in your interim report. Finally, a third important point: you are not using the instruments provided for in the legislation.

Even if the Christian Democrats, some of them the Social Democrats, are overwhelmed with enthusiasm in the face of the paper successes, so far it is mere hopes that are on this paper.  What worries me, frankly, Commissioner, is that you said that the lack of investment in Europe is due to banks no longer being able to take risks to the extent that they used to do so because we re-regulated them. Mr Katainen, if that is the reason that we do not have any investments, then it is not right to extend the EFSI as an instrument of state risk-taking, then we must approach this regulation, then we need to revise it. Then it is not right to say that EFSI has raised billions in private investment, but then we have to find that our regulation has outed that our regulation has prevented banks from taking risks.  And that, Mr President, we in this House will have to work that out and correct the mistakes we may have made in the context of regulation. It is important that we do not turn public policy on its head here. It is not the case that banks are supposed to finance the safe sides of the investments and the state takes the risk. No, it must be the other way round, Mr Katainen. Banks are the risk-taker, and banks are the ones that need to check risk. The banks are the ones who have to do the assessment.

It aims to fill the investment gap that Europe has suffered over the past decade. The first projects funded are numerous and encouraging, but it is still too early to draw up a reliable assessment and, in this regard, Vice-President Katainen, you will have to dispel three doubts.  The first doubt concerns the requirement of the fund's additionality, in other words its added value. We will have to show that, without the intervention of the Juncker Fund, the projects in question would not have been financed. The second doubt concerns the temptation to be used by some public investors to de-de-force capital expenditure and the corresponding debt, in order to lighten the presentation of public accounts in an optical way. The third doubt concerns the risk of replacing the European Investment Bank, which has the competitive advantage of the fund guarantee, with market operators.  As exciting as this fund is, let us be in mind that the brakes on investment are still very much present. First in the commercial sector, investment is conditioned by competitiveness. That is to say if countries that are slow to reform cannot wait for a miracle. Beyond the Member States, the Union has its own brakes, especially when the monetary environment is the subject of questions. Investors are haunted by uncertainty. There is an urgent need to decide the British referendum, to draw the consequences and to reform the governance of the euro area to make it more effective and more democratic.  Finally, the commitment of operators depends on the predictability and stability of market rules. In many areas, the single market is fragmented by national regulations, by local competition authorities. There is also an urgent need to complete the single market, to accelerate the convergence of tax, social regulations, in short, to make the euro area and the European Union an optimal economic zone.  Clearly pleased with the first results of the Juncker Fund, the Commission is considering making it sustainable. Financial engineering allows volumes to be increased tenfold. The fact remains that the guarantee must be mobilized in cash that is ringing and stumbling.

Where is the additionality there? Secondly, this one should also be for the countries mostly affected by the crisis. How can you explain that Greece only has one project on infrastructure and one SME project? That is really one of the regions most affected by the crisis, yet it is not benefiting from EFSI at all. That is also a genuine problem. Thirdly, this should be a transition of the economy. Bank Watch concluded that, without EFSI, the EIB is subsidising 25% of the projects related to climate.

I can tell you that there is the enlargement of a motorway, the A4, and explain to me how environmentally sustainable it is to focus again on the automotive sector, the Milazzo refinery, then oil, then the Arvedi steel works, steel, and the gas network. Gas does not seem to me to be a renewable source, so I cannot explain why the Greens are also clapping. Meanwhile, the Commission's concept of SMEs, if we look at the definition of what SME EFSI can finance, also concerns companies with up to 3 000 employees. I want to see in Italy how many companies there are of this type. So a total self-celebration for a project that is a failure. Now you also want to make a similar one for developing countries.

Investor confidence must be restored. Now I wonder where the added value of the EFSI actually lies – and this has already been mentioned several times today. I would like to give an example of this. Just last week, the first Austrian project was implemented, namely an EFSI project, a wind farm project in Hof-Seibersdorf, twelve wind turbines with a capacity of three megawatts each, EUR 70 million in project volume, 40 million of which was taken over by EFSI as a guarantee, 20% by the house bank. I do not see that this project would have a particular risk profile that would justify the additionality of the EFSI. This wind farm operator has been working with the EIB for three years, and the bank has been financing from the outset. So: I don't see the added value. Perhaps this added value should be made clearer. Several other projects have already been mentioned in other countries where there is no additionality. A second momentum for not fulfilling the core business, namely to take over the high-risk projects, is the leverage 1:23. 249 EFSI projects were funded, four billion euros were needed to kick-start 100 billion. This shows that you are not going into high-risk projects here. Perhaps it would be better to increase the eib's capital in order to actually invest more money in the economy and in development.

The Juncker Plan has allowed access to EUR 242 million of SME funding in my country in Spain, mobilizing EUR 4.4 billion and could benefit up to 17,000 of these small and medium-sized enterprises. The European Commission has proposed the extension of the EIEF. This will allow projects under study that are strategically very important for my region, for Navarra, such as the electrical interconnections between Spain and France, to benefit from this plan.

We need to continue structural reforms.

We need to fix the system as soon as possible so that it can help projects other than those with a high level of profitability that could probably have been financed by the market.

Of course, one cannot ask an instrument to solve all the problems that lie. We have too few investments in Europe, and I cannot solve that with one instrument. But EFSI could and can make a contribution if it is applied correctly. In this respect, after one year, I think it is quite fair to simply assess soberly: where are weaknesses, where are strengths, and where are there perhaps other homework that needs to be done? For me, this is a problem, that there are not so many particularly strong investments in economically weaker and smaller countries, that certain countries that we actually want to have are not included, or that the impression arises that very often investments are also being made in products or projects that are already running or that have already been started. It's not always just brand new projects. That is why we need to look at how to sharpen this instrument, how to make it work better. In any case, however, this instrument is much better than lamenting and the message that we only have to throw in more money. It is not about more money, it is about the intelligent use of money.

What is the record a year later? In the transport sector, for example, the additionality and European added value of the selected projects, mainly motorways, do not seem optimal. For projects more in line with European political priorities, additionality will often require coupling with financial instruments and subsidies. In this regard, we can only regret the budgetary drain on the interconnection mechanism for Europe by 2020, which goes against the very effectiveness of the plan.  The qualitative improvement of the projects requires an equally proactive approach by the Union.

Only four percent of all EFSI investments go to the social sector, for example in health and education. This is the lowest share of all sectors. I believe that, especially in times of crisis, social innovation, green jobs or even social entrepreneurship should be particularly encouraged. It should also be ensured that EFSI's investments are in line with the Europe 2020 targets such as poverty reduction, lowering the number of early school leavers, climate protection and research and development promotion. Mr Vice-President, we Greens are fully committed to the objective of increased investment, private and public investment, in order to get us out of the crisis and to create employment. However, the Greens' criticisms of the design and implementation of the EFSI, which have been made from the outset, are justified if we look at the figures for this interim report.

We wanted an additional plan, we wanted a job-creating plan, we wanted a plan for the ecological transition and we wanted a plan for the cohesion of the European Union. None of these criteria are availab at the rendezvous. In addition, I would add that in order to finance it, you must relaunch securitization or accept Chinese funds unconditionally.

I do not know how you look upon that in other parts of Europe, but I would like to advise that as an approach from the Commission during the review, because the fact that the money in EFSI is spent and used is not a success as such. It would have been a surprise if not, because public—subsidised and public—guaranteed money is always preferred to other types. The remaining problem is that Europe still has an investment gap of between EUR 300 to 400 to 500 billion annually, and we see it very clearly when we look at the flows of foreign direct investments. Since 2007, they have been more or less halved, while in other competing regions they have been doubled. This is the core problem, and in the review the Commission needs to look at whether this money is replacing other investments. Is it creating attraction to more investments, and at what does it mean that we have undermined research science and the Connecting Europe Facility?

Madam President, Mr Vice-President, all of us in the European Parliament have sometimes called for growth and new jobs in our countries. For all this to happen, investment is needed. The European Commission responded quickly and created the Investment Plan with a huge contribution from the European Parliament to make it better, and we must not forget the unlimited important contribution of his dear colleague José Manuel Fernandes, who was the rapporteur for this Project.  I'm not one of those people who thinks this plan would solve all the problems. I am not even one of those who believe that this project will be a complete success, but to date I have not heard another alternative proposal. I have not heard any suggestions for optimising this Plan. And I am telling you, that I belong to a country such as Cyprus, which has been tested and so far has not taken a cent from this Investment Plan, to formally ask Vice-President Katainen for countries such as Malta and Cyprus, which have not been able to participate to date, to receive the contribution and assistance of the Investment Fund. , to provide information on the Investment Fund, because until now all of us believed or believe that it is only for major projects, for infrastructure projects, for large deployments. It's for small and medium-sized enterprises. If possible, make a one-stop shop in each country where small and medium-sized enterprises are informed, in order to achieve the objective and dissemination of this Fund to 140,000 small and medium-sized enterprises.

But it is also true, especially if we look at the 'infrastructure and innovation' window, that we can and must do better and do more. I as the main critical elements individual the following. Firstly, I believe that the involvement of national development banks must be strengthened. Secondly, we need to see more platforms created in the various countries and also transnational. Finally, we must help more to combine the Structural Funds with EFSI funding.

Similar fates have been given to cohesion funds in the previous perspective and also to the current one when it comes to more complex projects.

It is also because, as has become very clear, the poorest regions are those where the presence of EFSI is still small and the knock-on effect has not been there. Secondly, we need more ambition: EUR 100 billion roughly one year of investment in Europe is a drop in the ocean. You are well aware that investment has fallen greatly as a whole as a crisis.

Madam President, Mr Katainen, the Juncker Investment Plan for Greece has failed because the troika, in which the Commission is a member, has imposed a stifling economic environment on Greek society and entrepreneurship. It has reduced wages and pensions, resulting in a reduction in purchasing power in the Greek market, which discourages investment. The troika has increased indirect taxes and the tax rate on small and medium-sized enterprises, which leads to padlocks. Instead of the troika returning to Greece the profits of the ECB and the central banks, SMP and ANFA, of 10 billion euros by 2020, in order to finance a new Marshall Plan for development, the ESM keeps that money. Finally, the referral of Greek debt regulation to the Greek calends is a burden on the economic climate and discourages investment.

Where multinationals make greater profits and not in states such as Cyprus and Greece, which are most in need because of the memoranda of austerity policies that have torn their economy apart, they have led to high rates of unemployment, youth migration and the poverty of the people. Equally dangerous is that the Commission's report clearly states that, instead of giving new money, further involvement of the Fund for Strategic Investments with Horizon 2020 and the Connecting Europe programme as well as the Structural Funds will be promoted. In other words, it is planned to further cut off funds from existing programmes and funds.

I will try to group my answers to your questions together. First, around 30% of EFSI projects are in the energy field and mostly in the renewable energy efficiency field. Some of our colleagues said that there were no projects in energy efficiency. That is a complete mistake. EFSI provides risk financing for new technologies and innovative projects and that is very good because this is what we all wanted.  For everybody who is concerned about projects already financed – or if there are some areas which have not been covered, like the circular economy for instance – I strongly encourage everybody to be active with the people who are operating in, for instance, the circular economy field to raise awareness of what EFSI can provide for them. I do this every single day. I go around Europe explaining the opportunities EFSI has to offer, for instance, new innovations and circular economy projects, but unfortunately the level of awareness varies between the Member States. Now, I will come to the point concerning why some Member States have not benefited very much from EFSI already. It is mostly – if you look at it very concretely – because public authorities have not been active in promoting EFSI opportunities. As we all know, EFSI does not finance pure public projects, but very often regional authorities, national authorities and Ministers play a role when raising awareness about what EFSI can do among the private sector – private investors – and there are huge differences between Member States.  Some Ministers have even indicated very clearly when I met them that if there were not more trains coming to their country, then they were not interested in EFSI at all. I asked them, if they were not interested, to please convey the message to investors in the private sector that they could contact the EIB directly.  Private investors in many countries are hearing for the first time, even though we have repeated it over and over again, that they do not need any public sector approval if they want to apply for resources from EFSI. We just have to repeat this over and over again. That is why I have repeated here a couple of times that we need your help. In some Member States some MEPs have been very active at regional level, conveying the message that companies can apply directly for resources from the EIB. Another point is that we have Commission Representations in all the Member States, which are ready to serve both public authorities and regional authorities, but also the private sector, to explain what EFSI can do. In most Member States too we have EIB offices, which are there for technical assistance and advice.  In many Member States we have seen excellent events organised by the private sector itself or by political parties, for instance, or by public authorities, to which they have invited private investors, entrepreneurs, industrialists and regional leaders, and to which the EIB has sent its representatives and the Commission has sent its representatives to explain what EFSI has done in other countries. We have to do this more in all the Member States.  So there are some attitude problems. Some Member States are very passive but we try to contact the private sector directly in those Member States where the public authorities have not been the most active. When looking at the projects, there were a few concerns about whether EFSI has financed motorways without good reason. Actually the few motorway investments which have benefited from EFSI have been technically the most difficult, there has been uncertainty about the traffic and it has been very difficult to attract private financing for those projects. Before you condemn those projects, I really encourage you to look at them and discuss them, for instance, with the EFSI management because they can explain in more detail why they have selected those projects.  We are helping – although it is not our primary duty – Member States to create platforms for green shipping, for instance. This means that we try to collect together port investment and other green shipping types of investment in order to spread EFSI to the areas where there have not been any projects so far.  I visited Greece for the second time a month ago. I met representatives from the five biggest banks in Greece and tried to explain what they could do for SMEs for instance. In Greece too it was the first time that Greek banks had heard that they could apply directly for resources from EFSI for SMEs.  I understand all the difficulties that the Greek banks have, but another idea which I raised there was to build an investment platform, for instance in the tourism sector, which means, basically that the platform could collect together a large amount of small—sized investment – for instance hotel renovation projects or things like that – and the private sector could put some equity in the platform while EFSI could provide , for instance, long—term, very low interest rate loans to the entrepreneurs.  I am a hundred percent sure that these would function in Greece. I spoke about it with the Greek authorities and the Greek Government and we have very close cooperation with the Greek Government on this issue. So I do want to see this happening in Greece. The same thing would also function in Cyprus.  There were lots of other issues. Mr Nicholson, you raised Northern Ireland and why Northern Ireland has not benefited from the EFSI yet. I do not know what the Northern Ireland authorities have done or have not done, but we have our Representation there at the authorities’ disposal. I visited there personally and I tried to convey the message to the private sector in Northern Ireland that they could apply resources directly from EFSI and it would be good to establish a platform for smaller projects. So everything is possible, in Northern Ireland too.  All Member States have the same opportunities and in those Member States which have been the least active, the Commission, and even my Cabinet directly, try to help the authorities understand how they could utilise the opportunities we have at our disposal. I will stop here. We have mostly been talking about EFSI and this is only one part of the Investment Plan. I want to underline the importance of the single market project.

It is an aid of 500 million, the second, over 15 years, conditional on a number of reforms, which I really hope will be relevant, will not only be accounting and will really serve the development of Tunisia. If this report is adopted earlier, which I think, the Council, in my opinion, will support it and I really ask the Commission to make these capital disbursements as soon as possible, before the summer, because Tunisia needs it. People sometimes think that this macro-financial assistance is a gift or a grant. It is only a loan, we lend money to Tunisia, which it will have to repay. I want to say a word about the Tunisian debt, which is obviously increasing. I want to open up a line of reflection - and I would be happy if the Commission listened to it: both France and Germany decided to convert part of the debt they had to Tunisia - 60 million for France, 60 million for Germany - in exchange for investments in the development of that country. I think this is very relevant and intelligent, and I really invite the Commission for the future, beyond the plan we are going to adopt this morning, to think and think about it in this way. I think it would be more useful and wiser for Tunisia. What France and Germany have done, the European institutions should, in my opinion, also propose to Tunisia. Colleagues, we all see that we must stand with Tunisia and Tunisians. We owe it to them, but we also owe it to our European Union, to our Europe. We need a stable, prosperous and peaceful Tunisia alongside Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 111, "date": "2016-06-08.json", "name": "Jyrki Katainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, let me first thank the rapporteur, Mrs de Sarnez, and the Committee on International Trade (INTA), for the valuable work on this report.  As we all know, Tunisia faces enormous political economic challenges, and that is the reason why the Commission made its proposal for a macro—financial assistance operation in that country. Tunisia is confronted with the consequences of the terrorist attacks of 2015. The result is that its vital tourism sector, in particular, has been seriously affected and foreign investments have sharply declined. These developments have led to falling growth rates and foreign currency reserves. This shows that the situation is very acute, and Tunisia needs international financial systems in order to stabilise and further political transition started during the Arab Spring of 2011.  International bilateral donors, led by the IMF, have clearly expressed their willingness to support Tunisia, now and in the near future. The Commission can and should contribute to these renewed financial support efforts and we propose to do so by providing a new macro-financial assistance (MFA) of EUR 500 million which builds on the previous MFA operation of EUR 300 million. It is foreseen that this new assistance, which is the largest MFA ever given to a country of the Southern neighbourhood, will be disbursed in three tranches over the next two years. This exceptional assistance effort must also be seen against the background of the courageous efforts and significant progress that Tunisia has been making in recent years to establish a fully—fledged democratic system, despite the difficult regional and security environment. Of course, the new MFA operation will be subject to the fulfilment of a number of economic policy conditions. Indeed, Tunisia must satisfactorily implement the new IMF programme and fulfil economic and financial policy conditions to be agreed between the EU and Tunisia in a memorandum of understanding. Potential policy measures could cover areas such as public finance management, fiscal reforms, strengthening the social safety net, labour market reforms and measures to support the recovery of the tourism sector, as well as in trade and investment. I would like to stress that timing is of the essence here. Tunisia requires the micro-financial assistance to cover its large external financing needs for 2016 and 2017, so a swift adoption of the current proposal by co-legislators, under the ordinary legislative procedure is very important. Therefore, I am pleased that the INTA Committee has approved the Commission proposal without amendment. I am also pleased that the Council in the letter from Coreper, has expressed its commitment to adopting a Commission proposal without amendments, subject to the same outcome at today’s plenary vote.

I believe that there is urgency, I think there is urgency for the reasons that have already been explained. I try to make the most of these reasons. Firstly, the European Union's neighbourhood policy, an important policy, an effective instrument, especially when it is intended for a project of democracy, for a project of freedom. The effects of this project are certainly necessary for Europe itself. This project is precisely about the maintenance of certain borders, about keeping in relation also to the centrality of a tragedy, a major problem such as migration, on which, in some ways, we continue to postpone decisions, and so we still need to focus on policies that are effective. On the other hand, there is the great problem of structural reforms that Tunisia needs. Reforms which, let us remember, would need not EUR 500 million but EUR 5 billion. Of course, 500 million is a fundamental input of certainty that realizes the condition of a progression in the right direction. Therefore, the PPE strongly supports it, the PPE has not tabled any amendments that are obstructing or instrumental. However, it is clear that the rules and regulations cannot be exceeded, and so we say that we are going to overcome this in the name of urgency and in the name of a European interest, but certainly also of a country such as Tunisia.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 113, "date": "2016-06-08.json", "name": "Emmanuel Maurel", "mepid": "24505", "text": "  On behalf of the Group of S-D. - Madam President, since the Tunisians have embarked on a democratic transition, of which everyone here has reminded us how exemplary it is, the European Parliament has always wanted to show solidarity with Tunisia and, of course, with Tunisians. We did so when we launched a free trade agreement process, which was collectively stressed, which had to be obviously asymmetrical and progressive, so-called partnership with Tunisia; we have also been, even if this has caused much debate between us, when we had to extend the quota of zero-rights olive oil for the Tunisian economy; we are now when we address this issue of macro-financial assistance.  So, of course, we do it, the group, and for the text as it stands. What for? Because there is an emergency and it has to go fast. That is the only reason why we are for the text as it stands. But, at the same time, there are a number of things that need to be remembered in this debate. First, when we say that Tunisia must be able to make structural reforms. I call on the Commission to be very flexible, to be more intelligent if possible about this, because it is not a question of completely stifling the Tunisian economy. That's the first point. Second point: we talk about AMF, but who says AMF, says ready, says loan, says debt, but Tunisian debt, today it is a problem. This is a problem that is essentially inherited from the Ben Ali period and the money that is lent to Tunisians should not be used for only one thing, namely to repay the interest on the debt it had incurred under the former regime. That is a second problem. Third problem, very important for us: precisely, the assets of Ben Ali, there are still many that are hidden in Europe and there are obviously things to do from the point of view of Europe - because there are also in the European countries - to solve this problem. While we are obviously in favour of this emergency aid, this should not prevent us from thinking about the longer term.

There are the major socio-economic challenges, the sky-high unemployment among young people, for example, but also the difficult recovery from the terrorist attacks. Tunisia - as the rapporteur has also said - has a very important role to play for the European Union as a strategic, reliable partner in the region. So we must support the country in this difficult transition process towards a fully stable democracy. A good trade policy is crucial in this respect.  The fact that we are now providing a new tranche of this macro-financial support is an important step towards greater stability. I can count on my support, but we are not giving blank cheques.

So, of course, at the request of the Tunisian government, we must promote macro-financial aid to Tunisia and, at the same time, we must - and the European Parliament voted to do so in 2012 - reverse Tunisia's odious debt, particularly under the Ben Ali years.  It is absolutely necessary to lighten the burden of debt. When we talk about structural reforms, ladies and gentlemen, be careful, look at the state of Tunisia today, consider that because this macro-financial aid is conditional on a Monetary Fund programme, we cannot support reforms that address the basic needs of Tunisians.

At any moment, in any place in the world, there could be a terrorist attack. No one is immune and no one is safe. Today, power in the world is shifting and changing.  At the Munich Security Conference, the Russian Prime Minister spoke about the time of the First Cold War, and the New Cold War time we are facing today. I hope we are not heading into a new Cold War. We are not in a time of a new Cold War, but we are rather in a time of Cold Peace. Two years ago, at the Munich Security Conference, I pointed out that Europe has entered a new period. The Ukrainian crisis was the game changer. We have entered a new phase of development, which I call Cold Peace Time. Peace, because nobody wants to have a war, but Cold Peace because we see confrontation and methods from the Cold War time – propaganda wars, cyber-attacks, proxy and hybrid warfare. And some countries got ‘cold’, destabilised and weakened through frozen conflicts. The Russian President often talks about a new balance in the world with spheres of interest of Great Powers that need to be respected. Are we heading towards a new Yalta Conference? If the West allows this, it will be a historic shame.  (Applause) We need to show character, we need to stand up and defend our vision – our vision for our united Europe. We are living in difficult times, because world and regional leaders demonstrate a different approach and different goals in politics. The cause of wise politics is to modernise, to educate, to give way to diplomacy and not to fight. But if you do not have a cause, you need a war, you need a convenient enemy. It is easy to destabilise. States can be broken easily by powerful neighbours. But broken societies can only be repaired by people, not by Great Powers. You can quickly destroy order but it takes a lot of time to rebuild it. Unfortunately this is exactly what I see today in some parts of Europe. The goal of wise politics should not be to create frozen conflicts and occupy your neighbour’s territory. In the 21st century it is not wise to move borders, but to think beyond borders. The goal of wise politics is to make your nation educated and prosperous, to empower citizens, to create societies that are free and tolerant.  We do not want to go back to the time when the Great Powers allocated their spheres of influence. We cannot once again allow ‘political interests’ to divide and occupy the territory of sovereign states. What happened in Ukraine is a bitter reminder that the achievements of progressive mankind cannot be taken for granted. We never wanted to have a war again in Europe, but unfortunately today, there is a war in Europe, and that is in Ukraine.  For me, for us, Crimea is Ukraine and Ukraine is Europe.  (Applause) I consider lifting visas for Ukrainian citizens as a significant and urgent step to support Ukraine and let its people feel welcome and supported by the Europeans.  The lack of proper knowledge about the past, the lessons not learned from history, continue to cast a shadow on our future. We should not give a chance to populists to exploit ignorance and forgetfulness and change the past to their liking. I welcome the creation of a European House of History. Remembrance of the tragic past should be encouraged and passed onto younger generations. And what we need to pass to the younger people is the most important lesson: that peace is not given and it is up to every one of us to protect it. And that peace is not just the absence of war. Peace is human rights, peace is the rule of law. Every young European should be able to see where and how battles such as Verdun or Doyran happened and understand why we should never go to war again. The Bulgarian revolutionary Gotse Delchev dreamed of a future world where nations would never again go to the battlefield, and only compete in the field of culture, science and knowledge. In the 21st century Europe’s disagreements should be solved in parliaments, not on battlefields! The European integration project is making exactly that dream a reality. Of course Europe cannot be an island of stability in the ocean of world instability today. The EU is facing a record number of crises. Additional crises are on our radar screens, for example the possible Brexit, the rise of nationalists and populists, migration and others. We must not allow Europe to fall into a moral crisis – a crisis of lack of solidarity, a crisis of values. Whether it is migration or the sanctions on Russia, we need to stand and stick together. We are a family. A family in a crisis stands together! And every member of the family has to contribute, has to solve and not deepen the problems. Bulgaria is proud to be always part of the European solution and acts in a more solid and responsible way.  The EU has unique significance and strong political legitimacy, because of the peaceful discussions and settlement of differences, because of the shared fundamental rights and rules, and because of the unprecedented level of cooperation achieved between 28 Member States. The EU is a unique project for peace, where every nation is important. No state is peripheral or subordinate. The problems of migration, terrorism, climate change, economic crises and others go beyond our borders. These problems are transnational and require joint efforts. Cooperation is no longer a matter of choice, but of necessity. We see chaos around our borders, failed states, and frozen conflicts. Brutal criminal interests and human traffickers make business by playing with people’s lives. Because of that, operations of NATO and Frontex on the outside borders are just and timely. Helping people whose lives are in danger is a universal value. But it is also essential to make the difference between those who run for their lives and migrants that are just looking for a better economic perspective.  Today the refugee crisis is crucial for Europe. It has the capacity to change it politically, economically and socially. It inflames old plagues like populism, nationalism and division. It embodies the crucial need for a better, common and long-term decision-making. In the face of an unprecedented migration flow, every Member State has to demonstrate solidarity and responsibility. Bulgaria has proved to be a loyal partner in good and in hard times. We are situated on the easiest and most direct way from the crisis zones to Western Europe. Bulgaria is protecting the external borders of the EU in a professional and efficient manner. We follow the rules of Dublin and Schengen. We show solidarity with all refugees and give humanitarian status to those that meet the criteria. Bulgaria fulfils all its responsibilities and duties as a Member State and it needs to be taken on an equal footing with Schengen members by joining the Schengen area as soon as possible for the sake of the EU common security policy.  (Applause) Bulgaria supports the establishment of the solidarity scheme, which will allow the fair relocation and resettlement of refugees among all Member States.  As Chair-in-Office of the South-East European Cooperation Process, Bulgaria initiated a Joint Statement on Migration and has put security and migration as a priority in the region.  The Balkans today are frontline and first on the line to protect Europe. I wish to see the Balkans become a frontline of stability and prosperity, a frontline of tolerance and peaceful coexistence of different religions and ethnic minorities. As the Bulgarian President I say: ‘We want borders to fall and not to be moved’. We have a balanced and a principled foreign policy, we want to be friends with everyone, because everyone can and must contribute to peace and stability. The close cooperation on migration and countering radicalisation, violent extremism and terrorism is just another example that the EU and the Balkans belong together. The EU integration process is also a historical chance for the Western Balkan countries to leave behind the heavy burden of conflicts. Nationalistic doctrines that led to atrocities belong to the past. Therefore, strengthening good neighbourly relationships and just being a good neighbour and a friend is a fundamental for the enlargement policy and a clear indicator whether the aspiring countries have sincerely embraced core EU values.  Bulgaria plays an important role in strengthening the EU’s expertise in the region. We strongly support the regional cooperation and work for reconciliation, connectivity and integration. The Summit of the South-East European Cooperation Process held in Sofia last week marked the very successful Bulgarian Presidency and the 20th anniversary of this format, which has proved to be the authentic voice of the region.  Dear friends, we need to team up and develop common strategies, rather than building fortresses to defend short-sighted national interests. We have to engage leaders from political, economic and civil society sectors, and not just to talk and discuss, but to implement, to contribute, to solve the problems. As new economic, demographic and political powers emerge, this underlines the necessity to intensify the links with partners that share our values. Transatlantic relations are strategically important in the face of growing challenges to our liberal-democratic model.  A bright future for Europe requires devising a new economic model, one that can respond to the upcoming challenges and make use of the wide range of opportunities. The new economic model of Europe has to be dynamic and open. We need to embrace new approaches and mechanisms. We should not fear phenomena like the collaborative and sharing economy, the e-commerce. Instead, we must welcome and use all innovations in the most pragmatic and productive way.  (Applause) Europe must become a leader of the new industrial revolution, of disruptive innovation, of digital technologies. Europe of the future has to be a Europe of entrepreneurs, a Europe of technology, of innovation and yes, we all want to have a Europe that is dynamic, that is flexible, that is adaptable, one that unites and leads.  What do we need to do? We need prevention, to be proactive, detect early and solve the crises. We need to calibrate and have a focus, choose one crises, get it solved and be proud. You did it in a European way, in our own way. We need to take bold political decisions. Our Union badly needs exactly that today, when it is hard and difficult. We need to empower diplomacy – negotiate, negotiate and do not fight, because the use of weapons is a proof that you have no arguments. We need to give way to principles, not interests. To reconfirm, and not to renegotiate the principles of rule of law, human rights and freedoms, territorial integrity, sovereignty and inviolability of the borders of each and every state in Europe and the world.  Yes, we face years of growing risks and uncertainty, as we are moving into a more unstable world order. And yes, it will take time until a new balance is reached in a new multipolar world. In this transitional period we have to build and rebuild a more resilient regional and world order through our joint efforts. We should promote institutional reforms, diplomacy and principles. We should support leaders that understand that differences should be resolved peacefully and not through proxy or propaganda wars. And we need to be firm, because if we are not, we will encourage irresponsible leaders to destabilise further.  Dear friends, the European Union is a daily plebiscite on our desire to live together. History shows that without constant efforts everything we have gained can be lost. The debates on migration, Brexit, populists or Euro-sceptics, only reaffirm that conclusion. Today, more than ever, we need to bring back confidence in the vitality, in the lack of alternative of our European project. We need to dispel the doubts of Europeans and reassure them we know where we are heading. Today’s Europe raises more questions than answers. Our citizens demand security in an increasingly more insecure world and ask themselves how we can live in harmony with our neighbours. The balance between rights and responsibilities in European society is an irrevocable part of the answer. We need to show to the outside world, but also to our citizens, that we believe in, and are ready to enhance, our potential. Issues like terrorism, migration, frozen conflicts cannot be handled without treating the root causes – geopolitical frustrations and heavy conflicts. This makes it necessary to strengthen our crisis management structures and enhance the role of strategic planning in European foreign and security policy.  But we need to be realists. Many of our problems have European roots – social exclusion, marginalisation, bad education, ineffective dialogue between religions. This mix of problems creates conditions for radicalisation. Terrorism starts where education fails.  (Applause) Many of the terrorists and foreign terrorist fighters are Europeans. We do not forget our moral obligation to be a land of freedom, human rights for the oppressed and for the endangered. But we also represent rules and values that outline rights, but also responsibilities. Integration and education is a commitment for both host societies and migrants.  Today, it is obvious, more than ever, that without a clear policy and solutions conducted through dialogue, citizens’ fears will be exploited by populists. Without a realistic approach, it would be difficult to parry the speculations that someone wants to build Europe behind the back of the Europeans. Populists and nationalists are forcing us to make a choice – between the values we inherited from the founding fathers and the imperatives of security for our citizens. We choose both! We choose values and security. We see no contradiction between keeping our borders safe and sticking to human rights and freedoms. And we see the difference between nationalists and patriots. A great European president, President de Gaulle, once said: ‘patriots are those who love their country, nationalists are those who hate the different’. Today, more than ever, we need modern patriotism, not aggressive nationalism in Europe. (Applause) Uniformity of principles and all-inclusiveness in the process of integration into the EU is key for the future of our European project. It is clear that national societies are different and have different historically motivated reactions to events. In the diversity of our history and culture lies the richness of Europe. This, however, should not be a cause for changing the nature of the European Project by initiating a ‘two-speed’ or ‘multi-speed Europe’. The equality of European engagement has a direct relevance for our own European identity. Even the suspicion that we can accept Europe to be built on ‘different speeds’ sends a message of doubt for the European Project. It insinuates inequality. It would be a mistake to underestimate the potential for development of some parts of Europe, for example the Balkans. It would be a historic mistake not to support them or leave them to the outside influences from former empires. European nations should not be played against one another, regardless of interest. There can be only one answer: solidarity with those countries that have a longer road ahead of them. Especially in a period of challenges this solidarity should go beyond the instruments of cohesion policy and be a part of every European policy. No matter what the outcome of the UK referendum is, the discussion about Europe’s many speeds will continue. We need to avoid the destructive nature of the discussion about ‘Europe à la carte’. We cannot pick and choose solidarity and turn the EU into a sum of transactional relationships.  (Applause) Because each country has different issues to deal with, ‘zero sum’ games have had terrible – I repeat, terrible – outcomes in the past. We all need just to listen better to our partners. Bulgaria is an example of a middle-sized Member State that turned from a peripheral into a front-line country: Ukraine, Russia, migration. Our borders are Europe’s borders, our neighbours are Europe’s neighbours. We have difficult choices to make, but we never think of sacrificing European solidarity. Because we, Bulgarians, have learned that you cannot change geography, and true European integration can turn the risks of geography into opportunity.  Certainly, European democracies are not perfect. Often, and not without reasons, they are criticised. We are not perfect, but we are better than many others. We cannot convince the Eurosceptics, but we should mobilise the pro—Europeans. I want to make it clear: all predictions for the failure and even disintegration of the European Union are wrong, are false! We have seen many crises in our history. The cure is clear: more solidarity, humanity and empathy. More rule of law. More synergies. More education. More integration. The first democratically elected Bulgarian President, Zhelyu Zhelev, used to say: ‘You can cure democracy only with more democracy’. I am confident that we will tackle the challenges without diminishing our core values. We have done it more than once before. It would be a mistake if some read our tolerance as weakness. On the contrary, it is a clear sign of strength and determination to defend our way of life. The history of the European Union has taught us that in times of hardship only integration works. The only weapon we have to achieve peace, security and human development is integration. Not a single country can cope with the challenges alone. Erecting borders – no matter whether they are territorial, economic or legal – is a tempting, yet temporary and not sustainable solution.  The challenges ahead of us are very serious and we cannot afford to wait, delay or shift the problems to the next government or generation. We need to act, we need to take decisions. Being indifferent is not an option today. We need to address the problems and have a plan how to solve them.  There are many crises. One of them is that today Russia does not support the principles of international order. The Kremlin is opposing us and is trying to destabilise the EU, by bringing mistrust to the very core of our project. It is trying to destroy and bring down the foundations of the European Union, which are unity, solidarity and the rule of law. (Applause) Moscow has initiated a vast propaganda operation in Europe that spreads messages of mistrust, not values. The goal is to undermine the trust of people in the EU. And that is the biggest danger: to erode the trust of Europeans in integration and our common destiny. To open the door for the ghosts from the past – nationalism, populism, Great Powers and spheres of influence, interests that prevail and oppose principles and values.  And it seems like they are succeeding. It looks like we are not making any progress now. We are stuck, we have stopped the only engine we have – integration. We are pulling the brake on enlargement, on Schengen and others. What we need to do is to open the door. Bring fresh air and a new horizon! Turn on our engine of integration! Start new projects of integration! What we need to do is to reaffirm and strengthen the foundations of our order and values, but also adapt and open up to the fast changing world. We need to integrate, not isolate. We need to look ahead, not behind. Europe has a meaningful global role to play and it needs to mobilise, to start new projects of integration.  And we need to make the difference between technique and content. The future of Europe does not depend so much on technique – eurofunds and directives, crisis management and others. The future of Europe depends on the content, on the very core of who we are. And this is the rule of law. The future of Europe depends on not forgetting the big ideas and getting just stuck in technique. Not to lose the big picture. The big question is what our vision for Europe is? How do we add value to the work of the previous generation and to the vision of the founding fathers? I wonder what was in the minds of the founding fathers of the European Union 70 years ago, right after the devastation of the Second World War, when everybody hated everyone in Europe? They knew that peace is only possible when nations get such a level of cooperation that makes future war impossible. And they started to integrate – steel markets, coal markets and others. Their idea was not to weaken the national states, but to make them stronger in a union. Bulgaria was always weak, when it was alone. Bulgaria is strong today as a proud member of the EU and NATO. The very big question is where do we want to be by 2030 or 2050? Of course we will be solving the migration, the banking, the debt and other crises. But is that all? Do we want just to deal with crisis management by jumping from one crisis to another? This is just technique, not a dream or vision. I want us to all continue dreaming and make history as our founding fathers did. I want us to all start new engines of integration – the enlargement process, a more efficient and coordinated common European foreign, defence and security policy, the European Energy Union, the Single Digital Market, the EU Capital Markets Union and others. And let us continue, write and make history and the history of a strong European Union with strong and prosperous Member States. If we forget or do not have a cause any more, someone else will focus on us as a convenient opponent. If we stop making history, somebody else will. As some want to question and destabilise our foundations, let us give a new extra dose of trust in the European Union! Let us give it now and let us give it together!

The reform and extension of the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) is important for two reasons. Firstly, the ITA was the first WTO agreement to massively reduce tariffs, and the innovations in the agreement are very good news for the WTO's multilateral trading system. We know that in some areas there was more of a slumber than a lot of activity. Secondly, the innovations will significantly reduce costs for consumers and businesses and significantly facilitate market access for the European IT industry. The IT industry has developed rapidly over the last 20 years, and that is why it was urgently necessary to modernise an agreement based on 1996. It includes an additional list of IT products whose tariffs are being eliminated – navigation systems, medical devices, satellites, touch screens, and so on. It also includes transition periods of zero to seven years, so that European industry can adapt slowly where necessary. Finally, I would like to say here: the EU exports EUR 189 billion worth of IT products. This sum is covered by the ITA expansion.

Tunisia has managed to go through a period of consolidation, but the macroeconomic situation remains very fragile. For example, the 3% growth projected for 2015 decreased to a slight 0.5%. With the Macro-Financial Assistance Facility (MFA), the European Union aims to provide funds to Tunisia to better overcome economic and regional instability.

In line with the G20 and OECD recommendations on combating tax fraud, the Directive introduces rules to ensure fairer taxation of large firms by targeting precisely the most widely used tax avoidance methods. Today, large multinational supranational firms are able to take advantage of differences between the tax rules of different countries, thus artificially reducing the amount of taxes paid. These practices fundamentally schmoul competition – SMEs do not have the capacity to find holes in tax laws and to set up fictitious subsidiaries in tax havens.

Legally speaking, endocrine disruptors are dealt with in European laws on chemicals, pesticides, water and cosmetics. A major drawback, however, is that endocrine disruptors are not precisely defined in that legislation. In 2015, in its judgment in Sweden v European Commission, the General Court ruled that the European Commission had infringed EU law by not ing a delegated act specifying the criteria for determining the characteristics of endocrine disruptors. Nevertheless, the European Commission has decided to continue the work as planned before the judgment. The resolution thus expresses strong criticism of the European Commission and condemns its failure to function.

Moreover, the European Commission has not exceeded its mandate in this executive action: if the Member States do not achieve a qualified majority, the European Commission is authorised to approve GMOs on the basis of a positive opinion from EFSA. With regard to glyphosate, it is noted that there is no scientific consensus. I recognise the concerns about glyphosate and call for the discussion on this controversial substance to be further and further deseeded.  It remains important to distinguish between GMO technology and application.

Mr President, more than 14 million European citizens live in a Member State different from their home state. In order to marry, to declare the birth of a child, to present a blank criminal record, they are forced to face tedious and sometimes expensive procedures. Indeed, it is not enough to produce an official document of their State of origin, yet it must be accompanied by a stamp issued by an authority - this is called the apostille - to which is added a certified translation and, if necessary, certified copies. Yet free movement is one of the fundamental rights of European citizenship. The need to make European citizenship more concrete was highlighted by the Stockholm programme in 2009. In order to strengthen confidence in the European area of justice, he advocates an action plan which specifically includes the abolition of the apostille. Today, seven years later, we are almost there. The regulation on the simplification of the acceptance of public documents, which we will adopt, is a step - I must say a small step - to alleviate these steps, since it abolishes the apostille for the documents that are covered by this regulation. These are civil registration documents: marriage, partnership, birth, life certificate, death certificate, residence certificate, electoral rights and lack of criminal record. Multilingual forms attached to public documents will be used to assist in translation and allow citizens to save on a certified translation. To mitigate the risk of fraud, the text provides for the use of an IMI platform, which is a system for directly exchanging information between the various authorities. Thus, if an administration has doubts about the authenticity of a document, it can contact the relevant authority directly to verify the veracity of the document. The day the platform works properly, within the allotted time, it will significantly improve fraud detection. The deadline for implementation is two and a half years. It is a long time, but it is necessary for the system to be put in place and for citizens to be informed. Indeed, we have fought in Parliament to impose an obligation on the Member States and the Commission to effectively inform citizens about this new legislation. They must be explicitly informed of the abolition of the apostille as well as the existence of multilingual forms, which are much less expensive than certified translations. Parliament also had to fight to ensure that the cost of these forms did not exceed the cost of production or that of the original document.  I want to emphasize the revision clause in particular. A Commission report will have to report on the application of the regulation, but also consider whether to abolish the apostille for other documents. Although the European Parliament has agreed to this proposal, it is not happy about it. We would have liked to go further and include in the scope a greater number of documents concerning companies, including their legal status, but also common documents such as diplomas, certificates of study, or the status of a person with a disability. Unfortunately, all these ambitions had to be relegated to the background in the revision clause. But I am sure that Parliament will remain vigilant about the application of the regulation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3275, "date": "2016-06-08.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, freedom of movement gives millions of people in the European Union unprecedented opportunities. Cross-border personal and business relationships are thriving: 14 million citizens – and we already had this figure here from Ms Delvaux – reside in a Member State other than their Member State of origin; 13% of all marriages in the Union are international; and 50% of SMEs are engaged in cross-border activities. I expect these numbers to continue rising.  This proposal will make the life of millions of citizens and businesses easier by removing unnecessary and costly red tape. Here we are: after three years of intense negotiations, with your vote tomorrow the Union is about to take another important step. It might not make it to the front pages of the magazines, but many people will breathe a sigh of relief once this regulation enters into force. Today, when people move to another EU country and they want to register a birth, get married, register a house, or apply for a residence card, the national authorities will ask for certified copies, certified translations and rubber stamps such as the apostille. This is time-consuming, costly, and perfectly unnecessary. This is now over for a whole range of life situations and corresponding documents. Based on the principle of mutual trust, the regulation does away with the requirement to authenticate public documents with an apostille and simplifies obligations with regard to certified copies and translations. It also introduces multilingual standard forms to avoid translation requirements and reinforces the fight against false documents by setting up a system of cooperation between Member States. Parliament has been a strong supporter of this regulation from the start. I would like to pay tribute to Mr Rapkay, who gathered a solid majority in first reading under the previous legislature, and wish to thank Ms Delvaux and the shadow rapporteurs who skilfully negotiated the final compromise with the Council. It was not easy; and we have a balanced compromise.  The regulation covers several areas of immediate relevance to most citizens, in particular their civil status. We would all have preferred a broader scope of the regulation, covering additional areas for citizens as well as documents useful to businesses. It is thanks to Parliament’s determination that the regulation provides for an early review of its scope. This early review will allow the Commission to consider the inclusion in the scope of additional areas such as educational records, disabilities, and the legal status and representation of companies.

Today's text of the Regulation is therefore a great success for us as the European Parliament, but it is mostly a great success for our citizens because we will facilitate their free movement by simplifying the adoption of certain public documents in the European Union. This Regulation concerns the abolition of administrative formalities such as legalisation and apostille for documents relating to civil status or those certifying a lack of criminal record issued by another Member State. These simplifications for citizens are offset by the possibility for the administration receiving the document to verify directly and electronically the authenticity of the document. This will also reduce the risk of fraud. The creation of multilingual standard forms for most of the relevant official documents saves citizens efforts, time, means of translation of the document. This also greatly facilitates the movement of citizens in the European Union. I hope that a subsequent revision of the Regulation will extend its scope to more documents, with particular attention to business documents as well as documents relating to the acquisition of qualifications, school and subsequent education.

In this context, it is extremely important to simplify the formalities to which citizens moving abroad are subject.

Without this, the European Union would not have the opportunities it objectively still has before it.

For example, the term ‘parenthood’ dilutes the more precise terms ‘father and mother’. A child’s birth certificate is fundamental to their very identity, and the names of ‘father and mother’ are sacrosanct.  These irreplaceable roles must be respected, as all of us were born of a father and a mother, forming a family unit, which has greater importance even than democratic government in the establishment of other societies.

The European Union is defined mainly by the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital. Today we have a more than acceptable free movement of people within the Union, even if not all Member States are in the Schengen area.  Unfortunately, the administrative obstacles found in the cross-border use and acceptance of official documents have a direct impact on the free movement of citizens. It is necessary to further identify practical tools that facilitate the lives of citizens beyond national borders.  'Unity in diversity' must also be found in the bureaucratic sphere, thus overcoming the language barriers created in the absence of standard forms. Simplification of these procedures responds to the needs and wishes of citizens, while at the same time being an important step towards deepening and strengthening European integration. A gradual approach is needed in starting this process, starting from the testing of a narrower area, such as civil status documents, and then it is mandatory to move towards an extension of the scope. We must be extremely careful, however, because, with the mirage of simplification, we must not neglect the principles of security and legal certainty, which have been the basis for the establishment of legalisation formalities.

Whether we are talking about tourists in need of medical insurance, employees who need to prove the payment of fees, or students who interact with university administration, bureaucratic requirements act as a real brake on European freedoms.

The number of cases brought before the court increased from 398 in 2000 to 912 in 2014. Pending business accumulates year after year. Five appeals based on the breach of the duty to rule within a reasonable time have already been lodged. The total amount claimed amounts to almost 27 million euros, double the cost of implementing the reform. That is why we voted on 28 October 2015 for the Council's proposal to increase the number of judges in the Tribunal to two per Member State, abolish the Public Service Tribunal and include the seven judges of the Public Service Tribunal in the Trial Tribunal.  The regulation we are about to adopt is the second step - in short, the implementation of that decision. Its purpose is to transfer the judges of the Public Service Tribunal and, therefore, all cases pending before that court to the Tribunal. In Parliament, we have ensured consistency in this transfer and ensured the legal certainty of cases pending before the Public Service Tribunal. Thus, the pending cases will be transferred as they are and will remain subject to the same procedure.

That is why it is worth remembering that we are advocating for more cases to be dealt with by chambers of five judges instead of three, and we also want the Tribunal to have specialized chambers.  I would like to remind the Member States that the European Parliament has explicitly voted for gender parity among judges, and therefore reminds Member States today to ensure that this parity is respected in the appointments they are proposing. Mr President, I will be frank, the solution chosen is not the best. I regret that the Member States have not been able to agree on a smaller increase in the number of judges and on a rotation system, but in the face of the Inflexibility of the Council, Parliament has taken its responsibilities.

Furthermore, only one jurisdiction – the Court of Justice will be responsible for ensuring uniform interpretation of the law by hearing all appeals.

We had a political debate about the necessity of this reform last year. At the moment, this is only a consequence of the actions we have carried out, the necessary consequence of the inclusion of the Civil Service Court in the Court of First Instance. The seven judges who have worked so far in the Civil Service Tribunal are judges who will not be the new judges of the Court; they will count in the number of judges already in place, so this change does not generate any additional costs, but brings huge benefits. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, until now, the judges of the Civil Service Court have dealt exclusively with labour matters. They could not be entrusted with other matters, even though these judges were quite often left without an allocation of cases to deal with. The change that we are making, the latter part of the reform, will allow, firstly, the transfer of staff cases to the Court of First Instance – so they are not in danger, they will continue to be settled correctly – and, secondly, the allocation of other cases to judges who will not be dealing with staff matters at any given time, which has so far been impossible. This reform is, of course, necessary because, as Danuta Hübner said, it weighs on the quality of the functioning of the European justice system. I therefore ask the Court itself and the other institutions to remember that it is an important institution for all of us, that this reform will be assessed over the coming years, because it has many opponents.  I therefore hope that the revision clause contained in the regulation will force everyone to properly assess the effectiveness of the Court's work in the coming years, so that in a few years we can say whether we have made the right choices or made the right decisions, or whether we may have made a wrong one.

The increase at that time was made on condition that the Civil Service Tribunal was dissolved and those disputes were referred back to the European Court of Justice.

The report also includes an amendment to the procedural organisation of the Court and its internal organisation, which is to be welcomed.

As I have stressed here and in the Committee on Legal Affairs, there has been a deliberate willingness on the part of the Court to prevent Parliament from being properly informed, and many Members are therefore able to vote in conscience. As I said in my report, specialised courts are more economical and their decisions are of better legal quality. However, the opposite was chosen, that is, the most costly, more inflexible and only reversible solution with a new legislative initiative.  The Court's proposal, which is reverently supmendable by this Parliament, is based on a huge lie. As several Judges of the General Court have warned, the pending cases have virtually ceased to exist, but it has been decided to double the number of its judges, who are technically underemployed and in which there are no cases to be distributed to them, let alone the new judges being appointed.  The number of cases entered so far yesterday is much lower than the number of cases decided and predominantly relates to trade mark issues, which have decreased significantly, and competition, which have almost disappeared due to preventive action by the Commission.

We stand determined in our common fight against terrorism. This is an attack on our open democratic society. This is what we stated on 24 March, two days after the Brussels attacks, at an extraordinary meeting of the Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs. Here, Ministers underlined the urgent need to increase the systematic feeding and consistent use of our different databases and their interoperability. Improving the information exchange and the interoperability of the European Union’s information systems has been a key topic for our Presidency and was cemented in the joint statement on 24 March. Besides the enormous importance of collecting information, it is of equal importance to connect the dots – that is often forgotten – and to make the best use of the information we have. This is why the Presidency has taken up the initiative of developing a roadmap on information exchange and information management, which will be submitted to the Council this Friday. This roadmap provides a coherent framework for a more integrated European Union information architecture in the justice and home affairs area. It lists a number of key challenges in information exchange, as well as principles and guidelines to be followed. The first of these principles is, of course, full respect for fundamental rights and data protection rules, which are the core values of our citizens. The roadmap contains practical, short and medium-term points with which  action can be undertaken quickly, as well as long-term orientations to enhance information management and information exchange in three domains: first, law enforcement, including judicial cooperation in criminal matters; second, detection of persons involved in terrorism and terrorism-related activity and their travel movements; and, third, border management and migration. The essence of the roadmap is to make sure that the practitioners have access to the information they need. I think this is a very important point.  The politics of all this is in its practical operationality – I mean the police officer in an urban neighbourhood, the border guard at a checkpoint or the immigration officer dealing with a visa application. They have to connect the dots; they have to understand what kind of information they get, how they can get it, where they can get it and how it is in real time. They can do their work best when they have access to high-quality systems with high-quality information that can facilitate their task. We are very well aware of the fact that this is only one part of the process. An equally important part relates to the communication on stronger and smarter IT systems that the Commission presented on 6 April. The High-Level Expert Group which the Commission announced in this communication will play an important role in developing a more long-term view for the future of the information systems and databases of the European Union.  The Presidency attaches the highest importance to working closely with the European Parliament on these issues. Your role as co-legislator will be crucial when addressing some of the challenges lying ahead, particularly, of course, when legislative changes are required to achieve our common objective. I can also inform you that the Council, at its meeting on 10 June will again address the Member States’ feeding and use of the databases, such as the SIS, VIS, Europol and Interpol databases, on the basis of a report by the counter-terrorism coordinator. We have to feed and use the information systems to the maximum extent since this is a condition sine qua non for an efficient sharing of information.  There has been very substantial progress over the past year and we will continue to strive for further improvement as soon as possible. In this way, we will be able to continuously improve our information exchange. The quality of information is as important as the quantity. The information that we store, share and use is information about citizens, so it needs to be protected. Citizens have to be confident that this information is used and shared on the basis of proportionality and only for well-described limited purposes. We need to protect our societies but we need to do so without becoming Big Brother. That is the big challenge. In fighting terrorism, we need to uphold our values.

Here is what we needed to look for in the Union, in our Union. The unity of the Union. Unity for our security. This is the crucial challenge facing all of us, because our most important duty is to ensure the security of our citizens. In today’s security environment, strength equals information and knowledge. In fact, the capacity to both share and make smart use of information. Information sharing is our only effective weapon against asymmetric and unpredictable threats, and limiting information in our national boxes does not provide security. It is exactly the opposite. The recent tragic events in Brussels and Paris showed again Europe’s major weakness in fighting terrorism. First among them: our information sharing. I am sure you will agree on that. The architecture of our systems for borders and security needs to improve. Sharing information is the strongest example of trust between us. It is not about reinventing the wheel, either. Plenty of tools to exchange information effectively are already in place. Let me give you an example. The Prüm framework. This is potentially a powerful tool against crime, because it automatically compares DNA, fingerprints and vehicle data. But Prüm is only as useful as the amount of information we put in it. It is only as helpful as the number of Member States connected to it. Implementation in practice remains poor. We are using our powers under the Treaties to get better results, but we all need to understand the importance of implementing what we agree, without going to the courts. That is why we presented our vision on Stronger and Smarter Information Systems for Borders and Security already in April, because we saw these problems and we saw the need to bring change, both practically and structurally. First, it is clear that some systems do not work as well as they should. The Schengen Information System contains only names, not fingerprints. Persons with fraudulent documents can go through it quite easily. A fingerprint functionality will be developed urgently in the coming months. Second, there are information gaps which are not covered by any system. We have third-country nationals who do not need visas. When not traveling by air, there is no information about them before they arrive. An EU travel information and authorisation system will be proposed to close this gap. Third, our information landscape is complex and fragmented. Border guards and police officers cannot consult multiple EU systems at the same time. Not all Member States are connected to all systems. Information is stored separately in various unconnected systems. This fragmentation makes us vulnerable. To be useful, our data systems must be interoperable and interconnected. The Entry/Exit System we proposed in April is interconnected and interoperable with the Visa Information System. What we want for the future is to have a common repository of data for different information systems, which will contain all the basic data. Other, more thematic systems, such as the Visa Information System, would be connected to it, with all necessary safeguards for the protection of personal data. All this is not to say that information sharing should improve at the expense of fundamental rights: freedom and security are two sides of the same coin. You cannot have freedom without security. We are now in the final stages of establishing an expert group to look at different options on interoperability. The group will meet this month for the first time, and we will work to give us policy input for decisions next year. We have already invited the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) to work with the experts in this process. Our expert group will work in coordination with the interoperability roadmap of the Council. Let me close by saying that it will be our clear priority in the next 12 months. We will continue to put emphasis on implementation and where there are structural information gaps, we will address them decisively, and with a clear vision to improve the security of our citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3331, "date": "2016-06-08.json", "name": "Monika Hohlmeier", "mepid": "96780", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his work and for the work she has First of all, thank you very much for this debate.

On the one hand, there are shortcomings on the part of the Member States in ensuring that effective data exchange is carried out and that the measures of mutual trust actually bring together the relevant data. I also believe that Europol's capacity must be stepped up in order to be able to act in a united and united manner in bringing together information and analysing it. The quality of information plays a major role in particular. But there is also a task on the part of this House, which is brought to us by Member States, namely that law enforcement authorities must have access to EURODAC and, conversely, that Frontex and border authorities must have access to SIS and the dangerous file, so that we can identify terrorists who use or abuse the migration stream at an appropriate early stage. I would also ask colleagues to bear in mind at ECRIS that fingerprints create the possibility of actually identifying them, and if there is no possibility of identifying the fingerprints, it means that you are severely disabled in exchange and have great difficulties.

Similarly, we have always faced terrorist threats in Europe. For decades, we have lived with terrorism in Spain, Ireland, elsewhere. Recently, threats have come from the outside. But the first phenomenon is not the result of the second and vice versa, which many people like to convince. That is also why I am concerned about this Commission's plan on the future of information systems, which it has presented, in fact, together with the smart borders proposal. The Commission wants to address new threats and challenges by combining databases and building a kind of 'big brother'. The number of passengers will increase sharply in the future. Probably the number of threats, too. Technology will advance, and criminals are likely to be one step ahead of it. The dangers must, of course, be combated, and we must be able to identify and prevent potential threats. But we're not going to do that by setting up new super databases. First of all, it is necessary to thoroughly assess existing systems and to remedy any shortcomings. Above all, their use needs to be improved. The spread of already known information is going down sharply. We have also been taught this by the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, in Brussels. We in Parliament have repeatedly called for the exchange of information to be essential. I am by no means opposed to new effective solutions in the field of information technology. But only when you protect your personal information. We must treat the suspect of a criminal act and a normal tourist very differently, as well as their personal data. Our intention is not to prevent the work of judicial and security authorities, but we cannot in any way agree to completely unrestricted and systematic access to everyone's personal data.

We must prevent attacks from continuing to plague Europe. We must prevent governments from having no choice but to close their borders, as the only way to keep criminals out of Europe. We must prevent the public from losing all confidence.  This matter must therefore be taken decisively. A change in mentality at Member State level is required. Yes, security is their competence, but information must be exchanged. Not in bulk, because then it will be for the police forces even to look for a needle in a haystack. But concrete hits must be effectively shared between like-minded intelligence agencies. We need to make the most of existing databases such as the SIS system, which can be used to identify people and goods as detectable. Europol, the EU agency in which a specialised counter-terrorism unit has recently been active, must also be at the heart of this. Belgium is one of the best pupils in the class in this respect, but other Member States are less industrious.  I also welcome the various new initiatives. The ECRIS initiative, for example, which is currently working on a database of convicted foreigners. I can also refer to the reform of Europol, which integrated the Internet cell into regular operation. Together with private ICT partners, the cell is trying to detect and remove jihadist content online. In the context of the creation of the European Border and Coast Guard, too, we are now paying particular attention to access to databases.

I thought this is wonderful; finally we are going to talk about something that we have been calling for a long time: data sharing. This is long overdue because there have been so many examples of terrorist attacks where we found out after the attacks that the information was available, but it had not been shared.  But if I look more closely at what is on the table today, I am actually very disappointed because I get the impression that this is not about more information sharing, this is about collecting more personal data. There is a big difference between mandatory information sharing of vital information and leaving it to the Member States’ discretion whether or not they will share information.  We can have a communication about interoperability, but that is the technical side of things. If the political will is still not there to share vital information, not between two friendly EU Member States, but throughout the European Union, then we are not making any progress here, and then this is all just technical. I get the feeling that the political will is still not there.  Then, I also wonder what are we actually talking about?  I am very curious what will be in this roadmap and it would have been very practical for this debate if we had had the text of the roadmap beforehand. Now maybe I have overlooked it, but it would have been very good to have the text beforehand, because now we do not know what we are actually talking about it. Is this about connecting databases? Is this about collecting more data? Is it only about travel data as some people seem to assume? Why not? Other police information that is probably more useful actually for fighting terrorism? Who is going to provide oversight, not only on the data protection issues, but also in terms of effectiveness? So actually I have lost my optimism on seeing the title.

Madam President, improving data exchange is an essential element in the fight against terrorism. The transnational dimension of the most serious crimes requires greater cooperation in this area and more efficient use of European databases, while ensuring respect for fundamental rights, particularly in data protection. In this regard, the principle of limiting purpose is very important: a database that is used for a specific purpose should not be suddenly used for other purposes. For example, the Schengen information system contains data on innocent people, such as missing persons, who should not be interconnected with terrorism-related databases, since there is no link between the two. If we take the lead in the direction of greater interoperability of European databases, it is essential to also provide a harmonised framework for data protection. The two are and must be linked. This is necessary to avoid fragmentation, as the new Police Data Protection Directive does not cover the databases discussed here, such as the Schengen Information System. The establishment of a common set of data protection rules must therefore be an integral part of this path towards greater interoperability.

Of course, in the United Kingdom, a lot of the debate on the European Union at the moment – as you know, we have a referendum coming up on June – is focussing on matters of security. We are being told by the Remain campaign that somehow Britain would not be secure if we were to leave the European Union. Of course we get most of our information on international terrorism in the UK from the Five Eyes Alliance, which doesn’t require political union or the handing—over of sovereignty. We also participate in Interpol, which has 190 members and was established long before Europol, just adding to the fact that NATO has kept the peace in Europe since 1945. They also lead on counter—terrorism and have a centre of excellence, focusing on cyber—crime, in Estonia. But having said all of that, of course, we in the UK want to continue to work together with our neighbours and friends across Europe. This is not a debate about Brexit in the UK or to say that the UK wants to be some kind of ‘little England’ separated from the continent; rather we want to be a United Kingdom that takes its place in the wider world, but continues to be good friends and good neighbours with Europe. So of course a post—Brexit UK would continue to want to be good friends and good neighbours with Europe and to share data, perhaps, in the right way.

Madam President, since the European Union and third countries also operate as a single area of free movement of persons, it makes sense for all kinds of illegals and criminals, from terrorists to arms and drug traffickers, to exploit the structural weaknesses of the Schengen Treaty for the benefit of their activities. In addition, problematic cooperation between police authorities in the various countries of Europe creates even more gaps and opportunities for all those who have such purposes. The exchange of information and data under certain conditions could improve the situation somewhat, but unfortunately there are also many questions and negative aspects here. First of all, the exchange of data alone does not solve the problem, since the problems of competence and jurisdiction of the services, the different legal framework of each country and the inability to coordinate and use information at pan-European level remain unresolved.  But even if we were to establish a single European police force, perhaps in the long run we would create more problems than we would solve. One of the main problems is that there is no reliable authority to control how data and information collected are used. Who's going to take on this role? Even if the Commission took on this role, it does not in fact have any democratic legitimacy for this. Recent incidents have shown us that even state authorities are willing to make the information they collect available to third parties or to use this data for political persecution of their ideological opponents.

I welcome the fact that the Council and the Commission are expressing their views on this, but also national parliaments, such as the German Bundestag, which is dealing with this issue at the same time today. The idea is not to create new intelligence services and investigative authorities, but to network existing databases, i.e. to make them interoperable. There is no objection to this, quite the contrary. One could criticise the fact that this is only now happening. But one should not expect a) the solution of all problems, as if it were a miracle machine, and b) one should also see the problems associated with it. I see three major problems. It can lead to completely new problems if the application is not in line with the case law of the ECJ, is not in conformity with fundamental rights and does not comply with the principles of data protection. Just as we have given the data protection officers a key role in Europol, so must the linkage of these databases. Secondly, we should also consider whether there are already instruments that are not being used, for whatever reason, such as the decision of the Minister of justice in 2005 on the mandatory exchange of information in the event of terrorist offences. So, before we do something new, we need an inventory of existing instruments, and we have to ask ourselves why this is not being applied. There must be reasons for this, and this should also be taken into account in our analyses. I also believe that it is not enough to rely on the mere networking of databases to solve the problem. This is blue-eyed. Not only does it need machine intelligence, but it also needs personnel, it also needs human intelligence, and that, it seems to me, is one of the very important things that joint investigation teams, such as those that exist within Europol, should be developed in order to solve the problem proactively.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3343, "date": "2016-06-08.json", "name": "Monica Macovei (ECR).", "mepid": "96824", "text": "   – Madam President, the right to life comes first.

This too, and we are finally beginning to be aware of this, is a phenomenon of transnational crime sometimes linked to terrorism or to the most serious crimes, such as trafficking in human beings, and for which only full cross-border cooperation between law enforcement authorities can make the fight against trafficking effective. After the tragic terrorist incidents in Europe, we have sadly learned one lesson: the exchange of information between national authorities has not worked. We learned later that in some cases those responsible for these crimes were already known in some Member States. Of course, we are not here today and this is not the place to understand what has not worked, but we are here to provide adequate answers to the threat of terrorism and the most serious cross-border crimes. This House recently approved the new Europol regulation and the PNR directive, which is also to be used to prevent and combat international terrorism. The revision of the ECRIS system is also to be welcomed in this respect.

Therefore information exchange and the feeding of the databases have been a major priority for the Presidency in the Justice and Home Affairs field. As I mentioned in the first round, that is not so easy because you have to do it on the basis of trust, interoperability and also filling the databases in a way that is immediately concrete for the people who work in law enforcement and intelligence agencies, who are in border control, and who are related to crime and therefore often the relationships that we see between crime and terror. Terrorism is not primarily defeated by bombs and bullets. We know that. It is also the effective and legitimate use of bytes and data that allows us to identify terrorist networks, to detect their plans and to uproot them at an early stage. So that information is vital to protect our societies and citizens. We have of course very often called for improving information sharing, feeding and using the databases in the way that I just mentioned. Figures are available, for instance in the EU CTC’s latest report. We know now that unprecedented levels of information have been shared with the taskforce, Fraternité, which was established at Europol in December 2015. Fortunately – and also importantly – we have made significant progress in recent years in terms of feeding and consulting databases, as is for example shown by the latest report from eu-LISA for 2015. However, I agree with you that we need to further increase every day our efforts for a better exchange of information and interoperability of databases. Yes, to a certain extent that is technical work, but technical work that cannot function without political leadership and trust. That is the reality: the better feeding and use of databases is crucial, in particular SIS, the database ‘Focal Point Travellers’ at Europol. This can be improved immediately without any legislative change. I am convinced that trust and recognition of the operational added value of sharing information between Member States and with Europol or Eurojust are fundamental factors for success. That has to become in reality more and more constraining for the Member States. We do this through the different parameters that have been mentioned. I will not go into the techniques of it, but obviously it has to do with very important issues like sharing biometric matching services, a common repository of data for different information systems, and the like. It is also key that we think through what it means if you have such a system and you believe in fundamental rights and privacy. We have to uphold our values also in fighting terrorism. Therefore full compliance with fundamental rights and data protection rules is a precondition for the way we manage and share that information for law enforcement. On 28 April the European Union Data Protection Package was formally adopted by the co-legislators, and now it has to be implemented and will require measures to ensure clarity, guidance and workable solutions for the day-to-day work of what I just mentioned, the practitioners and the interoperability. Sharing expertise, experiences and practices internationally will facilitate a practical and more uniform support for practitioners when implementing and applying data protection requirements.

Above all, however, the self-motivated domestic politically motivated actions of some European governments whose sole purpose is to control their own populations, limit their democratic rights and infight anti-foreigners. These are primarily the ringleaders of the policy of blocking joint EU action, The Hungarian Orban, and the polish right-wing government that followed him. This is evidenced by the constitutional amendment adopted in the Hungarian Parliament under the pretext of 'fight against terrorism', which contains restrictive legislation, and by the polish government's plan to introduce a similar package of laws.

I would also like to take the opportunity to thank the European Parliament for its strong support for our comprehensive agenda with Turkey as stated in the resolution of the 2015 report on Turkey which was adopted only in April. The European Union has demonstrated its willingness to re-energise relations with Turkey across the board, based on our firm principles and criteria. We have delivered on our side in terms of political engagement, high-level dialogues on energy, foreign policy, security and counter-terrorism, economy and trade. In terms of financial support – I am talking about the facility for refugees we have made necessary for the agreed support – so far more than EUR 250 million has been committed, more than EUR 100 million already paid: this gives refugees a perspective and alleviates migratory pressures. And we have worked towards visa-free travel on the basis of the well-known benchmarks, benchmarks which are well known since 2013 and have not changed. This re-energised engagement with Turkey is not a one-way street, it is based on joint interests and pursued through an open, constructive dialogue, and it must be viewed in a wider, regional context, including the very serious developments in Syria. Turkey remains a key partner in managing migration. Turkey indeed has done much to help refugees in need of protection, shelter, food and healthcare. But at the same time this is not a blank cheque, there are number of serious developments affecting the rule of law and fundamental freedoms in Turkey as well as the situation in the southeast of Turkey. We have been very clear about these issues in the Commission’s 2015 report on Turkey, as have you, here, in the European Parliament’s resolution. The Commission is seriously concerned about the Turkish Parliament’s recent decision to permit the lifting of parliamentary immunity from prosecution for a large number of members of Parliament. High Representative and Vice-President Mogherini and I jointly made clear in our statement of 20 May that immunity must apply to all, on a non-discriminatory basis. This is the Commission’s clear and consistent position. Any decisions on lifting immunity must be based on the merits of each specific case, according to transparent criteria not subject to political considerations. The Commission has repeatedly stressed that overall the framework for parliamentary immunity should include specific and objective criteria for taking decisions on lifting immunity as is the case in probably all our parliaments within the European Union. We have also systematically highlighted the problematic interpretation of the legal framework, and the constitution in particular, which continue to pose a risk to the freedom of expression of members of parliament in Turkey. Let me also underline that any alleged wrong-doing or alleged crimes committed by MPs must be subject to due process. The right to a fair trial is fundamental to the rule of law and key to ensuring public confidence in the judiciary. It is the responsibility of the relevant political and judicial authorities in Turkey to ensure that this right is respected, not just for the people concerned but for the broader stability of the country. The rule of law is the very basis for Turkey’s political and economic progress. The Commission will therefore continue to follow this particular issue very closely. We will also raise these important matters in our upcoming high-level contacts with Turkey and we renew our call on the Turkish Government to generally re-engage in reforms in line with European standards. In support of these reform efforts the Commission is currently working at an accelerated pace on preparatory documents for Chapters 23 and 24, of course without prejudice to the positions of Member States in accordance with the existing rules. We believe that defining benchmarks in the key areas of the judiciary and fundamental rights and justice, freedom and security is the best lever to convince Turkey to carry on the work and realise its stated goal to move closer to the European Union. Therefore I am grateful for the strong support of this House in this endeavour.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3379, "date": "2016-06-08.json", "name": "Cristian Dan Preda", "mepid": "96838", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Mr President, lifting a Member's immunity is not an exceptional thing for a Parliament. Every legislative chamber does it, we do it here in Strasbourg as well. But lifting the immunity of 138 deputies is something that is out of the ordinary and it is all the more exceptional because, for the most part, these deputies come from a single party, the Kurds, who oppose Ankara. There is doubt, not only because of the collective nature of this decision, but also because of the impact on the representation of Turkish citizens.

Another attack took place in Midyat today. I strongly condemn these attacks and I would like to express my sincere condolences to the families of the victims. No justification can be given for these horrendous attacks, but investments must be made in finding a just and durable solution to the Kurdish question. This is very much in the interest of both Turkey and its citizens who live in the south-east of the country.  Here in Parliament we are concerned about the decision of the Turkish Parliament to lift the immunity of one quarter of its members, a move clearly targeted against the opposition party HDP. At such a critical moment, taking away the political representation of many people living in the south-east of Turkey is a wrong move, not because we believe politicians should be immune to prosecution, not because we do not understand that Turkey faces a serious threat from terrorism, but because it is against all democratic principles to silence opponents simply for their political views, no matter how much you dislike them or disagree with them. If not even in the democratically elected parliament, can there be any place left where opposing political views are tolerated?  Mistakes have been made on all sides. Many who saw pictures of HDP deputies attending funerals of PKK terrorists were hurt, and many others were hurt when they saw that curfews did not cause any outcry from the west of the country, and these grievances are understandable, but the only way to overcome this divide is by looking forward. A parliament in exile is not the solution to anything, and nor are military operations. Moreover, the current events could also have a negative effect on EU/Turkey relations. Seeing court cases in the coming weeks whereby democratically elected members of parliament are disappearing behind bars, based on a highly controversial Turkish anti-terrorism legislation, will certainly jeopardise visa-free travel to the EU for Turkish citizens. We will not accept that journalists, academics and members of parliament are thrown into jail for using their right of freedom of expression.  The EU should stand ready to contribute positively to the restart of a peace process, but this process must start in Turkey. The House of People’s Representatives would be a logical place for that.

But the idea that we, as a Parliament, would waive the immunity of more than 100 Members for alleged offences ranging from petty grotestres to the most serious accusations – this idea is completely absurd. No parliament in the world does such a thing. It is really more than surprising that the Turkish Grand National Assembly has decided to take this step. On this occasion, I have looked again at the Copenhagen criteria. Turkey is, after all, a country that officially still has the right route to become a full member of the European Union. The first Copenhagen criterion under Eur-lex is 'institutional stability for democratic and constitutional order, respect for human rights and respect for and protection of minorities'. If a Parliament makes itself virtually incapable of working, at least it is no longer democratically representative by waiving the immunity of 138 Members, then there is certainly no mention here of institutional stability. There is also no question of protecting minorities here, because, of course, the measures are primarily directed against the Kurdish minority. It is clear to parliamentary democracies that those who are legally elected must also be able to exercise their mandate legally. This means freedom from fear, freedom from intimidation, freedom from arbitrary legal persecution. If we look at the other institutions in Turkey, we will see, for example, in the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors that the International Court of Justice has established that it has now been politicised – there is no longer any mention of independent justice. Let us look at the action against the press – against the Doan Group, against the journalists of Cumhuriyet. Let us look at the action against the trade unions when they want to hold their May rally in Taksim Square – where is the freedom of assembly? But social groups such as the Hizmet movement are also under pressure. The military has been restricted by Ergenekon and Balyoz by the procedures in a way that is not constitutional. Now it is the Kurds, now it is massive action being taken against this Kurdish minority, against its political representation, the HDP, and we must ask a question in the interests of the Turks: is the security situation in the country getting better?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which she has been rapporteur for her excellent report It is now exactly one year since the HDP celebrated an electoral success on 7 June last year. And it is precisely on 7 June that Erdogan signed the law that removes the immunity of Members from the Turkish Parliament. I no longer consider this to be just a formal act by the President, but a very deliberate step towards moving towards a presidential system, an autocratic system. The AKP-dominated parliament is practically abusing its own power and disempowering itself, harming Turkish democracy. However, this law also has an impact on how Members can or cannot fulfil their responsibilities. We are stunned that, in the 21st century, it is possible in Europe to create a climate of fear and intimidation in such a way. This is not only directed against HDP MPs. If I already imagine the absurdity of Erdogan now asking for blood tests to be carried out on members of the Bundestag of Turkish origin because of the acceptance of a statement or a resolution in the German Bundestag, or that it has just become known that complaints are being prepared against members of the Bundestag who have agreed to such a declaration, then I can only say that Erdogan is waging a fight against Members who use the right to freedom of expression in Parliament. And if what Erdogan wants to be applied here in the European Parliament, I would say that at least three quarters of the Members here would be deprived of immunity: because this is an attack on the freedom of speech and, above all, the responsibility of Members to represent themselves. I would also like to point out that among the Members – more than 50 complaints have been made against the 59 HDP Members – there are also two, which we are very well aware of here in Parliament: Leyla Zana, who has been awarded the Sakharov Prize by us, precisely because of the misconduct and because she has exercised her right to freedom of expression in Parliament, and Feleknas Uca, a Yazidi woman who has been a Member of Parliament here for ten years, who has learned the democratic craft here and now has seven cases pending alone.

You can be imprisoned for your opinions. Despite the threshold, the HDP, which brings together various minority groups – the Greens and a number of democratic groupings – managed to enter the Turkish Parliament by a large margin in June last year, but also later in the re-election, albeit with fewer seats and after a dirty election campaign. In Parliament's response to the Commission's progress report on Turkey, we write on the elections: 'Parliament condemns ... the threats and harassment of the media and discrimination against opposition parties in pre-election reporting, the atmosphere of violence and intimidation, which was mainly marked by attacks on individual candidates and the offices of opposition parties, in particular the People's Democratic Party (HDP) and the strong political polarisation'. On 20 May this year, the Turkish Parliament approved a proposal allowing members to be prosecuted and punished. In essence, it is directed against the HDP and, in essence, it will probably be a violation of Turkish terror legislation. It is the same law that is the major stumbling block when we discuss visa facilitation for Turkey, the law that is so markedly different from how we in europe view terrorism, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press and which I ask how many of us who have openly criticised the Turkish President would suffer if we were Turkish citizens, living in Turkey. How many of us wouldn't have signed the academic petition? But even the accused of corruption get their immunity lifted. Why doesn't the same apply to members of the government or to the president himself? After all, the issue of corruption is another of the stumbling blocks that Turkey has in reaching the visa facilitation criteria. In this case too, the European Parliament has expressed concern in its report. This is how we write: 'The European Parliament reiterates its concern about the anti-terror law. In particular, its broad and extremely vague definition of terrorism, organised crime and propaganda, which makes it completely impossible to establish the exact nature of these crimes'. We also write: 'Regrets the distortion of the course of justice in favour of some politicians, which became an everyday occurrence in Turkey following the corruption scandal in 2013'. The president wants to change the Constitution and gain more power. The president wants to tighten the anti-terror law even further.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which The debate has clearly shown that we all have a common view here – at least as far as the unacceptable of this decision to collectively deprive 138 Members of immunity is unacceptable. There is no ifs and buts, this is unacceptable under the rule of law, it must be condemned and contrary to all democratic rule of law practices. I myself was a member of a parliamentary immunity committee for many years. I know what I am talking about in this context. Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, whether we like it or not – and we must do so – we must take note of the fact that Turkey is geographically where it is. Turkey is, after Russia and, together with Egypt, the country with the most people in our immediate neighbourhood – 90 million – and they are geographically located where they are. That is why, as the European Union, as leaders, we, as officials, must engage with our neighbours and address the issues that need to be addressed. In the context of the refugee and migration crisis, we have had a need to engage more closely with Turkey. There are also other areas which have made it necessary to cooperate more closely with the candidate country, Turkey. That is why the action plan emerged, and the action plan covers several areas. One area is precisely the question of how to deal. How do we support Turkey in dealing with the refugee crisis? I think that for the longest time there has been a common view that a country that hosts so many refugees, as well as other countries in the region, is entitled to receive appropriate support. On the other hand, there has also been a commitment in this action plan to speed up the accession negotiations, to give them new energy, and to push ahead with visa liberalisation. If, personally, nothing has escaped me, then that has always been Turkey's ambition. Turkey wants to become a member of the European Union, not Europe wants to become a member of Turkey. And Turkey wants visa liberalisation for Turks who want to go to Europe. So, if that is the wish, then we will deal with it. But there are conditions here. And if these conditions are not met, then things do not happen. That is the state of play. I see it, as do many of you, that Turkey, although there are always these statements of becoming a member of the European Union, is moving in a completely different direction. I would like to see a clear statement from President Erdogan – and he is probably the most important in this country – whether they are serious about us or not. In the end, it is also a pity for the amount of time we invest here. We are ready, but only on European terms. The rule of law is non-negotiable, there is no Turkish version of democracy, there is only a uniform view and view of democratic rules of the game, as we operate in Europe, for example, also within the Member States of the European Union. Europe – neither you nor I, no one – need not be afraid of President Erdogan or others. We are going our way, we have our convictions, our principles, and we are interested in good neighbourly relations, but we must act accordingly. And these are the Commission's convictions and principles. Rest assured that we are not giving in for a moment on any issue.

Let me start by saying that the Council shares these concerns. There is clearly a need to take steps to improve our trade defence instruments in order to tackle unfair trade practices and distortions of competition, as well as to ensure a level playing field for European Union companies. Last month, during our debate regarding the market economy status for China, we also addressed the issue of modernisation of the European Union’s trade defence instruments. As we indicated on that occasion, the Council has restarted technical discussions on the Commission’s 2013 proposal and, although these discussions are still at a preliminary stage, it is worth noting that Member States recognise the need for the modernisation of our trade defence instruments also in the context of the current situation of global overcapacity across industrial sectors, in particular steel. At the Council of 13 May, Trade Ministers had a debate on the Commission’s latest ideas on how to strengthen the European Union’s trade defence instruments, taking into account possibilities of accelerating anti-dumping procedures and changing the methodology of calculating profit margins. The debate clearly confirmed that there is an urgent need for progress on this legislative file. All delegations stress the need for the modernisation of the European Union’s Trade Defence Instruments. But let me also be very honest. The Council is divided – as is this House – on certain elements and particularly on the disapplication of the Lesser Duty Rule. This is the main sticking point in the reform of our trade defence. Many Member States are happy with maintaining the Lesser Duty Rule. They feel that we have adequate anti-dumping instruments at our disposal. However, other Member States feel that more forceful measures are needed and that a relaxation of the Lesser Duty Rule is necessary in order to protect European industry against aggressive trade practices. In the current crisis facing the European Union’s steel industry, the European Union has already been robustly applying existing trade defence instruments, such as renewing anti-dumping duties and applying new measures for certain categories of steel products, investigating anti-subsidy action, launching new investigations and taking pre-emptive action such as the new steel prior surveillance scheme. Work will continue at a technical level in the relevant Council working party with a view to taking action at political level as soon as we can. However, it is still too early to say which of the ideas put forward by the Commission, as well as by some Member States, will ultimately be acceptable for the Council. Please rest assured that, as the Presidency, we will spare no effort to facilitate a compromise within the Council. It is clear that the modernisation of the European Union’s trade defence instruments is linked to the granting of market economy status to China, an issue which is of unprecedented political significance for the European Union. The question of market economy status for China was also considered at the G7 summit in Ise-Shima. Although the leaders’ declaration refrained from mentioning China by name, the G7 recognised the negative impact of global access capacity across industrial sectors, especially steel, on our economies, trade and workers. The Council has not yet taken a decision on the issue of whether it is important, or whether to grant market economy status to China, as the right to initiate legislation belongs to the Commission. We are therefore looking forward to the Commission proposal. The current discussion on trade defence also reveals the growing concern in our societies regarding trade liberalisation. We need to take this seriously and address these concerns. For instance, we need to ensure that the benefits of the global economy are widely shared. This includes countering unfair trade practices, while fighting protectionism and making the argument for trade as a means to create economic opportunities for workers, consumers and companies. Trade needs to be both open and fair. While being tough on trade defence, we therefore need to engage China in a discussion on the global economy and its place in it, in particular now that it holds the chair of the G20. This includes interacting with China on a strategic level to deal with the issues of overcapacity and its consequences.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3430, "date": "2016-06-08.json", "name": "Daniel Caspary", "mepid": "28219", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the Minister, I was very curious to see what arguments the Council used to justify the delay, inaction and irresponsibility of recent months and years.

These protective instruments can tempt politicians to eliminate foreign competition. However, they are necessary when cut-throat competition threatens, and that is on the table here. Then competitive companies will actually be forced out of the market and competition will be restricted. The Commission and the Council seem to have difficulties with anti-subsidy measures. I would like to make the following three requests to the Commission and the Council: it often takes a long, very long time for these anti-subsidy measures to enter into force. This period is too long. The Commission and the Council must become more efficient and faster. However, in order to take credible action against subsidies itself, the EU must stop subsidising itself on a large scale, for example in the area of agriculture.

On substance, our Group would call for a liberal approach favouring trade and promoting its further liberalisation. On the other hand, we need to be able to make use of a variety of suitable instruments which would provide the EU economies and their sensitive industries with relevant and efficient levels of protection against unfair practices. We need to be able to react when it is obvious that goods coming from a third country are not offered under regular market conditions, that prices are either dumped or artificially subsidised. While discussing the revising of our trade defence instruments, we should continue to follow WTO provisions which are per se non-protectionist. We should therefore continue where appropriate with the application of measures such as the lesser duty rule. On the instruments themselves, there are potential areas we can cover without bypassing the WTO framework and where we can truly help EU businesses, especially small and medium-sized ones. We should, for instance, try to shorten deadlines in anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations. We should further investigate possibilities of using alternative methods in calculations of trade defence measures while taking into account special conditions of the third country market or while evaluating the level of damage to domestic industry.

It is precisely in view of the many disputes with China that negotiations have been successful in recent years. However, I would like to point out something else: the new global value chains require a new international understanding from us: what is to be defined as dumping, what can and should still have a real effect on national and regional defence of interests? It is precisely the large transnational companies, but also their suppliers in the SME sector, that will have to take much greater account of production conditions in the international context in the future. This includes the interests and conditions of employees as well as the impact on the environment.

And indeed, would it even change anything because the EU anti-dumping rules are very much based on the WTO anti-dumping rules. And you know what, I agree to an extent with my north-east colleague, Jude Kirton Darling, who said that we have been far too slow.  But you know what? If the UK had the power to deal with these things ourselves straight away, we could not hide behind the European Council. We could not hide behind anything that is happening here. We would be able to take a decision straightforwardly and immediately for ourselves, rather than have to negotiate a position with 27 other countries, and actually the UK is going in a slightly different direction. America dealt with this very quickly. It slapped a huge tariff on imported steel and it was able to protect its industries. We should have been able to do the same.  If we were an independent, self-governing nation again in the United Kingdom, one of two things would happen – either the Conservative Government would take action, it would protect our industry, it would put on those tariffs for itself and we would save those jobs in the UK. Or the government would sit on its hands, refuse to help its own industry, in which case we could jolly well vote them back out again in a couple of years’ time at the next general election.

However, what is happening in practice is far from these objectives. Instead of promoting a fair international trading system, the World Trade Organisation is doing nothing to stop inequalities in international trade.  It is therefore necessary for the European Union's trade defence instruments to effectively activate and protect the interests of producers from unfair commercial practices and not to operate in accordance with the interests and speculation of multinational companies, achieved through imbalanced trade relations.

I think it is a very important signal also for the Council and for the Presidency work and I will come back to that in a second because I do understand very much the sense of urgency, not only for the people, the workers, in Europe, but also because we have a time limit because of some aspects that you mentioned regarding the WTO.  First of all, let me also say that I do not think it is a debate here between free traders or fair traders or protectionists. I think we all share the concerns regarding the issue of the strengthening of our trade defence instruments in order to tackle unfair trade practices and distortions of competition, as well as to ensure a global level playing field for the European Union. So the signal from this Parliament is very clear and I definitely take note of it and we will benefit from it at the Presidency of the European Union. Secondly, let me also say that, at the Council of 13 May, Trade Ministers had a debate on the Commission’s latest ideas on how to strengthen the EU’s trade defence instruments and I see exactly the same differences here in this House on this as I see in the Council. Let us not assume that we always all agree in the same way. I am not a President who believes in institutions blaming each other. I hear massively that it is the Council. Yes, I said honestly that we disagree there. That is not good. We have to speed it up and I am very honest about it. But it is something else to just simply say that the Council does not work. I think one of the Members out of frustration – which I fully support and understand – even said that we should even change the rules and the Parliament should rule and not the Council. Well, congratulations, we will see if we have a unified position quicker then. But the signal is very clear. I think all of you have mentioned issues that are very, very crucial to us. We have a community of law, we have a qualified majority on this issue and therefore, because of the reasons that you mentioned – and I therefore share your frustration on this because the world economy continues and the issue of overcapacity remains, and our people are waiting for us – in the light of the changed context resulting from Chinese dumping practices and the crisis in the European Union steel industry , the Presidency has reopened a discussion in the Council on the draft regulation on the modernisation of the trade defence instruments. This was proposed by the Presidency. We will continue to do that. We have just announced the intention to start an examination again on 14 June of those issues in the trade defence instruments modernisation package which could in principle be accepted by a majority of the Member States. There are quite a few different forms on that regarding anti—dumping and anti-subsidy investigation proceedings and improving the methodology of calculating the injury and profit margins. I think we have to realise that, in a Europe where we work together and the issue of the qualified majority is there, it is not always easy to find a consensus, but since we are one economic bloc and one trading bloc, we will have to succeed quicker on this, and there I share some of your frustrations as well. But let us not assume that this is just a problem only in the Council. This is something I think we have to work on together in an effective manner. Let me put one other issue on the agenda in that respect. We need to ensure that the benefits of the global economy are widely shared, also in Europe. That includes – yes – countering unfair trade practices, but it also includes fighting protectionism and making the argument for trade as a means to create economic opportunities for workers, consumers and companies. Some of you have mentioned that. Especially in those choices – the political, economic choices we have to make right now – it is true that it is frustrating that we do not yet have a consensual position from the Council. I think we have time limits in front of us. As I told you, the Presidency has taken a few initiatives.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Katainen, Minister, I am tabling the oral question on behalf of the Committee on the Environment. As you know, in November 2015 the Japanese fisheries agency informed the International Whaling Commission that it had resumed hunting as part of a new programme. The plan, which spans a 12-year period, would lead to the killing of 333 stranded whales during the 2015-2016 season, and a total of about 4,000 whales over the program's 12-year duration. With this decision to resume whaling, Japan clearly ignores the ruling of the International Court of Justice which, in its decision of 31 March 2014, required Japan to stop its annual whale slaughter in the Antarctic Ocean. Whaling is in fact a very ancient tradition in several countries, and in Japan it has been practiced for thousands of years. But in the 1980s it became clear that the indiscriminate killing of cetaceans should be stopped, which was banned in order to prevent the extermination of the species. Since 1986, when the moratorium of the International Whaling Commission came into force, commercial hunting has also been illegal in Japan. But as early as the following year Japan continued, in defiance of the Court's ruling, to kill these animals, improperly exploiting a loophole of the International Whaling Commission, which provided for the possibility of activating scientific research programmes as a justification for the killing of whales. But as you all know, the International Court of Justice has concluded that, in this case, whaling is not carried out for the purposes of scientific research, as the Japanese authorities and government have argued differently. Whaling by the Japanese authorities is therefore a violation of international law and threatens the protection of biodiversity and marine ecosystems. Furthermore, the same exception presented by Japan today would be rejected, given that scientific research itself no longer allows whales to be exterminated. In this context, therefore, we would welcome an answer from the Commission and the Council to the following questions: apart from the démarche that will co-sign the European Union delegation in Tokyo, do you intend to condemn more strictly Japan's decision to resume whaling and to hunt and kill 333 specimens of minke whales during the 2015-2016 season? Are you considering other means of putting pressure on Japan through bilateral or multilateral channels? If the démarche does not produce the desired results, do you intend to take legal action to ensure that Japan fully fully obtained the judgment of the International Court of Justice?", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3471, "date": "2016-06-08.json", "name": "Bert Koenders", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, I would like to thank Mr La Via for this important question. The European Union and its Member States are strongly committed to the protection of whales. And in a broader sense I think you mention exactly why this is so important: the protection of biodiversity and marine ecosystems. Let me also be very clear about the position of the Council. We do not approve of the current whaling activities of Japan. Up to this day, Japan has failed to present sufficient evidence to justify its whaling activities with regard to its new research programme and a justification of lethal sampling, in particular, is far below standard. We have conveyed our serious concerns in view of the expert panel findings and the conclusions of the Scientific Committee, and our position has not changed since June 2015. These serious concerns will be expressed again in a meeting in October and we acknowledge that an effective conservation and management regime can only be established through joint efforts and by initiatives that promote mutual trust and cooperation between all the members of the International Whaling Commission. As already said, and I think you mentioned this very important point, at the International Whaling Commission meeting in September 2014, we regard the judgment delivered by the International Court of Justice in March 2014 concerning whaling in the Antarctic as a definitive interpretation of the Convention, and we believe that the principles of the ICJ judgment should be fully incorporated into the working practices , including by a revision of the current review system, Annex B. In our view the judgment clarifies the legal framework for scientific whaling, particularly when it comes to assessing the necessity of having recourse to lethal methods of sampling where non-lethal alternatives exist. The judgment can also help to ensure an effective regulatory framework for international conservation and management. This brings all whaling operations under IWC control.  The European Union and its Member States stand by IWC Resolution 2014-5 adopted in 2014, according to which no further whaling permit should be granted without prior international review, including by the IWC Scientific Committee.  We regret that Japan had not consulted with its partners before engaging in such activities, which are not in line with the ICJ ruling. The Presidency will ensure that the European Union and its Member States are well prepared for the upcoming meeting in October. It is also against this background that the European Union and its Member States joined the démarche led by New Zealand to Japan in December 2015 following the resumption of Japan's whaling activities in the Southern Ocean.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3472, "date": "2016-06-08.json", "name": "Jyrki Katainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, the EU is fully committed to the conservation of all cetaceans and is equipped with environmental legislation to pursue this objective. Commercial whaling is not allowed in Member States’ waters or by ships under the jurisdiction of a Member State. All whale species are protected from deliberate disturbance, capture or killing under the Habitats Directive. In addition, the introduction of cetaceans into, and export from, the EU for primarily commercial purposes is banned under our wildlife regulations. The EU has also clearly positioned itself against commercial whaling at the International Whaling Commission and strongly supports the moratorium on commercial whaling as an essential measure to protect whale stocks that have been decimated by decades and decades of unsustainable hunts. For many decades now Japan has been conducting so-called scientific whaling under the special permit provided under the International Convention on the Regulation of Whaling. The EU welcomed the 2014 landmark judgment delivered by the International Court of Justice ordering the interruption of the Japanese research programme in the Arctic, in the light of its scale, methods and limited scientific output. In December 2015, the EU and its Member States joined New Zealand, Australia, the USA, Mexico and South Africa in a diplomatic démarche towards the Japanese authorities against the decision to issue special permits under its new scientific whale research programme in the Antarctic Ocean for the hunting season 2015-2016. The EU and its Member States do not believe that lethal sampling is required to satisfy the needs of a modern scientific research programme. In addition, we are deeply concerned by the fact that the new Japanese programme has been launched without due recourse to the concerns expressed by the IWC Scientific Committee in line with the clear criteria identified by the ICJ defining whaling for the purpose of scientific research.  Regrettably our diplomatic initiative did not result in reconsideration of the decision by the government of Japan. The issue of scientific whaling will be again on the agenda of the IWC at its next meeting, which will take place in Slovenia in October. The EU will continue to take a strong position on this subject and to work with our international partners to press for decisions within the IWC that lead to better conservation of whales worldwide. The Commission is not considering legal action against Japan at this stage. We should try to resolve the issue through political dialogue as well as further discussions in the competent international forum, the IWC.

Japan has clearly not found a way, such as Norway and Iceland, to allow that catch under agreement with its international partners that allowed it to continue its so-called controlled catch, but abuses the goodwill of the rest of the international community. Japan itself has admitted that more than 300 whales have been caught in the past whaling season, including 200 hills of females, which will cause far-reaching consequences for the population. All the more regrettable is the fact that there is no talk of stopping whale hunting, but rather a new 12-year plan that will allow the liquidation of 333 dwarf whales during the 2015/2016 season, with a total of 4,000 over a period of twelve years. Such disregard for international law raises the question of its meaningfulness, but not only that. Other national fleets could refer questions to their national governments in Australia and New Zealand, or Chile and the European Union whether they too are allowed to go there to investigate the way Japan does.

In the summer season that has just ended with scientific hunting – my colleague also said this – to whales in the Antarctic seas, Japanese whalers have brought back 333 minke whales killed, of which about 200 are pregnant. The International Court of Justice in The Hague considered it necessary to suspend this practice because it lacked scientific purposes, not least because, as we know, so-called scientific evidence often ended up on the shelves of Japanese supermarkets. By resuming whaling, Japan is clearly ignoring this ruling and its international commitments to stop the annual massacre in the Southern Ocean. Japan's intention, in fact, is clearly at odds with the international moratorium on commercial hunting of sea giants, it is a continuous violation of international law and obligations to protect biodiversity and marine ecosystems. Europe must oppose this and cannot allow commercial interests to always take precedence over environmental interests. Even at the last G7, I was sorry to hear that our summits were not ambitious enough in demanding that Japan honour its international obligations to protect wildlife and, indeed, called for the agreements to be speeded up. I hope, in short, that we can still find some ground for discussion on this. We therefore call on the Commission and the Council to work hard to ensure that Japan stops this slaughter.

The Commission and the Council must not allow for this heinous practice to be stopped and to protect the iconic animal that is the whale. The free trade agreement still being negotiated between the EU and Japan offers an excellent opportunity for this.

The same cannot be said for Japan which, under the false pretext of scientific capture programmes and in clear violation of the moratorium on commercial whaling, which entered into force in 1986 and to which it is a signatory, has illegally resumed its whaling activity.  And if I say illegally, Commissioner and Mr Minister, it is because there is a binding decision of the International Court of Justice of 2014 which forced Japan to suspend its cetacean hunting programme, to which that country cunningly intends to steal as already mentioned here by my colleague Giovanni La Via, author of the parliamentary questions.  The Japanese argument that these catches are for scientific purposes is of enormous shame and even shamelessness, because we all know that the scientific community no longer needs to slaughter whales for research purposes, as the International Court itself said, which, in deciding to suspend Japan's hunting programme, questioned the scientific purposes of the Japanese programme and considered it untransparent.

Whales are harpooned and a slow death is met. In modern whaling, harpoons are fired at the whale. The grenade explodes 30 centimetres into the whale's body and puts it in shock until it dies. Since 1986, there has been a ban on commercial whaling. The aim is to save whales from extinction. The only exceptions to the ban are hunting for the needs and scientific purposes of indigenous peoples. When the decision was made, Japan suddenly became very interested in conducting research. They started their whale research program just a year after the moratorium and continued to hunt whales in Antarctica. Since 1987, Japan has killed over 13,000 whales in its so-called scientific programmes, although it has been widely known that their hunting of whale meat had primarily commercial purposes. However, in March 2014, the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that Japanese whaling is not carried out for scientific purposes. I am very disappointed in Japan, which, despite this ruling, has resumed the whale hunt. They now plan to catch 4,000 whales over a 12-year period.

In addition, demand for whale meat has fallen sharply as Japanese consumers have been better informed. That makes it even more incomprehensible why Japan persists in continuing.  Europe must react.

The International Court of Justice has already said that this is not scientific research, that japan's excuses make no sense. But there was no need for the International Court of Justice, just ask any scientist working on cetaceans to know how many alternative methods we have, and none of them includes killing so many specimens, in fact not even one specimen.

Japan plans to catch about 4,000 whales over 12 years, and the recent slaughter of 541 whales near Australia, including 207 pregnant females, appears completely irresponsible. Japan's scientific justification does not hold up, it is similar to the arguments in favour of laboratory animal testing, which are for the most part completely useless. Parliament's proposals - putting pressure on Japan or even initiating legal proceedings - are interesting, but they are vague and do not suggest any concrete means of pressure. However, there are avenues, particularly in terms of fisheries agreements with developing countries. Japan often enters into fisheries agreements with the same countries as the European Union. Couldn't the resumption of whaling be an argument to be made in the negotiations? I'm asking the question. Finally, Japan is not the only threat to the survival of whales: plastic waste poisons them and leads to massive strandings, especially on European shores.

While it is true that a number of coastal communities in Japan have indeed practised inshore whale hunting for centuries, it is stretching it a bit too far to invoke traditional culture today to defend sending out ships across the globe and to the Antarctic to hunt whales. Fortunately, the times of post-war world food shortages, when whale meat was the biggest source of meat in Japan, have long past, and most people can afford other types of meat. Consumption has been falling for years, and most Japanese do not even eat whale meat at all. Therefore, just as eating habits have changed, so should the practice of whale hunting. Nor can the killing of hundreds of whales each year be credibly justified by scientific research purposes.

Technological developments are now instruments and methods that, although intrusive in some cases, do little to disturb the animals to study, little disturb cetaceans. The study of stable isotopes, genetic analysis and genomics allow us to know eating habits, migration dynamics and even kinship relationships. Today there is a huge set of non-lethal methods that are excellent approximations to reality and fully accepted by the scientific community. For these reasons, I find it unfair to argue the need to use lethal methods for scientific purposes. Through DNA barcoding and other genetic-based techniques applied to catering products, we know that cetaceans from hunting said for scientific purposes practiced by Japan are marketed without proper framing, having led to unfair and deceptive commercial practices.

In spite of the ruling, Japan has recently resumed whaling, exploiting a loophole that allows for a limited amount of hunting for scientific purposes. Even though there has been a moratorium on commercial whaling since 1982, there is still supply of whale meat in Japan due to imports and the sale of the meat that was hunted on scientific missions. However, the hunting of whales could not be justified by the alleged strong cultural attachment to whale meat, either – which was popular in the post-war period since it was a cheap source of protein – as, according to research conducted by Greenpeace, whale meat consumption in Japan amounted to about 30 grams per person on average in 2015 (whereas the stockpile of unsold frozen whale meat totalled up to 5 900 tons in 2011).

For the first time, in 2001, Parliament called on the Commission to submit a proposal for a regulation containing a code of good administrative behaviour. At that time we had no clear legal basis for an EU administrative procedure law but, with the Lisbon Treaty, Article 298 was introduced as an appropriate legal base. In 2010, the Committee on Legal Affairs (JURI) set up a working group on EU administrative law. We concluded that EU administrative law was very fragmented and only a very few areas of the Union’s administrative activities were subject to a systematic approach. That is why Parliament, in January 2013, adopted the Berlinguer report, in which it clearly requested the Commission to submit a proposal for an administrative regulation applicable to the administration of the Union’s institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. In the current parliamentary term we have again followed up, with a working group chaired by my esteemed colleague Heidi Hautala, which has done tremendous work that has now come to an end. As the Commission has, unfortunately, still not come up with a concrete proposal for a regulation, or clearly stated that we are to expect such an initiative, the oral question and resolution we are talking about tonight shall serve as a gentle reminder from Parliament to the Commission. In order to help the Commission to make up its mind, the main aim of the JURI Committee working group was to draft a model regulation, with the advice of law professors, containing a basic set of the rules we would like to see. We have annexed this regulation to the oral question and resolution presented tonight. The objective of such a proposal is to provide citizens and the Union’s administration with a comprehensive and cross-cutting administrative procedure. Especially in the current times, with Euroscepticism on the rise, citizens would enormously benefit from uniform procedural guarantees enforceable in the EU courts. Increased openness, transparency and accessibility of the EU administration will improve trust and the relationship between citizens and the Union’s administration, and in that way we will also reinforce the legitimacy of the EU.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3495, "date": "2016-06-08.json", "name": "Heidi Hautala", "mepid": "2054", "text": "  author. – Madam President, over the years the complexity of the EU’s administration has increased. New bodies, offices and agencies have been created and the tasks for which the European Union is responsible have also grown. This has meant, too, that citizens and businesses increasingly have become directly involved with the Union’s administration. This happens, for instance, when they are applying for EU funds, or when they lodge complaints against a decision which is unfavourable to them, etcetera. However, despite the fact that the Union has at its service officials who are both competent and dedicated, its public image is unfortunately often that of an incomprehensible and distant bureaucracy. The scattered nature of the rules governing the EU’s administrative activities, and the gaps and uncertainties that this leads to, are certainly not helping to improve this image. We have already heard from Mr Swoboda that there is a legal basis now for the Commission to come up with a proposal on law and administrative procedure, which would be applied to all EU institutions. And it is important to emphasise that the draft regulation which has been produced by the working group would apply only to the administration of the Union’s institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, and not to Member States’ administration. It would also concern only administrative activities in the strict sense. It excludes legislative procedures and it excludes judicial proceedings, as well as the adoption of delegated acts and implementing acts and other non-legislative acts directly based on the Treaties. What is very important is that the Commission looks at how, with the help of this draft regulation which has been finalised, we can foster the culture of an open, efficient and independent European administration. Finally I would like to say a word of thanks to the European Law Institute, a group of dedicated academic experts, from the political groups, for the immense amount of work that has gone into this exercise over the years, and notably during the past two years.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3496, "date": "2016-06-08.json", "name": "Jyrki Katainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, I am here today to reply to your oral question on the very important topic of European Union administration. You ask, in particular, if the Commission has analysed your suggestion for a regulation for an open, efficient and independent European Union administration, and whether the Commission has any plans to put forward its own proposal. You ask for the reasons that have prevented the Commission, thus far, from acting on its right of initiative in this field. Let me assure you from the start that the Commission is extremely serious about its commitment to guaranteeing that citizens can interact with a European administration that is open, independent and efficient. That is why the Commission has, for instance, set up the transparency portal. This portal provides citizens with direct access to information and will help them to be better informed and better prepared to follow and participate in the EU decision-making process. I also want to mention the Commission Inter-Service Group on Public Administration Quality and Innovation. This group is working to enable, among others, national administrations, and therefore European businesses, fully to tap the potential of the internal market, joint economic governance and the structural funds. Apart from these more recent initiatives, and as you know, the Commission has a well-established set of horizontal rules which govern its administrative behaviour – as, I would expect, does Parliament. This includes the general provisions of the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour, as well as a range of provisions on staff and financial regulations, on data protection and access to documents, to name but a few of the areas covered. All of these horizontal rules are a reflection of the existing legal principles of good administration, such as non-discrimination, impartiality and fairness, and the right to have one’s affairs handled within a reasonable time, etcetera. As the EU administers a range of diverse and mostly highly specialised activities, it also relies on sector-specific rules. Citizens and businesses concerned by such specialised activities are guaranteed specific administrative rights. Examples here are numerous: we have specific rights in competition law, and in relation to novel foods, the authorisation of medicinal products, GMOs, trade defence, etcetera. The Commission has analysed your suggestion for a regulation for an open, efficient and independent European Union administration against these existing horizontal and sectoral rules, principles and practices. As a result of that analysis, the Commission is, at this stage, not convinced that the benefits of using a legislative instrument that would codify administrative law would outweigh the costs. Codification is a complex and delicate exercise that can often have unintended consequences. In having to clarify the relationship and to ensure consistency with these more detailed rules, codification would require the revision of the considerable volume of existing EU legislation. Even where done with care and a sense of proportion, codification may still lead to problems of delimitation between the general and specific rules – not making legislation any clearer or litigation any easier for citizens and businesses affected. Codification would remove the flexibility required to adapt to particular needs. These challenges and difficulties are also confirmed by the draft regulation. The text does not identify what the gaps and inconsistencies in current law are, and therefore what the justification is for coming forward with horizontal legislative solutions as a proportionate answer to deal with them. It also does not assess the concrete impact of the provisions it contains. While the text is said to be without prejudice to existing rules and rights under specific Union legislation, it provides for no legal mechanism to ensure delimitation between the general and the specific rules. It rather seems to suggest that a case-by-case analysis would continue to apply. Lastly, there is the matter of ways to identify administrative activities of the institutions and bodies that would be subject to the new rules. Instead of engaging in a highly complex exercise of codification, with uncertain value-added, the Commission is of the opinion that we should continue to address concrete problems where they arise, analyse the root causes and then take the sort of action that is needed. The Commission analyses each case of alleged maladministration, and will try to rectify any error that has been made. It also engages constructively in the context of all inquiries by the European Ombudsman. That being said, at this stage the Commission is not aware of any pattern of cases of maladministration that could be addressed through a general administrative law. I am, as is the Commission, therefore grateful for the work you have done, and will continue working with you on all options and good arguments as to how we can improve our citizens’ life.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3497, "date": "2016-06-08.json", "name": "Емил Радев", "mepid": "124850", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – I would like to congratulate Mrs Hautala and the Legal Service of the European Parliament, who have made so much effort to produce this important document for the European administration.

Let's hope that this time he will make the necessary efforts to make this proposal a reality. Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights provide the right to good administration. But in order for citizens to exercise this right, they need clear, effective, predictable and accessible procedures in their relations with the European administration. The benefits of such legislation are undeniable – on the one hand it will fill gaps in the Union legal system and increase legal certainty by giving citizens and legal persons clearer rights and, on the other hand, help to strengthen confidence in the work of the European administration, the strengthening of the legitimacy of the Union. With our proposal, we provide answers to important questions, such as the initiation of the administrative procedure, deadlines and remedies. I believe that an important element of the proposal is the confirmation of fundamental procedural rights aimed at making the European administration an open, effective and independent administration.

This is what the European Parliament also asked for in its resolution of 15 January 2013 a few years ago. Today, the European Union has a cumbersome institutional mechanism. European funds are absorbed on the basis of a complicated and difficult system for citizens to access, and entrepreneurs face bushy bureaucratic mechanisms that block their work. That is why the way the European institutions work must be simplified in order to become easier to understand for everyone and, above all, for young people. The situation needs to change. Good administration is not an option, but a legal right, guaranteed by Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Institutions need to be more aware of the practical advantages of the citizen-centred approach. The principles of transparency, efficiency and independence lead to a stronger and binding European Union for Member States when their actions are subject to EU law. The European Union, however, is due to make its administration more efficient before criticising the functioning of the administrations of the Member States. However, I note with regret that there are still problems with a common European approach. Some states are protected when they commit violations of European law, while others, perceived as weaker, are sometimes criticised without objective arguments. The absence of the European dimension is also found at the level of representativeness in the European institutions. Whether we are talking about national representativeness or gender. That is why I believe that it is the duty of the European institutions to correct such situations and to propose a transparent and effective legal framework. We're talking about good administration.

Certainty is very important in order to give credibility to the institutions. There are two things on which we must focus our efforts, and not coincidentally they have been mentioned here several times. Firstly, legal certainty is essential: to have rules that are easy to interpret and effective at the stage of their implementation. On the other side is transparency. All we are doing is, inevitably, but I would like to say quite rightly, that the citizens of Europe have been observed, sometimes even with a great deal of mistrust.

At all levels of management, the need to change bulky and insouch structures is very often placed under the mantle of efficiency gains.

The European Ombudsman also contributes to ensuring quality in the work of the institutions and bodies and can point out where concrete improvements could be made.  While we see that the Parliament wants a ‘once-size-fits-all’ rule for EU administration, the Commission rather thinks that we best serve citizens if we have administrative rules that are tailor-made and can maximise the effect in each field of concern. We will continue to monitor our rules and practices in this spirit and, as always, are open to examine input by citizens and stakeholders that point our attention to specific needs for improvements.

The Commission and High Representative/Vice-President Mogherini and the European Investment Bank are currently examining how to have more efficient EU economic diplomacy.  Economic diplomacy is about using all levers that are at our disposal to promote our economic interests abroad. This means removing barriers and creating incentives to trade and investment by opening global markets, fostering cooperation on economic governance, regulatory convergence or a level playing field, concretely supporting the internationalisation of EU businesses and improving the coherence and effectiveness of the external action of the EU in the economic field.  Economic diplomacy is therefore at the forefront of the Jobs, Growth and Investment agenda, one of the top priorities of the Juncker Commission. In a world where most of the future economic growth is expected to happen outside the EU, we must make optimal use of all the levers at our disposal to promote EU prosperity in a global context. To this end, we need to develop a more cohesive and coherent approach that targets strong economic and political outcomes using our trade, investment, industry, innovation, foreign and development policies. EU economic diplomacy also has a financial dimension and access to finance for business internationalisation should be boosted, notably through EIB actions.  The Commission services, the EEAS and the European Investment Bank are already active in working towards removing barriers and creating incentives to trade and investment by opening global markets, fostering cooperation on economic governance, regulatory convergence or a level playing field with key economic partners. They are also supporting the internationalisation of EU businesses. We do this inter alia by negotiating and implementing trade and investment and sectoral agreements, by cooperating on sectoral policies across the world through diplomatic démarches by our EU delegations or at political level when we have summits or high-level meetings with partner countries, and by deploying and financing initiatives to support the internationalisation of businesses and SMEs. This can be done, for instance, via market access, partnership, support to EU chambers of commerce abroad, business missions and regulatory cooperation and projects. But we can still do more to further improve the coherence and effectiveness of the EU’s external action in the economic field.  First, we need to have a clear view of the EU’s economic interests and strategic objectives with key partners. And then we need to use the policy tools and instruments at our disposal to pursue these objectives and ensure coherence and synergies. Proper consultation, coordination and unity must be ensured with Parliament, Member States and industry, as a united EU is stronger and has more leverage.  An inter-service group on economic diplomacy has been set up with representatives of the Commission services, the EU External Action Service and the EIB to examine and make proposals on the above-mentioned agenda. This group has already helped strengthen our internal coordination. One of the next steps will be to equip EU delegations with better guidance and instructions on how to support EU economic interests abroad.  We are also reflecting on how to improve coordination with Member States and EU industry to work the together on the same objectives and divide work in an optimal way, including in respect of concrete support for the internationalisation of EU companies, where we need to avoid duplication. For this, we will discuss with Member States and industry representatives both in Brussels and in European capitals, but also in third countries where economic diplomacy is being carried out on the ground. The role of EU delegations is therefore key.  The European Parliament’s role in EU economic diplomacy is also key, as you have relations with parliaments of most countries in the world and can pass important messages when visiting them. We need to pursue the same objectives and work together to defend EU economic interests abroad. So, honourable Members, I will stop here and I am very interested in hearing your views on what more we could do and maybe learn from best practices you have seen during your visits and activities abroad.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3515, "date": "2016-06-08.json", "name": "Antonio Tajani", "mepid": "2187", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, we must not Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, if the Union wants to play a leading role on the international stage, it must promote its competitiveness through strategic sectors such as industry and energy. In order to achieve this objective, the Union must have real economic diplomacy with three main objectives. The first is to support their companies abroad, helping them to position themselves in emerging markets, I am thinking of Latin America, Africa and the Far East, and of consolidating into traditional ones. Secondly, to promote initiatives to internationalise enterprises, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, through missions of economic operators in growing countries, business forums or B to B meetings; Internationalisation is in fact the best instrument to combat the relocation of our companies. The third objective is to attract productive investment and tourist flows to Europe that will promote the growth of our continent. The European Commission has already developed effective instruments to support this dimension. I am thinking of the growth missions, which have already been carried out in some 30 regions or countries and which have proved very useful in expanding the activities of our companies beyond the borders of the Union. But improving and strengthening these initiatives is critical to addressing economic challenges and seizing opportunities globally. In the offices of the External Action Service we need desks specialized in supporting small and medium-sized enterprises that intend to internationalize. Unfortunately, our diplomacy has not renewed sufficiently and has not developed the economic reflex that would make it much more effective and useful for growth.

I recall the work of Mr Tajani as Commissioner and Vice-President of the Committee, when he already launched an interesting programme for economic diplomacy in 2013 so that the European Union could become a stronger player in the world.  In its definition, economic diplomacy is, in fact, a foreign policy function that ensures compliance with very clear objectives to promote the economic well-being of European citizens. Economic diplomacy aims to use foreign policy instruments to support the economic interests of entrepreneurs, Member States. In order to achieve its objectives, the European Union should promote global competitiveness and take the lead in strategic sectors such as industrial, innovative and energy.  Many times, at a meeting with several Commissioners, including Mr Juncker, we raised issues related to concrete measures, reindustrialisation of the European Union, internationalisation of business and, in particular, the support of SMEs to expand their work in third countries. You have also made it clear, Commissioner, but you have not said how. Because, without having concrete budgets for the internationalisation of SMEs, we will not be able to do it with words alone. My question is very explicit and I hope to receive an equally clear answer. What diplomatic instruments in the economic and trade sector do you want to develop now, when the European Union is in extremely important negotiations with large markets: the United States, Canada, China, Japan? Commissioner, as Vice-President of the SME Intergroup, I had the opportunity to meet with many SME associations, Myself I was an SME-ist and Minister for SMEs. What economic diplomacy tools are you thinking of developing to support SMEs in expanding businesses and marketing in third markets? What can be done to have innovative, competitive, solid SMEs in the global market? Do you have a plan?

The level of meso, i.e. the level of countries and regions, seems particularly important to me, as Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen said at a seminar at the European Centre for Political Strategy in February. However, new tools and new concepts for economic diplomacy are needed.  In doing so, I would like to point out that economic diplomacy at EU level should take into account the interests of all Member States and all regions of Europe and that it should strengthen the actions of the Member States in this regard, not replace them. Unfortunately, we all know that Europe's economic reality looks different than we would like. The gap between the countries of the European centre and the periphery is widening.

The fact that we are discussing this at a time when many in the EU are actually too inward-focused allows us to look outward again and see not only threats from the outside world but, frankly, the many opportunities. One of the strengths of the European Union is of course our soft power. I think economic diplomacy would be one way to also create a better relevance and clear picture for people of why we have trade and other economic policies and what it can mean concretely. Concretely, that is, for small and medium-sized enterprises and concretely in an outreach that should be a two-way street: on the one hand, we should have our diplomats and our representatives looking for opportunities in third countries, but we should also be a welcome desk providing information and bringing knowledge back to the European Union.  I think we should also strive to be less competing with one another globally and to act more as an EU together. Let me give you an example. Recently I was in Boston, Massachusetts, as the Vice-President of the US Delegation of this House, where there are incubators bringing life science companies from the EU to relevant partners in the US. You see a German hub, a Dutch hub and a Swedish hub operating within metres of each other. Why not join forces, show what Europe has to offer, and bring the knowledge and the entrepreneurship, the investment and other relevant actors back in touch with actors in the EU? The same could be said for Silicon Valley.  I think there are many opportunities to avoid duplication – as you said, Commissioner – but also to connect the dots in a changing world, involve technology and IT in a smart way, and involve the private sector also in our foreign policy goals, which includes them playing a role in advancing human rights, corporate social responsibility and basically streamlining our efforts on the global stage.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3519, "date": "2016-06-08.json", "name": "Helmut Scholz", "mepid": "96646", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to sanendour sto -- on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

These objectives will in future be targeted at all relevant policy areas and EU institutions, including the EIB. And this is where fundamental questions to be answered come up. After all, it has long been proven that trade-promoting action only works between developed and less developed countries. In this sense, the approach not only outlines target markets, but already points to a central problem that is clearly emerging: in the global south, international trade currently accounts for 50 percent of the problem and is highly dependent on the consideration of its interests and needs. If the EU does not take this into account in a future trade policy aimed at balancing interests, EU economic diplomacy will find its master in southern trade in the short term.

As you mentioned, we have the situation that 80-90% of economic growth will take place outside Europe over the next ten to fifteen years, a third of which will take place in China. Although 25% of European SMEs export to the EU, only 13% of all European SMEs currently operate in markets outside the Union. Due to globalisation, investment is largely carried out outside Europe.

With regard to the first objective, it is very important to support small and medium-sized enterprises. These are the ones that most need the support of the European Union. They often have the support of their States, the Member States in which they operate, but they need the support of the European Union because they have some difficulty in conquering new markets outside the European area.  And at a time when we are negotiating various trade agreements with different countries and groupings of countries around the world, this challenge is of particular importance and therefore here we need to create very specific instruments, from the financial component to the logistical support component, in order to allow precisely this business fabric, which is the bulk of the European business fabric. , consisting of small and medium-sized enterprises, to be able to aspire to faster internationalisation, unless they themselves cannot compete in the international framework.

I applied for this night's debate because, as chairman of the European Parliament-Iran delegation, I have a very interesting field of observation, a very interesting case study. Well, we are certainly dealing here with a great opening of a great country with great economic potential. But what has happened since the nuclear agreement was signed? 144 government visits from individual countries that compete with each other in this newly opened territory. From this comes a certain picture of the tasks for the European institutions, namely the protection of investment, the creation of a better investment area in this new country, breaking down barriers for small and medium-sized enterprises and sharing information. These are undoubtedly values added at European level compared to the 144 government visits and countless private visits that involve countries competing for this brand new market.

With many free trade agreements, the EU enables growth in foreign markets and an ever-improving environment. This is also an invitation to the left in Parliament, but to support the TTIP free trade agreement, because this also gives us a better framework, global export contacts. Many Member States also support initiatives through export protection and the very good service of the chambers of commerce abroad. But I think we can do more. The Commission could make greater use of its global networks for economic contacts, and Parliament's delegations, as has just been mentioned, can also take interested companies with them to the delegation trips. We would even have a budget; we have a lot of money in Parliament's budget to organise these things.

Therefore, creativity and the ability to also build a social model that is up to scratch, so in Europe it is nice to undertake and it is nice to work. But to do economic diplomacy you have to get to know each other well, know what we are strong in, get to know each other and defend yourself to propose yourself. We are the best in manufacturing and we do not have a large amount of raw materials. Therefore, a first strategy in building real economic diplomacy is to associate our production capacity with the strength of countries that have raw materials and with them to go hand in hand. For example, the great challenge of the Mediterranean is a challenge in which our economic diplomacy can play an exceptional role.

The fact is that 24% of GDP is in the European Union, that we are strong and the world's largest economy, but nevertheless we need economic diplomacy.  Personally, I think it needs to be a foreign policy function and that foreign policy cannot go without economic diplomacy. I therefore agree that the European Union, Member States and businesses, as well as the Foreign Affairs and Economic Diplomacy Service need to be linked and coordinated. Without this networking, we will not be able to preserve the first place in the world economy. Certainly, this is all for the benefit of European citizens. I believe that economic diplomacy needs to be internationalised, and a big emphasis should also be placed on the small and medium-sized enterprises we are constantly talking about, because the middle tier is clearly the dominant layer in the European Union and we must provide them with all possible mechanisms.

In my opinion, given the strength it has in global markets, the European Union should play a more active role internationally. The European Union is a little undersized internationally in the political sense. I think that this issue should come together here, and the three objectives that my colleague, Mr Tajani, has also talked about should be linked to the support of businesses, because the best report card for what the European Union has achieved is a very functioning company that is making its production on foreign markets.

The economic diplomacy as the Commission perceives it is extremely negative for the people. The disastrous decisions to take action against Russia have, by contrast, had a serious impact on many companies, without the European Union having so far compensated those affected satisfactorily and fairly. At the same time, while there are leaks of documents demonstrating the onerous environmental provisions being processed by TTIR, the Commission continues to 'business as usual'.

I am particularly glad to see Mr Tajani here, who is a genuine pioneer of new economic diplomacy. You launched this concept during your time in the Commission and we are trying to continue and even further develop and try to learn from best practices how we could improve the efficiency of our economic diplomatic activities. There was a good question, asking what are the objectives of economic diplomacy. I will try to explain what we are doing. Basically it elaborates or clarifies what our objectives are at the moment. For instance, we have had two very interesting high—level economic dialogues with third countries, and we will keep these on our agenda. Firstly, the dialogue with China: I regularly meet Vice—Premier Ma Kai, together with other Commissioners, and from the Chinese side there are also other Ministers. At those events we sometimes have discussions with the private sector. Every once in a while we invite private companies to our dialogue just to hear what they are saying and what they are expecting from the EU, what they are expecting from China and what the priorities the private sector is asking of us are in order to improve the business environment. At the same meetings, for instance last time, last September in Beijing, Commissioner Oettinger and Commissioner Bulc participated in the dialogue and discussed the cooperation of 5G. Commissioner Bulc also talked about the connectivity platform and we talked about potential Chinese investment in Europe. As a result of this, we have managed to finalise our technical work with the Silk Road Fund which is interested in investing in Europe more and more. So those are just a few examples of the fruits of high—level economic dialogue with China. Just a couple of months ago we had a similar event in Ankara and Istanbul where Turkey’s and the EU’s business delegations met each other and they also gave us ideas about what more the two parties could do in order to improve the business environment on both sides. There again, we had discussions on regulatory cooperation as well as on macroeconomic issues.  Commissioner Moscovici joined us and we talked about R&amp;D cooperation between Turkey and the EU.  So those are just a few examples of our current activities and clearly show some of our objectives. But of course, as I mentioned during the debate here, one of the priority areas is trade agreements with third countries.  I should also mention development policy and investment – a combination of development policy, trade and investment cooperation, because many of the third countries which we are helping to reform themselves and which are an objective of EU aid are willing to become a partner to the EU rather than just an objective of development aid. There of course diplomacy plays a big role. That is one of the reasons why we are planning to establish some sort of fund, similar to the one we have here, EFSI, which could support European investments to third countries. This is just one of the ideas.  My final point is about SME cooperation. I have already mentioned trade deals but I have to add a couple of other issues. The role of networks of European business organisations in third countries is significant. I have met excellent Chambers of Commerce, for instance in China – they are our ears and eyes about what is happening on a daily basis in Chinese trade issues –  also in Singapore, when I visited there, and in the United States and Turkey. I am planning to visit the Gulf region and also Iran, which was also  mentioned here earlier. But if the Parliament has good ideas about how we could improve our help to SMEs, just let us know. We can make trade promotion trips inviting SMEs to participate, but is there anything else apart from what has been mentioned here? Let us be innovative. Let us think what we could do more and differently than we have done so far. I am sure that, as there are so many experienced MEPs who have experience on trade policies, on trade promotion for instance, you can devise something and let us know because I am open—minded on this issue. The more we can do in order to help our businesses to expand to third countries and trade and sell, the better.

There is ampered evidence that effective economic diplomacy can be more effective than so-called hard power. As the Commissioner rightly stated in his speech, the vast majority of economic growth is currently generated outside the EU, and we must make sure that, through our contacts in the area of trade and investment, the results of this growth are felt more strongly in Europe as well.  That is why it is so important to support our entrepreneurs on the global market or to promote solutions that eliminate barriers on third-country markets. Closer cooperation between the European External Action Service and the European Investment Bank is needed to create easily accessible sources of funding for European entrepreneurs planning to expand abroad. Trade agreements negotiated by the EU with third countries are also part of economic diplomacy, provided that they ensure that they genuinely facilitate access to the markets in question for our companies and do not discriminate against individual economic sectors.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}]
