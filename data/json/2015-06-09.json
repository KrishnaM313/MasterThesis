I would also like to thank all those colleagues – MEPs and Parliament staff – for their very valuable input into this very sensitive and important matter that we are here to discuss: EU-Russia relations. I would like to note that while preparing the report I was planning on going and taking the opportunity to hear what the officials in Moscow had to say. Unfortunately, my fact-finding mission did not take place, since my delegation was not let into Russia. We can only regret that now, 19 of our colleagues find themselves on the illegal Russian visa ban list. This is not only disrespect to the European Parliament but an insult to the EU as a whole, which bases international cooperation on transparent and peaceful dialogue. When preparing for this speech I looked for inspiration from Churchill’s Fulton speech. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom saw the dramatic geopolitical changes that were arriving in his wake when he said these words: ‘If the Western Democracies stand together in strict adherence to the principles [of the United Nations Charter, their influence] will be immense and no one is likely to molest them. If however they become divided or falter in their duty and if these all-important years are allowed to slip away, then indeed catastrophe may overwhelm us all’. When everyone in Europe was tired after the war, it took great courage to name the situation, as it was – if not acted upon – possibly as dangerous as the situation created by the Nazis. There are countries and people who would say the same thing about today’s situation. Europe’s post-war peace order is challenged by the occupation of Crimea and continuing Russian military aggression in Ukraine. There should be no fear in naming it that way. But the European continent had not only the Cold War: it also had the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Singing Revolution, which was one of the reasons that made my speech here today possible. It all happened in a semi-peaceful way. It seemed that history has indeed come to an end: democracy and the rule of law are prevailing over aggression and unlawfulness and war. Further EU enlargement is an excellent example of peaceful European order. So one could say that there is a solution, there is a possibility of building a peaceful cohabitation with all the countries on the continent. But at this moment it is not Europe which will decide it. The European Union adheres to the very clear principles of the rule of law, transparency and self-determination, therefore numerous different formats and initiatives were offered to Russia in order to usher the Russian people to the path of democracy and reform. The European Union was even generous in offering strategic partnership or ‘common spaces’ initiatives, but the respect of human rights and democratic principles kept on deteriorating in Russia. Europe even turned a blind eye when people in the Kremlin were breaking the established order of international treaties. Europe did not do much when the Russian troops entered Georgia’s territory and remained silent during the establishment of the Gazprom monopoly in certain countries and during trade wars when Russia would close down its borders under political pretexts. But Europe is not there any longer. After the illegal annexation of Crimea, after the MH17 plane was shot down from the sky, Europe took Churchill’s advice and spoke out, and it will speak again, I am sure. There will be more and tougher sanctions if the international obligations set out in two Minsk agreements are not respected and if more people die because the guns keep flowing through the unprotected border. Europe will speak out when the rules of the internal market are challenged by uncompromising monopoly companies which long thought that corrupt deals would keep them above the law. Europe will say a word or two when the political parties that disagree with the very principles of European Union, like democracy, receive funding from financial institutions linked to the people running the Kremlin.

Our partnership was severely impacted last year by the illegal annexation of Crimea and the destabilisation of Donbas. But Russia is also an important economic counterpart and an essential partner for the solution of many pressing international problems. This is the backdrop of the report you are debating today. I appreciate your efforts, in particular those of Mr Landsbergis, which have made this report a very important contribution to the debate on how best to shape relations with Russia. Let me take up the key political messages in your report. First comes the issue of unity. I fully share your conviction that our Russia policy is strong and successful only if it enjoys the unanimous support of all 28 EU Member States. The EU must continue acting on the basis of a broad and principled consensus on the Ukraine conflict and on its relations with Russia. This does not mean reducing our policy to the lowest common denominator. Quite the contrary – it means pursuing a comprehensive approach, responding to immediate concerns but with strategic patience and vision. The work of this House is an example of EU unity. I understand that the draft report has been adopted by an overwhelming majority in the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET). I hope that the plenary vote will also reflect this, in order to send a clear political message about the views of European citizens. Second, there is the issue of balance. Your report contains strong criticism of Moscow’s actions such as the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol, its destabilising policy in Donbas, the multiplication of hybrid threats throughout Europe and the shrinking space for Russian civil society and media. At the same time, you are equally strong in stating the EU’s readiness to develop a constructive, predictable and mutually-beneficial relationship with Russia. Balance is at the core of our approach to the Ukraine conflict. On the one hand, we have been firm and decided to adopt sanctions. On the other hand, EU Member States and EU institutions are engaged in the search for a political solution to the conflict. Work is done in the Normandy format and in trilateral talks on trade and energy. The EU provides substantial assistance which is clearly conditional on real reforms in Ukraine. These efforts will continue unabated. Such a balanced approach should be followed between the EU and Russia. Dialogue and engagement should go together with resilience and firmness. We cannot turn a blind eye to security risks in sectors like energy, cyber-space, civil aviation or the impact of propaganda on our democracies. We must enhance our capacity for resilience and clearly state our red lines. At the same time, there is an imperative for cooperation based on the inter-dependence and complementarity of our economies, on historical and cultural traditions and on our capacity to make a difference when we act jointly. We should more often exercise our responsibilities as actors in a complex world of global and regional challenges. Based on mutual respect, the EU should remain ready to develop a new, positive relationship. Thirdly, the Commission shares your commitment to a comprehensive approach to our Russia policy. As High Representative Mogherini said in this Chamber at the start of her term last autumn, we believe that a successful foreign policy depends on success in internal EU policies fully committed to this principle. The work by High Representative Mogherini, with Commissioners Šefčovič and Malmström, on the trilateral talks on energy and trade proves we are on the right track. Fourth, let me stress the issue of integrity. The EU stands firmly behind democratic values, respect for human rights and a rules-based international order and will continue to do so. These fundamental principles underpin our commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. They are the basis for our call on Russia to respect its international commitments, be this in the field of governance, security or international trade. We have maintained our support and assistance for civil society organisations and human rights projects in an increasingly challenging environment. Despite the deterioration of relations, we will enhance people-to-people contacts in all fields – from education, culture and research to cross-border cooperation. Let me finish with a crucial point in your report – perspective. I see that the very first plea you make in your report is for the EU to develop a contingency plan for the short term, as well as a comprehensive plan for long-term relations with Russia and with the EU’s East European partners. I share the reasoning behind this call. Events in Crimea and Donbas should not prevent us from taking a broader horizon for identifying the challenges we face and the opportunities to be exploited. EU Foreign Ministers agreed back in January to continue dialogue with Russia at expert level on the resolution of regional conflicts and tackling global challenges. Further engagement with Russia should be gradual, with Russia’s fulfilment of commitments under international law and steps for rebuilding mutual trust. For this to develop, we need a long-term vision – a strategy that we must develop further. To achieve a vision for EU-Russia relations that can embrace all scenarios, our reflection should already start now.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2015-06-09.json", "name": "Jacek Saryusz-Wolski", "mepid": "28297", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, what is most important in our relations with Russia is to be consistent and united. Relations between us and Russia have never been as bad as they are now. They are a result of the aggressive policies of President Putin. But let us not forget that there is a Russia other than the one we are dealing with now – the Russia of Sakharov, Politkovskaya, Nemtsov, Kovalyov and Memorial, and of all those Russians, of that great nation, who have been honoured with our Sakharov Prize. Russia is not fulfilling the Minsk agreement, and this is at the core of our relationship with and attitude to Russia. The position recently taken at the G7 Summit – that the G7 is in favour of continuing the sanctions and, if the need arises, increasing them – is the best answer to Russia’s present aggressive policy. Contrary to what some say, the sanctions which we are applying hurt the core of Russia’s economy. Thus they should bring a result, despite the fact that, so far, they have not changed the course of the Kremlin’s policy. Russia has recently blacklisted 89 people from the European Union, including 19 Members of the European Parliament.

I believe that this now obliges us in our relations with Russia, even though it sometimes seems very difficult. Because without Russia there will be no peace in Europe, as Helmut Schmidt, a veteran of eastern politics, has said. And, as the Commissioner also said: 'The more united the EU is vis-à-vis Russia, the more certainly we can contribute to European core values: democracy, the rule of law, human rights.'  The Socialist Group wants to speed up dialogue and diplomacy. Parliamentary diplomacy is also important. That blacklist of several European politicians and MEPs published by Russia was ill thought out and only deepened the cycle of mistrust. My group has had a positive impact on the Landsbergis report before us. Russia must implement the Minsk agreement and respect the right of Ukraine and its other neighbours to make political choices. The annexation of Crimea is contrary to international law and must never be accepted or recognised. But despite all this, the doors must be opened to dialogue and the aim must be to build new trust. Common interests and challenges include the fight against climate change, terrorism, cross-border cooperation, and, for example, the Northern Dimension policy is an example of how everyday cooperation is already under way at the moment. It is quite right to condemn, as the report does, the restrictions on freedom of the Russian media and the Internet, and we should also be concerned that Russia supports the activities of the extreme right in the EU Member States. The Socialist Group calls on the External Action Service and I hope Commissioner Jourová will take this message forward that the Member States and the Eeas will raise issues of homophobia and violence against LGBT people. There really must be a relentless policy on Russia, but at the same time new confidence must be built. Global problems will not be solved without cooperation between Europe and Russia. We're also tied to each other by geography. And this is a good starting point when we start to carry out the great task given to us by the Nobel Peace Prize.

This is an important debate, this is an extremely important debate. We are talking about a truly changing international order and Russia, which, in this changing order, is trying to regain significant influence in the world at the expense of our region – including your regional member, The Commissioner. This is done through aggressive policy. The consequences of this aggressive policy have also been tested by the governments of which I had the honour of being a member, because we wanted to maintain, like you, dialogue with Russia. We wanted this dialogue to be friendly.  However, it is important to be aware of what Russian policy we are dealing with at the moment. That this is a country that, in its doctrines – both in military doctrine and in the concept of foreign policy – assumes strikes in close proximity if it considers that Russian interests are being violated. And unfortunately, russia recognises that it is violating its interests in almost every case, the simplest of things. And it is not that the framework of our debate is outlined within the framework of dialogue, economic interests and the convergence of the culture of our countries. Not only that, because there is a real serious threat, including in our territories, of hybrid warfare, of armaments in Kaliningrad, of violating the international legal order.

So thank you for doing so, Mr Landsbergis. The basis will be the return of international law by Russia: that is, of course, that Crimea should be given back to Ukraine and those who signed the Budapest Memorandum should be helping in this and should not be absent. Secondly, Russia should stop its involvement in eastern Ukraine and adhere to the Minsk Agreement – and only facts on the ground can change our position towards Russia. It is a two-track approach: it means being hard on Putin but willing to cooperate with Russian civil society, because many Russians want peace as well. It will take a lot of time. In this Parliament we always want things to happen overnight, but Putin has a long-term strategy of crippling Russia’s neighbours. So also to return Putin, or a successor, to international law will take time, and we have to be tough. We should not give in – let time do its work. There are no speedy resolutions, no business as usual. To conclude, there is that blacklist. But I think it is a list of honour. It is an honour to be on a list with so many colleagues who are pro-Ukrainian but who also love the Russian people and want to get Russia back on track.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Much has been going wrong in relations with Russia for years and is piling up: in order to turn this process around again, we need confidence-building instead of self-righteousness and great power, we need empathy instead of emotions or political fog candles, we need a clear increase in joint discussion and, above all, cooperation instead of further spirals of escalation or exclusion. Only those who want to assert themselves right-wing or driven by selfish interests, be it political or economic, step on the accelerator of escalation or that of over-pre-division on both sides. These would be important political axioms against which a report on the question of how to proceed in relations with Russia would have to be measured. But that is precisely what the rapporteur does not do. At the same time, it eludes the question of why relations with Russia are where they are and what this state of affairs has to do with our policy. Where the analysis is lacking, however, no strategy, even a common one, can arise, so there is only room for the game over gangs on the eve of the next EU summit, which is supposed to continue to wave through the sanctions against Russia, which are increasingly openly questioned by the Member States. The report should obviously not seek a way out of the impasse in relations, but should also help to discipline governments and, at the same time, help to promote processes of integration.

Mr Scholz, you too are one of those who, in the last few days around the Elmau Summit, have repeatedly asked Germany, around the Elmau Summit, whether European policy towards Russia, the international policy of democratic governments, is not an insult to President Putin. This is a psychological argument that responds to what the European Union has done so far. What have we done and why have we done so? Something catastrophic has really happened in Ukraine since last spring. Not only has the country lost a large part of its territory – much of its industrial base has been destroyed – but it has killed well over 5000 people in that country, tens of thousands of people have been injured and crippled, we have thousands of traumatised children who have lived for months in the cellars of Donetsk and Luhansk. Although a plane in which many Western Europeans have sat has also been shot down, we in the European Union have not reacted militarily and as a great power, but we have responded with economic sanctions, diplomacy and negotiations. And this is extremely important for the European Union and its self-image, it is a change for the better and a change that just goes to the idea of soft power and has absolutely nothing to do with these ideas of great power that you have just described. The Minsk agreement is so far the only relevant thing achieved, based on these other foreign policy ideas of the European Union. And that is why, in order to make progress in this attempt to restore peace to eastern Ukraine, the most important thing for me in this report by Mr Landsbergis is that we do not abandon the sanctions, but that we bind them to the implementation of the Minsk agreement in a comprehensible, even reliable way, for all parties involved. And at this point, the next summit must also be quite consistent. It does not have to be a question of whether we need more or less sanctions. It must be about strengthening our diplomacy and our negotiations with this idea of economic sanctions, which are an alternative to military escalation. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe, however, that we should also talk about ourselves and great other changes. I think Donald Tusk was right when he proposed the Energy Union as a response to dependence on Russia.

This report mentions many times violations of democratic principles, the rule of law and human rights in Russia. It stresses corruption and the threat of the country's freedom of expression and information.  Clearly, many of these critical issues are absolutely true, but I wonder why, for years, they have always been ignored and deliberately forgotten, when relations with Russia were so convenient to many of our states, that I also remember so many beautiful photos of our former prime ministers and presidents arm in arm with Putin? I wonder why, let us forget to point out that, as far as corruption and discrimination against certain categories of the population are due, today's Ukraine is certainly no better placed than Russia? This has also happened, including with Libya, and I could mention Gaddafi, I could mention many other cases as well.

I want to see if there will be all these defenders of conditionality, the strict application of cross compliance or whether the business as usual will continue in that case.  China, which is then one of the great beneficiaries of our relative policy, given that instead of seeking balance, we have pushed Russia, its traditional adversary and now increasingly close energy partners – see Western and Eastern Route projects – into its arms, economic, military and political.  And on the subject of energy, I wanted to say to the rapporteur that when it comes to European resilience, I would like to remind him that the only possible one is based not so much on diversification, but on a real new deal on renewable energies, which would guarantee our energy independence. I will always be on the side of those who want real conditionality, always, and not on that of those who have memory gaps in command, nor on that of those who seek pretexts for a crazy arms race, taking away resources indispensable to our peoples, especially the Mediterranean ones, who are now on their knees because of the crisis and the sanctions that are affecting ourselves more than hitting Russia.

Indeed, we are now experiencing a major crisis in our relations with Russia, because russia is no longer, as we said, a strategic partner. It is a very aggressive power, both in terms of its domestic policy and in terms of its external relations.  At the domestic level, we know that it is no longer possible to talk about a democratic regime. It is a regime confiscated by a party and personalised, which creates a huge problem in political dialogue. Dialogue which, moreover, is no longer possible. We are far from direct and sincere exchanges with this part of the world.  I would then like to say that it is still becoming unbearable to hear the voices of our colleagues who reproduce the messages from Moscow as they are. It's like the 1980s with this false pacifist discourse, held precisely by people who are - in some cases - paid directly by Moscow. It's still unacceptable. To this, the European Union must respond with very harsh sanctions in order to silence the voices of those unconscious who speak to us from countries sotipended by Moscow. I'm sick of it.

This report is not just about what happened in Ukraine, but some of the spirit of Minsk – which Members across this Chamber have said they want to see upheld – should also be demonstrated in how Members conduct the debate and in the content of it. That is a comment aimed at those who seek simply to criticise Russia and ramp up the rhetoric, but it includes those from Syriza in Greece, to the Front National in France, to the United Kingdom Independence Party, whose almost uncritical support for the current position of Russia is deeply dangerous. There can be no business as usual with Russia. It is right that Russia was excluded from the G7 meeting this week, because its politicians and people need to understand that if you break international law, you cannot expect to contribute to international law-making. I have to say that I join the condemnation of the blacklisting of 89 EU politicians. I am worried by the tit-for-tat inclusion of travel bans on politicians on both sides. I would like to see politicians able to travel and to meet together. That is not to deny that we have serious disagreements, but because the only way such disagreements could ever be resolved is through dialogue and negotiation and, with due courtesy, I make the same point to President Schulz. That is why Russia’s politicians and media should also notice paragraph 4 of the report, where we explicitly say our objective is a return to constructive dialogue and that we set conditions for that, which are both realistic and achievable. It is why we identify in this report not simply the differences but also the shared interests we have with Russia. I have just come back from Iran, where the Russian offer on nuclear enrichment could be a key part of securing a nuclear deal, but where Russian exportation of missiles to Iran equally threatens a very different future. In Syria, too, we want Russia to engage and not to block international diplomacy, which recognises the overriding need to end violence and to hold to account those responsible for that violence. If Russia does not want to be seen as a military aggressor and as anti-democratic, it must not simply align itself with others who clearly are, and if Russia wants to be treated with respect and as a partner – and I reiterate that we would like to return to a situation where that is our relationship – then Russia could take a strong step towards that by genuinely engaging with us and other international partners on Iran and Syria, and in other international conflicts, to demonstrate that cooperation is possible and that interests are indeed shared.

You completely underestimated Russia’s resolve in Eastern Europe and now the citizens of eastern Ukraine are paying the price for your folly.

There is no such improvement, and that is why there is no return on sanctions at the moment. On the other hand, it is also clear that this can be a two-way path, free according to the motto 'more for more and less for less'.

The blacklist is clearly a step in the wrong direction. I very much agree with colleagues and colleagues saying this. I would add – and we probably do not all agree on this – that the inclusion of Duma deputies on the sanctions list was also a mistake, and is perhaps the only mistake that strikes me about the sanctions. After all, it cannot be right in the long term for the Lavrovs and Putins and Medvedevs to be available as interlocutors, but parliamentary dialogue is not. In this respect, we should consider how we can maintain this parliamentary dialogue in the future at a level that is appropriate and does not contradict what has been said so far.

The conflict in Ukraine is a threat to security and peace throughout Europe. I believe that as long as Putin rules Russia, the course will not change, but we must maintain and extend our sanctions against Russia. There is no doubt that when we look at our energy policy in Europe, it says to me at least that we need to become independent in the long term, because this conflict will not be resolved here and now.

Mr President, the tension in relations between Russia and the European Union will continue. This is because the outlook for the Russian economy has deteriorated, particularly after the fall in international oil and gas prices. President Putin chooses confrontation with the West as a means of rallying Russian public opinion around a regime that cannot effectively address the problems of everyday life.  The European response to this challenge should be economic, since that is where we have the comparative advantage.

I am convinced that the Russian people are not willing to make war; they want peace, like all of us. Therefore Russia is capable of change, and that change will come from within. We have to support those who still dare to speak out for democracy and human rights in an atmosphere of suppression, murders, poisonings and harassment. It is up to the EU to show and encourage the Russian leadership that the path of folly and aggression will not pay for Russia. We continue to stand with good intentions towards Russia; but saying that, it is commitments first rather than incentives first. Once the Minsk Agreement is implemented and Crimea is set on the path to be returned, Europe will be ready to engage with Russia. At the same time we have to be conscious about the influence that the Russian leadership is trying to gain within the EU, trying to divide us and not let us be united. We have heard that – some of it today, here in this House – from some of the politicians as if they were under the influence of the Kremlin. The Kremlin will have to decide which path to take, but the EU will take its time to become more united, more resilient to propaganda, to trade pressures and energy wars.

Finally, we must come to terms with the fact that the current situation is not the result of unpredictable coincidences, but of deliberate actions by Russian politicians. They clearly want the situation in Ukraine to escalate and relations with Western countries to deteriorate. To this end, Russian aircraft and military ships violate our territorial space. To this end, World Trade Organisation rules are being violated and energy raw materials are being used as a foreign policy instrument.

Instead of spending large resources as if it were to deal with the threat from the West, it would be wise for Russia to focus on the real security threats, which certainly do not rely on the West, but from the South, and these threats are common in Europe and Russia. Thus, the normalisation of EU-Russian relations requires Russia to see the world as it is now, not in the pattern of 20th-century confrontation.

Last year, under your leadership, you successfully mastered very difficult situations with the formation of a government of national unity. Now you can tackle the economic and sustainable development of your country with great strength and broad support. The geographical location of your country between the two large and powerful states – the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China – is certainly not always easy; we have just talked about this in our bilateral discussion. Mongolia's achievements are all the more impressive, not least because of what you call the third-party policy. Mongolia is certainly a beacon in the region. That is why it is particularly important for us – and we are pleased, Mr President – that your country will host the next ASEM Summit in June 2016. This ASEM Summit is certainly essential for building bridges between Europe and Asia and for finding common solutions to the manifold regional and global problems. I am quite sure that we can make great progress in your country's capital.

Thank you, Mr President, for inviting me. Thank you, Members of the European Parliament, for giving me this opportunity to share my views with you, the distinguished representatives of 28 sovereign states of this great continent – Europe. I am the youngest of eight sons. For generations, my family lived as nomadic herdsmen in the western highlands of my country, in the ranges of the Altai Mountains. My mother and father never dreamed that, one day, their youngest son would speak from this respected podium to the most caring hearts of democracy: the European Parliament. (Applause) But this is not about me. I am here to speak for my people about my country. I am proud of my motherland, Mongolia. I am proud of our history, our culture, our traditions and the natural beauty that surrounds us. But most of all I am proud of our spirit and our values. The brief story of my country’s modern history and our journey to democracy will sound familiar to many of you. In the early 1920s, Mongolia came under communist rule, which lasted for seven decades. During the Stalinist purges one out of every six adult men was killed. More than 700 Buddhist temples were burnt to ash. The foreign and domestic agents of the communist experiment targeted the very spirit of our nation. But they were not destined to win, not destined to last forever. In the end, our will to live free prevailed. (Applause) After many years, our defining moment finally arrived. On the cold morning of 10 December 1989, we organised the first unauthorised public street meeting in our capital city, Ulaanbaatar. I was fortunate enough to be chosen by my fellow democracy fighters to moderate that historic event. ‘We have remained silent for a long time: this is our time to work; this is the time for reform’ – these were my opening remarks. That morning, we demanded our rights – of freedom of assembly, of speech, of religion, and freedom of the press. We demanded the right to create a multiparty system, conduct democratic elections, and begin market reforms. It was the beginning of my country’s journey to liberty, justice and openness. That was a tough journey to embark upon. During that time, our neighbour – the Soviet Union – was intact. Its grip and control was still tight, powerful and overwhelming. In our other neighbour’s capital, the Tiananmen Square massacre had happened. Its shockwave was still fresh and influential. In Mongolia, the old regime was stubborn. The old mindset was strongly resistant to change. We organised many meetings, demonstrations and hunger strikes. We tried to eliminate every reason for violence. We always called for compromises, for peaceful solutions. Indeed, Mongolia’s democratic revolution was totally peaceful. Not a single shot was fired. Not a single window was shattered. Not a single drop of blood was shed. (Applause) A month from now, Mongolia will celebrate the 25th anniversary of its first full democratic, multiparty election. Since that historic day on 29 July 1990, we have had full-scale democratic elections for parliament seven times and for the presidency six times. And since that day, a quarter of a century ago, we have transformed from a dictatorship to a democracy, from being one of the most isolated, closed communist regimes in the world, to one of the most open. Today we have a dynamic market economy, and a vibrant, plural, creative society. Our per capita GDP has increased more than 20-fold. Our private sector now produces more than 80% of our gross domestic product. I want to talk about some of the virtues at the core of our young democracy, virtues we hope to strengthen in the coming years through cooperation with our partners in Europe and elsewhere. Individual freedom is the cornerstone of our democracy. Mongolians love freedom because we have earned it through hard work. Government in a free country is not the property of any specific group of people. In order to sustain a healthy society, we must keep nurturing and challenging it every day. The beauty of freedom is that it is a learning process. It is the healing system of human society. We can make mistakes, but mistakes will not cost us our lives, as in a dictatorship. That is why we love freedom. (Applause) Mongolia is among the top countries in the world in terms of the number of media tools used per capita. We have only three million citizens, but it feels like there are three million journalists too! This is great. People have the right to question authority. Transparency and interaction make us stronger. That is why Mongolia is proud to be chairing the Freedom Online Coalition. We will use this opportunity to promote access to the internet for all. We will support the UN’s effort to create a comprehensive convention on internet freedom. As our society becomes more open, we increasingly hear voices concerned for safety. But we should not depart from universal values in response to today’s security concerns. We see that violent extremism continues to evolve and threaten but, by contrast, our commitment to freedom, tolerance and peace must stay unbending. I therefore applaud the European Parliament for its brilliant initiative to adopt a charter of fundamental digital rights in the 21st century. Let us continue to work together to advance this great digital revolution. (Applause) I want to say a few words on elections, government and accountability. New technologies have been vital to the health of our democracy. In our last three elections we used electronic voting machines and a biometric voter registration system. These fraud-prevention measures assure voters that their participation will make a difference. Of course, instilling confidence in government goes beyond elections. Mongolians are deeply interested in how the government spends their hard-earned tax money. To ensure transparency, we have developed a very effective monitoring system – the ‘Glass Account Law’ – that mandates online disclosure of public expenditure. One challenge we face is the growing size of government. In response to new challenges, government functions tend to increase and government becomes bigger, more bureaucratic, and more distant. Technology has the opposite tendency: it becomes smaller, more functional, and more user-friendly over time. To tackle this, I put forward a smart government initiative, which incorporates new technologies to allow our Government constantly to adapt to new challenges. Turning briefly to corruption: corruption is an infectious disease that grows in darkness. It destroys the fundamentals of a fair, just and secure society. It scares away honest partners and investors. It robs people of opportunity and devours the fruits of their hard work. To exterminate this evil, we must shine a light on corruption – ensuring that it is exposed and that those responsible for it do not escape justice. I am proud to say that, in just four years, Mongolia has risen from 120th to 80th place on Transparency International’s corruption index. We still have work to do, but we are making good progress in cleaning up our beloved country. We have also made progress in the sphere of human rights. The foundation of justice is respect for human dignity, central to which is the sanctity of human life. Under no circumstances is capital punishment acceptable. (Applause) Before 18 June 2009, Mongolia was regarded by Amnesty International as one of the worst countries in terms of capital punishment. That was the day I took my oath as President of Mongolia. That same day I saw on my desk two draft decrees. I had to make the choice on whether or not to have two men executed. I chose life, and I kept to my decision – and I began delivering that message to the public and to our decision-makers. (Applause) It was not easy to exercise leadership on this issue, but in 2012 my country ratified the UN’s International Covenant which aims at the abolition of the death penalty. There have been no executions in Mongolia since June 2009. Let me be clear: capital punishment is ineffective and barbaric. From this podium I would like to thank the EU and all our European friends who support and encourage us on this important cause. (Applause) Honourable Members, reform of the judiciary is imperative for us. Reforming our legislative and judicial frameworks is an important part of the efforts to build a free and fair society. It has been one of my priorities, and we have taken great steps to modernise all aspects of the justice system, from police and prosecutors to courts and judges. People’s confidence in a fair court of law is being restored. A free society must also be an inclusive one. Women are the backbone of the family and the bedrock of a nation. They bring life into the world. Often it is they who care for the old, the sick, and those in need. They are our mothers, our sisters and our daughters. For society to advance, we need more women in public service at all levels, from local to global. (Applause) I am proud to report that, at our last election, we tripled the number of women in our Parliament. With more women in power, I think we would have more harmony, more engagement, less suffering and less conflict. (Applause) I would also like to say a word about education. Education is the ground on which our future success will be built. I went from a family of herdsmen to Harvard. I want other young people to have the same opportunity. We are working hard to build our capacity in schools, universities and other academic institutions. We are particularly grateful for being able to draw on the expertise of the Council of Europe’s education programmes to strengthen our institutions. I understand that all democracies should not look the same. We have to respect differences. Democracy is a representative form of government. In any nation it should reflect the cultures and traditions. But in every decent society you will see a common trend: democracies limit the power of the state; they tend to be responsive to their people’s grievances; they protect human rights, with impartial and consistent rule of law; they support healthy civic institutions, independent media and judiciary; they fight corruption, invest in human capital and recognise gender equality; and they allow people to choose their leaders in free and fair elections. Mr President, honourable Members, these are all issues on which Mongolia and Europe share common values and on which we value your cooperation. Mongolia and Europe are old friends, as shown by a letter from the Mongol Ulziit Khan to Philippe le Bel, which dates back 710 years. It says: ‘How can we consign to oblivion the friendship our forefathers, grandfathers, fathers and brothers so cherished, who, being far apart yet feeling near, exchanged words of wisdom and gifts of peace?’ It is in this same spirit that I speak today of opening a new chapter in Mongolian-European relations. With the fall of communism, relations between Mongolia and Europe have again blossomed. Your financial, technical and humanitarian assistance and cooperation greatly aided our efforts to build a free, democratic society, and for that we are grateful. In 2014, Mongolia and the EU celebrated the 25th anniversary of our diplomatic relations. I see the cooperation between the European Parliament and the Mongolian State Great Khural as being crucial to the continued strengthening of our partnership. We have already made great strides together, including the establishment of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between Mongolia and the EU. I would like to thank the Member States that have ratified that agreement. There are now more opportunities than ever for European investment. First-rate European companies are coming to Mongolia to invest, often in partnership with our companies. As the Government takes steps to improve the investment climate, such opportunities are rapidly increasing. We hope many of you will see our country’s beauties and its potential at first hand in 2016 when Mongolia proudly hosts the 11th Asia-Europe Meeting. I sincerely look forward to welcoming the leaders of the EU and of the Member States to my country, and I assure you it will be a memorable summit. Mr President, honourable Members, Mongolia’s commitment to international cooperation is strong. We recently launched an initiative called the Forum of Asia. We hope this will serve as a much-needed mechanism to promote the regional integration of all sovereign nations in Asia, promoting equal representation of their diverse interests. My government is now working to finalise this concept and is inviting interested parties to contribute ideas that will aid its realisation. Friends, Mongolia does not have any intention to lecture others about democracy. Yet we do have lessons to share. With Kyrgyzstan, we are sharing our lessons learned in building effective parliamentary democracy and enacting legal reforms. With Afghanistan, we are conducting training for diplomats and public servants. With Myanmar, we are hosting media workers, journalists and civil society members. With North Korea, we are engaging in economic and security dialogues. We strongly believe Mongolia can make a substantial contribution to regional security in North-East Asia and beyond. We understand the consequences of the Cold War. Because of our experiences under both communism and democracy, we are uniquely suited to serve as an honest broker in promoting peace and security in that region. As part of our efforts to build regional understanding, in 2013 I announced the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on North-East Asian Security, an initiative similar to the Helsinki dialogue. We have hosted a number of meetings and conferences on topics beyond security matters, such as energy, women and nuclear issues. My country has been pursuing nuclear-weapon-free status for 23 years. (Applause) In 2012, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council signed a joint declaration reaffirming our nuclear-weapon-free status. While nuclear power may remain a viable energy option for some, any nation seeking to build nuclear power must not endanger the peace and security of their independent neighbours. We take seriously our common responsibility to promote peace. The Mongolian military proudly wear blue helmets and serve along with fellow UN peacekeepers to maintain international order and security. Mongolia has become one of the 20 largest peacekeeping contributors in the world. So far, more than 12 000 Mongolian peacekeepers have served on active duty in hotspots around the world. This is a significant number if you consider the small size of our population. We Mongols are proud to serve, and proud to contribute. Mr President, honourable Members, once again, I would like to thank the European Council, the European Union, the European Commission, and you, the European Parliament, as well as the nations of Europe, for constantly supporting my country, Mongolia. The Mongols say: ‘The finest of men is tested in need. The finest of horses is tested in riding.’ You were with us when we needed your support the most. You were with us when we needed your voice of encouragement. You are always with Mongolia, complimenting us on our success and helping in our challenges. The EU is the world’s premier invention for advancing global prosperity, peace and harmony. Mongolia will be a strategic anchor for the EU in the East, helping to advance our shared values and interests and working to build peace, democracy and engagement in Asia.

It is a regrettable fact that women continue to be discriminated against in many areas of life. The report rightly points out that equality between women and men is, among other things, an important economic resource for promoting just and inclusive economic growth. It is an unsustainable situation that lower salaries for women inevitably lead to lower pension contributions, which, of course, means lower pensions.

I consider the most important chapters on women in the labour market to aim at reducing the employment gap, the wage and pension gap, which are 11%, 17% and 39% respectively in Europe. As a result, women are poorer than men and more likely to be victims of domestic and sexual violence. Economic independence and equal opportunities for access to the labour market, including high positions, are important demands of this report.  On issues that differentiate positions within the group, I voted in favour of the Maternity Directive, quotas on company boards, the anti-violence directive and the European Observatory on Violence, incentives for paternity and parental leave, easier access to in vitro, quotas on electoral lists, access to health and reproductive rights services, education in this area and incentives for gender research and studies.

The report raises better the issue of women's rights, the discrimination they face in different aspects of life and gender equality as a whole. Instead of a programme focused on former 'equality between women and men', we therefore took a broader role. We live in 2015 in a Europe where one third of women have faced physical or sexual violence in their adult lives, and where women's employment is still more challenging in many places than men and the employment rate as full-time work is just over 50%. The pay gap between women and men is 16.4 per cent and the pension gap is as much as 39 per cent. There is no economic growth or prosperity when half the working-age population is underrepresented in the labour market. The solutions to these problems will help not only women, but also men, for example, in helping to reconcile the work and home life of parents with young children. Finnish women, too, are faced with an outrageous amount of violence that is too rarely addressed. The differences in wages and pensions are almost as bad for us as in many other EU countries.

The distribution of counterfeits is best shown by the fact that 72% of counterfeits were found in small packages shortly before they were delivered to final customers.  As a result, the EU, as a leader in new technologies and the place of origin of most manufacturers from whom products are foremaved, needs better coordination between foreign and domestic policy and better awareness among consumers of the potentially harmful effects of these products on their health.

I would like to thank Mr Svoboda for his report on respect for intellectual property. We all hope that this legislature will finally lead to the introduction of long-awaited reforms to the digital agenda and copyright. It is an economic necessity, it is an ever-increasing cultural need.  I believe that any legislative proposal for a reform of the sector, as mr Svoboda rightly does in the report that Mr Svoboda has presented to us, must start from the absolute and legitimate recognition of intellectual property, the fair remuneration for artists, the promotion of the high social and cultural value that copyright assumes as a legal institution. Attempting to relativise these fundamental principles will not benefit the European economy or support the promotion of a more mature and conscious legal and civic culture. I emphasise this because I agree, as the report states, with the lack of information and perception from citizens and consumers, especially younger consumers, about the permitted uses of cultural products online.  Information and awareness-raising campaigns are essential, but they are not enough: as legislators, we must be able to take up the challenge of bringing about legislation that anticipates the future, a system of rules that can be compatible with subsequent technological developments and social changes. I believe that we should ensure that the general context of the digital agenda stimulates investment in innovation and the introduction of new models and forms of cultural use. I am convinced that, however much rules we can introduce to combat piracy and counterfeiting, the best solution always remains to expand the legal offer through a new and simpler (but more certain) legal framework in this area. I therefore call on my fellow Members to consider European copyright reforms in their overall approach and open to the synthesis of multiple demands, without ideological demands for position but with a concrete approach, which aims to facilitate solutions also on other expected measures that can increase the supply and cross-border availability of digital content, such as new consumer protection regulations , the development of e-commerce, the approximation of VAT rates and the strengthening of digital networks.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 769, "date": "2015-06-09.json", "name": "Arne Gericke (ECR)", "mepid": "124815", "text": "  Writing.

Conservative parties in Parliament have been pushing for ‘market-based solutions’ to be the dominant approach to IPR, but if this approach is applied blindly across the line, how do we ensure affordable access to knowledge for our students, academics, SMEs and others? Also, while proper enforcement of IPR rules is paramount, we should focus on commercial-scale infringements rather than going after private customers and consumers.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the text on which we will vote tomorrow forms the basis for the conclusion of the Doha Amendment by the European Union and lays down the conditions for the joint fulfilment of commitments by the European Union, its Member States and Iceland, which will then be dealt with in detail by my colleague, Giovanni La Via. The text defines, as you know, the obligations of the second Kyoto commitment, the so-called Doha Amendment, from 2013 to 2020 and, above all, requires Member States to take the necessary measures to complete their national ratification processes by the third quarter of 2015.  Although the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol and the joint fulfilment of the relevant commitments is certainly a positive step, it must nevertheless be stressed that it is above all the countries of the European Union that participate in the second commitment period, while some of the most polluting countries unfortunately do not participate. In this context, I believe that it is appropriate for the Union to use all possible political, diplomatic and economic instruments available to ensure that an international agreement is reached in Paris at the end of the year, as comprehensive as possible, also in order to break this long tradition, in which the European Union, very often alone, makes all its climate commitments. In this sense, last week's G7 meeting marks, albeit with lights and shadows, some important points towards this goal. In particular, I would like to mention the cut in greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 70 % in 2050 compared to 2010 levels and the commitment to contain the increase in global temperatures in 2 centigrade, seem important points, others are important. Just as at the G7 meeting there appeared to be a desire, particularly at german pressure, to phase out the use of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal during this century.  Chancellor Merkel called it the decarbonization of the global economy. This, however, seems to me to be a project that is practically difficult to implement. We know that a number of European countries, on the other hand, have, in contrast, increased the use of fossil fuels with a high environmental impact, including lignite in particular. So, if this is the scenario at European level, with lights and shadows, we find on the other side of the Ocean Obama who seems to be giving signals that also go in the direction of an effective contrast to global warming, at least in the intentions because, as we know, Obama's policy in the words of some illustrious political commentators, Obama's policy precisely , seems to have a weak point precisely on the environment, and so I believe that, as the G7 communiqué concluded, the challenge can only be overcome by a global response. So, even if the G7 countries were to eliminate all carbon monoxide emissions from tomorrow, the problem of climate change would not be solved. Here the emerging countries must also make their own contribution: to abandon the rhetoric of differentiated responsibility between rich and emerging countries. In this context, the Kyoto Protocol 2, which requires the parties to communicate, I do not have time to mention everything now, is an important step in the right direction and I really hope that the Paris Summit will finally be that day when we can applaud a binding global agreement to which we will all contribute with Europe, as commissioner always strongly at the head of this process as a global leader.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 891, "date": "2015-06-09.json", "name": "Giovanni La Via", "mepid": "96816", "text": "   Rapporteur. Madam President, Commissioner Cañete, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are about to deal with concerns the signing by the European Union of an agreement between the Eu ropean Union and its Member States on the one hand and Iceland on the other, on Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment of the commitments of the European Union and its Member States for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  I do not repeat what Mrs Gardini said, reconstructing the history of the Kyoto Protocol and commitments, but I would remind you that at the twentieth Conference of the Parties in Lima in December 2014, the appeal made encouraged all 192 parties and the Kyoto Protocol to ratify the amendment. As of 14 May 2015, this amendment had been ratified by 31 countries. But for it to enter into force, it needs to be ratified by 144 other parties. Specifically, I would like to point out that Iceland is already part of Annex 1 to the Kyoto Protocol and has achieved its individual target for the first commitment period, during which it was to limit the increase in emissions to less than 10% on average.  In the end, Iceland's emissions fell on average during that period. In 2009, Iceland expressed its intention to fulfil its commitments in a second commitment period jointly with the European Union and its Member States. Iceland also participates in the Eu ropean Union emissions trading scheme, the so-called ETS, and in the Eu ropean Union regulation on the MMR monitoring mechanism for greenhouse gases. It has therefore fully embarked on this path, as are the other 28 Member States of the European Union. Iceland is therefore interested in joint compliance with the European Union and its Member States, whether or not it joins the Union.  In conclusion, I believe that this agreement will be a strong signal, which will highlight coordinated European efforts to combat climate change at international level, especially in view of the forthcoming COP 21 in Paris. The European Union, as has already been said, has a world-leading position in the fight against climate change and has always supported an ambitious climate policy. We are leaders at international level and we are political leaders, we are leading the fight against climate change and we must do so with greater commitment and even more commitment in the run-up to Paris, stepping up efforts for an ambitious, comprehensive and legally binding agreement. In this overall framework of commitments, Iceland has so far played its part, it is continuing along the path together with the other 28 States of the European Union, and that is why I believe it is appropriate, in this context, to call on all my fellow Members to support this ratification, which supports our European action on climate change and will also be able to contribute with iceland's small contribution to the current international debate on reducing emissions globally. I therefore call on all my fellow Members to support the ratification of this agreement, which marks a further small step towards even more ambitious agreements that we hope to reach at the end of the year in Paris.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 892, "date": "2015-06-09.json", "name": "Miguel Arias Cañete", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, let me start by welcoming today’s debate. First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Ms Gardini and Mr La Via, for their work on the recommendations on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol and the Agreement between the European Union, its Member States and Iceland concerning Iceland’s participation in the joint fulfilment of commitments. The same also applies, of course, to the shadow rapporteurs for the file. I welcome the suggestions in the recommendations to give consent for the conclusion of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol and to the joint fulfilment agreement with Iceland. Ratification will give an important signal to the international community that we stand by our commitments. This is especially significant this year in the run-up to the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, to be held in Paris in December this year. The second phase of the Kyoto Protocol serves as a bridge towards a post-2020 global climate change agreement. In this context, the European Union and its Member States, acting jointly – together with Iceland – have committed to reducing their emissions during the period 2013-2020 to 20% below their levels of 1990 or other chosen base years. We are already implementing and, as a result of robust policies, are on track to meet the target. The Commission welcomes the texts transmitted by the Council to the Parliament for consent. The draft ratification decision enables the European Union, as a Party to the Kyoto Protocol, to formally ratify the Doha Amendment. It also sets out the terms according to which the European Union, its Member States and Iceland, will fulfil their emissions reduction commitments jointly. The draft ratification decision is consistent with the 2009 Climate and Energy Package and does not change any national targets set in the climate and energy package, nor does it change the emissions cap of the European Union Emissions Trading System. However, the ratification has gained significant value in the international climate change negotiations and is a demonstration of our continued commitment to the UNFCCC process. Iceland participates in the joint fulfilment on the same basis as the Member States. To ensure that Iceland and the Member States are treated alike, the emission level for Iceland was determined in a way that is consistent both with the Doha Amendment and with Union legislation, including the 2009 Climate and Energy Package and the principles and criteria on which objectives in that legislation are based. Finally, I would like to invite you to support the texts in front of you. Ratification of the Doha Amendment will show that, as the world prepares for the adoption of a new global climate agreement, the European Union stands by its commitments.

At the moment, of course, it seems difficult to give up fossil fuels altogether.

We must take climate protection seriously, and I would like to end by quoting a very conservative American senator, John Warner, who once introduced a climate change law in the United States that did not have a majority at the time.

That is only a small step; we have got to be doing much more.

I can think of no better way of stating the obvious, which is that we have many more steps to take – but because a distance is far does not mean we should not be pushing as hard as we possibly can. Right now, the Scottish Government have announced that they have failed to meet their ambitious climate change targets for the reduction of carbon dioxide. That is unfortunate, but we should in no way condemn them for it. Rather, we should ask them again how much more they can do to push forward.

In quoting the newspapers I would like to praise Chancellor Merkel for her leadership not only at the G7 but also on the energy transition in Germany. At the G7 in particular, however, I think what she did in the last couple of days showed leadership. We heard extremely strong language coming out of the G7 meeting this week. But these are words, words and more words – and the words are not new, because in 2007 the G7 embraced the target of not exceeding two degrees centigrade, and in 2008, at the Climate Conference in Cancún, the same was done. So words are important, but even more important is how they are interpreted, and the deeds that follow. Talking about the interpretation of words, let me quote the Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, speaking after the G7 meeting. He said: ‘We should not fool ourselves: nobody is going to start to shut down their industries.’ I guess that is the whole point. If we want to avoid the closure of industries, we need extremely ambitious policy. We need new technology, we need alternatives for current industries. Only in that way, via very ambitious policy, can we avoid the future closure of our industries.

The Kyoto Protocol was signed back in 1997, but has never been ratified by the biggest polluters such as the US or China. I would like to remind all my colleagues here that, after the Protocol was definitively refused to ratify the United States, its fate depended on Russia.  Yes, it was that, as some say, a terrible Russia, which has been depicted here for the past year often as the very bottom of hell that made the fight against climate change possible at all. If Russia could sign this agreement, I do not see a single strong argument as to why the Protocol and its amendment could not be signed by our most important trading partner, the United States of America.  In Doha in 2012, the Parties to the Protocol adopted an amendment introducing a second commitment period between 2013 and 2020. Yes, the fact that the EU and Iceland will continue to participate in the second control period of the Protocol helps our fight against climate change, but this is quite negligible when we cannot ensure the participation of the largest polluters, such as China, India or the United States, whose share of emissions was only about 36% in the original protocol.  It must be said loud and clear: current emissions from the EU and Iceland are not a problem, it is a mere gesture on the part of the EU.

To be honest, I think that these votes will not be the tightest we will see tomorrow. There is another issue on the agenda, so I would like to broaden the scope a bit, not only because of what we have seen at the G7 but also because, as we speak, there are negotiations ongoing in Bonn. What is striking is that everyone is brilliant with words. We are all willing to have global decarbonisation at the end of the century. We are reducing our emissions by 2050 – with a total shift in our energy system. So it all sounds great, and indeed we have to thank Chancellor Merkel for getting some of those words in, but at the same time we know that climate change will not stop because of words. It will stop only because of action, and I have some questions in that regard – mainly to the Commissioner, because I foresee some problems, including with the Commission’s input. For example, at this moment in Bonn, India is asking whether the EU wants to step up its ambition level before 2020, which is one of the negotiation tracks. The EU can do that very easily, for example by elimination of the huge surplus of allowances. But the EU is refusing to do it, and that is, of course, greatly annoying to India, which will be an important country in Paris. So what is the EU going to do to help a country like India? Because another issue where India is having a problem is the global phase-out of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Is the EU going to propose, as part of the Montreal Protocol, a global phase-out there, or are we only going for words? That is something else I would like to know from the Commission. On the question of the transformation of the energy sector, I do not see why the Commission is, at the same time, going to North Africa and doing a lot of deals on gas – giving us a huge lock-in to gas – whereas we are talking about decarbonisation for the longer term.

Every euro that is not invested in our industrial economy to produce what we need here is a euro that funds globalisation, pollution and, therefore, CO2 production. However, our production standards are of the highest standard. So let's end our companies and SMEs cutting their means of production and innovation.  The United States recently submitted its contribution to COP21. They say they want to reduce their carbon footprint by 26%, but an American will still pollute five times more than a French person, for example. So, is that really credible and acceptable? How can we still negotiate a free trade treaty with the United States and, at the same time, pretend to want to reduce pollution? Everything is implemented in total schizophrenia, without a global vision and without a real perception of the issues.

If we put the cart in front of the horse, nothing goes forward. Now let's think about it for a second! We all know that in order to reduce the threat of global warming, we need to reduce CO2 emissions. That's where we agree. The question is just how we do it best and best to do it. If we look at the world as a whole, in 2007. In 2005, the G8 estimated that CO2 emissions would have to be reduced by 50% by 2050 – half – but now the European Union is about a tenth of all global emissions – around 10-12%, not more – which means that even if we reduce to zero in Europe, if we no longer have emissions, we will still not meet this 50% target. So we don't need to put a cart in front of the horse. We need to ensure that the large emitter economies – the United States, it is China – finally sign such protocols and also begin to reduce their emissions, because if in Europe we take the burden of all that on our shoulders, we will not only achieve common targets because we do not have so much emissions, we will continue to sink the European economy into global competition.

In Europe, we are making good progress in reducing CO2 emissions in certain areas, such as industrial, energy or housing sectors. This work must continue.  On the other hand, we continue to see CO2 emissions in the transport sector increase due to forms of mobility that we have not yet changed, either because we are stuck with sectoral interests, or the existence of technological barriers, or the need for large investments to make the transition to a new paradigm of mobility. Let us not forget, however, that there are also opportunities for green growth that will be triggered by this investment. If we don't take advantage of them, someone else will.  At the international level, it is imperative to make decisions and these can only be taken at the highest level.

And, as I said in my first speech, Parliament's decision to adopt this amendment and Iceland's process will send an important signal to the international community that the European Union continues to strongly support the process of negotiating a new international agreement on climate change, under the auspices of the United Nations, and that we maintain our commitments , which is especially significant this year, before COP 21 in Paris. Many of you, in the context of this debate, have referred to the G-7 agreements, and let me make an assessment. The Commission welcomes the G-7's fundamental commitments to take the necessary measures to ensure that global warming does not exceed 2oC from pre-industrial levels. More specifically, however, the G-7 declaration also includes a medium-term target of reduction at the top of the recommendation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, between 40 and 70 %, and a long-term target of 100% emission reduction by the year 2100. As you all know, the 2050 target is a target that the European Union wants to see incorporated into the Paris agreement, because this medium-term objective will allow us to assess whether collective efforts are sufficient to prevent the increase in the world's temperature by 2oC and to periodically review the level of our ambitions. Therefore, this decision, contained in the final joint communiqué, is an important step forward to the December Climate Summit in Paris. Moreover, it is positive that all G-7 countries, except Japan, have already presented their national adaptation and mitigation commitments, the so-called \"INDC\", although Japan announced yesterday that they are in the final phase of internal consultations, so we expect its INDC to be approved in the coming weeks.  Let us remember that the countries that ratified Kyoto at the time, the 28 in the European Union plus Austria, Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein and New Zealand accounted for 14% of emissions. At the moment, 37 countries have made adaptation and mitigation commitments, which account for 30% of global emissions, giving the idea that we are on track for all Parties to the Convention to be able to submit mitigation commitments and to cover 100% of emissions. It is true that for the time being only the 28 countries of the European Union have ratified it plus Switzerland, Mexico, Russia, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Canada, Morocco, Norway and the United States, but we are already at an emissions level of 30%. In addition, the G-7 reiterated the binding nature of the agreement and was determined to financially support the Green Climate Fund and to implement other mechanisms to support the most vulnerable countries.  If it is joined that it was agreed to make possible throughout this century a global economy in which fossil energy sources are not used and that clean energy production was encouraged before 2050, the overall assessment of the G-7 agreements is frankly positive and puts the European Union in a very positive position for negotiation , especially if, by the time we arrive in Paris, we will have already presented , or very soon we will present it – our new STD system, the European emission allowance system. Some people want us to present it immediately, we are working on it right now, but in any case the European Union will arrive in Paris with a new emission allowance system in which we have to address all the issues that affect this regime and in which we cannot improvise by making unique changes, but we have to set up a system that is positive , which has a functioning carbon market and which, in turn, warns of the so-called problems of carbon leakage or relocation of our industries, which has also concerned many of you.  In short, it seems to us that paving the way for ratification of the Kyoto process is very positive, especially as a signal to negotiate this ambitious, binding agreement at COP 21 in Paris, on which we are still working at the moment. We have worked to have the G-7, all countries, present its INDCs; we are now working to get them presented as soon as possible by all G20 countries, and it will be desirable that, when we arrive in Paris, a large number of countries have made mitigation and adaptation commitments that set up a much more ambitious scheme than in the past.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 932, "date": "2015-06-09.json", "name": "Elisabetta Gardini", "mepid": "58758", "text": "   Rapporteur.

The EU's pioneering action against climate change risks becoming an illusion. On Monday, member states' energy ministers ultimately did not intervene in any way in state aid for the production and use of fossil fuels. Direct payments to this industry alone amount to EUR 100 billion a year. Although the use of fossil fuels in energy production could be stopped by 2050, germany, Great Britain, France and Italy have increased the use of coal in recent years.

Dear colleagues, the energy security of the European Union is particularly important in the current geopolitical context. Europe's dependence on energy resources not only prevents us from pursuing an independent foreign policy, but also affects the competitiveness of our industry and the daily lives of all citizens. Therefore, without better communication, cooperation and speaking with third countries, Europe will not be able to ensure a unified energy policy and energy security. We must make solidarity between Member States in the event of a disruption of external energy supply not only words, but also concrete actions. I believe that we must pay particular attention to the coordinated diversification of suppliers, routes and energy sources and to the increase and promotion of local energy production. We have and can use local energy sources, and this includes fossil fuels, renewable energy sources and advanced technologies, where Europe is leading with its innovation and skilled workforce, and we must make better use of this potential. As has been said on several occasions, an efficient internal market is the basis for ensuring energy security and solidarity between Member States. We need to pay sufficient attention to the development and optimal use of connections. It must be remembered that there are still energy islands in Europe and that their security must be integrated into continental European networks. Finding the right balance between the various energy areas will be one of the main challenges of the energy union being created.  Mr President, dear colleagues, I do not want to repeat the importance of energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and decarbonisation of the economy. As regards energy security, all energy-related topics are inevitably intertwined. I am convinced that it is equally important to implement both the internal and external energy policies of the European Union. However, I would like to draw the attention of my colleagues to the fact that in this report the issue of security must remain at the top of the area. The aim of this report is not to address how much energy efficiency we need to achieve, or how many buildings we need to renovate, but rather to set out the basic guidelines on which we will seek to ensure our safety, both in the long term and in the short term. Other energy-related issues should not be taken hostage by the issue of security, but will be subject to a more detailed examination within the framework of European Energy Union policies. Once again, we thank all and I call for support for this report in tomorrow's votes.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 942, "date": "2015-06-09.json", "name": "Miguel Arias Cañete", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   member of the Commission. – Madam President, I am pleased to take part in this debate on the European Energy Security Strategy. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to all members who will participate in it, but I am particularly grateful to Mr Saudargas and all the drafts members of the opinion for their efforts to achieve this balanced report by the European Parliament on an issue which is very current, but at the same time very sensitive. I would also like to thank you for the excellent cooperation you have had with the Commission throughout this process, providing us with many opportunities to share and explain our views. The draft report before us is an excellent result of the work and commitment to energy security, which adds to the political momentum we have wanted to give to this and other issues with the Energy Union. Let me explain why we think this is an important report. First, because it maintains and reinforces a balanced and comprehensive approach to energy security. Energy security is a very complex issue that requires action in different policy areas and various levels when it comes to decision-making. We need to keep this approach balanced if we are to successfully address this collective challenge. In this regard, the draft report reflecting the structure of the May 2014 energy security strategy seeks to respond not only to our short-term challenges, however politically sensitive they may be, but also to look further, taking into account strategic priorities, both within and outside the European Union. In this broad concept of energy security, achieving a true internal energy market is essential, as is research and innovation. I would like to congratulate myself on the fact that the draft report we are discussing today has placed particular emphasis on the need to moderate energy demand and increase domestic production, mainly from renewable energy sources. The Commission fully shares this approach. We will continue to move forward on the basis of this strong political message from Parliament, especially in the context of this year's forthcoming COP 21 Conference, with the aim of reaching a historic agreement to combat climate change. At the same time, this draft report, in its external dimension, mentions the most urgent supply problems we face and highlights in a very clear way the dependence of a single supplier on energy resources, with the vulnerability that this creates and the lack of competition, because it can impede economic growth and jeopardize security at national level of the European Union. The Commission shares this view. Therefore, we will work to diversify our sources and supply routes. To do this, we will continue to work in the southern gas corridor, the Southern Gas Corridor, the Mediterranean and Algeria, as well as relations with our traditional partners, such as Norway, the United States and Canada. I have already visited several of these countries in recent months, aware that diversification of routes and suppliers is essential for the European Union. In northern Europe, the establishment of liquefied gas hubs, with multiple suppliers, is greatly improving security of supply, and this example must be followed in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Mediterranean area. In this regard, we are preparing a liquefied natural gas and storage strategy to be adopted at the end of this year, together with the revision of the Regulation on the safety of gas supply, two essential parts for diversification of supply and to be prepared in the event of gas supply interruptions. I have also been able to see with satisfaction that the report once again stresses the need to speak with one voice on the international stage and calls on the Commission to develop a proposal for mandatory ex ante assessments of intergovernmental agreements with regard to their impact on the internal energy market and their compatibility with European Union legislation. I can assure you that the Commission is working on this and plans to submit a proposal in the first half of 2016. Finally, I would like to underline the emphasis that the draft report places on the Energy Union Strategy, adopted by the Commission in February this year. As you know, energy security is one of the three overall objectives of the Commission's Energy Union Strategy. Our energy has to be safe, competitive and sustainable. Of course, all three objectives are interdependent and go hand in hand. Therefore, the implementation of the European Energy Security Strategy has been fully integrated as a central element of the Energy Union Strategy. We are planning to publish at the end of this year the first report on the implementation of key actions related to the European Energy Security Strategy and I hope that dialogue in the European Parliament will be, throughout the process, a key pillar of our action.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 943, "date": "2015-06-09.json", "name": "Arne Lietz", "mepid": "124839", "text": "   Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.

The creation of a European Internal Energy Union must be accompanied by a coherent energy and climate foreign policy. One of the most pressing issues is undoubtedly the diversification of our energy imports and the need to speak internationally with a common European voice. However, energy and climate policy must not be limited to pure security of supply. This includes the global fight for climate protection. Europe must make better use of its foreign policy instruments in order to support European projects such as decarbonisation and the energy transition to the outside world.

Access to energy is a basic need of the people, and energy poverty is unfortunately a growing phenomenon also in Europe. The INTA therefore insists that energy security ensures affordable, sustainable, stable, secure and predictable access to energy for citizens and businesses, and must be part of an inclusive strategy for economic growth and a coherent interrelationship between EU trade and energy policies. These partnerships should be embedded in the goals of global climate protection and corresponding binding commitments in energy chapters in EU trade agreements. We call on the Commission to take strong action against environmental dumping by third countries that do not comply with international decisions. The INTA stresses that reducing dependence on one supplier should not be replaced by a new dependence on another supplier.

The report prepared by Parliament seems to me to have made this quite clear (and there is a request to the Commission to take this into account when presenting the specific legislation): to connect the networks in gas, electricity, to diversify sources, to increase energy efficiency, to make more use of domestic resources, and to learn to speak with one voice.

Our current way of life, the functioning of our economy and, in fact, the whole modern society are completely dependent on uninterrupted supply of available energy, both affordable and physically. Naturally, we must consider ensuring energy security to be one of our main priorities. Measures will not only be taken by the Member States, but measures taken by the European Union will also play an increasingly important role. That is why we need an effective and strong European strategy to meet our energy needs in the future. A strategy that will not simply be a repetition of traditional recipes for our energy problems. The view has long prevailed among experts and the public that energy security is limited to seeking access to new fossil fuels, especially oil and natural gas. That is why the discussion has very often turned to plans to build new pipelines and pipelines. This view was based on a century of dependence on these raw materials. Personally, I believe that this position is long overdue. It is the unsustainable that threatens our long-term energy security today, I would say, an unreasonable dependence on oil and natural gas. These are not just imports from countries that tend to use the so-called energy weapon to advance their foreign policy objectives. I also consider the non-critical support for mining unconventional ... (interrupted the chair speaker). The technologies used today clearly have a negative impact on citizens' health and the quality of the environment. In itself, this should be enough to prohibit hydraulic fracturing mining in the European Union.  That's not the only reason. The great danger is also that our dependence on oil and natural gas would only be extended. Thus, the extraction of these unconventional resources will only lead to a much-needed transition to a low-carbon economy being postponed again into the future. That is why our faction is tabling an amendment calling on member countries to stop the extraction of unconventional resources by hydraulic fracturing in Europe.  I am very glad that the report presented is not limited to a short-sighted effort to promote the construction of new pipelines and pipelines or to find more reliable partners. On the contrary, it comes with very concrete proposals and measures to gradually get rid of our dependence while strengthening the competitiveness of our economy. The European Energy Security Strategy must first and foremost start at home, in our European Union. We need to fundamentally change the way we use energy, or in other words, how we tend to waste it.  Energy savings are one of the least costly ways to strengthen our energy security. At the same time, lower consumption means less dependence on oil and gas imports.

I agree with Mr Kariņš that Russia is ruled by an unfriendly government which uses energy as a political weapon. We saw this happen in both 2006 and 2009 when Mr Putin decided to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine. The continuing crisis in Ukraine has only exacerbated the danger of this happening again. While improving energy efficiency and our use of renewable energy are both important, they will not have much impact on the EU’s energy dependency on Russia. If we are to relieve the focus on energy security, we should be willing to use all the tools at our disposal, including shale gas and nuclear energy. We should also encourage the development of new technologies, especially carbon capture and storage. I reject the calls in this report for binding climate and energy targets and interference in the energy mix of Member States. That is a national competence and I want it to remain so. Commissioner, the best way to ensure energy security for the whole of Europe is to have a properly interconnected single market. We need the ability to move gas and electricity around the continent, so that if one source is ever unavailable, another can be used. I would ask Members to imagine how differently we would have approached the crisis in Ukraine had we been able to replace Russian gas with imports from elsewhere. The Commission should concentrate on resolving the technical and legal issues which prevent the free exchange of energy, and they should also use their funds for projects of common interest to improve the connectivity of our energy networks.

By fundamentally changing the way we supply, distribute and consume energy, we can ensure that European citizens do not have to fear such threats in the future. I am glad that in this report we have been able to agree, across party lines, on the need to look not just at the issue of gas imports. We have taken a step further by also addressing the link between the need to reduce gas imports and the benefits that more efficient use of energy and renewables can bring. This will not only address security of supply but also offer significant opportunities for local jobs and growth within the EU through productive investment in infrastructure and renovation. Reducing dependence on fossil fuels, particularly gas and oil, has created local jobs and a competitive economy, as well as a thriving export base in the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies in my own country, Denmark.

Madam President, despite the improvements made in the report, there are significant omissions and problematic references that we cannot ignore.  Energy for us is a social development good, to which we must all have responsibility and equal access. The primary objective must therefore be to combat energy poverty. To achieve this, neoliberal austerity policies must be ended and policies to support social development and enhanced state control promoted.  That is why it is important to ensure public ownership and infrastructure management with strategic importance by the state, based on the interests of society and the people. Particularly negative in the text is the proposal for the Commission's compulsory participation in negotiations on intergovernmental agreements, as well as the ex ante and ex post evaluation of these agreements.  The GUE will not support the promotion of an energy policy controlled by the Commission, limits the sovereignty of states and reduces national flexibility in the formulation of multidimensional and efficient international energy relations. Much more so, the Commission cannot ask for increased powers, while there are significant problems in the energy supply of the Member States and also the energy isolation of many Member States, but also regions, from the Union's major energy networks continues.  In response to these problems, we welcome the proposals to exploit domestic gas sources in the eastern Mediterranean and to create a Mediterranean gas hub with LNG development, in order to exploit the prospects created in the region for the Union's energy security.

The Commission has rightly identified the fact that reducing energy dependency is a key to strengthening energy security in Europe, especially considering that approximately EUR 400 billion is spent yearly by the EU on energy imports. Yet the strategy they came up with has not managed to translate this high-level ambition into the most needed actions. The own-initiative report of the European Parliament contains several more forward—looking elements than the Commission proposal. I would like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Algirdas Saudargas, and the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive work in this regard. These achievements include the chapter entitled Moderating Energy Demand and reiterating the position of the European Parliament on 2030 climate and energy targets. However, in my opinion, this own-initiative report only gives a partial answer to energy security challenges. I fear that the extreme dependency on Russia will simply be turned into a dependency on other external fossil energy suppliers. This is not what we should be aiming for. The future energy policy of the EU, as also mentioned in the Energy Union Package, should be fully coherent with other EU policies and be based on reduced energy demand, energy savings and the use of renewable sources with the increased role of consumers/prosumers. It should also tackle the pressing issue of energy poverty. Unfortunately, in many areas the report does not set clear directions and it lacks long—term thinking when it comes to concrete measures. I would like to highlight the selection of projects of common interest – PCI’s – where we experience a strong bias towards fossil fuel projects, which is neither defendable nor in line with the decarbonisation pillar of the energy union package. The report mentions several types of technologies, including shale gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and carbon capture and storage (CCS), which should be supported. This would lead to a severe lock-in effect in the European energy system. The report remains very much focused on gas and other conventional energy sources and does not tackle the multiple forms of energy dependence – technological and financial fuel dependence. Also, it does not acknowledge the important role of renewables – we only find a few hints in the strategy. The EU should, rather, take steps towards an energy transition using sustainable renewable sources of energy, which are becoming increasingly cost—competitive with conventional sources and provide multiple benefits, including more jobs, opportunities for the local economy and lower energy import costs.

The energy security strategy, despite the substantial improvements – and I thank Saudargas – therefore appears not only out of history but also unfortunately schizophrenic: on the one hand, there is a declared war on climate change and the desire to reduce energy and political dependence, on the other hand it provides for the import of fissile material, clean coal, new drilling and the use of shale gas, and new investments in infrastructure that will still result in climate gas emissions.

So what is the proposal of the Commission and the Member States? We are told that we need to diversify our sources of supply. But the same system remains unchanged because we hear that we have to provide for other pipelines, other pipelines, and that brings us back to fossil fuels.

A second point has not yet been mentioned today, namely that yesterday a study was published on behalf of the World Energy Council, which shows that billions of savings would also be possible in the interests of European security of supply, billions of savings by reducing reserve capacity. Up to 100 large-scale power plants could be saved if security of supply is taken seriously to the extent presented today. What does regionalisation mean? What steps should be taken? The main objective is investment in the development of the pipeline network, the second of which concerns cross-border interconnectors and, thirdly, the reduction of bottlenecks within national borders. These three points are important for regionalisation. The report we are debating today has chosen more complex access, namely more complex access in the sense of a cross-policy nature. Two dimensions that have also been chosen quite correctly, namely the Internet dimension, where they say: what should be done to increase energy security? More in-house production of energy. Renewable energy is the main focus here, which is a good thing. And a second point, namely the increase in energy efficiency and, thereby, the attenuation of demand. It should be borne in mind that energy efficiency also costs money. And the foreign policy dimension, diversification of third countries – please do not fall from one dependence to another.

I find it regrettable that the current political debate on energy security is dominated mainly by foreign policy issues. It is above all a question of our heavy dependence on imports towards Russia and the question of from which country or region we can then obtain our gas in the future. I consider this development to be counterproductive, because new energy partnerships alone will not be able to secure our energy supply in the long term or reduce our dependence on imports. The second aspect I would like to draw attention to concerns the EU's so-called domestic energy sources, which are often referred to in the report. This concept has already appeared in the Commission's communication on the energy supply strategy, without it being defined in any way. I therefore wonder what exactly this term is meant to mean. For example, is nuclear energy also one of the EU's domestic energy sources, even though 95% of the uranium used in the nuclear sector is imported from outside the EU? For example, despite environmental concerns in many Member States, is hydraulic fracking also one of these so-called promising domestic energy sources in the EU?

The use of energy resources as a powerful political pressure against the European Union is breaking down, causing internal tensions and depressing the economy. 2.

The Commission should make concrete proposals, taking into account the energy specificities of individual regions of the European Union and assessing optimal energy mixes. One of the essential work in the field of energy security is the synchronisation of the baltic region's electricity networks with continental European networks. 3. To date, the Commission has not presented a strategic approach to the development of nuclear energy in the European Union, although the Energy Action Plan presented by the Commission stresses the role of nuclear energy and its importance in the future production of clean electricity.

We have learned the lesson so that we do not repeat the same mistakes in other dossiers. For example, the Digital Union dossier, which links so strongly with the Energy Union and which indicates security threats due to our delays in creating a regulated and transparent single market. But let's get back to energy security, Commissioner. The strategic pillars highlighted in this report are adequate: more efficiency, more own production with priority to renewable and environmentally friendly energies, technological leadership, an integrated market with strong interconnections, diversification of sources and geographical origins of the necessary imports. The implementation of this strategy involves a single market and an Energy Union. Levels of planning and regulation must be supranational and strengthened. But it also means giving a new impetus to the sustainable growth of the European economy, with a new model of organisation of space, mobility and social organisation. Let's not let ambition die.

If such a balance is lacking, it is difficult to achieve other objectives: competitiveness, security, reindustrialisation, and it is wrong if the Union declares and does not achieve the objectives.

The current Efficiency Directive is flawed because it is the same in EU countries with different energy use.

The aim of the new directive must not be to restrict the use of energy, but to physically increase its efficiency as the main method of decarbonisation.

A recent study in the UK showed that 82% of the public are worried that the UK is becoming too dependent on too many countries for its supply. Energy security is a crucial part of this puzzle. However, to help design our Energy Union, we should not forget that millions of people in Europe and in the UK are energy poor. So how do we ensure that our energy is secure and affordable? Our actions and our policies need to be guided by three major responsibilities: affordability, security and also sustainability.

We need to diversify, we need to develop new energy sources, and we need to phase out those energy sources that have the highest levels of carbon dioxide emissions.

This leads me to an important conclusion for this Chamber: the Green’s policies are leading us to the increased use of black fossil fuels. We see it in a number of countries: when phasing out nuclear power instead of phasing out fossil fuels, we are increasing our dependence on countries like Russia and we are increasing our dependence on fossil fuels.

These objectives are more ambitious than those adopted by the Council and we can only welcome them. However, there are a few problems, including shale gas development and, more broadly, unconventional fossil fuels. It is not enough to point out , and only point out - that the extraction of these fuels is not very clean. This is why many of us believe that the use of hydraulic fracturing, a technology poorly controlled in Europe, poses risks and adverse effects on the climate, the environment and public health.  Economically, the benefits will be far below those expected or promised by some experts. Operating costs are much higher than in the U.S. and gas inventories are also lower.

Secondly, energy security should not be an issue only at times of political crisis, like now in Russia. There should be a long-term focus.

The European Commission could also give the green light to the privatisation of DESFA, a state-owned gas company, through an investment by SOCAR, an Azerbaijani company. This approval would also facilitate the construction of the pipeline, which will supply natural gas from Azerbaijan, from the Caspian Sea region, to Greece, thus reducing energy dependence on Russia.

I would like to highlight one aspect in particular, namely the issue of energy efficiency. The cheapest and safest energy is the one we do not need. And President Juncker announced before his election that he would commit to at least 30% energy savings by 2030. In a paper that we jointly adopted in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we also confirmed our support for this 30% target. If you compare this, an important energy security project was the Nabucco pipeline. It is probably not being realised now. If Nabucco had come, it would have accounted for 3% of the European Union's total energy supply, because gas is, of course, only part of it and because, of course, it would have secured only part of the gas supply. So 3% Nabucco with all the political discussions that we have had about it – 30% energy efficiency: I think that shows the perspective. We need to make energy efficiency more effective as the most cost-effective means of energy security and climate protection, and I am sure, Commissioner, that I have you at my side when I call for this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1043, "date": "2015-06-09.json", "name": "Λευτέρης Χριστοφόρου (", "mepid": "26837", "text": "  PPE). Madam President, I think it is undeniable that the European Union is really energy dependent and that it has a steady economic bleeding from the energy sector of EUR 400 billion a year, which is truly shocking.  How do we respond to this challenge? There are solutions. One solution is certainly the development of renewable energy sources, which we support and support. The second credible, important solution is for the European Union to use its own energy sources. At the moment, the Eastern Mediterranean is offering to give way to the European Union's energy problems.  It is for this reason that if the European Union really has the political will and determination to open energy corridors and solve the problem of energy dependency and costs, it must invest in energy infrastructure and - I expect the Commissioner to respond to this - in the Eastern Mediterranean, Cyprus, Greece, Israel, but we also say to any other countries that they have the option and the ability to offer energy deposits , which are European energy deposits and we must use them here and now and not tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1044, "date": "2015-06-09.json", "name": "Doru-Claudian Frunzulică (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124790", "text": "   – Madam President, allow me to quote a Commission report which says there is no diversification or back-up in the event of supply problems, whether for technical or political reasons.

It means coordination of action but also flexibility. It means a common strategy, but also a use of the principle of subsidiarity. It means establishing a common framework for action of the European Union with common principles, but within which the Member States of the Union should retain their sovereign rights and exploit their sources of wealth.  In relation to Greece, this means that my country will have to move in two directions. First, to turn it into a modern energy hub, making the most of the TAP pipeline, but also the Greek stream, as well as liquefied gas. Secondly, to use without commitments, in the public interest, the natural gas and oil found in the Greek EEZ.

A crisis that brought up the urgent progress in terms of: European energy infrastructure, the completion of the internal energy market and the diversification of import sources. Despite this context, there are also states that are temporarily making considerable progress on energy independence. In the last three months the moderation of demand for natural gas on the Romanian market could be covered by domestic production without resorting to imports. We need more examples of this kind, and I am glad that we have agreed on the terms of a European energy security strategy. The creation of the Energy Union is the only solution to the vulnerabilities that logically derive from regional instability.

I, throughout this debate, have seen, first of all, the interest in the issue of energy security. It is normal: a European Union that imports 53% of its energy; where six Member States depend on Russia as the sole external gas supplier; in which three states depend on Russia for the operation and balance of their electricity grid; and taking into account the geopolitical situation we have experienced, as this issue is hot.  But the approach to its solution is polyeedric, as we have seen: there are many ways to increase our energy security.  The highest level of consensus I have seen in the debate is on energy efficiency policies. Here's a consensus that it's a win-win policy, it's a winning policy, it's a policy worth pushing. And one fact is enough, which is that for every percentage point when we increase our energy efficiency, we reduce our gas imports by 2.6%, we manage to increase our energy security and, in addition, we achieve fundamental savings for European consumers.  The second major policy in which there is a basic agreement is the development of a true internal energy market in the electricity sector and in the gas sector. In the electricity sector, the biggest problem has been posed by interconnections: the fact that there are still many Member States that do not reach 10% of the interconnection target set for 2020 or 15% that was set for 2030. And so one of the European Commission's policies is going to be to promote interconnections, the development of smart grids and that electricity flows can be a reality in the European Union.  But the same goes for gas interconnections: we don't have all of our interconnections resolved right now. We have to solve it: the Midcat corridor in the Pyrenees; we need to develop the networks of southern France to connect with the Central European network; in central, eastern and southern Europe we have to carry out more than fourteen projects for real interconnection in the area. And, therefore, we must also have an ambitious policy of interconnecting the territory, because we have seen, during ukraine's recent crisis, how reversible flows and European solidarity were very important to ensure energy security in times of crisis. And finally there is a policy, which everyone has also advocated, which is the need for source diversification, route diversification and diversification of suppliers. The Commission is seeking that no country should depend on a single supplier and may depend on at least three suppliers, which involves the development of interconnections; which means supporting the southern corridor to make the gas connection with Azerbaijan and, in its day, turkmenistan; and which involves developing a liquefied natural gas strategy that is very important as an element of energy security and as a guarantee at times when there may be a crisis. But it also produces immediate effects: it increases the competition. The development of liquefied natural gas with a strategy produces immediate effects. We have seen this in Lithuania, when the construction of a liquefied natural gas plant automatically resulted in a 20% price reduction because there was competition in the market. The Commission will therefore continue to support all developments, all actions within the framework of the Energy Union to make energy security one of the priorities, and using all instruments.

As announced in the Agenda on Security that we adopted, as you will remember, on 28 April 2015, and in the Agenda on Migration presented on 13 May, it is now our intention to present, by the beginning of 2016, a revised proposal on smart borders. Today’s reality is that Member States face difficulties in managing the growing traveller flows at borders and in fulfilling the obligations set by the Schengen Border Code. There were an estimated 200 million border crossings by third country nationals last year, and a 50% increase is expected in the next decade. Borders must benefit from technology. The smart borders system will automatically record all incoming and outgoing third country nationals and will support border guards in their tasks. It will also enable the automation or semi-automation of the border controls for travellers already known by the system. This will allow us to face the increases in traveller flows. Smart borders will also help us in making our policy against irregular migration more effective. How? By systematically recording all incoming and outgoing third country nationals, the system will automatically identify the travellers who stay longer than the authorised period. Smart borders will also help in identifying undocumented persons present in the Schengen area. Lastly, the system will support an informed visa policy decision-making process, taking into account the actual overstayer figures provided by the system. Possible law-enforcement access will be a key issue to be addressed in the impact assessment for the new proposal. The Commission has already acknowledged, in the impact assessment for the 2013 proposal, that the data generated at entry/exit could be of use to law-enforcement authorities in the fight against terrorist offences and serious crime in specific cases – both as an identity verification tool and as a criminal intelligence tool. But any decision to allow law-enforcement access from the outset will need to be based on the demonstrated necessity and proportionality of the measure. Strict, specific substantive and procedural safeguards would need to be laid down, taking into account, inter alia, the rulings of the European Court of Justice on data protection. Let me now share with you some of the emerging ideas on how we could increase the efficiency and effectiveness of border management. These are, of course, not yet conclusive, as discussions are still ongoing and the testing phase is still under way. These issues will all be covered in depth in the updated impact assessment the Commission is undertaking in order to inform its revised proposal. The initial findings of the technical study seem to point to potential advantages of a single piece of legislation. As in 2013, this would be accompanied by a technical modification of the Schengen Border Code. Let me give you an idea of the questions which, in my view, need to be answered in the context of our impact assessment, in addition to the already-mentioned issue of law-enforcement access and, of course, the financial implications and efficiency questions.  As regards the architecture of the system: should smart borders rely on a single system rather than separate systems for entry/exit recording and registered traveller management? Can we further reduce the number of data items about each traveller while still achieving our objectives? How long should the data retention periods be for entry/exit and for registered travellers, in full compliance with data protection rules? Can we introduce a ‘lighter’ form of biometric identifiers while maintaining the effectiveness of the system? How can we facilitate border crossings for the very large majority of travellers who do not pose any problem or risk? How can we benefit from the experience and solutions found in the existing large-scale systems, in order to reduce costs? While preparing the revised proposal, the Commission will continue to listen carefully to the opinions expressed by the European Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1069, "date": "2015-06-09.json", "name": "Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra", "mepid": "28397", "text": "  PPE Group. – Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you to Mrs Fajon for her good work. As has been said, 300 million border crossings, produced by approximately 76 million third-country nationals, are expected to reach 300 million border crossings in 2025, which require us to improve passenger traffic management, given the proven inadequacy of SIS II and VIS. As Members, in the face of a still very vague legislative package — even though it was born in February 2013 — we are determined that Parliament's voice will be taken into account throughout the legislative process and in the face of the new revised proposal of 2016. As for the architecture of the system, what we want to know, Commissioner, is clearly what your ideas are about it: an input and output system and an RTP?; Both of you?; One or the other?; Mixed? Because this is an essential issue and it is also essential for the budget, of course. Furthermore, the Commission needs to clarify and commit to the main objective and possible secondary ones. For example, the fight against migration mafias and other serious crimes such as terrorism. We're talking about technology, and technology to give this one added value. Everything I say, of course, must have the legal and primary packaging, with the maximum guarantees, as far as fundamental rights are concerned, in order to comply well with Article 77 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. And only from being clear about this general framework can we talk about biometrics, interoperability, accelerators, passenger information systems or the role of transport companies. The technical report and the conclusion of the pilot projects or testing phases — sixteen in twelve Member States — shall provide the information necessary for the launch of the new legislative proposal at the air, land and sea borders. On the other hand, Commissioner, interinstitutional dialogue needs to be strengthened in order to strengthen data protection, access to the system by law en forces and law enies or the consequences of the removal of stamps on passports. I would remind you that all but one of the national parliaments were in favour of access by law en forces and law enies, as you say: taking into account proportionality and necessity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1070, "date": "2015-06-09.json", "name": "Tanja Fajon", "mepid": "96911", "text": "  On behalf of the S&amp;D Group. What is the purpose of smart borders? Make Europe more attractive or build new walls? At the moment, the debate is going in the wrong direction. Spending money on a new system, new technology is anything but smart. Especially if the Commission does not take into account our concerns about data protection and costs – almost €800 million. We focus too much on safety, disproportionate to the risk that exists. I am particularly concerned about the scope of access by judicial authorities to data when the proposal is renewed. It is a very serious question of who will store and process the data and how this will affect the fundamental rights of passengers. I would like to point out seriously here that the Socialists and Democrats have a very clear red line, and I am pleased, Commissioner, that you are aware of this. My next concern: we have never heard a detailed answer in Parliament: will the costs that Europeans spend on new technologies justify the purpose of the project? I admit, I'm very skeptical. Connoisseurs and professions point to different solutions. Better border management and easier passenger crossing could be achieved by upgrading the existing VIS system, where we are already collecting biometric data on visa holders entering the Union. A simple operation could extend this system to those travellers who do not need visas to enter. Why not take advantage of these systems, as well as SIS2? Last but not least – the proposal for a programme for registered travellers, of which I am a rapporteur. If this is not the case in the new proposal, we will lose even that glimmer of hope that the purpose of the contested legislation, to facilitate border crossings for third-party citizens, will be sincere. Dear Commissioner, I know that we want the same thing: an attractive, free and secure Europe. I call on you to take into account all the concerns mentioned in the preparation of the recast of the proposal. Almost €800 million, or at least part of that money, could be used much more meaningfully. For example, emergency rescue and assistance to refugees dying in the Mediterranean today. What we do not want to do is to create a system, new smart borders, which would mean two things in practice: waste of money and new unnecessary barriers for passengers.

However, the absence of internal borders benefits not only bona-fide travellers. It is vital for the credibility and acceptability of the Schengen area that we effectively control our common external border. Third-country nationals that cross the external border should be reliably identified and their right to enter the Schengen area verified. The collected data should be stored in shared databases and be available to all relevant authorities. Also, the same standards should apply to all border-crossing points. The manual checking of travel documents is both slow and unreliable, which leads to long queues and more mistakes at the borders. The Smart Borders Package aims to address such challenges. The objective is to facilitate smooth and easy travel for the vast majority of travellers and, at the same time, make life more difficult for those who seek to abuse free movement inside the Union. The ECR supports these objectives. My question to the Commissioner is this: given the very large and ever-growing number of travellers into the European Union, how do you see the future if we do not create a common EU-wide solution, such as smart borders?

Some of the most important issues under the Smart Borders package remain the outline of clear project objectives and the proportionality of the proposed measures against the need for a legislative solution.  There are many uncertainties about the current legislative proposals. It was pointed out that their objectives are to tackle the increasing flow of passengers, collect statistics, track illegal residents and provide a higher level of security for European citizens. At the same time, however, law enforcement authorities in the Member States continue to not cooperate fully and do not exchange information in order to prevent and combat international crime.  Furthermore, the technical study of legislative proposals indicated that facial recognition as isolated geometric recognition for the identification of passengers is also seen as an option. It is also subject to analysis during the test stage currently underway. It is true that additional methods such as fingerprint collection provide greater accuracy, but a large number of fingerprints slow down the process. Their continued storage entails additional costs, and too short storage does not facilitate the management of passenger traffic. The question arises as to whether it is justified by the additional funds that Member States will have to invest and on the integrity of the individual.  Secondly, as shadow rapporteur for the report on the amendments to the Schengen Code, I would also like to address the Representative of the Council and reiterate to the Latvian Presidency that Bulgaria and Romania are carrying out their obligations to protect Europe's external borders, have met reception requirements and will bear the burden of introducing all standards , requirements and security systems on an equal footing with the Schengen countries, which is another argument for our adoption in Schengen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1075, "date": "2015-06-09.json", "name": "Marie-Christine Vergiat", "mepid": "96858", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL group. Madam President, 'smart borders', 'smart borders'... Let's move on to the vocabulary used. This system at exorbitant cost, even if it has been revised downwards, is a paradox in itself. It is claimed to make the European Union more attractive, facilitate free movement, improve border control and better combat irregular immigration. In order to do this, we want to leave all those who enter the European Union, i.e. 500 million people a year, the equivalent of the population of the Union.  The United States has implemented a similar program, which cost a billion and a half, to block 1,300 people, or more than one million per refusal. So we're going to set up a gas plant that will create more problems than it solves. Fluidity is not for tomorrow. The Commission has withdrawn its project, so much the better. But it wants to build on a pilot project led by eu-LISA and present us with a new one. This is a purely technical validation that is far from taking into account the magnitude of the problems. Let us turn to the conditions for setting up this test, which is just a smokescreen to force the hand of the European Parliament, a way of resuming the obsessions of the Member States - border control and migrant registration - after Eurodac, SIS and SIS II, which were already very expensive. These instruments are already questionable, but at least we can make real assessments of them. There is no justification for this project, except the security dogma and the obsession with the hunt for migrants. What is a \"risky traveller,\" Commissioner?

According to the Commission, the database is intended to ensure that overstayers no longer stay too long. But exactly how this is to happen is completely unclear. Finally, we only have the database for statistical purposes. We Greens are also firmly opposed to simply extending the purpose and also giving the police access to these fingerprints. The Commission must not give in to the pressure of the Member States, because that would simply trample European fundamental and data protection rights underfoot. And even from a financial point of view, smart borders is not a particularly smart project, because the costs will definitely be significantly higher than they have now been calculated in the study. After all, everything that the Member States have to buy in terms of equipment, scanners, ABC gates, kiosks and all the drums is not included.

This debate is obviously not just about the \"Smart Borders\" package. Enforcement agencies are increasingly leaving access to data from people who are not, in principle, suspected of any crime. So it's a question of what we're talking about. A border management system or yet another security tool?  Prudence, then, with regard to its impact on fundamental rights. On the one hand, the scheme proposes to facilitate the journey of some privileged travellers and, on the other hand, it wants to combat the overspending of the length of stay of slightly less fortunate travellers. Won't this differentiation between travellers lead to a form of discrimination? On what basis would the criteria for access or denial of access to the registered traveller program be assessed?  Finally, in terms of its cost, a smart border seems to be a border that costs a lot of money, which has probably not gone unnoticed by industrial players.  In addition to the intense lobbying that this scheme must generate, is there no reason to question its cost-effectiveness?

That is a good thing. The cost factor in particular has been emphasised and must be emphasised. Replacing the old travel stamps is an extraordinarily logical consequence. We must, of course, network with the visa and Schengen system here. Illegal stays in the EU must be effectively prosecuted and frequent travellers must be given appropriate relief.

I commend the crew of the Irish naval vessel, the LÉ Eithne, which has now rescued over 1 000 people since it left Ireland. This illustrates the need for increased search and rescue activities. The smart borders proposal appears more concerned with the mass collection of data than with addressing this humanitarian crisis.

This project seems to me to be critical for two reasons. First, it is a dangerous project for freedoms, as it intends to computer-file the personal data of millions of people; it is the same liberticidal logic as that of the PNR project on the use of passenger record data. Secondly, these \"smart borders\" are a cover-up designed to strengthen the Schengen system.

The question arises as to how effective the entry and exit system would be if the identification of persons who did not leave the European Union on time would not be possible by the time of their exit.

I have another problem that I want to highlight here, namely the results of the fifth report on the post-liberalisation of the visa regime for the control of western Balkan countries by the European Commission, which states that the European Union does not exclude the possibility of reintroducing visas for citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro and Serbia, all because of the huge increase in the number of citizens of these countries in the Countries of the European Union.

We cannot create a border in the European Union, and I believe that Romania, given the success of its border protection programmes, but also by meeting the criteria for accession to the Schengen area, must and can be included in this system of smart borders.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1116, "date": "2015-06-09.json", "name": "El Presidente. –", "mepid": "125032", "text": "   The next item on the agenda is the debate on: - the question with an oral response to the Commission on the 2014 annual report of the OLAF Monitoring Committee, Petri Sarvamaa, on behalf of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), and Bart Staes, on behalf of the Green Group/European Free Alliance (O-000060/2015 – B8-0553/2015), - the question with request for an oral response to the Commission on the 2014 annual report of the OLAF Monitoring Committee, Dennis de Jong, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left (O-000061/2015 – B8-0554/2015), and - the question with request for oral response to the Commission on OLAF investigations , by Michael Theurer, Martina Dlabajová, Nedzhmi Ali, Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy, Dita Charanzová and Frédérique Ries, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (O-000066/2015 – B8-0555/2015).", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1117, "date": "2015-06-09.json", "name": "Bart Staes", "mepid": "4751", "text": "   Author. – Let me first bring some positive news. Within OLAF, many hundreds of people work hard and well, and their work makes them a fight against fraud, corruption and illegal practices that cost the taxpayer a great deal of money. However, the activities report of the Supervisory Committee is sweeping the floor with some of olaf's practices and the concrete functioning of olaf's Director-General.  Some examples: 1) investigations are opened without a sufficiently serious suspicion of fraud and corruption, even though this is legally necessary;  2. olaf's Director-General does not take seriously the recommendations of the Supervisory Committee;  3. the Supervisory Committee is hampered in its work and has no or insufficient access to documents and information;  4) there is no legal basis for recording private phone calls and yet this has been done in an important investigation;  5) statistics on the duration of investigations are manipulated to speed up or at least make the investigations appear to be so;  6. the Secretariat of the Supervisory Committee is under enormous, sometimes personal pressure, because it falls under the administrative supervision of the Director-General of OLAF, so the auditee has control over the auditor.  The Supervisory Committee shall consist of five members. They work collectively and are known in their Member States as extremely competent, with a great deal of expertise in combating fraud. In the activity report we clearly read that there is a difference of opinion between the Supervisory Committee on the one hand and the Director-General of OLAF on the other hand on the role of the Commission. This is where the Commission comes in. That's where you have to take responsibility. Commissioner Georgieva, who is the anti-fraud commissioner, must take a position. The findings of the Supervisory Committee are serious, concrete and have been going on for a long time.  So our question is: what measures are you going to take to ensure that the supervisory committee's comments are followed up and the problems are resolved? No one is asking you to intervene in operational activities, not even the supervisory committee, but there must be action, there must be an action plan.

But what really needs to be said tonight in this debate – and when we are putting these questions to the Commission – is that for the first time we are witnessing a crucial and damning report from an independent supervisory committee consisting of five independent experts. Their role in supervising the work of OLAF is not just anything; it is absolutely crucial and essential to the credibility of the Union in the eyes of EU citizens. Therefore, we are asking you tonight not just what the Commission has done, but what is the Commission's doing? What is the Commission doing to deal with the problems that clearly are present? The Supervisory Committee is calling into question its ability to conduct its work. This is not acceptable.

I am pleased that we can have this discussion with the Commission today in a business-like way. I have no need for any attacks, neither on the person of the DG OLAF nor on the Committee on Budgetary Control. The fact is, however, that the supervisor has included a number of specific criticisms in its annual report and that OLAF's responses do not allay the concerns of many colleagues and myself.  Opening things up, for example, needs to be done carefully. You don't start an official investigation until there's a sufficiently serious suspicion of fraud. OLAF points out that the new rules were not in force at the time. However, the supervisor does not rely on the new OLAF Regulation but on the case law of the Court of Justice. OLAF admits that this case law was not followed and that is serious.  It is just one example, i believe that the real discussion between the supervisor and OLAF is mainly about how to monitor if you do not have enough or at least too little insight into individual cases. Of course, DG OLAF is right to say that the privacy of suspects must be safeguarded, but even then OLAF can ensure that the information on selection criteria and prioritisation is sufficiently substantiated to be submitted to the supervisor. The institutions have been talking about this for years now, and I think there is a very clear task for the European Commissioner. It seems that more specific information is required to the supervisor in order to break the deadlock.  Finally, it is noticeable that OLAF wants to keep a lot of things indoors. For example, there is the proposal to place a controller on procedural safeguards within OLAF. But it certainly applies to the regulator as well. It depends on OLAF's budget and information. The European Commissioner must look at this explicitly. How can the supervisor really become independent of the organisation he oversees? It is in everyone's interest to improve the relationship between the supervisor and OLAF quickly. These organs are clearly not coming out of their own. That is why I hope that the Commissioner will quickly take up the gauntlet and in the resolution we are calling for a concrete action plan. I trust that the Commission will commit us to come up with such a plan quickly.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has The matter we are discussing today is a very serious matter, and I agree with colleagues. And it's not new. In the last mandate, in the role of Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I saw that, as early as 2011 and 2013, the Report of the Supervisory Committee pointed out that the members of the Supervisory Committee were experiencing difficulties in carrying out their work, that they were not getting close to the information they deems necessary, that there appear to be repeated conflicts of competence between management. , the Director of OLAF and the Supervisory Committee. That is why we feel compelled today to put a question to the Commission here in plenary, because OLAF is independent. We need a strong and functioning anti-fraud authority, that is right. And we, as the European Parliament, also defend independence. But in a state governed by the rule of law, there must be checks and balances. In other words, the question is: who actually controls the inspectors? In the OLAF regulation, we have introduced the supervisory committee, the supervisory committee. It is extremely worrying for us, as the Committee on Budgetary Control, if the members of this Supervisory Committee turn to us and point out difficulties. We want the Supervisory Committee to be able to carry out its tasks. In other words, if OLAF is the police authority, then the European Public Prosecutor, whom we have been calling for for years, is missing at EU level, who can then monitor the police if necessary. Against this background, we believe that the Supervisory Committee must now be strengthened or that the Commission must take measures to ensure that the Supervisory Committee can actually fulfil the tasks laid down in the regulation. We expect the Commission to give us answers here.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1121, "date": "2015-06-09.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, Vice- President Georgieva regrets that she is not able to participate in this debate tonight. I therefore represent the Commission on this occasion. The fight against fraud is of the utmost importance for the Commission, and I know that it is the same for Parliament. In this context, Parliament has repeatedly shown great interest in the work of the European Anti-Fraud Office and its Supervisory Committee. Most recently, when the Supervisory Committee presented its annual activity report covering the year 2014, this gave rise to discussions in the Committee on Budgetary Control. Some honourable Members have stated that the report identified serious deficiencies in the work of OLAF. The Commission would like to emphasise that the role of the Supervisory Committee is to reinforce OLAF’s independence as an investigative board. The Supervisory Committee can identify issues which, in its view, require further improvements with the aim of making OLAF stronger in its core mission. In this context, the Commission has received three oral questions covering matters referred to in the Supervisory Committee activity report or in other discussions concerning the Supervisory Committee of OLAF. Furthermore, four motions for a resolution touching on the same subjects were tabled by different political groups. Allow me to elaborate on the matters raised in the oral questions. The first is the opening of 423 cases on 12 February 2012. The second is the Commission’s position with regard to ensuring that OLAF complies with the legal requirements placed on it in the OLAF Regulation. OLAF has been criticised for the opening of a large number of cases, by a single decision, in February 2012. The Commission has been informed that this decision was taken transparently; that all investigative units and OLAF management were involved; and that the decision and its impact on OLAF’s resources were transparently reported on in OLAF’s annual report for 2012—2013. The decision was due to internal reorganisation and the need to clear a backlog. The Commission also notes that OLAF does not agree with the Supervisory Committee that the opening of the cases failed to meet the legal requirement for the opening of an investigation. OLAF does not share the Supervisory Committee’s legal assessment on this matter. The Commission emphasises that the opening of investigations is an investigative act, that OLAF is fully independent in those acts, and that the Commission is required to respect the independence of OLAF in its investigative functions. The decisions that the European Union and national authorities may adopt in the follow-up to OLAF investigations are subject to judicial review. It should, furthermore, be noted that it is not the role of the Supervisory Committee to pass judgment on the legality of individual investigative acts, as recognised by the Supervisory Committee itself. My third point concerns the Commission’s perception of the working arrangements and working relations between OLAF and the Supervisory Committee, and its intention to facilitate those relations and to make OLAF more efficient. The Commission is aware that OLAF and the Supervisory Committee are working very hard to improve their relations. In particular, OLAF and the Supervisory Committee are currently reviewing their working arrangements in order to align them better to the needs of the Supervisory Committee. The Commission, and in particular Vice-President Georgieva, has regularly raised with both sides issues linked to the relations between OLAF and the Supervisory Committee. The Commission’s aim is, of course, to facilitate and foster good cooperation and constructive dialogue. It should be noted, however, that OLAF and the Supervisory Committee are two independent bodies which are already in dialogue and work together with the same aim. The Commission can offer its advice and support, but it is the responsibility of OLAF and its Supervisory Committee to develop sound and constructive cooperation. Referring, in its activity report, to the independence of its secretariat, the Supervisory Committee mentions legal requirements. The OLAF Regulation specifies that the Supervisory Committee secretariat shall be provided by the Office in close consultation with the Supervisory Committee. In its most recent opinion, No 1/2015, on OLAF’s budget 2016 – an opinion not yet shared with the institutions – the Supervisory Committee recognises that the current arrangements with OLAF come close to sufficient financial autonomy for the Supervisory Committee and its secretariat. As stated by my colleague Vice-President Georgieva at Parliament’s March 2015 part-session, the Commission is currently exploring ways in which it can further strengthen the independence of the Supervisory Committee in its human resources and budget management within the existing framework. Fuller formal independence of the Supervisory Committee and secretariat, in terms of both budget and human resources, would, however, require the legislator to amend OLAF Regulation 883/2015. In view of the international role of both OLAF and the Supervisory Committee in the protection of the European Union’s financial interests, the relations between OLAF and the Supervisory Committee are, of course, a matter of interest to Parliament, the Council and the Commission. We would like to propose that the subject be discussed further in the context of the annual interinstitutional exchange of views provided for in the OLAF Regulation. The next exchange of views will take place in September 2015. Fourthly, on the question of whether the Commission is to propose an action plan to resolve serious deficiencies highlighted in the Supervisory Committee annual report, the Commission is of the opinion that it is excessive to consider that the Supervisory Committee has identified serious deficiencies. It is the very purpose of the Supervisory Committee to identify issues which, in its view, require further improvement in the work of the Office, and to make the corresponding recommendations. Many of the issues raised by the Supervisory Committee in its activity report refer to OLAF’s investigative activities, such as the opening of the 423 cases in 2012, the investigative policy priorities and the participation of the office in the Commission’s Clearing House meetings. Last week, on 2 June 2015, OLAF presented its annual report for the year 2014. It reports on the efficacy and results of its investigations, providing a positive picture of its achievements. It is for OLAF, as an independent investigative body, to give proper follow-up and to inform the Supervisory Committee and the institutions thereof. The Commission has been informed by OLAF that it has responded to, or is in the process of responding to, many of the Supervisory Committee’s recommendations and requests. As mentioned by the Chair of the Supervisory Committee during his speech at the meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control on 4 May, the important professional work carried out by OLAF deserves all our appreciation, and the statutory role of the Supervisory Committee is to improve this work and to contribute to trust in OLAF’s investigative activities.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1122, "date": "2015-06-09.json", "name": "Ingeborg Gräßle", "mepid": "28220", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has Sometimes it would be better if you didn't read out what others were writing down.

The EU would have been there and would have had a lot of good advice for a long time. In the core area of what is concerned with the EU, namely the Anti-Fraud Office, you have now explained to us for a long time that all this is not so bad, that we can see the matter from two sides and that we should not be upset at what is happening, because on the one hand those who find out – the Supervisory Committee – would overstretch their mandate.

But those were other times. Precipitation is always a very bad adviser, and more so in the treatment of the body responsible for combating fraud inside and outside the European Union, pending the next European Prosecutor. That is why, since my group, we have considered this debate to be hasty — which addresses only one part of the problem and has been organised even before we heard the annual report of OLAF itself, which is the central body we should be talking about — as we consider at the time to have precipitated the debate on the Supervisory Committee's annual report, almost before we even made it public , without having invited the CEO. It would become as if, in the face of the presentation of the annual discharge of the Court of Auditors, the Commissioner responsible was not invited. Well, that was done. What urgency was there? That said: precipitation. That is why our resolution focuses on deploring that Parliament, in its Committee on Budgetary Control, rather than offering citizens and colleagues the opportunity to carry out a full debate with all the necessary opinions and responses, has preferred, on the part of some groups, to offer a partial debate. OLAF is the body for carrying out the Treaty's mandate to combat fraud, and the Surveillance Committee is the auxiliary body to protect OLAF, ensuring its independence, and protect the rights of those investigated. There has always been a proper tension between the two. If it didn't exist, they wouldn't do their job well. What we cannot do in Parliament is to unbalance the balance maliciously, deliberately ignoring the answers and explanations of one of the parties, putting back on the table some of the points that this Parliament has already voted on - and voted against - although some colleagues want us to vote again and again until we get the vote to change. I, in truth, understand that eriating the Surveillance Committee as a judge, rather than as protector of OLAF, and also party, since it would not exist if there was no OLAF, I understand that it is not the functioning or our role.

And I give an example: the report on the Tinduf refugee camps. He talks about fraud, but he doesn't make an estimate of it. He says it was conducted and yet did not visit the camps at any time and did not consult data as basic as the UNHCR refugee census in October 2000.

Authoritarian action within an institution, which is intended to exemplify accountability and internal integrity, and the fact that it itself does not comply with the rules and procedures, is not only shameful for the whole Union, but, above all, threatens the financial interests of European citizens.

On the contrary, they are very worrying because they show that they will do nothing to remedy the situation at OLAF. And in this context I would like to ask him whether he believes in the fight against corruption and fraud, and I also ask him if it is true that he has altered, deprived of substance, brushed the biannual Eurobarometer of corruption by the European Commission? Now, on how OLAF is supervised by the Commission, I think we have said enough. The report of the Supervisory Committee is very unhappy with OLAF's work and we are really talking about the management work here and not the work of the investigators. There is insufficient data transmitted so that the control cannot be carried out. OLAF's statistics are also not credible, they differ from year to year or from a few months to months or from a few years to a few years, and they differ greatly, so we cannot rely on them. And I recall in this context that fraud with European money is at least EUR 3 billion. And this is our money, and we want everyone who steals it to take their hand out of our pockets. You too, Commissioner Avramopoulos, have a very important role to play, and you should live up to that role in relation to what OLAF is doing.

The explanation that they are too confrontational, so they cannot sit in the same room, is ridiculous. It is the business of the Committee on Budgetary Control, in collaboration with the Commission, to see that an end is put to this absolutely unacceptable situation as quickly as possible because – as we repeat all the time – we need the confidence of our citizens. We have to show them that we are responsible. What are we doing? We are exchanging, through the media, through all sorts of different channels, allegations which cannot be examined in conjunction, and then we wonder why we look ridiculous in the eyes of our citizens.

It has been said that there are certain procedures, and we, too, politicians or Members of the European Parliament, must stick to them.

And it really needs to be accepted that olaf's report needs to be awaited, the achievements have been assessed, so that there are no misunderstandings about the opening of certain cases and the outcome of those cases. And I think this issue will be resolved. The Director of OLAF has been appointed in accordance with procedures which were discussed for almost a year during the previous term of office. The Supervisory Committee is also the Supervisory Committee. And the most important role – I really understand – must be played by the European Commission and, in particular, by the Commissioner responsible for these matters.

The motion for a resolution calls on the European Anti-Fraud Office and its Director-General to address these problems.

The government and Peter Polt do not suspect anything, despite the fact that we are falling out of billions in the EU because of institutionalised corruption, and government officials are being banned from the United States.
