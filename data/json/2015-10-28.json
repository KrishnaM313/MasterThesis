Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Andriukaitis, the issue of GMOs always provokes a lively debate in public opinion, mainly on the possible consequences for human health. To date, there is insufficient evidence to show that the consumption of GMO foods can have consequences for human health and the environment. EFSA expresses its position, but as you know in Europe we apply the precautionary principle and therefore, of course, we have a very careful position on this issue. Before I go into the substance of the proposal, however, allow me to thank my fellow Members who have worked with me on what has been done to date. On 22 April, the European Commission presented its proposal to amend the regulation on genetically modified food and feed, which provides for the possibility for Member States to take national decisions to restrict or prohibit the use of GMOs in food or feed, once such use has been authorised at EU level, the so-called 'opt-out'. The ENVI Commission has spoken out loud against the proposal, albeit for a number of reasons for its rejection. However, the majority was large, with 47 votes in favour. In recent months, serious concerns have been expressed about the lack of an impact assessment, the compatibility of the measures taken by the Member States with the internal market, and the practicability of the proposal.  The proposal was not preceded by an assessment of all the possible consequences and alternative options available. We therefore have no means of judging with certainty the consequences that the proposal could have for the functioning of the internal market in food and feed and for the competitiveness of the Union's agricultural sector.  I believe that the proposal could seriously damage livestock production and also have a negative impact on agriculture in the European Union, given that the European Union is still heavily dependent on the supply of protein from genetically modified sources, and considering that the proposal is likely to have an indirect negative effect on imports. I also have serious doubts, already expressed on several occasions in comparison with the Commission, about the implementation of the proposal, given the absence of controls at the Borders of the European Union. The reintroduction of these internal controls, with barriers between Member States, would be tantamount to erasing the economic achievements of the European Customs Union and the single market. And we cannot expect to have an internal market in a leopard spot, after all the efforts that have enabled us over the years to remove internal barriers, the EU's internal borders. It is also unclear how Member States using the opt-out can guarantee compliance with the measures on their territory on a practical basis.  Today, therefore, we are in plenary to take a decision in this Parliament and the rapporteur's request to colleagues is to reject the proposal. We will also have to vote on some amendments to the legislative resolution: some require a new proposal from the Commission and others call for a moratorium until there is a new proposal. As rapporteur, I would also ask you to vote against these amendments, because I believe that the legislation in force is good legislation, but the Member States must have the courage to implement it. The Member States must, of course, take responsibility.  With today's vote, therefore, we are sending a great signal to the Commission, and I hope that in the course of the debate my fellow Members will be able to make a clear statement of our opposition.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2015-10-28.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President,  honourable Members of Parliament, I am pleased to have this opportunity to set out the aims and substance of the Commission’s proposal to amend the Regulation on genetically modified food and feed prior to the vote later today. Let me recall that this proposal derives directly from the set of political guidelines on the basis of which this Commission was appointed, especially under the heading of a Union of democratic change – this is very important, a Union of democratic change.  We are in a very paradoxical situation and our proposal aims to solve it. On the one hand, European Union citizens seem to be sceptical about GMOs in many Member States, and yet GMOs are authorised in the European Union only after a comprehensive risk assessment which confirms a high level of safety. But part of European Union society is still against GMOs and this creates a democratic deficit in the European Union. On the other hand, EU livestock protein producers are extremely dependent on imports of protein crops, which are mostly genetically modified soya. These GMOs are widely used to feed animals, even in the Member States who vote against GMO products, and European Union livestock producers need a legally sound authorisation mechanism.  Let me recall that before the Commission takes its decision on GMO authorisation it consults Member States, first in a Standing Committee and then, if there is no clear opinion from the Standing Committee, in the Appeal Committee. In this way the Member States twice have the possibility to express their views. Under comitology rules, if Member States reach a qualified majority in favour of a draft Commission authorisation, the Commission adopts it. If the Member States reach a qualified majority against the draft, the Commission cannot adopt its draft authorisation. In case of no opinion, GMO and comitology legislation requires the Commission to adopt a decision alone.  In the specific case of GMOs, Member States have never reached a qualified majority either in favour or against the draft authorisation proposed by the Commission. The result has been a ‘no opinion’ for the 67 GM food and feed authorisations granted. Most of the Member States who voted against or abstained did not challenge the risk assessment, but instead openly invoked national political reasons. Therefore, by failing to draw the line between yes and no, Member States leave the final decision solely to the Commission.  This situation is indeed unique because thousands of other decisions are adopted without difficulty under the comitology procedure in other sectors. This situation creates tensions and deepens a democratic deficit in the European Union. It is highly unsatisfactory as it contributes to a climate of distrust against the European Union and its institutions. Mr President, honourable Members, the time has come for everyone to step up and take their full responsibilities. The Commission’s proposal sets out a pragmatic and legally—sound way forward, consistent with the subsidiarity principle. Member States are already using the Directive on GMO cultivation – thanks to this House, because the directive was adopted here – and it shows that this model provides a workable framework to give the possibility to Member States to better take account of national circumstances. Today’s proposal follows the same logic. The legislative proposal on GM food and feed would give clear roles to the Commission and Member States. The Commission would retain responsibility for granting European marketing authorisations for safe GMOs, while Member States would hold full responsibility for deciding whether or not to use them on their territory in respect of their national political reasons.  I am not aware of an alternative approach that could properly address the challenge at stake and respect at the same time the European Union institutional framework. For example, changing the Comitology Regulation just for GMOs would clearly pose a problem of equal treatment compared with other systems of pre-authorisation. This would also run the risk of not allowing the Commission to take a decision, be it an approval or a rejection, on an application. Changing the voting rules would also be problematic. These rules are set out in the Treaty to ensure the democratic balance between the respective weights of the 28 Member States.  Some suggested that what is needed is not to change the system of authorisation but to improve the risk assessment of GMOs. Let me recall that continuous efforts are made by the Commission and EFSA to ensure that GMO risk assessments are based on the very highest standards of science and independence. The most recent development was the adoption two years ago of a regulation reinforcing and clarifying the requirements of GM food and feed applications. It was supported by a qualified majority of Member States, but this adoption had no influence on the voting behaviour of the same Member States which continue to invoke political reasons. Mr President, honourable Members, I am well aware of the questions this House has raised regarding this proposal, and that Members are considering the adoption of a resolution to reject it. I would regret that very much. I believe an open and serious debate would be beneficial to our institutions and would bring the European Union closer to its citizens and solve problems of democratic deficit.  Should you choose to reject this proposal, the Commission will continue to apply the legislation which was adopted by the European Parliament and by the Council. The Member States will still not take a clear position, they will remain led by national political considerations and, without challenging the European Union risk assessment or demonstrating that GMOs are unsafe, they will not give a clear vote but leave full responsibility for this decision only to the Commission. Farmers will continue using GMOs to feed their livestock, willingly or unwillingly, and European citizens will be sceptical about GMOs in many Member States. This would be a last opportunity to give a concrete answer to genuine and legitimate concerns of European citizens, which undermine not just the GMO authorisation system but also confidence in the European Union itself. I therefore urge you to reflect again very carefully on the full consequences of your decision before proceeding to vote. We are proposing an additional democratic mechanism to reinforce the legitimacy of the European Union decisions on GMOs.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioner for his excellent work and for the work she has done. The Commission has proposed that Member States should be responsible for importing food and feed in the event of genetic modification. Commissioner, we cannot agree to such a proposal. I was ten years old when the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957. One of the great achievements of the European Union is a free internal market. If we were to allow national authorisation here again, then border controls would basically be necessary again in Europe. The other discussion on border controls in Europe is enough. We do not need border controls on the import of animal feed.  The Committee on Agriculture and Development rejected this proposal by a large majority.  I am in favour of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for which I am also speaking, saying very clearly that we are rejecting this Commission proposal, because we do not want production to be moved from Europe to other countries, to other parts of the world.

Of course, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports the report and we support it in the way that ENVI and AGRI have adopted it, that is, without amendments. The Commission's proposal goes against all the principles that this Commission and we in the European Union have given ourselves. It has no impact assessment, nor is it feasible. I support what Albert Dess said: we do not want to introduce new border controls either. But without border controls, the proposal would not be feasible. We will have huge problems with third countries. Or, of course, this question is also in the air, is the proposal not meant seriously in the end? Are the limits for the Member States, which are also included, so strict that no one could do it in the end? But then it would not be serious either. That is why we will reject it.  I find it particularly absurd that the Commission is still sticking to this proposal and, on the other hand, telling us that the European Parliament's demands are unworkable when it comes to animal cloning. They refuse to accept a regulation for re-productive material, semen and embryos. You are even refusing to accept first-generation labelling because you say that this is not feasible.  This is child's play compared to the proposal we are discussing this morning. Of course, the breeders know the reproductive material and they can also say whether it is from cloned animals or not. Otherwise they would not pay for it if they did not know that this is particularly good material.

In any case, we are moving in that direction. So, of course, this indicates two things: on the one hand, that the Commission must rework this subject, that it cannot stop there. On the other hand, if there is unanimity, it is also because the reasons may be different for different groups to reject this proposal. But it is true that today, renationalising trade policies within the Union in a more general context where it is clear that there is a threat, a fragility on the issue of free movement, whether that of human beings or that of goods, does not correspond to the idea we have, we in any case social democrats , what the European Union should be.  And I confess that I was somewhat stunned earlier when, in support of your argument, you raised the democratic question. For if we are now at European level to consider that we cannot establish democratic rules to make choices, especially on such important elements as GMOs and their marketing, and to ensure that these choices can be understood by the people, and that for this reason we should renationalise our policies, Commissioner , we are embarking on a path that is being promoted by many here, at least in front of me, but not on this side of the Chamber, and which is not the pro-European tradition in which we are part of it. It is precisely at the level of the European Union and the Commission that we must know how to build democratic choices today so that they can be affirmed.  In this sense, the proposal you are making today cannot be accepted, but we cannot leave it at that either, and that is why, Commissioner, we, the Social Democrats , and probably others here - will urge that a new proposal be prepared from, of course, what has already been done, from the work of Parliament; but we can't stay as it is. I conclude by saying that the question of the agricultural model is still being asked. It is not a question of dreaming of complete self-sufficiency, for example with regard to animal feed. However, as we can see, we cannot be in an agricultural system today that pushes for production, and therefore the massive importation of GMOs, without people even knowing. This is the case, for example, in the country I know best, France. I think many citizens would be surprised to know that the animals they eat eat GMOs themselves; I am not sure they know.  So, and to conclude, Commissioner, we ask you not to stop today, but rather to continue the work. And so take our position rather as, I was going to say, an encouragement to deepen the work with us, so that a new proposal can be made quickly on this subject of the marketing of GMOs.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2015-10-28.json", "name": "Zbigniew Kuźmiuk", "mepid": "28389", "text": "  On behalf of the ECR Group. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by Speaking in the debate on allowing Member States to restrict or prohibit the use of genetically modified food and feed on their territory, I would like to point out that the ECR Group will vote against the European Commission's proposal on this matter. However, we believe that similar arrangements should be introduced for genetically modified food and feed as for the cultivation of genetically modified plants. After all, the GMO Cultivation Directive, agreed by all EU institutions, gives Member States the possibility to prohibit or restrict cultivation on their territory, provided that certain requirements described in the Directive are met.

Thank you very much, Mr President. Commissioner, I know that this is not an easy thing to do with this proposal.  You have tried to resolve a situation that seems to be very difficult. When it comes to genetic engineering, it is the case at the moment that, in principle, EFSA, on behalf of the Commission, must find a solution and scientifically examine whether something is safe or not. That is the way it is at the moment. Then the Member States will have to say whether they want to follow the Council. And, you mentioned it, there is never a qualified majority in the Standing Committee. It is usually the case: one third is in favour, a third is against and a third abstain. This is a problem for you, because then you have to find solutions and just make a decision. You yourself said that this is unsatisfactory for the Commission, it is also unique – especially in the case of genetically modified organisms – and you want to have a solution.  Now President Juncker has promised us, Parliament, that he will try to change the voting behaviour in the standing committee. But that did not happen. If we had a better solution, we may have moved on now. And that is precisely not the case in this case. You said that it is problematic to change the procedure or the voting behaviour. But it is the case that at the moment you continue to spin in circles, and it is almost a question of who should have the Black Peter. The Commission does not want to have the Buck Peter, we say it in German. But it must find a solution.  That is the case again with the Member States or with us, with Parliament. We believe that the proposal you have made does not take us any further. But the situation we have at the moment is not good either. It's a pretty deadlocked story. That is why I really think that you should reconsider whether you can make a new, better proposal that really no longer requires border controls, which allows the internal market and which also puts into the room the scientific knowledge that the Commission wants to promote, so that it can be implemented. I know it is a difficult task for you. But I don't think it's insoluble. That is why I will be advocating for my group to ask you for a new proposal.

However, I urge colleagues not to allow the Commission off the hook on this issue. It must go back to the drawing board and come up with a new proposal which is fit for purpose. Citizens and environmental groups have genuine concerns surrounding GM foods, including about their environmental impact and their implications for food sovereignty, and these are clearly reflected in the decision by 19 Member States to opt out of GM cultivation. With this weak proposal the Commission has missed a good opportunity to address one of the weak spots – namely in relation to the authorisation procedure and the European Food Safety Authority’s risk assessment procedure, which must be reformed. Parliament itself, in its resolution on GM product 1507, called for a freeze on any new authorisations until the risk assessment procedure had been improved. It is a rarity when biotech companies and environmental NGOs are in agreement.

I read to them for a moment: \"It is simply not right that under the current rules the Commission is legally forced to authorise new organisms for import and processing even though a clear majority of member states is against.\" Commissioner, the proposal before us does not fulfil that promise.

The balance of power is still favourable to the party of prudence, because it is based on public opinion.  Nevertheless, support for agriculture and the trade in GMOs is of formidable importance, and their influence in decision-making places and among opinion-makers is increasing. Let us remember the researcher Gilles-Eric Séralini, who in 2012 demonstrated the harmfulness of GMOs after feeding rats for several weeks; a controversy led by the major industrial groups had disavowed it. This was not for scientific reasons but for reasons of commercial interest, and public health questions found no other answers than those of industrialists.  Therefore, there will be no status quo, nor a middle ground. We must demand a ban on GMOs - trade as well as culture - or risk seeing them soon dumped and cultivated throughout Europe. The Commission is moving more slowly, but in the same direction as the big sellers of GMOs: what is in favour of globalised trade inevitably finds a guilty tenderness and favour in this institution. So let's be clairvoyant and look where we're going. At stake is absolute control of food production and the chain of life. That the more a fruit or vegetable is produced by nature, the more a seed, the more a bread without royalty to the industry: that is the challenge.

After the introduction of a two-tiered system for cultivation permits which threatens to create a real distortion of competition between our farmers, the Commission is now re-offending with marketing authorisations.

The Commission definitely wants to send the hot potato back to national governments, in order to break the deadlock.  But we're going the wrong way.

This, in my view, poses a major legal security problem. There are about 50 imported GMO products that are marketed in the European Union. We are thus undermining the cohesion of the single market, when in reality we would need to have a serene debate and get out of the trap of passionate debate, trapped in an often inadequate precautionary principle that prevents us from moving forward.

You have just mentioned that EFSA is making scientific decisions. After that, GMOs are already taken into account, for example in the case of animal feed, as Mr Des said a short while ago. It has now been proposed to impose a moratorium until a new proposal is in place.

With respect to the second question, I did not fully understand the content, so I would have a little difficulty answering it.

Far too often we see cases being paralysed for legal or procedural reasons, which are causing problems for businesses and end users. I am thinking here of the new plant breeding techniques, for example cisgenesis. In contrast to GMO techniques, only species's own genes are used. This actually works the same as classic breeding, only many times faster. As a result, beneficial crop characteristics such as disease and drought resistance can be crossed in faster and better. This can significantly reduce the use of plant protection products. In 2012, the European food watchdog EFSA already concluded that cisgenesis is as safe as conventional breeding and that if only species's own genes are used in breeding, there is no GMO. Unfortunately, cisgenesis is still covered by strict GMO legislation, which means that this promising technique still cannot be applied. Back to the proposal on the table.

I would like to reply to some of these. Regarding the claims that the Commission proposal is not in line with the European Union single market rules, I will simply respond that this is incorrect. According to the European Union Treaties, Member States may derogate from the freedom-of-movement rule on the basis of overriding reasons related to the public interest. That is enshrined in the Treaties. This is not against the Single Market: it is about the right of Member States to see such overriding reasons. We must follow the rule of law; we must follow the Treaties; we cannot act without a legal basis – and the proposal fully respects that principle. I am in favour of supporting the single European market. I am in favour of supporting science-based assessment, because that is the only way. I believe in science – independent science. As regards the accusation that an impact assessment was not carried out, I would say this: it is meaningless for the Commission to carry out an ex-ante impact assessment on a proposal which merely gives the Member States a legal basis on which to act. In relation to cultivation proposals, the same logic applies. The proposal does not have an impact in itself: it will be up to Member States to evaluate the possible impact of their own decisions – about which you have raised many, many questions. It is in the hands of Member States to use the opt-out mechanism if they are ready to do so. They must follow the impact assessment procedure because this is a very serious and complex matter. I fear from the unwilling tone of the discussions that there is a real possibility of Parliament rejecting the proposal. Allow me to repeat my view: it would be preferable to continue to discuss this frankly and openly under the ordinary legislative procedure rather than to seek to close down the dialogue. I would repeat once again Jean-Claude Juncker’s promise: the Commission should be in a position to give the majority view of democratically—elected governments at least the same weight as scientific advice. It is about the Member State governments’ view, not about the scope for Treaty changes to change the voting mechanism, because that is enshrined in the Treaties. Secondly, I would not want the Commission to be able to take a decision when the majority of Member States had not encouraged it to do so. That is our proposal: please, if Member States have reasonable opinions, that is one thing, but you cannot destroy the single market, you cannot destroy our common European agricultural policy, and you cannot act against the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) assessment because we need a centralised EFSA opinion. On the subject of EFSA, this risk assessment of GM food and feed is carried out by EFSA in accordance with the highest and the most up-to-date scientific standards. We have mentioned independence and scientific evidence, and I am ready to discuss all these arguments about EFSA’s transparency. We must create trust in EFSA because otherwise we will have no scientifically based instruments. We must do our job in the best way to preserve trust in EFSA. Commission Implementing Regulation No 503/2013 on applications for authorisation of genetically modified food and feed reinforces the authorisation process by clarifying the studies to be conducted by applicants and defining the protocols to be followed. It was adopted by a qualified majority of Member States. Furthermore, EFSA carries out risk assessment in close cooperation with Member States: with all 28 Member States, with all the scientists involved. Of course, we must debate and see how to improve EFSA’s capacity but we need science. I call on you once again, honourable Members, to reflect on the consequences of this discussion before proceeding to the vote. We need to reinforce the legitimacy of European Union decisions on GMOs. I would like to say that I have heard some excellent proposals: to continue our debates on biotechnologies, on science, on examining ways of supporting European Union researchers, including biotechnologists, more effectively. I cannot imagine the European Union without scientific progress – that would be against logic. I am a cardiac surgeon and I know what a scientific approach to all the issues means. I am ready to continue those debates. Maybe next year it would be good to organise debates together with the European Parliament, inviting representatives of non-governmental organisations and prominent scientists and to challenge some of our understanding of the issues. Lastly, I would like to confirm that the Commission believes this proposal is the right way of addressing the challenges in relation to the decision-making process on GMOs at European Union level.

Having heard this debate, I think he has a deep conviction that, for different reasons, there is one point that unites almost all the political groups, which is the reject of the Commission's proposal. I said, for different reasons: because, on the one hand, there are reasons for the inconsistency between a proposal for better regulation put forward by the Commission and the lack of an impact assessment, which you explain to us that it would probably not be necessary, because it will be the Member States that will have to opt out.

We want something else, and we have also heard some clearly positive proposals in this House, which you have accepted, but which I would like to highlight.

The rules in force allow Member States to prohibit the cultivation on their territory of authorised GMOs. But when using (trading) GMOs, it goes beyond national borders because of the free movement of goods. The introduction of a ban on GMOs in an individual country means the introduction of border controls on imports of food and feed, which is contrary to the rules of the pan-European market. There are therefore no guarantees that the proposal will work in a single Europe that seeks to remove restrictions and barriers to trade. Clearly, the national approach to limiting GMOs does not provide solutions that avoid negative consequences for the single market and for the competitiveness of farmers.

Rejecting the delegate deal with the Council and Commission would risk extending the shelf life of an old regulation that is no longer fit for purpose and that is slow to respond to market needs and safety concerns. Our agri-food sector is constantly changing, constantly adapting and improving. We must always be prepared for change. We need a legislative framework in place to keep up with the technological developments of the past 20 years. For example, with regard to nanotechnology and cell tissue cultures, the new innovations must have a proper legal framework securing food safety standards. A new, single and centralised procedure for the authorisation of novel foods and more robust data protection will provide applicants with greater legal certainty, reduce the administrative burden for SMEs and therefore encourage further innovation in the agri-food sector across Europe. It will not compromise our safety standards, which are the highest in the world, and we are rightly proud of them. On the contrary, the enhanced role for the European Food Safety Authority and increased transparency in the process can only improve these standards. The Novel Foods Regulation has had a long and arduous history. I want us to make a breakthrough today. During the negotiations on novel foods we have managed to come much further than Parliament had done in the past. I am pleased with the substantial progress that has been made on a number of issues, and I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and all who worked on this to bring it thus far. On nanomaterials, the definition has been moved to this regulation to reflect the safety concerns of this House, and it will be updated, by means of a delegated act, to reflect scientific progress: in other words, Parliament is being given a say on how the definition is updated. The wording on the test methods for nanomaterials has been strengthened, while taking into account environmental and consumer protection.  On the environment, this regulation should take into account a high level of protection and improvement in the quality of the environment. On animal welfare, the regulation has been strengthened in terms of animal-welfare measures, urging that testing on animals should be replaced, reduced or refined. The transparency of the process has been significantly strengthened: by obliging the Commission to publish the summary of every application and through the fact that the list of rejected applications should be publicly available. Food consisting of, isolated from, or produced from cell or tissue cultures derived from animals, plants, micro-organisms, fungi or algae is now explicitly mentioned in the scope of the regulation. The precautionary principle is explicitly mentioned in the articles as a main factor for the Commission in deciding whether to propose to authorise a novel food. A provision has also been added to align time periods with regard to data protection under the Novel Foods and Health Claims Regulations, which will act as a stimulant to innovation. The regulation also makes it easier for traditional food from one or more third countries to be placed on the internal market. This is particularly welcome for developing countries attempting to export their traditional products. Nevertheless, and quite rightly, any food imported from these third countries must meet our high quality standards. Let me also comment on two other issues. Cloning no longer belongs in this proposal. After the collapse of 2011, the Commission rightly separated out the cloning issue to different files. If you disagree with the Commission proposals, then the right place to have the debate is in relation to those files. Insisting on tackling the cloning issue here benefits no one, whatever side of the debate you are on: clearly the Council will not move on novel foods unless it moves on other files. But if the Council moves on other files it is no longer necessary to do anything on novel foods. Some did want novel food to be authorised by delegated acts, but there is a confusion here. If we are a Parliament representing the people of Europe, we have to act as a Parliament: it is up to us to set the legal framework, not to implement it. We are the legislature, not the executive branch of government. The concept of Parliament deciding on authorisations for companies seems to me a very strange one. To sum up, I want the European food sector to continue to lead rather than follow. We need legislation that can keep pace with new technologies, otherwise I greatly fear that we will be left behind.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 62, "date": "2015-10-28.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, first let me thank the rapporteur, James Nicholson, and the shadow rapporteurs, Pilar Ayuso, Pavel Poc, Marit Paulsen, Lynn Boylan, Bart Staes and Eleonora Evi, for the compromise text on novel foods we have in front of us today. I very much appreciate their hard work and commitment which has led to a good outcome. The right balance has been reached in ensuring that only safe foods may be placed on the market, while allowing for innovation in the agri-food sector. The current regulation on novel foods dates back to 1997. Over the last 18 years, scientific innovation in the food sector has progressed, giving rise to the creation of new types of food products. In parallel, consumption patterns among citizens have also changed. The Commission considers it necessary to adopt and improve an up-to-date legislative framework on novel foods to ensure food safety and to protect human health, while also facilitating the functioning of the internal market. This approach will ensure that innovation in the food sector can lead to the placing on the market of new scientifically—assessed safe foods. With a view to updating the current rules, the Commission proposes to streamline the authorisation procedure, through a centralised procedure at Commission level, by granting general authorisation and by ensuring a centralised safety assessment by the European Food Safety Authority. To improve efficiency, deadlines would be established for the evaluation and authorisation procedure, thus reducing the overall time spent on approvals. To improve transparency, the Commission would also make available on its website a summary of applications, as well as a list of applications that did not result in authorisation. This is in line with a request from this House. The safety of novel foods remains the main criterion for authorisation. The European Food Safety Authority will be systematically consulted on all questions relating to the safety of novel foods. In conclusion, innovation will be facilitated without compromising on food safety. Over the years, third countries have criticised our current rules, claiming that some foods that are traditional in their diets are considered to be novel foods in the European Union. This agreement will help us to simplify the authorisation procedure of so-called traditional foods from third countries with a history of safe use, and facilitate their placing on the market. At the same time, safety must not be compromised. To this end, if safety concerns are raised, we will ask the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority. The proposed new regulation on novel foods would contribute to innovation and facilitate market access on the agri-food sector by bringing clarity to the authorisation procedure. It would allow support for true innovators through its data protection provisions. Applicants who are able to present safety studies based on their own protected data would benefit from an individual authorisation for five years.

This is how simple it is, food safety and consumers' right to information. The reactions of European consumer organisations clearly and unequivocally say that consumers want both. And what happened after that? During the trialogue, the requirement that foods produced using nanotechnologies should not be authorised until methods are available to assess their safety and those methods are not available.

The third point is the question of delegated or implementing acts. We European Conservatives and Reformers are in favour of implementing acts.

It is imperative that the precautionary principle is front and centre in nanotechnology. We already know that these particles take on different characteristics to their bulk counterparts. There may well be benefits to the technology, but we cannot simply railroad through legislation without developing a fit-for-purpose safety risk assessment. We must have longitudinal studies on the impact of this technology on the environment and human health.

We are sending out a signal to industry that withholding information is OK. Surely if industries are confident in their product they would make all information available.

Technological progress in recent years has shown that current concepts of food ingredients are outdated. This is why it is important that the new provisions take account in particular of the safety aspects of products, so that any new food products do not have harmful effects on the consumer when they are introduced on the market. It should also be borne in mind whether the molecular structure of food is or is not modified in any way. In this way, we will avoid uncertainty about GMO products, which I believe must be eliminated from the European food market. In no case may new laws and new concepts become tools for their legalisation.

That is the key message of the review of the NEC Directive that will be voting on in a couple of hours. We need to set ambitious targets on key pollutants taking us forward to 2030 and beyond. The reason why is obvious, but let me spell it out: air pollution is the number one environmental cause of death in the EU. Over 400 000 of our citizens die prematurely each year and millions more suffer debilitating illness, medication and hospitalisation. This has an enormous human and economic cost: tens of billions of euros in days lost at work, and even more spent on health care bills. Air pollution also hits the natural environment through eutrophication and acid deposition. So, in December 2013, the Commission published its clean air package, which includes the NEC Directive. The central plank of the proposal is the setting of emissions reductions targets in all Member States for 2030, for six pollutants. This proposal was accompanied by a 352-page impact assessment. This file has had a difficult passage through the process. Parliament agreed to commission an additional impact assessment of our own, which was finally published in October 2014, after the European elections. At the same time, the Commission’s Work Programme suggested that they were considering withdrawing the whole proposal, and a lot of time and effort went into ensuring that this did not happen. I still feel strongly, as your rapporteur, that this is a key issue that is best tackled at EU level. Air pollution does not stop at Member State borders. I passionately believe that better regulation and good air quality are not mutually exclusive, and this is why I fought so hard to keep this proposal alive. This is a very important point for me because, having invested so much time and political capital into making sure the proposal stayed on the table, it really is imperative that we vote responsibly today, finding a consensus that garners broad support on all the key issues. That means not supporting the Environment Committee’s position on lower ceilings across all pollutants, and supporting amendments on ammonia. There will be very many people here who will say that this is not ambitious enough, that we need to push further, but I would like them to take another look at the facts. The proposal I am supporting delivers a 52% improvement in health outcomes. It rejects the Commission’s proposed flexibility for shipping, has added mandatory targets for 2025 on all pollutants, offers vastly improved access to justice for citizens affected by poor air quality, as well as improvements on national air pollution control programs and reporting. This will help all levels of government in Member States, including the regional and sub-regional authorities that have engaged so vigorously in the lobbying process.  Frankly, this is the first time that I have ever experienced this so starkly with regional authorities: a real bottom-up demand for action. My report pushes the Commission to ensure that the RDE legislation is agreed as soon as possible. We all agree that NOx must be dealt with urgently. The public are demanding action in this area following the recent revelations from the car industry. What about agriculture? Across Europe farmers are concerned about demands to decrease output of ammonia. If they are going to achieve this, they will need help, both technically and financially. That is why I have proposed an amendment asking for a review of ammonia targets by 2022 in line with scientific evidence and a new article on access to funding, calling on the Commission to support farmers through its mid-term review of CAP  greening. So, to those of you who are thinking of voting for even tougher targets, let me just say: think very carefully. We do not currently have a position from Council on this file. We do know that many Member States, including some of the biggest, have not yet presented their positions. They are waiting for this plenary vote to see where Parliament will go, so let us not signal intransigence. Let us not choose political grandstanding. Let us not play to the gallery. The EP should be ambitious, but also pragmatic. Let us strike the right balance and get this dossier moving quickly towards trialogue. I do not want to be responsible for any more delay – let us give our citizens a rapid route to improved air quality. It is what they demand, and it is what they deserve.  Finally, can I just say a big thank you to all the shadow rapporteurs, thank you for your help, and a special mention for Kateřina Konečná from the GUE/NGL Group who cannot be with us today as she delivered her baby boy a few days ago. I am sure we all wish to send her our congratulations.

As Julie Girling has already pointed out, more than 400 000 people die prematurely every year because of poor air quality, not to mention the increasing number of chronic respiratory diseases.  The severe air pollution episodes in north-west Europe in the spring once again demonstrated that pure air is as much an environmental as a health concern. We breathe polluted air even if we cannot often see or smell it. The situation is unacceptable. However, it is avoidable. This is why I am so keen for us to make progress in the negotiations on the Directive on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants.  This proposal is a key part of the Commission’s clean air policy package and an important deliverable for the 7th Environment Action Programme. Every month that passes we are delaying the implementation of policies that could save lives, that could reduce respiratory problems and that could reduce the cost of health care and absenteeism from work. That is why I very much hope that we – meaning Parliament, the Council and the Commission – can come to a viable agreement during a possible first reading.  I will take this opportunity to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Julie Girling, and her colleagues from the Environment Committee for their commitment and for their hard work on the proposal. I would also like to acknowledge the opinions of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.  To maintain their chances of first reading agreement, it will be very important that the positions of the co-legislators do not diverge too much. The Commission proposal is a well-balanced package and represents a major reduction in health impacts of 52% by the year 2030. These figures are supported by a solid and a substantial impact assessment, by scientific evidence and by cost-benefit analysis. To give the best prospects of early resolution I would ask Parliament, as I have already asked the Council in June, to support the level of ambition in the Commission’s proposal. To achieve this, efforts are needed from all sectors.  The cost of current legislation falls almost entirely on industry, transport and households. Only 2% of these large costs fall on agriculture. To move forward, sectors that have so far contributed little will need to do more. Agricultural emissions make the largest relative contribution to PM2.5 in Europe through ammonia emissions. For instance, the major air pollution problem in Paris in the spring of 2014 was predominantly caused by agricultural pollution.  It is important to counter some claims being made on the impact of agriculture. There is no need to change to structure of the agriculture sector. No action is needed from small farms, and there is no need to push for intensification or to reduce animal numbers. We focus on applying good practice and existing technology in large industrial farms, while providing support for implementation under the rural development programme.  With regards to methane, where some Members have concerns, this is increasingly driving background concentration of ground-level ozone in the EU, and has a strong climate impact. The proposed reductions will help us argue for similar reductions across the hemisphere. To conclude, the Commission proposal represents a balanced and a cost-effective distribution of effort. The implementation costs are far outweighed by the benefits to society, including reduced healthcare costs, increased productivity and opportunities for new jobs in a developing green economy. Together we can deliver a major improvement to the health of the European Union citizen. So I would like to invite Members to support the proposal before them.

That is why the European Commission has chosen to include methane in the NEC directive to show the rest of the world that the EU has a clear methane target.  However, I do not believe that this is the right instrument. For me, the following arguments are reason enough to vote methane from the proposal. Number one: methane is primarily a greenhouse gas and is therefore already regulated through the climate targets. Two, methane emissions have already been reduced by almost a third in Europe. Three: through the feed we can reduce methane emissions from ruminants such as cows and sheep, but the only way to actually capture methane is by putting animals back in the barn, even though society is asking for the animals to be left out. Four: biologically kept animals in particular emit more methane because they are rationed differently. Five: it is agriculture that can play a very important role in reducing greenhouse gases, despite methane emissions. Through organic matter, agriculture ensures that CO2 is absorbed into the soil.

I think we agree on the fundamental objective: we need to improve air quality in Europe in order to protect the health of our citizens. In the difficult, sometimes very technical negotiations, we have been able to find a whole series of compromises, which are supported by almost all the political groups. However, there are some key points on which there is a need for improvement from the PPE-DE point of view. The tightening of the already ambitious reduction targets resulting from the vote in the Committee on the Environment is unacceptable.  The opinions of the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Industry have not been sufficiently taken into account. Both committees are calling for methane to be removed from the scope of the directive, as methane should also be regulated through climate policy. Mr Huitema has just rightly pointed this out.  The very ambitious reduction targets for ammonia remain unacceptable and will lead to significant disadvantages for European agriculture. We therefore call on the Commission to review this and to call for achievable appropriate targets for a balanced approach between better air quality and maintaining the competitiveness of our agriculture.  Not that we are misunderstood by some colleagues: the PPE-DE is not opposed in principle to the inclusion of mercury in the scope of the directive. But our policy should be based on a sound impact assessment, and we are also calling for it to be used for the inclusion of mercury.  Goals must be realistic and achievable. With this in mind, I hope that we will be able to find a balanced approach and then start negotiations with the Council quickly.

The reality, however, is much, much worse.  Air pollution across Europe kills 10 times more people than all road traffic accidents. More people die from poor air quality than from smoking. Poor air circulates around us all and is as likely in the countryside as it is in the cities. In my own country, the UK, it is estimated that 55 000 people are dying from poor air quality every year. Ninety percent of all Europeans living in cities are exposed to levels of air pollution deemed damaging to human health. I supported a high level of ambition during the committee stage and will continue to do so today. This is based on robust evidence commissioned by this House, which showed that we can prevent more people dying prematurely. Governments must step up their efforts to comply with better air pollution measures, and the 2025 targets mean Member States can start planning now.

We have a European Parliament impact assessment available showing that, with the same cost effectiveness, we can reduce our emissions more, and deliver more on public health. That finding has been reached with an impact assessment. People are always complaining that we just come up with numbers and put them where we like: well, this has been done on the basis of research.

We keep reminding each other that we need to be more realistic and that we need to look more at reality, and I could not agree more. That is exactly what we should be doing and the biggest reality is that we have almost half a million European citizens dying every year from poor air quality, plus a bigger number with chronic respiratory diseases. The reality is that we need to stop this.  As several of you have stressed in your statements, our citizens increasingly demand action to address the health impacts of air pollution. Efforts are needed from all sectors, including agri-industry. It is important to keep the level of ambition for ammonia in line with the overall objective and to retain methane in the proposal. This will not have any negative effect on animal welfare and will not require keeping them inside, as some of Members have tried to suggest.  On the overall ambition, I share the rapporteur’s concern that if the position of this House is too far from that of the Council, this will jeopardise the chances of agreement. I would therefore encourage your support for a plenary position close to the original proposal of the Commission for all pollutants. It was also encouraging to note that we all agree on the objectives and it would be a big pity not to agree on how we can achieve these same objectives.  A number of Members referred to the supplementary impact assessment done by the European Parliament’s own services. While this shows that with the climate and energy package we can deliver greater air pollution reduction for broadly the same cost, it also shows that we can deliver the same reduction at a lower cost. Given that the assessment does not fully reflect the latest state of play, I feel the latter message should carry more weight. With regard to a number of other proposed amendments, many improve the original proposal. However, I would make two last comments.  On the interim targets for 2025, it is important to ensure steady progress towards the 2030 reductions. But if the interim targets become binding, this could in some cases lead to disproportionate costs. Hence I would support a solution based around the original Commission proposal. With regard to reduction commitments for mercury, as emissions from all major sources are regulated under the Industrial Emissions Directive, reduction commitments under the NEC directive would not further reduce emissions. Furthermore exposure of EU citizens to mercury is largely due to emissions from third countries. The Commission is preparing the ratification of the Minamata Convention on Mercury which is expected to curb those emissions and thereby reduce exposure of EU citizens to this toxic substance.  As I said earlier on, every month that passes delays the implementation of policies that could alleviate the problems with bad air quality. I call on your support today to pave the way for a viable agreement between the co-legislators during the first reading. Let me conclude by making some final remarks. First, this is not just about a better environment, it is about avoiding and reducing further deaths as a result of our non-action. Polluted air kills; non-action does the same. EU citizens deserve, expect and have a right to action. We all acknowledge that we have a serious, lethal problem, so let us all come together towards a much-needed responsible solution. Finally, let me assure everyone here that we are not after less agriculture, we are not after less economic growth, what we are after is better and healthier agriculture, what we are after is better economic growth that will contribute to better living and not to premature deaths.

I own agriculture, which is why I also know how Danish agriculture is constantly being squeezed by new legislation. This is despite the fact that the Danish agricultural sector has been immensely adept at doing its part to protect the environment. Yet the sector is being punished. Competition is distorted if Danish agriculture is obliged to set overambitious targets for ammonia reduction, when, for example, in Germany, which is right next door, they do not have the same obligations. This means that the air is still polluted in Denmark, while at the same time we have to contend with unequal conditions of competition. That's not fair. Everyone has to go in bunches. There is no point in a small country like Denmark taking the heavy tow. Neither environmental nor competitive. At the same time, methane reduction targets also threaten agriculture with double regulation, as such targets already exist and need to be renegotiated again within the framework of climate policy.

Parliament's draft position amending the Air Quality Directive is of concern in many respects. On the one hand, the proposed methane emission limits would have a devastating impact on Hungarian livestock production. The Hungarian Government is doing its utmost to encourage an increase in the hungarian cattle and pig population, which has fortunately led to an increase in the number of both livestock. The proposed limit, which experts calculate would require a 30% reduction in current emissions! – break the objective of increasing livestock, one of the most important objectives of the Hungarian agricultural government. Moreover, the reduction of methane emissions is already regulated and is subject to the Community commitment to reduce greenhouse gases. There are also serious problems with ammonia emission limits. The 2030 and 2020 limits are already unrealistic, but the proposed 2025 intermediate limit is downright outrageous. Hungary would require a reduction of almost 40%! Furthermore, unnecessary legislation would be taken here, since fertilisation methods are already regulated by the standards of the Cross Compliance system and other environmental rules, in particular the Nitrate Directive. This would complicate the situation of farmers and result in unenforceable standards.

Today, therefore, the only logical next step is to change the legislation restricting emissions of air pollutants, based on a report by the Committee on the Environment. Doing so could save more than 74,000 people from premature death every year across Europe, according to the latest expert calculations (http://www.eeb.org/?LinkServID=9168DFDD-5056-B741-DBA5B64C92B81F9D&amp;showMeta=0&amp;aa). Diseases caused by air pollution have significant economic costs in the health sector and due to reduced working hours. To prevent this, binding targets should also be adopted in Europe for 2020, 2025 and 2030. Mandatory limits for ammonia, methane and mercury are also required in the Directive.

Emissions do not stop at national borders either, which is why overseas countries and maritime and air transport must also be made compulsory. In addition, individual states should not be able to have a flexibility regime in the accounting of their emissions, as most of the Member States will not meet certain targets, especially for NOX emissions, within the specified period.

Parliament did not fully refuse the Council's proposals and only amended the proposal for a timetable for increasing the number of judges by introducing further steps and adding the need for gender balance in the appointment of judges.

Firstly, because it completely ignores the interests of taxpayers. At a time when the EU is calling for serious austerity measures to balance member states' budgets and calls on these Member States to reduce their public spending, such a frivolous increase in costs is pointless and difficult for Europeans to accept. Doubling the number of judges would also lead to an increase in the number of legal rapporteurs and assistants, thus increasing the number to more than 100. Given that the operation of each office costs more than EUR 1 million per year, total remuneration would increase EU structural expenditure by more than EUR 20 million per year. The other reason why Parliament rejects the EBB's proposal is the dignity of the judiciary itself, that is, the reputation and respect for the judicial office. The Union may not appoint judges in the way it appoints political commissioners. Judges should be selected on the basis of their professional experience and legal expertise in order to guarantee the quality of decision-making, while the right character is also the basis for selection, ensuring fairness, honesty and impartiality.

As a result of reasonable steps taken to maintain them, the amount of seafish fish fished will be continuously and significantly reduced. Therefore, the common fisheries policy should pay much more attention to sustainable fish farming, i.e. aquaculture, and in particular freshwater fish farming. A significant number of fish ponds in Hungary are located in Natura 2000 sites. These farms do not pose any threat to the natural assets of these areas. Moreover, in many cases it is precisely because of our closed-system fish ponds that they have created or preserved individual wetland associations.

The reintroduction of such controls between Member States would reverse the economic achievements of the European Customs Union and the single market.

The new regulation, by increasing member states' discretion over the agricultural and commercial use of GMOs, raises serious doubts as to its actual applicability and its compliance with the rules governing the single market. The introduction of different regulations diverges from the need for greater integration and would put at risk the interconnection between the different food production chains.

The lack of borders also raises serious doubts about the controls that would rule the introduction of GMO products into the various markets. The division of the single market would also threaten competitive balances.

As if that were not the case, the European Commission is not obliged to initiate any proposal for legislative amendments, so their effectiveness is minimal. In the face of this situation, the final report is not at all critical of the procedures regulated for this participatory tool; it also proposes limiting the content of the European citizens' initiative if it does not suit the competences of the Union and, above all, that the Commission should make a legislative proposal only if it has a positive opinion published by it.

It has a design flaw, as we denounced from the campaign on the European Constitution, which became the Lisbon Treaty. It only allows the Commission to act, not to act. For example, it cannot be validly petitioned for the Commission to stop Turkey's accession negotiations or the transatlantic treaty negotiations, nor can it be asked to end the liberalisation of public services, which is still less in the service of the public. It gives the Commission no obligation to follow up, or even an obligation to justify its fate for these initiatives. And what a fate! Of THE 51 ICE applications, only three were found to be admissible. One third of the refusals are appealed by their organizers to the Court of Justice.

No longer seeing any interest in this tool, citizens turn away from it and the number of ICEs deposited declines.

It is therefore important, as part of the EUSAIR strategy, to support projects such as the Ionian-Adriatic gas pipeline, which will bring gas from sites in the Caucasus region through Turkey. This will not only reduce our dependence on Russia, but also increase cooperation with the Caucasus states, which are unprotected by NATO against Russia and thus need our support.

This is best demonstrated by the fact that the rules on programming or reporting under cohesion policy do not provide for mechanisms for the flagship initiatives of the strategy and the contribution of the European Funds to their implementation. The European Commission, on the other hand, does not sufficiently address cohesion policy in its review of the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy. Employment and social policy areas undoubtedly suffer from this, as the objectives of creating quality jobs and combating social exclusion present in the strategy are not sufficiently achieved through cohesion policy.  Of course, it is to be pleased that the amounts allocated to these objectives are higher in the current programming period than in the previous one.

Here, a new EU investment instrument, the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), is crucial to bridge the investment gap in the EU.

Cohesion policy is also an investment policy that contributes to the smart, sustainable and inclusive growth of the EU and its Member States. Good governance and effective public institutions in the Member States are essential for sustainable and long-term economic growth, job creation and social and territorial development, and, on the contrary, economic and financial unpredictability and legal uncertainty can lead to a decline in public and private investment, thus jeopardised by the achievement of cohesion policy objectives. However, Parliament is very strongly in favour of applying macroeconomic conditions to the provision of structural assistance in the Member States. Macroeconomic irregularities at other levels of administration cannot be allowed to penalise regional or local authorities for the reprogramming or suspension of the use of funds, which would impair their respective economic and social situation.

This is just to explain to everyone where I am sitting/standing. However let us get on to the very important issue of ‘smart borders’.  On behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), allow me to present the oral question which we have tabled to the Council and to the Commission. It is good to see again Commissioner Avramopoulous and, of course, our Presidency, which we know has been working incredibly hard over the past few days.  The Smart Borders Package is one which we have debated on a number of occasions in the past, including in this Chamber. The reason for this is very simple. The original proposal that the Commission presented in 2013 had so many technical problems that in the committee we did not even proceed to the stage of preparing draft reports.  Since then, we have been in a discussion process with the other institutions and in a process of verifying what technical options we have. It is this process that we are continuing today. We have presented a series of questions to the Council and Commission and we are looking forward to their responses. From the Commission we would like to receive an update regarding the new proposals. Specifically, does the Commissioner intend to present a single legislative proposal which would be complemented by a modification of the Schengen Borders Code to take account of the systems at the border, or would it present two separate proposals which would also be complemented by a modification of the Schengen Borders Code? Also, when does it intend to present the announced revised proposals, and could the Commission outline its main ideas for the revised proposals and its intended purpose? The following questions are also addressed to both the Council and the Commission.  We are interested to know whether they consider an envisaged entry/exit system and registered traveller programme to be appropriate and adequate responses to the current and future situation at the EU’s external border, given the constant increase in the number of border crossings and, if so, why? Do they consider the envisaged entry and exit system to be an appropriate instrument for reducing the number of so-called overstayers and, if so, why? What are the views of the Council and Commission as regards access for law enforcement purposes? What are their views as to the intended purposes and what are their thoughts on the systems as regards the architecture, biometric identifiers and data retention periods? And to what extent may the European Court of Justice’s ruling on data retention impact on the proposals as they stand? What are their views regarding upgrading the existing tools to achieve the intended objectives of the entry and exit system and the registered traveller programme, regarding the interoperability and compatibility of various IT systems that already exist with regard to the Smart Borders Package? Finally, for the Council specifically, what is the Council’s view on the costs of the Smart Borders Package, in particular those that are not fully covered by the Internal Security Fund? This Smart Borders package, which will take us into the next Presidency – where there is a lot of interest in this matter, and I have spoken briefly to the Minister – is one which has many deep civil liberties implications, but as you have heard from my questions – and we have one of our rapporteurs here, Ms Fajon – has many technical aspects. We in the LIBE Committee want to get these technical aspects discussed openly and transparently, but we are also concerned with the many civil liberties aspects, so I look forward to the debate today and I am very pleased that the Members here present will give their best to ensure that the Smart Borders Package begins to make sense to all of us today.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me, first of all, thank Mr Moraes and the two rapporteurs, Mr Diaz de Mera and Mrs Fajon, for this issue, but above all for the efforts they have made to ensure Parliament's active participation in this important European project.  In the 2009 Stockholm programme, the European Council called on the Commission - and I quote - to \"submit proposals for an entry and exit system coupled with a rapidly procedureed passenger registration programme, with the aim of ensuring that such a system is operational as soon as possible\". This request has become urgent in the current context, which I do not need to remind and describe, indeed, the European Council of 15 October last called - I quote again - to \"develop technical solutions to strengthen the control of the external borders of the European Union in order to achieve the objectives pursued, both in terms of migration and security, without harming the fluidity of movements\". The creation of a European entry/exit system is a necessary step to preserve the Schengen area. Currently, there are twelve countries that use national entry/exit systems, but the value added remains limited.  If no system is established at EU level, Member States will continue to act on their own, without the efficiency and harmonised approach that the Smart Borders package can provide. Such a system should lead to harmonization and standardization of border controls, and lead to a higher level of security. This system will provide more certainty for calculating the authorized period of stay. Border guards now spend a lot of time looking at the composting of travel documents and calculating the authorized period of stay. If this system works properly, border guards will have more time to identify passengers who pose a migratory or security risk. In addition, the fact that composting is no longer required will allow the use of automated border control systems to be extended to a portion of travellers, for whom the border crossing will be more fluid.  The European entry/exit system will make it easier to identify people at the border and within the territory. This could not have been achieved by an upgrade to SIS II. The technical study presented by the Commission a year ago also showed that it would not be realistic to overhaul the visa information system, which is still being deployed and applies only to third-country nationals who need a visa, to achieve these objectives. A European system would act as a deterrent for third-country nationals who intend to exceed the length of their allowed stay. The fact that Member States will have a clear view of the number and nationality of these people would also allow for more appropriate measures to counter this phenomenon. This information will also be relevant in the negotiation of visa facilitation agreements, when considering the granting of a visa exemption for third countries and when considering the application of the visa waiver suspension mechanism.  As for the frequent flyer program, the Commission has always been in favour of such a program. At this stage of the discussion, a majority of Member States are in favour of such a programme with flexibility as to how it should be applied according to the type of border. During the discussions, a majority voted in favour of a lean RTP, presented by the Commission in its technical study.  On the question of access to the European entry/exit system, a very large majority of Member States have expressed support for such a possibility from the very beginning of the system's operation. The purpose of such access would be to prevent or detect terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences or to carry out investigations in this area. Moreover, this was also the wish of a large majority of representatives of national parliaments, at the meeting organized by the Committee on Civil Liberties last February. For Member States, access by law enforcement to the European system would be introduced on a secondary basis, as in the case of the VIS and Eurodac. This access should be subject to strict conditions and procedures. To this end, the Commission endeavours to identify the necessary elements for future provisions as well as the list of safeguards necessary in accordance with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice.  As regards architecture, based on the technical study that preceded the pilot project, a majority of Member States favoured the implementation of the passenger registration programme and the entry/exit system as a single system. A majority in the Council prefers, at this stage, a progressive approach to integrating the entry/exit system and the RTP into the VIS. The interoperability between future European and existing national systems and the introduction of the possibility of reusing existing elements in the VIS system will help to reduce the final cost of this project. In terms of the type and number of biometric identifiers, we are awaiting the results of the pilot project, which will be decisive for future discussions.  For data retention periods, a large majority of Member States are in favour of a uniform five-year retention period, in order to harmonize all the systems and for all the objectives mentioned: this would be in the interest not only of the authorities, but also of travellers, as this would reduce the number of cases where their data should be recorded. The Council is fully aware of the importance of the Court of Justice's ruling of 8 April 2014 which overturns the Data Retention Directive. All the debates in the Council on the establishment of a smart border system have taken full account of the principle of doing only what is necessary and proportionate to achieve the objectives pursued.  Regarding the potential cost of the Smart Borders package, the Council shares Parliament's concerns not to exceed the budget strictly necessary for the efficient operation of the system.  The Council believes that this legislative package is vital for the Schengen area, and I should also congratulate the Commission, since yesterday the first Vice-President of the Commission announced it in the work programme for 2016, which includes three regulations concerning this area. We all, of course, count on cooperation with Parliament to bring this important project to a successful place.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1960, "date": "2015-10-28.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, let me start by wishing the Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs a swift recovery. I want you to know, Claude, that we need you to be fully operational for months to come. We have a lot of work to do together. (Applause) I would like to thank the honourable Members for this further opportunity to reflect with you on ‘smart borders’. I know how sensitive the Parliament is on this issue. As announced in both the Agenda on Security and the Agenda on Migration, and as already mentioned at our previous exchange on 9 June, it is our intention to present a modified proposal on smart borders by the beginning of next year. In our upcoming 2016 proposal we aim to present a solution that is operational and cost effective. We will propose a system that performs well and quickly and that meets the European Union’s security and migration policy objectives, improves the traveller’s experience, does not increase the workload for border guards and stands the test of our data protection legislation. The Commission will modify the existing proposals in the Smart Borders Package to deliver a single legislative proposal complemented by a targeted modification of the Schengen Borders Code. It will be supported by a new impact assessment in order to incorporate and justify the changes to the original proposals. These changes will be limited to the following issues assessed: the architecture of the system; the biometric identifier to be used; the facilitation of border crossings; the retention time for the storage of data; and access for law-enforcement purposes. The current border control system is neither efficient nor effective given increased travel flows and Member States’ financial constraints. The smart borders proposal will, when implemented, lead to a reduction in border guards’ repetitive manual tasks, and release resources where they are urgently needed. It will also facilitate the crossing of EU external borders by third-country nationals through a semi-automated or fully automated system. The modified smart borders proposal will allow for a more effective EU policy against irregular migration and notably the phenomenon of over-stayers. It will help border guards in detecting travellers who did not observe the terms of their stay in the Schengen zone and will allow them to undertake appropriate action. This is also expected to have a preventive effect on over-staying. Data generated at entry/exit could also be of use to law enforcement authorities in the fight against terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences in specific cases. Should access for law enforcement purposes be granted, the necessary substantive and procedural safeguards will obviously be introduced.  Subject to the results of the new impact assessment, some preliminary conclusions can already be presented. As I have said on previous occasions, it seems preferable to build a single system, with functionalities for both an entry/exit system and registered travellers’ programmes, instead of two different systems. It reduces the development and operating costs, avoids the duplication of travellers’ personal data and reduces the impact on national systems. As for possible synergies with existing systems, the re-use of certain elements from the visa information system, such as the common biometric matching system, seems to be the preferred option. Such an approach presents a lower level of risk and will be cheaper than the option of full and immediate integration to a biometric identification and authentication system. The possibility of limited interoperability between the entry/exit system and the visa information system is under assessment: it would prevent registration of the same data concerning the same persons in two different systems. The 2013 proposal was for the use of 10 fingerprints and biometric identifiers. However, the technical study showed that a facial image is sufficient for verification of the identity of a traveller, while the combination of fingerprints and facial image gives the best results for traveller identification. The ongoing test phase will need to compare how these options work out in practice. However, it is clear to me that the biometric identifier used for the entry/exit system has to be as light and non—intrusive as possible. A major challenge for us is to ensure that the introduction of a smart borders system will accelerate the border-control process. To complement the functionalities for a registered travellers’ programme, increased scope for using process accelerators, such as self-service kiosks or mobile device applications, could be promoted. This would facilitate border crossing for a wider group of travellers. The impact assessment will look into the details of this important question.  On the subject of data retention, it is clear that if records of previous data are deleted too quickly travellers would have to re-enrol more often. It would also mean that border guards can see only a very short period of the traveller’s history. Remember that, in today’s situation with stamped passports, border guards can reconstruct several years of travel history when looking at the passport of the person standing in front of them. In this context I want to underline once again that the Court of Justice ruling on the Data Retention Directive has no direct effect on other EU legal instruments. However, it is very clear that a strict assessment of the proportionality and necessity of measures that constitute serious restrictions to fundamental rights is needed. These key points raised in the Court of Justice judgment will be fully addressed in the smart borders proposal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1961, "date": "2015-10-28.json", "name": "Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra", "mepid": "28397", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, yes, Mr Moraes' approach to the question and the intervention of the Presidency of the Council and Mr Avramopoulos has been very timely. I want to start by saying that these systems are effectively designed to control, facilitate and expedite passenger traffic.

This is something that has led to a lot of confusion here, and this confusion has come from the Presidency of the Council and the Presidency of the Commission. Currently it is estimated that in the Schengen area there are between three and five million people who have exceeded the time stay limit established to remain in our territory. It is therefore very necessary to put an end to these practices and these procedures, which are a clear violation of the Schengen area. I naturally support the access of State Security Forces to the system, as an added value, provided that it is a matter of clarifying a few things, such as which authorities would access; provide these authorities with the necessary guarantees for access to be provided and limited for purposes; and finally, I am reassured that the judgment is taken into consideration and that, even if it has no impact on the legislative acts of the European Union, it will indeed be taken into account.

Several things have happened in recent weeks and months that need to be clarified. We are talking about the introduction of smart borders at the Union's external borders, a project worth almost €800 million, which is supposed to facilitate the crossing of borders for travellers from third countries, introduce easier control over them, automate border procedures and the like. Unfortunately, all of you, including you, Commissioner, Mr Schmit, are in a difficult situation. There are various proposals circulating between Member States. For some of my colleagues, we find out by chance that some countries want the recast legislative proposal to be published as early as December, because they clearly link the introduction of smart borders to extreme migratory pressures on Europe and security risks. We cannot allow this to happen, and that was not the purpose of the European Commission's proposal. Yes, we share serious concerns about developments in Europe, over the apparently poor or uncontrolled arrivals. My country Slovenia is under extreme pressure these days. Austria announced this morning the construction of some kind of fence or barrier on the border with Slovenia. Schengen will be seriously threatened by such a measure. I'm afraid of how Slovenia will react. She will be forced to consider similar measures at the border with Croatia. These are all the concerns we share on a daily basis, and also the view that fences within schengen countries, as well as the construction of a European fortress with smart borders, may not be the best solution. However, it is indeed harmful to the current situation with the need to introduce smart borders. When we talk about new solutions to the management of European borders, we need a thorough reflection. However, when we talk about smart borders, we need smart proposals, and I sincerely hope that when presenting the recast proposal, the European Commission will take into account the concerns of the European Parliament. On behalf of the Socialists and Democrats, I would like to highlight in particular the following: firstly, what is the purpose of the proposal and is it really proportionate to the dizzying costs? Analyses showed lower costs. Have we taken advantage of all the possibilities of existing systems such as VIS or SIS II? Are we against any access by the judicial authorities to the new system? We are facing major challenges when it comes to the issue of borders, and what I do not want is for us to build some complex and expensive system that would become just a kind of police tool, with no added value for those for whom it is intended, for passengers who are therefore coming to Europe and from whom we have not only economic benefits. The same as you would expect for Europeans elsewhere. Above all, I would like the cooperation between the institutions in this complex operation to be transparent, because it is the only way that we can find the best common solutions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1963, "date": "2015-10-28.json", "name": "Jussi Halla-aho", "mepid": "124727", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, the Schengen area is based on trust between the Member States. However, although the same Schengen Code applies to all Member States, its implementation varies from one country to another. The external border does have weak points, and this should not be the case. Certain Member States have their national entry/exit systems and registered travellers’ programmes, but their usefulness is limited as they do not communicate with each other. While free movement is one of the great achievements of European integration, it also offers many possibilities to criminals, terrorists, human traffickers, illegal immigrants and so on. These risks must be compensated by better management of the external border. The Smart Borders Package does not mean ‘Fortress Europe’. It is a technological update that enables us to more effectively enforce the legislation and rules that we already have. But the Smart Borders Package is not only about security. It is also about facilitating smoother border crossing. The number of travellers to the European Union will grow dramatically. This will mean long queues at border crossing points, if nothing is done. It is also in the interests of bona fide travellers that we bring our border management into the 21st Century. If we do not control the external borders we cannot have free movement of people within the European Union. This has become evident during the migration crisis, but it would be a true also in a normal situation.

Now, however, the reality of the management of the EU's external borders or the non-existent management of the EU's external borders is moving in the direction of stupid borders, namely very old border security methods. Hungary has already built a fence, Slovenia, Austria and Germany are thinking about it. While in Germany only local politicians dream about this nonsense, in Austria it is the interior minister who seriously believes that she will win a few populist votes in this way. Not so long ago, we celebrated the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall or the fall of the Iron Curtain. And now, in all seriousness, do we want to build fences and walls again in 2015? Even then, this did not help and only brought suffering and will not help in the present time. Our Schengen system is in serious jeopardy and the free movement of persons, which is a great achievement, is also at risk. If we do not succeed in actually finding a way for people to seek asylum legally outside the EU's borders, then people will continue to come and will continue to try to overcome fences in a simple way in order to gain a foothold on EU soil in any way. The money used here for alibi actions should be used to set up and secure refugee camps in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. There we can build walls, walls to protect the war refugees. Walls that may ensure that people can stay closer to home. That would actually help in our situation. In this sense, I also support the approach of using the money budgeted for smart borders and the money not used in this context in the current crisis, thereby supporting the coordination of Mediterranean activities, but also activities along the Balkan route.

Smart borders certainly can't be quicker. Instead, these intelligent borders, as you would like to say, are about using another building block in Fortress Europe. The police should have access to the fingerprints of third-country nationals. All non-EU citizens should enter this database in order to see if the fingerprints of these people may match fingerprints of crime scenes. This is contrary to fundamental law, because the European Court of Justice has just once again established that the mass storage of data without cause is simply not feasible under European law.  Police access to fingerprints is also discriminatory, because who is inside?  There are all those who do not have EU citizenship who want to enter. We would not be able to clean up EU citizens for good reason. However, the same must also apply to all foreigners.  As the Heads of State and Government recently decided, the smart-border system is now also there to tackle the refugee crisis. But that is probably just a bad joke, because if smart borders are to come, then the Member States must put millions of euros into fingerprint scanners, facial recognition devices and otherwise a lot of technology, so that the whole system can work at all.

I will raise four aspects. Firstly, the establishment of a smart border system will enable us to exchange data effectively, not only between the various national authorities but also with Europol or Interpol, to detect, for example, the use of stolen passports through automatic and automated access to their files. It is therefore clear, today, that we must change the modus operandi by making cooperation the rule and not the exception. Second, the full potential of this system must be harnessed by allowing access to law enforcement and by considering a retention period sufficient for this system to have added value. The SIS and vis are already available to national authorities and Europol. So the question I ask myself is: why not smart borders? Thirdly, this system must be adapted to all types of borders: both maritime, land and air. The news shows us that we cannot prioritise the protection of certain borders over other types of borders.

If we do nothing, we will either have to face much longer queues at the borders, or we will have to employ more border guards in the near future. Neither of these options seems acceptable or feasible. I notice that many Members made reference to Schengen. I avail myself of this opportunity to state and repeat: we will not allow isolated, one-sided actions taken under the state of fear to put into question the greatest achievement of Europe during our times.  This Commission, as I had committed during the hearing one year ago, took the time to carefully evaluate the Smart Borders proposal, and we shall come back with a new proposal in order to modify proposals based on a new impact assessment. I do not, therefore, agree that we are acting under pressure or urgency. On the contrary, we took into account your considerations, which will be reflected in the modified proposal.  The Commission is looking forward to continuing its close work with Parliament in this important file and really counts on its support and cooperation to find the right balance.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1989, "date": "2015-10-28.json", "name": "n/a", "mepid": "n/a", "text": " President-in-Office of the Council. Mr President, I am quite hearing what the Commissioner is saying. First of all, the current situation is an exceptional situation, so the wrong conclusions should not be drawn from it now. Secondly, I believe that what the Commissioner has said about Schengen is absolutely important. But we all know that Schengen needs a system that works better at the external borders, hence the proposals that will be made. We need an effective, more effective system, too - and I say this - to combat phenomena such as terrorism and serious crime. And knowing that the 21st century will be the century of mobility, there will be people who move from one country to another, hence the need also to have an effective system, which not only allows mobility, but also prevents or proposes measures to combat, among other things, the phenomena of crime or other phenomena of illegal mobility.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1990, "date": "2015-10-28.json", "name": "Πρόεδρος. –", "mepid": "28586", "text": "   The debate is closed.

They are growing in number and they are a precious resource to our Member States. Free movement of persons is one of the most important achievements of the European Union since its foundation. The absence of internal borders makes it therefore crucially important that our common external borders are controlled reliably and consistently. In order to better manage the growing flow of travellers, we need to modernise the European border control system, by increasing its efficiency and effectiveness. The result should be smooth and easy travel for the majority of third country travellers who cross the European borders yearly on one side, and an impossible mission for those who abuse free movement, such as organised crime and terrorist organisations, on the other side.

Dear Colleagues, I would like to express my delight that, only a year after the start of the legislative process, the European Parliament will hold a final vote on the new CEPOL legislation tomorrow. I would like to thank all the shadow reporters, in particular Mrs Flasikova-Benova, whose support and cooperation has been of great help in the negotiations, for the smooth running of the process. Likewise, I appreciate the work of the Latvian Presidency, and I would like to thank Mrs Indra Bule, who has helped through the tripartit negotiations with her constructive approach and proactive approach. We all know that the Union's internal security has been seriously challenged recently and we can look like this in the future. We therefore desperately need properly trained law enforcement officers and law enforcement agencies who can respond quickly and effectively at Pan-European level to challenges such as cross-border crime, cybercrime and terrorism. We need law enforcement officers who can act with full professionalism in today's migration crisis. Cepol can therefore serve as a tool for consolidating a culture of professionalism between professional law enforcement officers, strengthening mutual trust between Member States and cross-border cooperation. It can contribute to the realisation of a genuine European policing culture based on respect for fundamental rights and European values. That is why we in Parliament believe that the existence of a modernised, efficient, independent and adequate cepol agency is vital.  In the negotiations with the co-legislators, it remained important that cepol's basic architecture – its reliance on and close cooperation with national police academies – remained unchanged. Cepol had to have the mandate and mandate in place for the Treaties as soon as possible. Cepol's governance structure has been made operational, taking into account the proposals made during the debate on the new Europol Regulatory Framework. We believe that with this new regulation, we have created the conditions for CEPOL to contribute to building a genuine European policing culture. This new regulation, which we are about to vote on, modernises the legal foundations of CEPOL. It brings it into line with the treaty of Lisbon and mandates CEPOL to put into practice the principles of the law enforcement and police training programme proposed by the Commission in March 2013. This should include assessing the needs of strategic training at Union level, accreditation of training courses, a common curriculum, sharing positive examples and identifying the minimum knowledge that all police academies should include in their education programmes. Cepol should therefore be able to provide training and trainers at EU level. In recent years, CEPOL has been viewed by everyone as a network. However, a network is not a legal entity and is not accountable. This is precisely why CEPOL needed to become an agency of the Union, with clear mandate, tasks, responsibility and, most importantly, accountability.  As far as the use of taxpayers' money is concerned, CEPOL has come a long way to demonstrate its cost-effectiveness. It has increased the number of people taking part in its training, the demand for its training is increasing and it will be worth adjusting its budget for this. We will therefore continue to push for the provision of adequate resources, which is a necessary precondition for a well-functioning EU agency, and for the overlaps to be eliminated with other EU institutions. That is why I am asking for your support in tomorrow's vote for this institution.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1994, "date": "2015-10-28.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, let me start by thanking the rapporteur, Ms Kinga Gál, who has worked very hard to find common ground among the shadow rapporteurs and to expedite the adoption of the regulation.  When it comes to the substance of the reform of CEPOL, we can all welcome the final outcome, as this would reinforce CEPOL’s ability to prepare police officers to cooperate effectively, to develop a common law enforcement culture and to become the centre of excellence of training of law enforcement officers in the European Union.  Training is key in this respect. The European Agenda on Security underlines that this is an essential element to enhancing the security of our Union. Training is essential to allow authorities on the ground to utilise our law enforcement cooperation tools in an operational situation. The CEPOL regulation is an evolution rather than a revolution. The network-based character of CEPOL is maintained. The agency will continue to bring together the network of training institutes of the Member States and liaise with a single national unit in each Member State. CEPOL is now entrusted with the task of coordinating the implementation of the law enforcement training system. The overall objective of the scheme is to present a coordinated policy approach ensuring high-quality training for law enforcement officials. This new role widens the opportunities for CEPOL to support, develop, deliver and coordinate training for law enforcement officers of all ranks, and not just senior officers. The reform also provides for the professionalisation of CEPOL’s management. The members of the management board will be appointed taking into account their knowledge of training for law enforcement officers, and they will be assisted by a scientific committee for training to further ensure the quality and coherence of training programmes. CEPOL’s work will come in addition to the welcome initiative taken by the Member States in the field of training for law enforcement personnel.  I am also very encouraged by the strong role ensured for the European Parliament in this CEPOL regulation. Parliament will receive the agency’s annual planning documents, and is the budgetary authority for all EU bodies. In addition, the management board shall consult Parliament on CEPOL’s multiannual work programme. The idea is to provide the opportunity for a strategic debate on the direction the agency should take. The Parliament will also receive all activity reports and accounts and all evaluations commissioned. The director of CEPOL will additionally report to the Parliament on the performance of his duties when invited to do so. That said, the Commission has misgivings on two central aspects of this reform, and this comes before us today. These two aspects are the governance of the agency and respect for the European Union’s budgetary principles, which are of course very important for the Commission. On both these aspects, the outcome of the negotiation process is not in line with what the Commission has proposed or with the trilaterally-agreed common approach on EU decentralised agencies.  Let me take this opportunity to recall the institutional commitment to use such revisions of the agency’s founding acts – as with CEPOL and Europol – as opportunities to implement and to comply with the common approach. This common approach includes the reinforcement of the supervisory role of the management board, including by ensuring full participation by the Commission, ensuring a transparent selection procedure for directors and the necessary adoption of programming document with a multiannual component, the possible setting up of an executive board to ensure more assured more efficiency and the obligation to better follow-up of evaluations and audits.  The Commission regrets the lack of political commitment to ensure respect for the common approach on EU decentralised agencies, in particular regarding the role and composition of the agency’s management structures. On these two points the Commission wants to table a statement to make clear its position. I would ask you, therefore, to add the Commission’s statement to the minutes of this meeting. So allow me now to proceed to the reading of the Commission statement: ‘The Commission takes note of the political agreement reached between the European Parliament and Council. The Commission regrets that this agreement is not fully aligned with the principles of the Common Approach on the EU decentralised agencies nor with the financial rules applicable to these agencies and considers that the agreed text on the governance of the agency and on its funding is without prejudice to any future legislative texts. The possibility of funding part of CEPOL’s tasks through ad hoc grants or delegation agreements contradicts the fundamental principle that the tasks of an agency, as described in its constituent act, are financed by the annual contribution from EU budget and not through ad hoc grants or delegation agreements. The Commission underlines that the respect of this principle is essential to allow the budget authority to take an informed decision about the annual contribution foreseen for each agency in the annual budget. The Commission refers to the Framework Financial Regulation for agencies, which limits the possibility for agencies to receive funding through ad hoc grants or delegation agreements to exceptional cases, in line with the principle of transparency and sound financial management.’  Thank you very much for your attention.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has As permanent rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets for Agencies, Let me highlight a number of fundamental aspects. We would still have thought it more useful if the original proposal to merge Europol and CEPOL had found a majority. CEPOL is a very small agency with just 27 posts in the establishment plan of the 2015 budget. Agencies of this size have to spend a disproportionate proportion of their staff on the necessary administrative backbone, i.e. finance and human resources, IT, logistics, communication and the like, so that the part of the staff working in the actual operational area, i.e. on the tasks specified in the basic regulation, is the responsibility of the basic regulation. , is not reasonably related to the total number of posts. Larger units are therefore more sensible and cost-effective. In theory, this could also be achieved if agencies, especially those working in related subject areas, share these administrative units. However, it would be helpful if these agencies were then located in the same place. Unfortunately, this opportunity was also undone by the Council's decision to move CEPOL to Budapest. I therefore welcome the fact that the committee responsible has taken up our proposal that the Commission should submit a cost-benefit analysis with regard to the seat after two years at the latest. I also welcome the approach of pushing for further cooperation between the various agencies in the field of internal and judicial policy. I am convinced that further efficiencies and thematic spillover effects can be achieved here. However, I do not want to confine myself to this request only to the agencies in the field of internal and judicial policy. On the contrary, I believe that we should also achieve increased cooperation between agencies in other policy areas. I would also like to call on the Commission to always consider the possibility of merging or even streamlining the remit in the event of forthcoming amendments to basic regulations. Because there is one thing that cannot be done: we cannot, on the one hand, insist on the independence of all the agencies, and we can always give them new tasks, and on the other hand we can ask them to do all this with fewer and fewer staff.

I do not know whether Cepol itself can solve the situation, but I am sure that quality and continuous training of law enforcement police officers will lead not only to a more effective fight against cross-border and organised crime, but also to better cooperation between national components throughout the European Union. And it is not only about law enforcement the hard way, but also about educating police officers on soft skills, such as privacy, data protection, victims' rights or the rights of children, the disabled and the infirm.

In this context, I therefore welcome the proposal in question, as it was the European Parliament that asked the Commission on several occasions to bring Cepol's existing legal framework into line with the Treaty of Lisbon and the new ambitions set out in the European enforcement training scheme. The high quality of training of officers of anti-crime or law enforcement authorities is essential for combating serious and organised cross-border crime, and a modern and efficient Cepol agency with sufficient staff is essential. The proposal for a new regulation to reform Cepol comes at a time when the European Union is forced to face ever new pitfalls in protecting its internal security. Their successful management will require an extension of the academy's powers and will not go without increasing financial resources. The refugee crisis facing the European Union and its Member States has shown us all that the demand for the quality of police forces and cooperation between its forces within individual Member States must be improved in the future so that the European Union can better cope with crisis situations and be able to protect its people. I therefore believe that Cepol should be given sufficient powers to properly coordinate law enforcement training at European Union level and to apply the principles enshrined in the enforcement training scheme.

Cross-border criminality is a feature of the modern world of increased travel and new technology.

And, as the Commissioner has said, good cooperation between law enforcement authorities across Europe is an essential tool in carrying out effective and expedient investigations, resulting in the capture and prosecution of criminals.  The European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL) offers a valuable platform for the exchange of best practice and skill sharing for all law enforcement officers across the EU. When it comes to the training and running of national law enforcement authorities, account must always be taken of, and respect accorded to, national sovereignty, subsidiarity and the differing pressures and crime trends in Member States, and I believe that in the area of police cooperation the EU should offer the hand of support rather than compulsion.

We have all worked very nicely and constructively over the past few years. Sometimes there have been tough, sometimes tough, discussions between us. Now, however, we are in the finish line, and I think we should all be happy about what has happened.  The challenge now will be to strengthen cooperation, to exchange experiences and best examples between the Member States and the various law enforcement authorities across our Union. Of course, I regret what we, as liberals, had as a guiding principle, namely merging CEPOL with Europol. That would have meant positive synergies, and it would have saved our taxpayers across Europe a lot of money. Now, however, this did not happen, and we must realise that it was a majority that looked different.  What is particularly positive now is that CEPOL now has in its job descriptions and the conditions to strengthen respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms and to engage in cross-border law enforcement cooperation in a different and more up-to-date way. As we know, criminals do not know of any borders between countries, and then it is very crazy that our law enforcement authorities should not be able to work at least as effectively cross-border as the criminal gangs they are set to fight. So now there are conditions. I think we are putting history behind us and realising that we have everything to gain from working together even more.

This debate has demonstrated, and I thank you for your comments, that we have come to fruition after a great few fights and different positions have been coordinated.

Thus, CEPOL had no registered office for a while, but even its very existence was called into question. As far as the merger is concerned – you all know it, because we voted on it here – the European Parliament and the Council have flatly rejected the Commission's proposal for a merger. As regards the seat, a number of Member States have offered to provide a home for CEPOL. In the end, budapest was chosen after Hungary the best deal in the world. We all know that we need professionally trained law enforcement officers, especially now, in these times, who can respond quickly and effectively at Pan-European level. We have now laid the foundation for this with this new regulation and we can create the conditions for CEPOL to contribute to the development of a genuine European policing culture.

The oral question which I present today to the Commissioner – he is not yet in his place – but I am going to present the questions first and then explain this very sensitive and important topic to colleagues. The questions that we are going to present in the oral question are first of all: what is the Council’s and Commissionʼs general political assessment as to any electronic mass surveillance EU citizens are subject to? Do the Council and Commission consider EU citizens to be sufficiently protected against unnecessary electronic mass surveillance? What measures have the Council and Commission undertaken since the adoption of the resolution of 12 March 2014 in order to protect fundamental rights in a digital age, and what further measures do the Council and Commission plan to take? I am very conscious – Commissioner, I am sorry that you have just taken your seat, but I am sure you will catch up – that these are very broad questions, but what I want to say to colleagues present in the Chamber is that one of the most surprising things about the inquiry of March 2014 into mass surveillance was the outcome of the plenary vote – an extraordinary 544 Members in this plenary across the political spectrum voted for a very sensitive and far-reaching report. They did it because they were acting in a very mature way; they understood that what was happening was that we were not just dealing with one of the most important issues that all individual sovereign countries have to deal with – that is: the protection of their citizens, and therefore intelligence agencies have to do their work – but we were dealing with one of the biggest growth areas in the confidence, in the privacy of individual citizens, you and I. And we have seen in recent days massive data breaches of major telecom companies like Talk Talk. We have seen the judgment on Safe Harbour; and it is very prescient that such an important vote took place in March 2014 because human rights in a digital age were taken very seriously by this Parliament for a reason, and that is that privacy is not a soft option; privacy is fundamental to consumer confidence; privacy is fundamental to human rights in the digital age. So the resolution that we present to Members and to the Commission and Council is about what follow-up we have. In this follow-up resolution, if I take one example, the Safe Harbour judgment of the European Court of Justice, we have a situation where the European Parliament warned incessantly that Safe Harbour was not safe, that the transfers of mass data from the European Union which had higher standards of data protection compared to the United States, which had lower standards, would end up with this kind of situation and a negative situation. We warned of mass surveillance, not for security and purposes of protecting individuals, but simply mass surveillance, very expensive mass surveillance, which was uncontrolled, which has negative implications. Since then the Council of Europe and individual Member States, individual parliaments of Member States, have gone into great detail with their inquiries. And I am very proud that this Parliament went into great detail in the post-Snowden era on digital rights and human rights in the digital era, because we were able to say, on the one hand, that this is vital to tackle terrorism, it is vital to tackle security threats, but that it is incredibly important to understand that we will not do this if there is no credibility in the way that mass surveillance is carried out.  I think we set some good standards in March 2014. What we are now trying to do in this oral question is to see, with the four questions I have put to both Council and Commission, what follow up we actually have on all of these key points. For the European Union, with the trilogues currently running on data regulation, and on the question of the Data Directive, but also on the agreements on PNR, on SWIFT and so on, it is very important that we understand that the European Union is itself invested in transferring data as a European Union to other places; and for that reason we have the competence and we have the need to understand these issues and get these issues fixed. But most importantly it is about the privacy of the citizen, paramountly, and we need to represent the citizen, ensure they are confident in their privacy and ensure they have the confidence to go forward, and they feel they are represented. Look around you and see whether that is necessary and then look at this resolution and see whether it is worthy of support. So I hand over to the Commission and Council to tell us what they are now doing on this resolution and the questions I have put.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me also wish- as I had forgotten in the previous question - a speedy recovery to the chairman of the LIBE committee. The Council shares Parliament's concerns about secret surveillance programmes and their impact on the privacy and personal data of EU citizens. This has been highlighted several times by previous presidencies, in the context of the plenary debates on this subject. States must take steps to protect their citizens, of course, from terrorism and other attacks on their sovereignty; however, these measures must also protect fundamental rights. International approaches to balancing data protection and security vary from country to country. At EU level, the starting point is first and foremost respect for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, including the right to the protection of the personal data of European citizens. In the United States, the appreciation of security and protection is linked to the experience of that country, and therefore different from what it is in Europe. Nevertheless, the United States is placing increasing emphasis on data protection considerations, as evidenced by the Freedom Act, passed in June 2015, and the Judicial Redress Act, recently introduced before Congress. Given the increasing volume of data flow on both sides of the Atlantic, it is clear that the balance between protection and security requires a constant debate between the Union and the United States. For our part, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, each acting according to their competences, must play their full role. The report you presented, Mr Moraes, in 2014, rightly pointed out that the increasing use of mass surveillance has not been preceded by any democratic public debate. To ensure the proper protection of data, constant vigilance is required. The European Parliament had been vigilant, moreover, regarding the Safe Harbor agreement. I will not return here to the debate we had on this subject at the mini-plenary on 14 October in Brussels, it is up to the Commission to reserve the appropriate follow-up to the Court's judgment. Let me cite two positive international developments in the field of surveillance. First, the text of the Framework Agreement on Data Protection was signed in September. This is a step forward in ensuring data protection and providing EU citizens with mechanisms in the United States for judicial remedies in law enforcement matters. The Council is awaiting the Commission's proposal for the conclusion of the framework agreement and the European Parliament will be asked to give its approval to this proposal. Second, the Judicial Redress Act, which was introduced before Congress. These two developments help to protect the fundamental right of EU citizens to protect their data. Let us now return to the question you asked, Mr Moraes, namely the measures taken following the resolution of 12 March 2014. I would like to recall the following. First, the protection of fundamental rights in the digital age is an issue that is constantly on the agenda of meetings between the European Union and the United States, both at the senior official level and at the political level. These meetings restored confidence in the handling of personal data and led the US authorities to present the Judicial Redress Act specifically to Congress. Secondly, I would also like to recall the meeting that took place in Riga on 3 June 2015 between the Ministers of Home Affairs and Justice of the Union and the United States. The meeting culminated in the Riga Declaration, which sets out specific cooperation actions for the next five years to address these issues more effectively. These actions include data protection measures and a commitment by both sides to strengthen the implementation of the mutual legal assistance agreement they have concluded, so that law enforcement agencies can better cooperate in a manner that respects, precisely, data protection. Finally, with regard to data protection within the Union, the Council has given priority to intensifying negotiations with the European Parliament on the data protection package. I am particularly pleased with the intensive work that is currently being carried out devoted to both the General Data Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Directive for law enforcement purposes.  Both the Council and Parliament are committed to adopting a strong data protection framework by the end of the year. On this basis, the Council will continue to work with Parliament and the Commission to strengthen privacy rights and develop Europe's digital economy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2022, "date": "2015-10-28.json", "name": "Valdis Dombrovskis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, the Commission remains concerned about media reports on surveillance programmes of the Member State intelligence services which appear to enable large—scale access to, and processing of, the data of Europeans. At the same time, the area of national security falls within the competence of Member States. However, these exception clauses for national security need to be interpreted strictly in the light of settled Court of Justice case law. In its ruling of 6 October 2015 in the Schrems case, the European Court of Justice further clarified that any legislation permitting public authorities to have access on a generalised basis to the content of electronic communications must be regarded as compromising the essence of the fundamental right to the respect of private life as guaranteed by Article 7 of the Charter. Likewise, legislation not providing for any possibility for an individual to pursue legal remedies in order to have access to personal data relating to him or to obtain the rectification or erasure of such data compromises the essence of the fundamental right to effective judicial protection, as guaranteed by Article 47 of the Charter.  As regards the protection of fundamental rights within the scope of EU law, let me point out the following. As Members know, two proposals for our data protection reform are at the last stage of interinstitutional negotiations. They will increase the standard of the protection of personal data within the European Union. Furthermore, on 8 September 2015, the Commission initialised with the US the ‘umbrella agreement’. The agreement covers all personal data exchanged between the EU and the US for the purpose of prevention of and prosecution for criminal offences, including terrorism. The Commission will propose signature and conclusion of the agreement only after the US Judicial Redress Bill, granting judicial redress rights to EU citizens, has been adopted. The bill has just passed through the House and we hope for rapid progress in the Senate as well. The umbrella agreement will guarantee a high level of protection of all personal data when transported between law enforcement authorities across the Atlantic. It will, in particular guarantee, that all EU citizens will have non-discriminatory access to US courts under the Privacy Act. Regarding Parliament’s request for the development of the European strategy for greater IT independence, the Commission is working to address the main points of the strategy by establishing the contractual public—private partnership on cybersecurity. The goal of this initiative, to be launched in 2016, will be to stimulate the competitiveness and innovation capacities of the digital security and privacy industry in Europe. Research and innovation projects on privacy and cyber security have already been launched using Horizon 2020 funding, and these activities will be pursued under the PPP. Moreover, the negotiations of the Network and Information Securities Directive, which aims to increase Member States’ capacity to react to cyber threats in a coordinated manner while imposing security requirements on critical infrastructure providers, should be completed by the end of this year.  The Commission further announced its intention to reform the ePrivacy Directive in the Digital Single Market strategy as soon as the general data protection reform has been adopted, with a focus on ensuring a high level of protection for data subjects and a level playing field for all market players. This includes a high degree of confidentiality of communications in Europe.  The Commission is also committed to increasing trust in cloud computing by launching a series of initiatives in 2016 covering certification, contracts, switching providers and a research open science cloud, as well as the support of the free flow of non-personal data. Also in the Digital Single Market strategy, the Commission announced that it will undertake a comprehensive assessment of the role of intermediaries in tackling illegal content online.  Finally, the Commission would like to underline that it has been for many years a major user of open source systems, for example its data centre. It would also like to refer to the strategy for internal use of Open Source Software, which was updated in July 2015. Security and confidentiality are systematically considered when defining the tendering specifications in the Commission’s IT contracts. All Commission contracts contain a clause referring to the applicable data protection legislation. The legal framework for procurement does not, however, allow favouring particular business models or limiting the award of contracts to EU companies. A thorough review and assessment of the Commission’s exposure in terms of IT security has been launched with a view to establishing an IT security reference framework to structure and prioritise a range of short-term actions and a longer term IT security strategy. Against a threat landscape that is becoming ever more challenging with increasingly sophisticated attacks, the Commission’s Chief Information Security Officer collaborates closely with the CERT-EU to prevent cyber threats, detect them at an early stage and work towards a quick resolution. CERT-EU collaborates with the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security on lessons learned to improve the protection of networks and with the European Cybercrime Centre in the context of threat assessment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2023, "date": "2015-10-28.json", "name": "Axel Voss", "mepid": "96761", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Thank you very much, Madam President.

We have also committed ourselves to continuing to monitor the issue – and that is also true. However, what has now emerged in this motion for a resolution is, in my view, largely ideological demands which are no longer connected with mass surveillance at all.

Of course, independent and thorough investigation must take place where any potential wrongdoing is revealed. This is essential if citizens are to have confidence in the people entrusted with protecting us. However, I cannot support this resolution. I will never regard Edward Snowden or his actions as ‘heroic’. I cannot bestow the label of hero upon a person who has endangered the lives of so many citizens across the world and those individuals serving overseas who risk their lives, day in and day out, to protect ours.  In my opinion the language in this resolution does little to offer a sensible approach but instead just seeks to escalate the rhetoric. I fail to see how producing a report from an investigation conducted in the political arena, with no access to official documents, with no powers to call relevant individuals to give evidence, and with no competence under EU law, can produce recommendations with even the smallest perceived amount of objectivity.  I cannot in conscience ever support a resolution of this Parliament that calls for the suspension of important anti-terror agreements with the United States given the security situation in Europe at present.

For liberals, there is no room for mass surveillance of citizens.  Developments are worrying across Europe. We are seeing several steps backwards in fact with regard to the particular view of privacy and data protection. Instead, the starting point seems increasingly to be based on the mistaken assumption that the more data we collect, the safer the citizens become. Nothing could be more wrong! My group deeply regrets that the Council and the Commission have consistently refused to answer Parliament's questions, which we asked for the first time over a year ago in the context of the debate on mass surveillance. We are also very concerned about the legislation now being passed in several Member States, where bulk mass data storage is now becoming the practice. Britain passed a law in 2014 which it now has to review, as the Supreme Court, the High Court, has annulled it. Germany has just decided on new data retention legislation, and France has introduced the possibility of mass surveillance of citizens for its intelligence services. We are also deeply concerned about Dutch intelligence legislation. I strongly urge my Liberal colleagues in the Dutch Government here and now to take careful account of yesterday's judgment in the Prakken d'Oliveira case. That ruling prohibits the monitoring of lawyers' communications until an independent review is carried out. The European Court of Justice's decision the other week on Safe Harbor should also be a wake-up call for everyone. That ruling states that AMERICAN mass surveillance is not compatible with EU laws and principles.  We must now start sweeping our own door and not depend on the courts to put right the legislation that we should jointly take responsibility for ensuring that it actually puts fundamental rights at the centre.

In June 2015, the Bundestag decided to amend the law so that the BND can legally monitor the Frankfurt Internet node. Also in June 2015, France passed a law to massively expand the surveillance powers of the intelligence services. Austria has a new state protection law in place, and the Dutch government also wants to extend the powers of the secret services and no longer control them. The fact that we, as the only parliament in the world, have – if you can say – produced an investigation report on the NSA mass surveillance and a follow-up report, thereby urging an end to mass surveillance, is of no interest to either the Commission, nor the Council, and certainly not any government in Europe.

It is precisely this relationship that determines whether a community can be regarded as democratic or dictatorial.  How free is a citizen in a state if he can be monitored all around?

I think this is the moment, at least, where Heads of States and the European Commission should act and take their responsibilities. Until now there have been only two reactions to the revelations by Snowden, both of them taking seriously what he has said. The first is the US administration: Obama has conducted an investigation and changed the surveillance measures, but with regard to its own citizens, not with regard to European citizens or anyone else in the world where its intelligence services are spying on us. That is the problem. The second reaction is not by any politician in the European Union, not by any head of state, nor by any minister has there been taken action on behalf of the Snowden revelations, but here it was the highest court which took the action three weeks ago with the judgment on Safe Harbour. There it clearly referred to the facts revealed by Edward Snowden. If the highest court of the European Union says there is something which Edward Snowden rightfully said is an infringement to the Fundamental Rights Charter to our Treaties, should we not take that seriously? Should not the Commission start infringement procedures against those Member States which obviously still cooperate with those intelligence services, or even have intelligence services doing the same unlawful activities? This is not any more in the area of national security, which in Europe is obviously becoming the black hole of the rule of law.

While I hear the European Parliament pointing out the dangers of mass surveillance of citizens by the US in Member States, what actually worries me more is the EUʼs ambitions to set up its own secret service agency – in fact, a spy agency.

We have realised that more coordination of national economic policies is needed within the EU in order to prevent imbalances, ensure convergence and exploit potential synergies. The European Semester, introduced in 2011 within the Six—pack, is the most important instrument for national policy coordination and surveillance in the EU. Each year the Commission undertakes a detailed analysis of EU Member States’ budgetary, macroeconomic and structural reform plans and provides them with policy recommendations for the next 12 to 18 months. These country—specific recommendations (CSRs) provide guidance and advice to Member States on how to stimulate growth and jobs in conformity with the Europe 2020 Strategy, while at the same time avoiding excessive imbalances. Each year the European Semester cycle starts with the annual growth survey published by the Commission in the late autumn, in which key policy priorities are specified for Member States and the EU a whole. It is then followed by an assessment of draft budgetary plans and country report analyses. On that basis the Commission proposes country—specific recommendations, which are then discussed with national governments and are then endorsed by the European Council and adopted formally by the Council. Drawing on experience from the previous cycles, this year the Commission has proposed to shorten and streamline the whole process in order to give Member States more time to react and also to focus on key priorities. We welcome these changes, while underlining the fact that further action is needed to make the coordination process more efficient and less bureaucratic. This year, priorities focus on the most important growth drivers and include investment for growth and jobs, growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, structural reforms in the labour, product and services markets, and active employment policies. We support these priorities, but we think that more effort is needed to implement them effectively, especially in the area of structural reforms that are necessary for increasing potential growth in Europe. These reforms should concentrate on removing barriers in the product and services markets and on making labour markets more flexible, while balancing this with the adequate protection of employees’ rights. Equally important is the need to radically improve access to finance, especially for small and medium—sized enterprises, and to make the legal and administrative environment more friendly for businesses and to deal effectively with excessive indebtedness in the private sector. We share the Commission’s view that continued fiscal consolidation is needed in Member States with unsustainable debt levels and that strict compliance with EU fiscal rules under the reformed Stability and Growth Pact is absolutely crucial for sustainable recovery. However, we also recognise that countries with sufficient fiscal space have the potential to further accelerate domestic investment. We also share the Commission’s opinion that the actual implementation of CSRs by Member States leaves much to be desired. Less than 15% of all CSRs were actually fully implemented in 2014. Thus the potential positive impact of coordination is seriously diminished.  In this context, we call on Member States to radically improve the implementation record through faster transposition, more active political support and, above all, strengthened national ownership. The European Semester offers an opportunity for securing faster growth in Europe and avoiding devastating crises in the future. I call on this House to support our report.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr rapporteur, I welcome this opportunity to debate the European Semester with you. We have all just received the Commission's proposals for a renovated Semester. The Council will consider this issue in the coming weeks to draw conclusions, already, for the 2016 financial year.  The three institutions share - and I have listened to you, Mr rapporteur - the analysis of the main challenges facing the European economy, namely the high level of debt, the unacceptable unemployment rate, a global competitiveness which suffers particularly from an insufficient level of research and development and a dangerous investment gap which weighs on the growth potential of the European economy. We propose similar solutions, more effective and broader implementation of structural reforms, growth-oriented fiscal consolidation, better access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises, education systems that better meet the needs of labour markets, and above all - and above all - a revival of investment.  Since the first European Semester of 2012, we have made progress, and the 2015 edition is a good example. This year, country-specific recommendations are more limited in number and better targeted at key country-specific macroeconomic problems. In addition, while calling for long-term reforms, the recommendations also focus on short- and medium-term actions. The scope of the recommendations is reinforced. The 2015 recommendations are also anchored in stronger country-based analyses. The presentation of these analyses ahead of the recommendations, as early as February, allowed the Commission to examine them in depth, including through the peer review method, the so-called \"peer review\".  The Commission also had more time to work on the recommendations themselves. In this way, we have been able to better align the Commission's proposals with the realities on the ground. This less tight timetable has also allowed Member States to involve national stakeholders and parliaments in the process of economic coordination at national level. This contributes to the appropriation of the recommendations and to the more effective implementation of them.  The Council discussed this fall the lessons to be learned from the 2015 Semester. And we are pleased with the progress made in organizing this Semester. Our discussions also highlighted other improvements that could further strengthen the process. This concerns above all the transparency of the procedure of macroeconomic imbalances, on which the Commission has just presented its ideas, as well as the link between the European Semester and the supervision provided for in the Stability and Growth Pact. We will consider the Commission's new proposals on these aspects without delay. So what policy will this coordination process take us to? In what areas did we use this tool? At the macroeconomic level, I would like to focus on investment and access to finance. At the same time last year, the Commission presented the investment plan and the co-legislators adopted the proposal on the European Fund for Strategic Investments in record time. Secondly, in reviewing the country-by-country recommendations of 2015, Member States welcomed the Commission's emphasis on growth-enhancing fiscal policies, whether it be efficient spending, public investment and stimulating private investment, or more appropriate taxation. This autumn, at the ministerial level, work on the Commission's action plan for a capital markets union began. The Council will adopt conclusions on this issue in November. The Presidency is committed to progress in the work on the securitisation proposal. We are counting on the cooperation of Parliament to move this issue forward. With regard to employment and social policy, in approving country-specific recommendations last summer, the Council also recognised the realities on the ground. Unemployment and social inclusion continue to pose major challenges in a number of Member States. For their citizens, the improvement in the economic outlook in Europe has not yet been felt in terms of employment or the social situation. Increasing poverty remains a major issue, particularly poverty affecting children. The renovated 2020 strategy, which will have to be presented by the Commission in the months ahead, I think, will have to provide for more effective targets and actions in this area.  We need to step up efforts to reduce still significantly high levels of unemployment in many Member States and improve the functioning of labour markets and social protection systems. Progress in these areas is also essential to consolidate growth. The political stakes are high. Citizens expect policies to resolve their problems from Europe. Progress in the fight against youth unemployment is still insufficient. Even if there is progress, we need to strengthen our instruments, such as the youth guarantee, and go beyond that. We need more economic convergence, we also need more social convergence. And to move social Europe forward, certain themes, such as worker mobility, will be the subject of Commission proposals at the end of this year.  The exchange of good practices and peer review, or the definition of common benchmarks, as we are establishing for the integration of the long-term unemployed into the labour market, are useful in such an approach.  In the area of competitiveness, the Council's work confirms that Member States share the same analysis on the main challenges. With regard to the country-specific recommendations, the Council was very pleased to find the theme of investment, whether it was the opening up of markets for goods and services, the regulatory framework, a better business environment or increased efficiency of public administration. The Council will also continue its work, which includes improving the functioning of the internal market. I think it is a major asset that we do not always get the full benefits of.  In this context, the digitisation of the single market is certainly one of our major projects, not to mention smart regulation and support for innovation hubs. Strengthening research and development - I recall that we have made a commitment to invest 3% of GDP in research and development - promoting innovation through a better articulation between the public and private sectors, supporting business creation, as well as investing in human capital are essential to a European economy that is renewing and positioning itself in relation to its main competitors.  Before concluding, I would like to return briefly to the implementation of the country-specific recommendations. You highlight this issue by recommending that the Commission present a detailed overview of the progress made by the Member States, or that it consider the introduction of an incentive mechanism. I would like to assure you that the implementation of the recommendations remains the Council's top priority. We are convinced that the reforms of the European Semester introduced last spring are already bringing us closer to this goal. But the most important thing remains to be done, and we will consider the Commission's new proposals on a renovated Semester with this in mind.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2060, "date": "2015-10-28.json", "name": "Valdis Dombrovskis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, let me start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Rosati, as well as the shadow rapporteurs and all Members involved in the work for their engagement and dedication. The Commission welcomes Parliamentʼs constructive contribution by way of its timely reports such as those of Mr Rosati and the June report by Ms Berès. Today I have an opportunity to present to you the package of measures adopted by the Commission last week aiming to make the economic and monetary union more effective, transparent and democratic. Our package intends to restart economic and social convergence by implementing key short- to medium-term elements of the Five Presidents’ report: revamping the European Semester, improving the toolbox of economic governance rules, improving the voice of euro area internationally, completing the financial union, and preparing for stage two on more far-reaching measures that could require a Treaty change. Let me start with the European Semester. This is the heart of Europeʼs efforts to coordinate economic policies and deliver reforms. Nevertheless, as you rightly stated, Member States have demonstrated varying degrees of commitment to the process. The Commission has constantly been improving the EU Semester to strengthen Member States’ implementation of reforms. In 2015 we have streamlined it to sharpen its focus, better involve national stakeholders and strengthen its social dimension. We value your support in recognising our efforts. Building on these developments, some further adjustments can bring additional benefits. Firstly we share your view that many Member States, in particular in the euro area, are faced with inter—dependent macroeconomic challenges. Therefore we intend to better integrate the euro area and national dimensions. Recommendations for the euro area will come out earlier than before, so that common challenges can be reflected in recommendations for individual euro area countries. Second, on several occasions Parliament also called for the social dimension of the European Semester to be strengthened. The Commission has already taken steps to do so, on which we will build further. Specifically, more attention will be given to employment and social performance in the macro-economic imbalances procedure. Moreover, we intend to further improve involvement of EU and national social partners. Social fairness will also get more attention in the context of macroeconomic adjustment programmes, and we have already put this into practice for the Greek programme, for the first time preparing the social impact assessment of the programme. Third, you asked the Commission to support Member States’ exchange of best practices. We agree that this is a valuable tool to achieve convergence. We will launch new efforts to promote greater use of benchmarking and cross-examination across policy or thematic areas.  First, in order to focus EU structural and investment funds on supporting reforms, the Commission will enhance their links to key priorities in the CSRs. Effective reform implementation will also be supported through the progressive roll-out of technical assistance by the Commission structural reform support service.  Last week the Commission also presented concrete measures to improve our toolbox of economic governance. The Commission is not proposing a legislative reform. More evidence and experience with reform governance structures are necessary before embarking on such a road. But the Commission has listened to your calls to improve transparency and to reduce the complexity of available instruments and tools, so we will take action. We will notably increase the documentation on the methodologies we use, publish more information and data backing our decisions under the Stability and Growth Pact and the macroeconomic imbalances procedure, and work to streamline the indicators for assessing compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. Moreover, as you have rightly stated in the report, the foundations of the recovery are fragile owing to the EU’s underlying structural weaknesses, lack of competitiveness and low investment. The capacity to compete and to adjust is essential for economies to deal with shocks and structural changes and to prosper within a monetary union. It is therefore a focus of our economic policy coordination already today; but we suggest that more be done to strengthen national ownership. We are therefore proposing that national competitiveness boards be set up in all euro area Member States. They would be independent bodies that provide expertise on competitiveness, performance and reforms. The definition of competitiveness in the Commissionʼs proposal is broad, covering both cost and non-cost competitiveness drivers. Our objective here is to strengthen and support national processes and the role of social partners – not to hamper them.  National traditions are very different. We have therefore considered it better to start with a recommendation to Member States and not move straight to legislation. But even so the European Parliament must be fully part of this debate from the start, and your views will be important to shape the debate on the competitiveness boards.  The Commission has also decided to set up an Advisory European Fiscal Board. This board will provide advice on the implementation of fiscal rules, taking into account both national and euro area developments. But let me be clear: any proposals for fiscal decisions under the Treaty remain fully with the Commission, and we are politically responsible for them to this Parliament.  We are also taking steps to complete the banking union. We need to implement what was agreed with strong support from this Parliament, and we need to finish what we have started. This includes full transposition of the BRRD Directive and implementation of the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive; and the agreement on bridge financing for the single resolution fund must be completed swiftly.  We plan to present a legislative proposal on first steps towards a European deposit insurance scheme by the end of the year, based on the reinsurance approach. We also plan to set out ways to reduce further risk in the banking sector and ensure a level playing field. A strong EMU must go hand in hand with a strong, single voice on the global stage. We therefore propose to gradually develop a unified representation of the euro area in the IMF. We propose that the President of the Eurogroup should ultimately represent the euro area internationally.  Finally, the Commission considers effective democratic legitimacy and accountability to be an indispensable element of the process to complete EMU. Steps have been taken towards that in the recent past, and the Commission is proposing concrete steps to move further along the lines of the Five Presidents’ report. We expect the European Parliament to take part in shaping the debates to define the economic and social priorities of the EU. This is why we propose to engage in frequent debates throughout the European Semester, for instance in the plenary debate after the publication of the AGS package and upon presentation of the Commissionʼs proposals for country-specific recommendations. The Commission and the Parliament are in permanent contact, and I am confident we can further refine the details of our cooperation in these matters. To ensure ownership, legitimacy and accountability, we also aim to engage with a broader range of actors. In the lead-up to this European Semester, which will start with the annual growth survey next month, we have been consulting social partners, both trade unions and business representatives, on the priorities for the year ahead. During this year, I and my fellow Members of the Commission have also travelled to many capitals and met national parliament representatives.  We want national parliaments to be more deeply involved in the adoption of national reform and stability programmes. This is essential to strengthen the ownership, and thereby implementation, of reforms. The last package should be seen as a first stepping stone towards completing economic and monetary union, but we also need more far-reaching measures – those requiring Treaty change. We are talking here about the preparation for stage two of the Five Presidents’ report. We will need to shape consensus on those more fundamental changes, so we will launch a broad consultation gathering ideas from across Europe.  Next year we will appoint a dedicated expert group to explore legal, economic and political implementation for the long term. All this will feed into the Commissionʼs White Paper in spring 2017. The European Parliamentʼs input will be a crucial contribution to the next stages in the process of completing EMU. I am looking forward to hearing your views on the proposed approach.

I sometimes get worried about the way in which the European Parliament works. This concern also sometimes extends to concerns about the way in which the Commission works.  I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Rosati, for the way in which he has worked. When we got this assignment, the first draft statement was actually a pretty good piece of paper. It was concise, and there were quite a few issues that I wanted to improve on that in that context. I was, of course, concerned that the implementation percentage of the CSRs was almost non-existent, i.e. we produce a lot of paper that we send out to our Member States, and then the Member States browse these papers. That's it. Anything else doesn't come out of it. We should therefore have really focused all our attention on how to improve this process, but in Parliament something rather strange is happening in this context. To use an expression that has now become popular in Finland, it suddenly seems that the 'Moomins had fled the valley', i.e. as if all understanding had disappeared from Parliament as well. Instead of sticking to a concise paper, there are an endless bunch of proposals that have quite a bit to do with the actual mission. It is really just a way for members of this House to somehow show that they are staying awake and doing their work.  So we have an irrational process that does not lead us forward. Inside the proposal, we get everything between heaven and earth, but no improvements to the country-specific recommendations. In this irrational process, it may also be the case that the proposals made by my colleague Sven Giegold, which are, at least to some extent, quite sensible, fall away. There are also some proposals in which we really should think about the future – how, for example, education for young people in the various Member States works. How do these things come into our recommendations? To sum up this brief, I think we should try to gather our Moomins so that we would have a slightly simpler and better process in the future as well.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2062, "date": "2015-10-28.json", "name": "Sergio Gutiérrez Prieto", "mepid": "103488", "text": "  drafts member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. – Madam President; Commissioner, Minister Schmit, from the Committee on Employment we have made a proposal report for a situation which remains critical. Criticism, because one more year we have to say that the economic recovery remains slow and fragile. We must continue to talk about the fact that unemployment exchanges continue, one more year, in a situation that is totally unbearable from a social and economic point of view; an unemployment situation that also leads more and more Europeans to long-term unemployment, which illuminates today's pockets of poverty. And also the problem of inequality because, according to the OECD report, there are still more people today who accumulate more wealth at the expense of more people accumulating more situations of extreme difficulty. Today's stock market, the gap between the 10% that has the most compared to the least 10% in the European Union has multiplied in some countries by up to seven, and that is mainly due to fiscally unfair policies, to the detriment of socially redistributive policies, and also, of course, how not , to the lack of quality in employment, to the precariousness of employment through the European Union as a whole. That is why I agree with Mr Schmit that great analysts are needed in the European Parliament, that we need greater coordination, but above all we need changes, profound changes. Because we are talking about youth unemployment, but we have an underfunded Youth Guarantee; we are talking about long-term standing, but we only remember the European Social Fund's 10 billion; we are talking about labour poverty, but the Commission blocks the European minimum wage framework.

Overall, this European Semester– I agree with commissioner – I think it has evolved a great much since its insanity, it has evolved a great much, and we are now slowly reaching our goal. However, there are main priorities on which it would be good to focus more, such as the internal market as a major reserve, and I believe that strengthening the pillar of the internal market should be reflected in this report. We are focused on increasing economic growth, but we are talking very little about our biggest reserve, the reserves of the functioning of the internal market.  However, I am pleased that the SME and even its lack of funding have been mentioned, which is still a pressing problem. I'm happy for FSI when it came out as an alternative tool.

Firstly, because of all the issues we have introduced in the opinion that was voted on in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality — and, by the way, I would also like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs of the opinion in committee — many of them have not been incorporated into the report. It's taken a long time for the Semester to have a gender perspective. The truth is that in the latest reports there was not even an opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the Semester. It's great that we've been able to reintroduce it. It would be very nice now if, in the next report, the Committee on Economic and Budget affairs took more account of many of the issues we are pointing out. Because, look, many of the reforms pushed through REP have a very, very important effect on gender equality. And I can talk about labour market reforms, pension reforms — which have been driven by many in the context of the Semester — which have had a very negative effect in terms of equality: if we are talking, for example, about the reform of the listed years and their impact on pensions; if we talk, for example, about the effect that many labour reforms have had on the ability to reconcile work and family; and that is jeopardizing years of progress in increasing the rate of female labour activity and therefore there are many negative aspects to this issue. We had put in the opinion a whole range of elements: that there be a gender assessment when the reforms are carried out; that the European Institute for Gender Equality could play a role in the process of recommendations... Well, a whole list of proposals which unfortunately have not been included, but which are obviously important, are on the table and my group will continue to insist on them because they are so important. I go to the general framework of the report, once we have mentioned the issues we have raised from the Committee on Women's Rights. I believe that the report shields an economic policy model in recent years in Europe that has not worked, and on top of that all the things that have not been done right - and which we know have not been done well - we refuse to recognise them. Having too low investment, having relied too much on external demand, having applied extreme internal devaluations and extreme budgetary adjustments in some Member States, which have made things worse; all these issues are not recognised as such in the report and I have to say that the vision given is extremely triumphant. There are some proposals that we had made and which we have been calling for for many years: for example - and that is one thing I would like to stress to the Commission - that there have been social indicators in the PDM is one thing that the Commission has repeatedly promised us, social indicators and also environmental indicators, energy efficiency indicators. Where's that reform? Where are those indicators you've promised us so many times? We haven't seen them. And, therefore, other issues, for example, which have to do with democracy and democratic control: What about the issues of the little transparency that exists right now in the Eurogroup? Well, all these issues worry us. And I end up with one thing, and with this I'm done, which is all you've presented to us about reform. Surely my colleague Sven Giegold will insist on it, but the first package presented to us by the five presidents, which is very timid, is extremely timid in implementation of the report and does not contain the substance or what we need for eurozone governance reform.

It calls for the consistent implementation of structural reforms, in particular comprehensive reforms in the labour market, in order to achieve flexibility while reconciling wages and competitiveness, better starting conditions for the real economy, less bureaucratic hurdles and, most importantly, greater support for small and medium-sized enterprises. A look at the eurozone, as the Commission is now planning separately in the European Semester, can certainly be helpful. But it must be clear and it must also remain clear where the responsibilities lie for a sustainable budgetary policy, for a successful reform agenda and, therefore, for greater competitiveness and growth, namely the individual Member States. We know that the Member States have a 'deficiency' in their testimonies in complying with the country-specific recommendations. The Commission, Mr Dombrovskis, must act on this, and urgently. The European Semester is for budgetary surveillance, and that must remain the focus.

But the Commission's recent communication does not contribute to this objective, quite the contrary.  In 2012, at the height of the crisis, we know that the three institutions converged on a long-term vision: Parliament made the report of Marianne Thyssen, her colleague now in the Commission, there was the text of Herman Van Rompuy, or the four presidents plus one, and the european commission's blueprint, and the condition for the election and confirmation of Jean-Claude Juncker was that this process be relaunched — and it was through the report of the five presidents. But now that we are taking the first steps of implementation, it is with great surprise and disappointment that we find that the first test of this commitment is not working. And it is not working because the European Commission says it wants to hear from the European Parliament. But, for example, in the European Semester, at what stage and how is the European Parliament heard, and the European Semester itself is based and built on the six-pack and two-pack, which were legislative texts in which this Parliament was an active co-legislator? The European Commission takes refuge in an intergovernmental framework, which is what has not worked, and therefore misses the opportunity, for example, to frame the European Stabilisation Mechanism in a Community-based context. And it goes so far as to hand over the external representation of the euro area to the President of the Eurogroup who, as we know, does not report to this Parliament or any Community institution. So, Commissioner, what agenda is the European Commission following? Because it is certainly not an answer to either Marianne Thyssen's report in the past or to the Berès report, which was adopted here by this Plenary.  I hope that the agenda will still be corrected and that the Commission will realise that, in order to make progress in the euro area, the two Community institutions - Parliament and the Commission - must work hand in hand, and not only with the so-called lip service in English, which in practice does not guarantee any accountability or any democratic control.

But the work is far from finished. However, it is very important for us to concentrate on the positives that have been achieved so that we can also look to a positive future.  I am also disappointed that the Commission did not publish the single market integration report as part of the Annual Growth Survey this year. We should take note of that. The Commission should ensure that Member States implement the European legislation adopted on the single market, in all its dimensions, and place stronger emphasis on the implementation of existing single market legislation.

The belief is that we have to treat trade surpluses differently in relation to deficits. As I said, I am talking about this issue of trade surpluses and deficits, because more and more deficits are being carried and trade surpluses are becoming more naturalised. However, the issue of surpluses and deficits is not a political issue, it is a matter of logic: international trade is a zero-sum game — in order to have surpluses on one side, there must be deficits on the other. And in this sense, continuing this path, with a very strong hand with the weakest, of punishment, of penalization, and a very light hand with the strongest, is a way for the disaggregation of monetary union and of the European Union itself.

Unfortunately, this round of the European Semester’s recommendations basically do not show any serious measures to reduce poverty, and all the environment-related measures were totally taken out of the European Semester. While in previous periods there were always strong structural reforms suggested by the Commission in order to increase resource efficiency, to generate competitive new business in the green sector, this time everything is gone.  I would like to ask you, Commissioner, whether you are still attached to the 2020 objectives and to the role of the European Semester in order to achieve these objectives, and I also would like to know why you took out all the environment-related measures, which have always been there in the past.  Secondly, I think the key problem here is that, even if you do not agree with all of these measures as they are proposed, it is clear that the euro in particular, but also Europe as a whole, needs the European Semester process. We all know that the level of accomplishment of the country-specific recommendations is appallingly low. Mr President of the Council, Mr Schmit, from my perspective you did not address the key question: what did you do in order to increase the number of recommendations, which the Council – which is voting on these recommendations – is really implementing?  Where is your decisive action to make your fellow Member States, including Germany and many others, truly reforming in the sense of the European Semester?  We make a joke of the European Semester. Nobody takes it seriously any more if the Council does not manage to implement. And to the Commission: I feel your proposals on the Semester lack a clear enforcement strategy. I cannot see a tough enforcement strategy, and that is really a shortcoming. I have one last point concerning your proposal, one which really needs its own debate, but the European Fiscal Board is an advisory body, which you could have had proposed under the ordinary legislative process.

Democracy is reacting violently, and you continue to impose, as you did in Italy in 2011, as you did in Greece, as you did just now in Portugal, these same failed policies. We have, of course, demonstrated our democratic disagreement, because we had this mandate from the citizens, who gave us the vote to try to bring about this change. But it will never happen. Because? Because, unfortunately, austerity is linked to the euro.

The divergence in growth, borrowing, unemployment and inflation rates in the 19 eurozone economies is proof that the euro has never been, ex post, the optimal monetary zone that the ultraliberal elites promised to citizens from the beginning.  Therefore, in a frantic flight forward to escape the sad realities of this policy destructive of wealth and jobs, the disoriented European leaders push the experience to the point of economic federalism.

True, deficits have been curtailed in a majority of Member States and, arguably, national debt levels are going down – but would that not have happened anyway, given normal economic and financial pressures? Not so, we are told.  Our procedures were designed to forestall financial Armageddon among Member States. In this they have succeeded by ensuring that rule-based methods compatible with free markets apply to all national players. However, these methods have not led to economic growth at the desired level. Such growth, as there has been, remains fragile. Despite the quantitative easing programme run by the European Central Bank, its President Mario Draghi stated again that he is prepared to do anything to keep the system on track. Saying that once was necessary; having to say it twice becomes less effective. So perhaps we need to evaluate critically the Semester cycle of surveillance. Member States must now satisfy rules that in practice impose more constraints than exist on states in the USA under a federal system, which is not the case for the EU. Other rules such as those for the banking union, necessary though they are, have also introduced down the line new costs and delays in the circulation and mobilisation of funds.

The Commission announced the purpose – which I very much support – of promoting upward convergence, but I am afraid that the solutions which are being proposed will not be enough to deliver these goals. If you really want to deliver upward convergence, you need first of all to change the targets, starting with competitiveness. It is very important to focus improvement in competitiveness on factors for the future, meaning innovation, education, energy and public administration, rather than just controlling labour costs. Then you also need to change the social targets because it is important to take into account not only unemployment rates, but also social inequalities, because they are increasing in Europe. Then you need to change the priorities in the country—specific recommendations. Yes, we need reforms; but the reforms which should be prioritised concern education, innovation and public administration.

Secondly, the European Commission today presented the Internal Market Strategy. I would like to anticipate this, because I believe that it does not help us in this Chamber at all if each of us believes that we know everything better and that the others are to blame for the problems. In the end, we will only return to the economic phase of growth in the euro area, in Europe, if we try to achieve the necessary steps together. One thing is obvious: on all the macroeconomic issues that exist in this area and about which there is also controversy, an important element, which can in any case ensure joint growth, is better implementation of the common internal market rules. That is why I think it is important that we focus more on the idea that Michel Barnier put forward in the last Commission, the so-called single market governance strategy.

I believe we need to ask ourselves why this is happening. It is not only the content of the CSRs, but also the design of the process. The question is, how shall we design a better economic policy coordination process? We should eliminate the perception that it is a top-down process from the level of the EU. I believe we should have two stages of the European Semester. A first round of recommendations which sets out the reasons why the country-level recommendations need to be fulfilled in the second stage, and in addition we need more parliamentary control and involvement in this process. Secondly, in order to have more concrete solutions, we need a comprehensive evaluation of the European Semester and the CSRs in order to understand their relevance to Member States and to adjust the process. Member States also need incentives for action. The question is, how can we make Member States own the process more?

We do not have a central government or a serious budget that will help us overcome any crisis. Instead, we are 28 independent states that cooperate with each other, and we have 28 different national budgets.  But it is also a fact that we are all connected to each other. This means that if there is a crisis in one Member State, it inevitably affects others, perhaps even all the Member States of the European Union. It is therefore important for us to agree on those things that make our cooperation stronger and more resilient to any future crises.  Firstly, it is important for us to continue the so-called European Semester, in which we coordinate the procedure for adopting national budgets. But that is not enough! We must go further, both by strengthening our banking union and by strengthening our economic supervision. I therefore support the Commission's initiative to strengthen our economic union.

Economic growth is a key driver of the four key priorities of the 2015 Country-Specific Recommendations.

However, the Member States hardly adhere to it. We have already heard today that almost 11 per cent of country-specific recommendations are being implemented, although the data on which the country-specific recommendations are based comes from the Member States, namely through the Council, in the Annual Growth Survey. That is why it makes sense for the rapporteur to now focus on the report and say that there must be a greater focus on the core priorities and that the country-specific recommendations must be published earlier.

I agree that the European Semester should focus on what is its action: the coordination of the European Union's economic policies. But we cannot allow these guidelines not to promote the balance between a market economy and the social economy, but should primarily target the empowerment of young Europeans to meet the demands of the labour market, the number of people at risk of poverty and social exclusion, the difficulty of businesses in accessing finance and removing barriers to their activity.

Parliament has an important role to play in the debating of European economic policies and the future of EMU, so I have carefully taken note of Members’ remarks and the points raised today. While different views and opinions were expressed during the debate, I note that there is also certain support for a new Commission approach to the revamped European Semester, and there are certain elements which still need to be fine—tuned to find the right way forward. On some of the issues which have been raised during this debate: firstly, environmental measures or environmental policy-related measures in the European Semester bring us to the next debate on the Europe 2020 Strategy. But I would emphasise that we are streamlining the European Semester, we are trying to focus on key social economic challenges in the Member States and we are applying the ʻtell only onceʼ principle, so we are not doubling some of the advice that we are giving to the Member States in the context of other EU policies. The low CSR implementation is a cause of concern. It is something we need to address, but we believe the best way to address this is through improved membership in the Member States so that Member States, stakeholders, national parliaments, governments and social partners are better involved in decision-making and are better informed about the economic challenges both at the euro area level and the EU level, and how it goes in a national context. Then on some of the questions of surplus versus deficit countries which were raised here, I must note that excessive current account surpluses are indeed also considered as a macroeconomic imbalance by the European Commission, as outlined in our macroeconomic imbalance procedures. That is why countries like Germany, for example, are also in macroeconomic imbalance due to a large and sustained current account surplus. We recommend strengthening investment and strengthening and stimulating the demand side of the economy. Indeed the demand side of the economy is part of our economic strategy, so what we need to focus on is how to strengthen the economic recovery in Europe, and of course the demand side is one of the answers. Some questions were raised on the ambition of this current Commission proposal and reference was made to some specific instruments, for example fiscal capacity. It must be noted that some of those elements were, for example, in the Five Presidents’ Report where there is a reference to euro area stabilisation. This extends a similar concept since this used to be referred to in some earlier documents as fiscal capacity, and this is foreseen for Stage 2 of the Five Presidents’ Report. I have been outlining also the Commissionʼs preparation of that Stage 2 of the Five Presidents’ Report so this is going to be part of that work. Indeed the Commission is open to looking at ways of how to ensure stronger involvement of the European Parliament in the European Semester and macroeconomic policy decision-making, and indeed I sense also from today’s debate that there is some further work and consideration needed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2132, "date": "2015-10-28.json", "name": "n/a", "mepid": "n/a", "text": " President-in-Office of the Council. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you first of all for this exchange, which has been sometimes critical, but overall always constructive.  As your draft resolution indicates, we share the same priorities and, above all, and I think it is crucial, we share the same will for action, because indeed the economic results and especially the employment situation are not satisfactory. The European Semester must be placed in a broader perspective, that of work to complete the Economic and Monetary Union. It is an essential tool in strengthened governance. The Luxembourg Presidency has also discussed the proposals of the five presidents in several ministerial meetings this autumn and we have just reported to the European Council in October.  The Commission made proposals a few days ago, which will also be on the agenda of either Council. I can already tell you that at the EPSCO Council on 7 December, we will discuss, among other things, the social aspect contained in the Commission's proposals. Because this social dimension needs to be deepened, it must enable the establishment of an inclusive space with high social and employment performance for all citizens. This is a high priority for this Commission, which, I have noted, finds a great deal of support in Parliament. It requires concrete measures to promote upward convergence and here I would say that the best indicators, the best benchmarks will not suffice alone. We do need policies, we need reforms, and we also need resources, resources, investments in human capital, of course, and in innovation, research and education. This is the future of the European economy. I also agree - I think the person who mentioned it is no longer there - that investments in the green economy in relation to climate change, also in relation to the promotion of renewable energy and energy transition can not only create jobs - the so-called green jobs - but also redirect growth in Europe. The Council will have to continue discussions on deepening EMU and we will have to be more ambitious, closer to realities and real problems. I agree with what has also been said by one or the other, namely that the euro area is not simply the addition of the Member States. The eurozone needs to act more globally - that is what we call, what one or the other has called the eurozone tax stances.

We have not agreed on everything, of course – that would have been impossible in this House – but at least I have seen involvement and indeed a genuine willingness to discuss important matters. This debate has also shown that the issue is politically very sensitive and, indeed, this has been reflected in the process of our work on this report because we have been confronted with different expectations, different opinions, on such elementary things like: What is the actual economic situation of the Union? What measures need to be taken in order to put the EU economies on a sustainable growth path? What are the reasons for the current slowdown? And so on and so forth. So we have been unable to agree on everything but, as I said, I tried very much to come up with a compromise – of course at the cost of some clarity and perhaps insufficient focus on all important matters, but still I thought that having a broad majority in favour of this report would be important. I would like to express my thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs who have participated in this difficult negotiation process. As I said, we have not agreed on everything, but at least they have shown consistently their willingness to cooperate, willingness to discuss, and I would like to express my appreciation.

Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. Today's question from the Committee on Employment deals with the Council's last recommendation on the integration of the long-term unemployed into the labour market – indeed the most difficult group. As a result of the economic crisis, the number of long-term unemployed has doubled since 2007. They make up half of all the unemployed: more than 12 million people, 5% of the unemployed in Europe, not yet registered. The shortcomings of data collection and sometimes creative data design play a role here. Official statistics underestimate the situation of long-term unemployment. More than 60% of the long-term unemployed are unemployed for at least two years in a row, and we have long-term unemployment rates in the Member States with marked differences. The rates are highest in countries that have had austerity policies, in the programme countries that have been overrun by austerity – I will mention this personally. The consequences are well known: long-term unemployment often leads to inequality, poverty and social exclusion, and it affects particularly disadvantaged groups. The downward spiral, the erosion of abilities, discouragement and alienation, increased psychological and physical problems, social exclusion and withdrawal from society are palpable throughout societies. This is becoming increasingly common: unemployment and poverty are increasingly being inherited into the next generation. We note that enormous social and economic consequences, the waste of skills, higher social expenditure, the loss of social cohesion and growing old-age poverty also have to do with the consolidation of long-term unemployment. The questions addressed to the Council are relatively clear: how does the Council intend to deal effectively with the multiple barriers for many long-term unemployed? How does the Council intend to create conditions for permanent jobs for the long-term unemployed, especially in regions with high structural unemployment? Are employment-enhancing tax measures recommended? How do you intend to make better use of skills and employment opportunities to enable the reintegration of the long-term unemployed? How should Member States create quality jobs for the long-term unemployed and prevent them from ending up in precarious employment? The Member States are certainly very different in terms of their social, economic and budgetary conditions. At the same time, the long-term unemployed form a very heterogeneous group, that is clear. What is the Council's assessment of this for successful implementation in the Member States? How should the identification and exchange of best practices be ensured in order to combat this situation? How does the Council intend to improve the situation of those who have been unemployed for more than 18 months or those who are not registered, if we want to focus only on those who are unemployed for 12 to 18 months? What specific measures does the Council intend to take to involve all relevant actors, including NGOs and employment services, be they private or public, in the process of integration? These are questions that are addressed to this recommendation. True, EU labour markets are showing some signs of improvement, and yet the unemployment rate among the long-term unemployed remains high. We see the highest growth in precarious employment. However, this also means an additional burden on public budgets, taxpayers and social security funds. Continued high long-term unemployment not only threatens the Europe 2020 headline targets, from which we are further away than ever: to reach 75% of 20-64 year olds in employment and to have at least 20 million fewer people in poverty and social exclusion at the end of the period. It also jeopardises people's confidence in a more social Europe, it leads to a loss of confidence that hurts us, which casts doubt on the further development of this European Union in the spirit of the people, in the sense of a better life, and that does Europe no good.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2137, "date": "2015-10-28.json", "name": "Nicolas Schmit", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. Mr President, finally, your question is an illustration of the debate we have just had. I believe that you have put your finger on a very concrete, very specific issue, which affects - and you have recalled the figures - millions of Europeans who are waiting for something concrete from the European Semester. The European Semester is not an exercise in style, a theoretical exercise. But, in the end, if the European Semester has any real political significance, it must reach those who, in fact, have been unemployed for a long time and suffer from all the evils you have described. Indeed, the 12 million that we quote are statistics. But, as we often say, behind these statistics, there are people, there are families, there are broken lives, there are despairs, and I think that is what we will actually have to deal with. Long-term unemployment is already a kind of failure, because how is it acceptable for someone not to find a job for a year, two years? And when you cross the two-year mark, it becomes a sometimes impossible affair, a matter of real despair. And what does this long-term unemployment produce? It is a kind of vicious circle that, in a way, adds unemployment to unemployment. And the longer the duration of unemployment, the less favourable the prospects of finding a job become. And among these long-term unemployed, there are often women, often seniors and slightly older people who have lost their jobs and whose qualifications are no longer adapted to the labour market. Unfortunately, there are also young people and, it must be said, sometimes the youth guarantee is not enough to reintegrate these people. And if we are actually talking about a crisis, if the economic crisis has ended, if the debt crisis is under control, if the financial crisis is behind us, with billions and billions, and indeed the real losers, the real victims of the crisis, it is these unemployed, those who have no prospects. Indeed, these workers facing long-term unemployment are gradually losing, and I think that is really the hardest problem, their skills and, subsequently, their employability. In the event of an economic recovery, which we are seeing today, they will be the last to be hired. And they even run the risk of not being hired at all. And in these circumstances, it is very likely that they will leave the labour market, that they will no longer be registered, as you said, and that they will join the ranks of the inactive, with all the spiral of poverty that this entails, and which directly affects them, but which often - I do not need to repeat, as you said - also concerns their families. , their children, in some way replicating the same pattern of exclusion.  The long-term unemployed must therefore be treated as a priority category. And the policy to be implemented must include reforms in both social and employment policies, but also broader strategic action in the economic and fiscal sphere. A real economic recovery and demand-driven measures are essential to reduce long-term unemployment, because, you know, the best recipe against unemployment in general and especially against long-term unemployment is job creation and, ultimately, what creates jobs is growth, with business creation, the creation of business. And so we need a more sustainable, stronger recovery, since we are increasingly facing this type of structural unemployment, and this, of course, in the countries that have been affected the most by the crisis, but even in countries where, in the end, the level of unemployment remains relatively low.  But growth alone is not going to solve this problem, we need a major investment in human capital. This is the most decisive action to enable these people to re-acquire skills or restore their skills, which they need to re-enter the labour market. It is also important to focus on a preventive approach. Because you become a long-term unemployed because you have lost your job very often or because you have not been able to find a job, but often because you have lost your job. I think that here, when we discuss flexicurity, well we forget a little about the \"security\" aspect. And when we talk about the long-term unemployed, it is because finally this security component did not work. Because it should have allowed those people who had lost their jobs, in the end, to rehabilitate themselves, to be trained in order to be able to reintegrate more quickly the job market.  Therefore, training, re-qualification, continuing education for those who have a job are key policies to avoid, effectively, long-term unemployment.  And long-term unemployment, we're talking about 18 months, we say we should start acting when someone has been unemployed for 18 months. And perhaps it is also the reproach that I make a little to this document that was presented by the Commission: well no, we must not wait 18 months when someone is unemployed, we must take action as quickly as possible, we must act quickly, as soon as possible, because, indeed, if we wait 18 months already , we've wasted a lot of time, way too much time.  It is in this context that work is taking place on the Council's proposed recommendation on the long-term unemployed. The Luxembourg Presidency wants the Council to reach a political agreement at the EPSCO Council session in December. A policy debate on this proposal has already taken place at the EPSCO Council session in October.  As you pointed out, we do need to modernize, adapt and strengthen our public employment services, which often resign in the face of the long-term unemployed because they feel that there is not much left to do, so these people are a little left behind. And it is important to develop an approach, perhaps not exactly the same, but comparable to what has been implemented with the youth guarantee. So we don't just have to rely on more fluid labour markets to reintegrate these job seekers. We need to build real bridges to employment. The creation of specific jobs that would facilitate their reintegration should be promoted, including public sector jobs. Investing more in employment than inactivity, because inactivity rhymes with exclusion, with distress, with precariousness, with poverty.  Let us also think of families, children, as you said. I am also thinking of the social and solidarity economy, which has a specific role to play in reintegrating the long-term unemployed, because it obeys other rules and can act at that level. And I am referring to the social innovation projects of the Commission's EaSI programme to make better use of the means to reintegrate the long-term unemployed.  So I think there are different approaches: job creation, investment in training, investment in re-qualification, social support - it's also important because often the long-term unemployed have no income or very low incomes, have housing problems, and then the vicious circle is going to take an extremely dangerous turn.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2138, "date": "2015-10-28.json", "name": "David Casa", "mepid": "28122", "text": "  f'isem group PPE. – Aħna konxji mill-fatt li dawk li ilhom mingħajr impjieg għal żmien twil jiffa大大jaw ħafna ostakoli.

That's what long-term unemployment means. Twelve million, more than double what we had before the 2007 economic crisis. They have not stopped growing and, in some countries – as in mine, in Spain – we have more than three million people unemployed for long duration. And the effects are huge, negative, very very negative; economic effects, because we deteriorate a lot of human capital; social effects, because we push, drag, millions of people into poverty, marginality or social exclusion; effects on health, public health, with enormous deterioration also in the psychosocial sphere, and a huge difficulty in returning to the labour market, very difficult, and with consequences for life once entering the labour market. That is why the European Commission has put forward a recommendation, a work plan, a framework that is positive. That is why the Council also addressed us today with the words of the Minister, whom I welcome, which I share, but everything we do will not be enough as long as we have this problem in front of us. That is why, from the Socialist Group, what we are asking for is, first of all, that there be more resources, as we have had for some sectors, such as for youth, for youth unemployment; secondly, that we devote more efforts to detection, registration: there are many people who have given up, it is invisible; third, that we personalize our performance: it is not the same a long-term stop of more than 45 years as of less than 25 years; and that we combine active employment policies with social policies, because training of the person is as important as the social environment, and never at the price of having a precarious job.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2140, "date": "2015-10-28.json", "name": "Jana Žitňanská", "mepid": "124901", "text": "  for the ECR Group – Several Member States, among them, unfortunately Slovakia, have a serious problem.

The ALDE Group supports the initiative by the Commission on the integration of long-term unemployed people into the labour market and the three main elements of the proposal. Fighting unemployment requires more efficiency, consistency and cooperation regarding the integration of the long-term unemployed. An individual approach, assessing people’s abilities and needs, is also crucial, and a written job integration agreement can be beneficial. However, on the basis of some negative experiences of the European Youth Guarantee, we call on the Member States to consider regional differences. In some regions the fight against unemployment is limited by the narrowness of the local labour market. This problem may be addressed by creating a favourable business environment, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. Unfortunately, labour taxation systems in some Member States do little to promote the creation of new jobs. Another important aspect of the fight against long-term unemployment is labour-force mobility at three levels – regional, national and EU. There should be no obstacles to freedom of movement in the European Union, and the Commission should react swiftly where it sees such obstacles. For instance, in the Baltic region, workers’ freedom of movement is compromised by disproportionate professional linguistic requirements. The fight against long-term unemployment is heavily dependent on the ability of both the Commission and Member States to cooperate in an efficient way. There should be no artificial obstacles for job seekers on national labour markets.

Two points are important to us. The first, structural in nature and directly addressed to the Council, is to point out that countries with the highest long-term unemployment rate are most affected by austerity policies and competition generated between Member States, which has contributed to a virulent deterioration in employment and living conditions since the onset of the crisis. Mr Schmit, we share the diagnosis, but with the policies implemented, long-term unemployment has continued to grow. So what we want is to reverse neoliberal policies; other hand, we will not be able to find a solution to this serious problem. Be brave, stand up to the financial system, it's okay. And start talking about labor time sharing, public sector expansion, reinforcement and social protection resources. The second axis is the implementation of active policies that are really effective, and I believe that in this I share a lot with my colleagues in this Parliament. Errors that have already occurred in the implementation of the Youth Guarantee should not be repeated.

So I do not understand why today we are content with a debate, a recommendation from the Council, which does not oblige the Member States to follow its content.

We are talking about China, which could perhaps invest in the Juncker plan. Is it serious? You are really talking about the real issues, Minister. But we will not be able to deal with this issue of unemployment if we do not deal with social dumping, tax dumping, because behind tax dumping, we have the money to create the jobs of the future.  And I end, because that's where it's most important: job creation. We are one month away from the last chance summit to save the climate, COP 21.

I welcome the agreement on labour integration, but I do wonder how we are going to implement it. How do we provide good quality jobs that people can also live on? It seems clear to me that the Commission must ensure sufficient funding and that it should be made available to the Member States quickly and easily, just as is happening now with the Youth Initiative. My main concern is that while the economy is creeping out of the valley again, the number of jobs is lagging behind. At the same time, we are seeing companies hoarding money and also trying to keep tax payments in their pockets. I also believe that companies should take responsibility for creating jobs.

Madam President, I would like first of all to thank the author of the question, but also Parliament for this extremely stimulating debate. Indeed, this issue of long-term unemployment is an issue that will have to be integrated, and which is also integrated into the procedures and actions of the European Semester.  Countries with high levels of unemployment, especially long-term levels, must indeed be encouraged to implement appropriate solutions, actions and policies. It is true that there are people who do not want, who cannot work, these are categories that exist; it may also be necessary to see, if work does not pay, to adapt this imbalance between benefits on the one hand and wages on the other, because it is true that the problem exists.  Nor should we expect everything from the Council, because in fact the real employment policies are first and foremost at the level of each Member State. Of course, national policies will have to be better matched, on the one hand, and the actions of the European Union on the other. I believe that this is also the meaning of this recommendation proposed by the Commission. This recommendation is to put this issue on the agenda that concerns us all. But policies also require resources, and it is especially countries that do not have resources, that are experiencing budgetary difficulties, that need help in this area. And I believe that, as we have done in favour of the Youth Guarantee, with the implementation of targeted actions on countries with particularly high youth unemployment rates, which are generally also the most serious budgetary problems, we should also consider targeting resources to countries that are experiencing the greatest difficulties in terms of long-term unemployment. I believe that the European Social Fund should integrate a real dimension in the fight against long-term unemployment. We all agree that in order to employ a long-term unemployed person, jobs must be created and that economic policy is primarily concerned. If there is no job creation, if there is no growth, if there is no demand, if there is no investment, there will be no jobs, and unemployment will become increasingly high and structural unemployment. Of course, employers should also be held accountable for their actions , and I believe that this is also part of their social responsibility , but perhaps the authorities must also help employers to hire long-term jobseekers, through specific aids or measures.  I do not like to cite my country as an example, but on Friday I will launch a new measure, which was suggested to me by the Commission's recommendation, by creating a real reintegration contract for the most vulnerable groups, to try to bring these people back to work and, of course, to grant aid to the companies that hire these people. At the same time, I will allow these companies to also have measures to supervise these people, to train, etc.  I therefore believe that we must help employers, encourage them, but also call on their responsibility to give a chance to the long-term unemployed, because what we are actually talking about is also an aspect of the European social model, it is social cohesion, because this number of people - twelve million - represents a wound in European societies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2166, "date": "2015-10-28.json", "name": "Die Präsidentin. –", "mepid": "97017", "text": "   At the end of the debate, a motion for a resolution was tabled in accordance with Rule 128(5) of the Rules of Procedure.

It can lead to skills depreciation, loss of motivation and higher incidence of health problems. Long-term unemployment is one of the most important causes of poverty. Long-term unemployed people are often facing reluctance from potential employers and consequently lower career advancement prospects. Many of them, unemployed for a year or more, risk leaving the labour market altogether. Workers with low qualifications, third country nationals, and people with disabilities are disproportionately affected. The diversity of situations requires support tailored to the needs of each person. This trend needs to be reversed to ensure that the long-term unemployed can benefit from the economic recovery. Tackling long-term unemployment can contribute to sustainable growth and would reduce the impact of higher social assistance. We need to open a way out of poverty for both the workers affected and their families. Besides ensuring adequate financial support from the European Social Fund, we need effective administrative measures. The EU needs to assist Member States to exchange good practices to improve their policies and services focusing on better assessment of the unemployed person’s skills and designing a personalised job integration agreement.

That is not to mention 100 000s of people working in the Midlands supply chain. This has not developed overnight, yet the UK Government failed to prevent this social bloodbath. EU funding is available to support the affected workers, but the Tories failed to apply.  Still, there are other ways in which the EU can and should help: it should swiftly grant state aid approval so the industry can receive compensation for high energy prices – especially given the Tories are hiding behind the Commission rather than securing retrospective EU approval later. The EU should also take a firm stance against China dumping steel on our markets. 42 companies have shown interest in taking over Caparo, but we can only prevent a similar tragedy from happening again if we address these structural problems.

It set out five ambitious targets for the EU to achieve by 2020 in the fields of employment, research and development, climate change and energy, education, and the fight against poverty and social exclusion. More than that, the Europe 2020 Strategy has guided the strategic choices of the Commission’s work. The Strategy announced the creation of the European Semester, which has become a powerful instrument to provide guidance for the Member States in their structural reforms and sustainable fiscal policies.  The Strategy also guides EU spending. It has set the direction when preparing the 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework, when programing European structural and investment funds and when launching new funding programmes at EU level. A clear example is the creation of the Horizon 2020 Programme, with substantial increases in research, development and innovation funding.  However, Europe 2020 has not always been successful in giving Member States the tools to achieve their objectives. Europe 2020 should not be a process imposed by the EU, but a method for common prosperity. Therefore, full ownership at EU and national level is key to its implementation. This requires the Commission to work more closely with Member States. The European Council needs to be fully involved and to share ownership of Europe’s long-term growth strategy. The European Parliament and the national parliaments are vital partners. Engagement with, and ownership by, civil society and businesses is also important.  The reflection on the Europe 2020 Strategy is ongoing and we are looking into making the best use of the existing Strategy – improving its implementation and monitoring in the context of the European Semester. At the same time we need to reflect on, and develop, a longer-term vision. Therefore, we will present next year a new long-term strategy for jobs and growth, looking beyond the 2020 horizon. With this approach we are ensuring economic growth and social and environmental sustainability beyond the 2020 framework. In this work we are taking into account the Europe 2020 review and the internal and external implementation of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.

In part, the objectives have hitherto been difficult to achieve because, of course, they have demonstrated the necessary flexibility that characterises such longer-term strategies in general. That is why we must, above all, stick to the objectives, which are actually measurable for the success of the European Union and can be used in the European internal market. The three per cent target for investment in research and development is an often underestimated element in increasing competitiveness and strengthening the social market economy in the European Union, because we see that global economies that invest heavily in research and development are significantly better off than others.

It has disappeared from our radars, but Europe really needs a bolder strategy for growth and jobs. Europe 2020 should be updated to take into account the new challenges. We believe that what is at stake now is not only energy transition but also promoting a circular economy and providing new kinds of jobs because of that; what is at stake is not only to promote digital telecommunications but the full range of new services, products and the new jobs connected with this; what is at stake is not only to strengthen R&amp;D but to turn R&amp;D into real innovative services and products, and finally, in the social dimension, we believe that beyond quality jobs we also need to tackle social inequalities. So Europe 2020 should be updated like that. But then we are concerned with the means to implement this, because the lesson of the past is that bold visions were not matched by the proper means. So we believe that the European investment plan should be made a central engine to implement the Europe 2020 Strategy, and we also believe that the European Semester should provide the coordination of economic and social policies which we need to deliver the Europe 2020 Strategy properly. So my question for you, Mr Vice-President, is the following: so far, we have a kind of divorce between the Europe 2020 Strategy on the one hand and the European Semester on the other, and we need to marry them again, I would say, so this means that the next European Semester cycle should take fully on board the Europe 2020 targets, should take fully on board Europe 2020 goals when encouraging Member States to prepare their national reform programmes, and then the country-specific recommendations should push in the same direction.

To be honest, I think that we missed the opportunity, and I will tell you why. For me, the Strategy is a document that really focuses on absolutely key issues, provides the necessary means, provides tools and monitors, creates benchmarks and has some kind of internal review. In fact, what we got out of Europe 2020 was, if not shopping list, a Christmas tree. Everyone had to be happy. Everyone contributed, and we again created a compromise.  I really appreciate what you have said, that the strategy has met certain objectives, and that it did help. You mentioned guiding EU spending: I think if we look at EFSI it also reflects that. But I would also like to emphasise what you have said, and that is that you will be preparing a longer-term vision for next year. This is once again an opportunity, but I think that this time we cannot afford to miss the opportunity. We should be looking for absolutely key priorities – a limited range – create the resources, have the right tools and have the courage. Also, when you speak of ownership on behalf of the European Council, I could not agree more. But what we have today is a Strategy which was too much owned by the European Council. I know that the Commission missed out on the opportunity to be a little bit more pushy, courageous and address the topical issues, but then the European Council created a document about which, shortly after it was approved, colleagues both from the Commission and the Council kept telling me ‘We did not want that! This is not a good document’, and we need to avoid that situation. So my plea would be to focus on the key issues, both on growth and creating jobs, adjusted to the needs of this year – post-recession, post-crisis – to tackle exactly the areas that will contribute to growth. Some of them were mentioned by colleagues; some of them might not have been mentioned.

Commissioner, what strategy are we talking about when the people of Europe are currently experiencing this situation? The economic crisis deepened inequalities in the Union, while harsh measures deregulated industrial relations, took out the social state and sold off public wealth. The poverty rate is constantly rising, the figures call for reality: 123 million Europeans live below the poverty line, of whom 26 million are children and young people. Only in Cyprus, although harsh memorial policies are in place, one in four people is facing poverty and child poverty is at 27% . Greece and Spain and Portugal and Ireland face the same problems, although the last two countries have theoretically emerged from the Memorandums, while the same policies continue. It is no coincidence, of course, that 1% of Europe's population currently holds a third of its wealth.  As wealth gathers in the hands of the few, the gap and inequalities grow. That is why cohesion policy should not be a tool of the EU 2020 strategy, which provides for enhanced competitiveness, flexible forms of employment and privatisation. It is important that cohesion policy is not aligned with the framework of single economic governance, otherwise states will be blackmailed into following the harsh austerity measures provided for in the European Semester, so as not to interrupt their financial support. In such a case, cohesion policy will be completely neutralised.  Commissioner, we need to promote a new social development policy, to support public investment, to finance projects that meet the needs of society and to contribute to the creation of new quality jobs. Only in this way will we combat the economic, social and territorial disparities that exist in Europe.

The countries of the European Union will undoubtedly achieve more and better results than acting alone in their immediate challenges. If this is not done, increased poverty and social exclusion will lead to even greater alienation and division in our region and will further undermine the idea of a united Europe.

I am rather pleased with this path, not only because this is the first legislative report on which I had the pleasure of working, here in the European Parliament, but also because I believe that a good compromise has been found between the two main objectives of this rule, which is to ensure an efficient and liquid market for securities financing operations, but even more so to ensure transparency and clear rules in order to prevent systemic risks in the financial market.  The crisis that broke out in 2007 in the United States, in fact, and then quickly transmitted virulently throughout Europe, clearly highlighted not only how the world banking system is now strongly interconnected, but also how there were many connections between the traditional banking system and the so-called shadow banking system, shadow banking, that is, that set of entities that, although performing functions similar to those traditionally carried out by banks , do so outside the system of rules to which credit institutions are subject.  The ECB Board said it was \"too big and too indebted, this shadow banking system.\" In fact, some of the operations carried out by the shadow banking system can result in a level of excessive indebtedness, thus increasing the risk and danger of the whole system. It has been estimated that shadow banking may have accounted for around EUR 51 000 billion in 2011, four times the GDP of the whole of Europe.  Securities financing operations are one of the main link between the shadow banking system and the traditional banking system, which is why the Financial Stability Board and the expert group led by Mr Liikanen, first, and then the European Commission, have made a number of recommendations aimed at ensuring transparency and security, while preserving the necessary liquidity of this market. , which is, however, an important market in ensuring the possibility of financing and also the possibility of using liquidity. The regulation that we are going to adopt aims to improve three important aspects of this market. Firstly, the proposed regulation requires all transactions to be reported in a central database, which will make it possible to know the size and link between shadow banking and the traditional financial system. Secondly, there is a need for greater transparency between investment funds engaged in this market and investors, and finally better regulation of the reuse or rehypothecation of securities.  Efforts have also been made to simplify and take advantage of other regulations affecting financial markets, such as EMIR. There has also been an attempt to agree on the need for transparency, but also for the security of the operations carried out by the European Central Bank.  In short, I believe that a good compromise will be presented to the House for the vote tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2209, "date": "2015-10-28.json", "name": "Valdis Dombrovskis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, I am very pleased to have the chance today to discuss the Securities Financing Transactions Regulation (SFTR) and to congratulate Mr Soru and the shadow rapporteurs for the work they have done in taking this proposal forward.  This regulation is a central part of our response to the need to increase the safety and transparency of financial markets. It will help us to manage the risks in the shadow banking sector, in line with Financial Stability Board recommendations endorsed by G20. It sits alongside a number of measures we have already taken to regulate the shadow banking sector. For example, the European Market Infrastructure Regulation reduces risks in derivatives markets, and the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive ensures that investment funds are regulated. As those of you who have followed this proposal know well, securities financing transactions are transactions in which securities are used as collateral to borrow cash, or vice versa. They are an important source of funding on Europe’s financial markets. They support investment and allow for better risk management. They are integral to European Central Bank monetary policy operations. During the financial crisis, it became clear that we did not know enough about what was going on in these markets. Without reliable data, oversight was more difficult. The European Systemic Risk Board, the European Central Bank and the Financial Stability Board all argued that transparency in these markets would allow risks to be managed better and would enable better-informed investment decisions. This was also our analysis in the Commission. So I am delighted that we are on the verge of reaching a final agreement on legislation that will improve transparency. I am grateful to Parliament for its hard work on this issue, and I believe that the political agreement you have reached with the Council strikes the right balance.  It will enhance transparency in three main ways. Firstly, it will introduce the reporting of securities financing transactions to centralised databases known as trade repositories. This will allow supervisors to identify risks better and, if necessary, to take targeted action.  Secondly, funds will have to become more transparent for investors both in their regular reports and in pre-investment documents. This will give investors the information they need to make sound investment decisions. Thirdly, the regulation will improve transparency around the re-use of securities as collateral. This should help reduce domino effects when a default on one transaction can cause other defaults if the same collateral has been used more than once. The legislation builds on the experience of establishing the European Market Infrastructure Regulation. A detailed implementation table will give European markets time to adjust. The proposed reporting system will reduce the burden on small and medium-sized enterprises, and it limits reporting of existing transactions to those strictly necessary for regulatory and supervisory purposes. The proposal enlarges the list of supervisors who can access data in trade repositories, and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation has been modified to ensure consistency. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will prepare draft regulatory technical standards setting out the requirements for reporting. We will work with ESMA to ensure consistent application of the rules across the European Union. The Commission is committed to legislating in a proportionate manner in a way that strikes the right balance between managing risk and encouraging growth. Transparency is an important part of this agenda. By making the right information available we can help investors make sound decisions; we can encourage responsible behaviour; we can avoid unnecessary burdens; and we can take targeted action, if and when it is needed, on the basis of evidence. The Securities Financing Transactions Regulation will be an important step in this direction.

This will certainly help market participants. I also trust that transparency might prevent activities migrating from the banking system to the less regulated non-bank system. In this respect I find it particularly important that information on the securities financing transactions entered into by funds – and I am thinking here of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) and structured financial instruments (SFIs) – is disclosed to investors. The good news is also that the three institutions agreed to use the opportunity of this regulation to make two amendments to the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). One will give the resolution authorities established after the entry into force of EMIR the right to access information retained in trade repositories.

Securities financing transactions (SFTs) play an important role in financial markets and the financing of our economy. I would like to congratulate the negotiating team for its very balanced approach. By a balanced approach I mean that the result has considered all SFT stakeholders, whilst achieving financial stability. At the end of the day, we wanted to ensure that the reporting is actually being used and is useful for its intended purpose. The proposed regulation delivers binding transparency and reporting requirements in three key areas. First, all securities financing transactions have to be reported to trade repositories, and here the burden for non-financial parties, such as SMEs, was reduced by allowing their financial counterparties to do the reporting for them. Second, we have ensured transparency towards investors. Funds have to inform investors of their SFT activities in the prospectus, and this will enable them to assess the risk as part of their investment decisions. Third, the report addresses transparency around re-use of assets. Parties have a responsibility to communicate the risks and consequences in the event of a default. Assets can only be reused within certain parameters and with prior consent, except for Title Transfer Collateral Arrangements (TTCAs) where the legal title has already been transferred. Another important point is that we came up with a realistic implementation timeframe. We wanted to avoid the mistakes that we have seen with the implementation of EMIR and we rectified some of the shortcomings. All parties should now have sufficient time to implement the necessary requirements. To conclude, I believe that we have come up with a very balanced approach. We have created transparency in a difficult and technical market, both towards supervisors and investors with a minimal burden for all the stakeholders.

Apart from any regulation and supervision of the banking authorities, trillions of dollars or euros of off-balance sheet assets circulate in the greatest opacity.  The proposed regulation on securities financing transactions obliges players to play the game of transparency in terms of transactions and listed companies. But it lacks ambition and could be more restrictive, particularly with regard to the prohibition on the reuse of security, which is a major factor in the dissemination of risk, and by taking into account the operations of public institutions.  Above all, the only effective reform is the real separation between deposit-taking and investment banks - but the end of the universal banking model, using deposits to speculate, will not take place until there are irresponsible politicians subject to the banking lobby - with the aim of no longer making financial contributions to either citizens or customers to bail out insolvent private banks.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2215, "date": "2015-10-28.json", "name": "Romana Tomc (PPE).", "mepid": "125104", "text": "   – The global crisis has also shown us, in addition to everything else, the shortcomings and vulnerability of our financial systems.

In particular, I would like to thank Vice-President Tajani for his involvement and contribution, and there is some time to discuss it today in plenary.  The Commission is committed to thoroughly assessing how EU financial regulations impact access to finance for SMEs and for banks and, in particular, how they impact local and regional banks. We have just closed a target consultation on the potential impact of the banking regulation on the financing of the economy, which covers the impact on SME lending as well as issues of proportionality and simplification.  The responses are currently being analysed by the services of the Commission. With the recent publication of a call for evidence, the Commission has also launched a comprehensive review of the cumulative impact and overall coherence of financial legislation, in particular to assess interactions and whether they give rise to any unintended consequences. As regards assessing the potential benefits and strengthening alternative forms of lending, it is the Commission’s standard practice as part of the Better Regulation Agenda to conduct impact assessments in support of our proposals. This includes an analysis of the potential benefits and costs to different stakeholders, including SMEs. This was also the case for the CRR and CRD IV proposals in 2011.  Thanks to an amendment introduced by Parliament, the Capital Requirements Regulation contains a requirement for the Commission to assess the impact of own funds requirements on lending to SMEs and natural persons and to report back to you and the Council by 28 June, 2016. We are currently carrying out that analytical work, and the issue will be debated in the conference scheduled for 14 December on the impact of CRR and CRD IV on bank financing of the economy in which Members of the European Parliament are also warmly invited to participate.  Early next year, the European Banking Authority will provide technical advice to the Commission. We will use this, as well as evidence from different sources, to deliver an objective and a reliable report to Parliament and the Council by the deadline.  Our first priority in the Capital Markets Union Action Plan is to facilitate the financing of innovative companies, start-ups and non-listed firms. We will create an appropriate framework to enable innovative forms of business financing such as crowd—funding, private placements and loan originating funds to grow, while at the same time responding to the key risks. We will also launch a comprehensive package of measures to support venture capital and risk capital financing in the EU. We will explore ways to build a pan-European approach to better connect SMEs with a range of funding sources. With respect to work currently conducted by the Basel Committee to review the approach to credit risk, the goal is to reduce the importance of ratings provided by external credit rating agencies in determining regulatory capital requirements. This needs to be done without affecting the conservative capital requirements. The Basel Committee’s consultation paper includes ideas on how to replace ratings with other risk indicators and contains a preliminary illustrative calibration.  In light of the predominantly negative responses received, we understand the Basel Committee is currently reviewing its approach but maintaining the original objective of reducing mechanical reliance on external ratings. The Commission is closely following this debate as an observer at Basel and generally shares the goal of reducing mechanical reliance on ratings. The Commission will take a position once the final rules have been published.

Our SMEs need access to more diverse funding tools, as our over-reliance on bank loans really is the spanner in the works. Achieving this requires sharing best practices, financial education and cultural change. Lord Hill’s CMU proposals are promising, and existing tax incentives stimulate investment in SMEs. However, they are not the only solution. We need to let our constituents know about all the options available to them. Venture capital, business angels and looking at equity rather than bank debt should all be considered.

After all, we know that our SMEs are very much dependent on bank financing. Certainly the smaller ones are struggling to get funding in any other way. I think this is one of the things we should try to change. We must try to create a culture of equity among SMEs as well so that they can grow faster, create more jobs and weigh more economically. My own professional experience also plays a part in this. I have seen how new forms of financing clearly allow companies to grow much faster and rise up the funding ladder much faster. It's about creating diversity in the market. We need to look at venture capital and new forms of financing, such as crowdfunding, but we should not forget private placements as sources of funding for our SMEs. It is a thing of the european authorities to create a clear and stable regulatory framework that encourages long-term investment. In addition, we must do everything we can to prevent fragmentation in our European Union. Commissioner Hill's proposal on the capital market union is a good example of this. We must break down national barriers, prevent over-regulation and ensure that we have a genuine single European market.

I do not share the Commission's diagnosis of the causes of lack of credit and which serves to guide its financing programmes to SMEs. We are witnessing a huge concentration of the banking sector in a few private transnational oligopolies. It is a development favoured by the Commission, as seen in its model of banking union or under the conditions of financial bailouts, for example the one that was established for Spain. But without public banking, without a bank linked to territory and industry, what happens is a shift of financial activity towards speculation. Seeking to respond to this problem with further liberalization of finance, such as the Capital Markets Union, is a false answer, because not only is this business still in the hands of the same large financial groups, but it also strengthens its ability to impose its conditions and transfer its risks to SMEs, which are the first to suffer the impact of increased volatility and uncertainty. I would like to conclude by adding that the financial asphyxiation of SMEs is also due to stagnant demand and the lack of prospects for recovery in many countries, especially on the European periphery. I stress that economic policy must be moved away from financial interests because, if not, we will continue to suffer from great macroeconomic instability, a lack of growth that will hinder access to SME credit and thereby job creation and much-needed growth for Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2235, "date": "2015-10-28.json", "name": "Margot Parker", "mepid": "124945", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, the discussion this evening reminds me of the old adage, ‘Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime’.

SMEs are the backbone of our economy: they represent over 99% of businesses and help provide millions of jobs and deliver crucial services to our citizens. To ensure that the long-term prosperity and growth of SMEs is not stifled, we must put SMEs at the heart of all future decisions and we must ensure that harmful, costly and bureaucratic legislation is repealed.

More innovative instruments were mentioned: COSME, Horizon, venture capital. Europe really does a lot for SMEs here. Yes, and we also have the Capital Markets Union in front of our chests. But here really isn't all the gold that shines. Facilitation for securitisation – okay, air-to-IP facilitation is good. But all of this is only really profitable after certain sales limits, starting from a hundred million. Unfortunately, companies are hardly interested in these new instruments. Traditional credit financing still counts. But what is the ECB doing, what is the Commission doing with the large remainder of the medium-sized companies that rely on this credit financing? Commissioner, there will be 150 new data sets for loans starting at EUR 25 000. AnaCredit is a nightmare for every medium-sized company, for every Volksbank, for every savings bank. And the review of credit collateral, the questioning of real estate as collateral, and the distrust of SME loans – that is, what is now going on in the review of the Basel 3 criteria – is not progress either. All these things would really be a step backwards for the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises. I therefore really ask that we proceed very carefully on these matters.

The European Commission needs to step up its work in this area. Small and medium-sized enterprises need to be helped to become more independent of the need for bank debt. Conditions must be created for better access to finance in the form of grants and loans or loan guarantees. SMEs should be assisted in their efforts to improve access to markets around the world and look for ways to reduce the risk of economic activity. It is necessary to simplify procedures for access to financial instruments, to introduce clear and comprehensible eligibility criteria.

In Latvian we have such a saying — ar threads nav aršanas. If we think about business, all of us who have been entrepreneurs know that without funding you cannot develop a business.  In the EU, small and medium-sized enterprises employ more than 90% of all workers. In fact, SMEs are the backbone of our economy. If we want our economy to develop, we need small and medium-sized entrepreneurs to grow. Where's the difficulty? The difficulty is that, for 75% of their funding, small and medium-sized enterprises depend on bank loans. But the banks now, especially after the crisis, do not want to give this money, and those loans are becoming more and more expensive.  So what can we do to help our small businesses? I think two main things need to be done. Firstly, access to bank loans needs to be improved. But secondly and very importantly, we need to help small and medium-sized enterprises find non-bank financing through such investment mechanisms in their share capital through venture capital and capital market mechanisms.

It should therefore be the Union's task to create appropriate instruments and to encourage Member States and the banking sector to look for ways to solve this problem. It is worth noting that the lack of convenient funding limits the expansion of our region's companies within the common market and makes the introduction of new standards at European level a threat to their existence on a case-by-case basis.

If, on the one hand, taxes are paid for profits and wages, then we must also be prepared to invest in the risk that small and medium-sized enterprises have to bear. Ultimately, 60% of liquidity problems arise from late payments. In this respect, I would like to ask Commissioner Dombrovskis, in particular, for us to analyse the European Union and the European Union's budget, as is also the way in which late payments are made in research programmes and in many other areas. I do not want to know how many SMEs have already gone bankrupt, because the bureaucratic rules and the administrative procedures are so complicated that small and medium-sized enterprises do not get their liquidity and therefore do not do so. I would also like to point out that the Joint Research Centre has now carried out a study on tax incentivs, which should lead to more equity capital of private individuals also in the companies.

Bank credits, for example, are not relevant to many entrepreneurs because of excessive interest, the European Commission's survey on access to finance shows. This is what 22% of Slovenian entrepreneurs believe, while the European Union average is 11%, while in Finland and Sweden only 1% of entrepreneurs think so.

So while in previous decades small and medium-sized enterprises have created thousands of jobs, they have started to shrink as an industry because of memoranda, fiscal adjustment and austerity, which have reduced demand and consumption. Moreover, both in Greece and in the rest of Europe, access to banking credit for small and medium-sized enterprises is deteriorating, while there are wide divergences in bank lending between large and small enterprises. Unfortunately, the European Union does not have sufficient resources to finance small and medium-sized enterprises, to support and support their exports and to access credit through cooperative banks.

First, capital markets union (CMU) should not be seen as in competition or contradiction with a strong banking system. Banks have strong local relationships and knowledge about micro, small and medium—sized enterprises. Bank lending will remain the principal source of external finance for SMEs. The measures provided for in the Capital Markets Union Action Plan will not interfere with, or detract from, local banking networks. On the contrary, CMU provides for measures that will strengthen the banking system. It seeks to make it easier for banks to refinance their traditional lending business by selling securities and bonds to the capital markets. The larger and more efficient funding market for banks will help them, including the local relationship banks, to focus on their core business, notably lending to micro-businesses and SMEs. There are, however, Member States where bank loans are difficult to obtain. There are also companies – start—ups with limited physical collateral or firms in an expansion phase – whose needs may not always be catered for by the banks. CMU proposes a way to help firms in these situations to raise funding through other channels. CMU will complement, rather than compete with, bank finance by adding to the diversity of funding sources.  By promoting more diverse funding channels and reducing Europe’s dependency on banks, CMU should increase the resilience of the financial system. Nevertheless, we also need to be alert to financial stability risks that may emerge as a result of efforts to further develop Europe’s capital markets. Recent measures, such as the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), the Alternative Investment Funds Managers Directive (AIFMD), the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) and the Securities Financing Transactions Regulation, will make capital markets more transparent, well-regulated and robust. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will play an important role in ensuring consistent implementation and application of these laws.  As markets develop, it will be important to ensure that any risks associated with the deepening of capital-market-based financing are monitored and mitigated. Work is underway, within the EU and internationally, to improve understanding and monitoring of systemic risks. The Commission will examine the need for changes to the macroprudential framework in the context of the forthcoming review of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and, if it appears necessary, will allow for effective intervention to contain and mitigate risks arising from market—based finance.  Let me conclude today by saying that it is my pleasure to continue discussions with you on ongoing issues in relation to SMEs’ access to finance, which are important for all of us. Improving access to finance for SMEs is one of the mainstays of the implementation of the Commission’s strategy for growth and jobs.

SMEs are one of the main employers and are at the heart of communities across Europe. Therefore, what is required are policies that will enable SMEs to grow, create local employment and as a result circulate money into our economy. Europe can not only provide practical financial assistance to companies, but it can also enable Member States to capitalise on the positive aspects which membership of the European Union brings. It is quite clear that Europe does provide opportunities to open up lucrative export markets for our SME sector. Huge opportunities exist in Europe to support our SME sector.

Since the beginning of the crisis, the Commission has launched several initiatives to facilitate credit for SMEs. These include the SUPPORTING Factor PMI in the regulation of capital requirements, which allows banks to take advantage of a capital discount factor to be set aside for SME financing and the EU Passport to increase confidence in European SMEs.  Recently, the Commission stated that it wanted to activate measures to support SMEs within the Capital Markets Union. However, these initiatives seem to be disjointed and also do not seem to have had the desired effect given the persistent difficulties of European SMEs in accessing credit.  It would therefore be appropriate for the Commission to launch an overall impact assessment of EU financial regulation to assess its impact on European SMEs. It would also be appropriate for the Commission to assess the benefits achieved with the instruments used so far and to look for new forms of financing alternative to the classic banking channel - such as peer to peer lending and crowdfunding.
