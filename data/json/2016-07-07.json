[{"id": 0, "date": "2016-07-07.json", "name": "Helga Stevens", "mepid": "125105", "text": "  Rapporteur. – To this day, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is the only international convention on human rights that has been ratified by the European Union as a whole. In addition, it is important to note that all EU Member States have signed the Treaty and that 27 Member States have ratified it. So there is a very strong political support for this treaty politically. The treaty is considered the first human rights treaty of this century, the 21st century. The treaty is legally binding and the European Union must now take action to fully implement it. All legislation, both in the future and in the past, must be fully in line with the UN Convention and ensure full and equal participation of persons with disabilities in society, including at European level. The UN Convention does not give new or additional rights to persons with disabilities, but explicitly clarifies that persons with disabilities can also claim fundamental rights that have already been written down in other treaties, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other international treaties. I am really proud to have been able to involve a record number of committees in my report, from the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Legal Affairs and Development To the Committee on Petitions. This proves that disability is not just a social issue, but a theme that permeates all aspects of life. Remember that this UN convention is a human rights treaty. We are therefore talking here about the human rights of people with disabilities. In the spirit of the treaty and of the slogan of the movement of people with disabilities, namely \"Nothing about us without us\", I wrote my report together with organizations of and for people with disabilities. From the outset, I have been able to consult constructively with the European Disability Forum and its members. I would therefore like to thank the organisations and individuals who have supported me very much. Representatives of those organisations sit above in the public gallery. I would very much like to give them a round of applause, because they tirelessly continue to claim their rights as persons with disabilities in our society [applause], a society that does not always take them into account and which does not always understand the obstacles faced by people with disabilities every day. I would like to reiterate and stress that people with disabilities should not be treated as second-class citizens in Europe. They must enjoy the same rights to live and work in the EU, just as citizens without disabilities. The European institutions must lead by example. Employees with disabilities should be supported so that they have equal access to work and occupation. Citizens with disabilities should also have equal access to public information and events in the European Parliament and other institutions. We cannot ask the Member States to apply the treaty if we do not do it ourselves. I look forward to working with my colleagues here and in other institutions to ensure that the rights of people with disabilities are respected and taken seriously throughout Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1, "date": "2016-07-07.json", "name": "Rosa Estaràs Ferragut (PPE)", "mepid": "96811", "text": "  drafts member of the Committee on Petitions. – Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate Mrs Helga Stevens for having produced this report. It is the first Treaty of International Law, on Human Rights, which is signed by the European Union and ratified as a whole and is therefore part of the EU's own legal order. In August last year, the United Nations prepared concluding observations on the fulfilment by Member States and the Union itself of all the parameters of this Convention. This Convention is not the end, it is the principle of consolidating the principle of equality of all the rights of persons with disabilities. Many comments were made in them, basically around the European Union's need to harmonize all its legislation in order to get in line with the Convention. Comments were also made on accessibility, access to justice and, ultimately, a principle of equality and diversity that enriches us all. The European Union has to be a leader in these issues and that is why I repeatedly call for the unblocking of the Non-Discrimination Directive, which needs to be adopted and which has been blocked for many years in the Council. The Accessibility Directive, as regards the labour market, with reasonable adjustments, as well as education, is also concerned. And I end up calling for respect for difference and acceptance of people with disabilities as part of diversity and the human condition.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-07-07.json", "name": "Marianne Thyssen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Stevens, for her report on the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The UN Convention has set the gold standard for the full and equal participation of people with disabilities in society. Its implementation on the ground requires a joint effort by all the European Union institutions and Member States, and also the involvement of people with disabilities. We have achieved good results so far but, as we all know, much remains to be done. That is also why I welcome your comprehensive and valuable recommendations. While I cannot be exhaustive here, I would like to address some of the key issues raised in your report. Significant inequalities persist regarding the participation and opportunities of people with disabilities in our society and our economy. Your report refers, notably, to access to employment, education and social protection. Indeed, across the Union, the employment rate for people with a disability is around 48%. Only 27.8% have completed third-level education and one-third are at risk of poverty or social exclusion. This Commission is committed to job creation and employment opportunities for all people. We are working to ensure that European legislation prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of disability in employment is fully implemented. That includes the obligation for employers – public or private – to make the necessary adaptations enabling all to work on an equal basis. Our efforts are backed up by our financial instruments, in particular the European Social Fund, which is worth EUR 86 billion. Thanks to the European Parliament, Member States must reserve at least 20% for social inclusion. Many impressive projects show how people with disabilities can be supported to find work and enabled fully to enjoy their rights in society. European funds can – and should – be used for supporting conditions for independent living. In order for Member States to access these funds, we have introduced as a pre-condition that they demonstrate their administrative capacity to implement and apply the UN Convention. In addition, only actions which help to establish the conditions for independent living should be supported. Empowering people with disabilities means that they should not live in institutions. So far, EUR 3.1 billion has been allocated by Member States to social infrastructure. This should contribute to our goal of transition from institutional care to community-based services. Our 2010-2020 European Disability Strategy aims for a barrier-free Europe. Free movement is a basic right in the EU and persons with disabilities should not be excluded from it – either in their local living environment or when traveling abroad. That is why the Commission is currently implementing, with eight Member States, a pilot project on the European Disability Card. The card will allow people with disabilities to access certain benefits in the areas of culture, leisure, transport and sport on the same conditions as nationals of the countries concerned with disabilities. The Commission has made over EUR 1.5 million available in support. To break down barriers in the daily lives of people with disabilities I have put forward – and presented here in plenary in December 2015 – a legislative proposal for a European Accessibility Act. I am happy to report that there has been good progress in the Council under the Dutch Council Presidency and I am counting on the Slovak Presidency to keep up the pace. I am confident that you will also contribute to reaching an agreement on this important proposal in due time. The European Accessibility Act aims to improve the functioning of the internal market by harmonising accessibility requirements in the European Union, but it will also serve as a catalyst for social inclusion, by giving people with disabilities access to everyday products and services. To be crystal clear, this is about putting the internal market at the service of people. The concluding observations of the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities provide the EU with important guidance. They highlight the positive aspects as well as gaps and difficulties in terms of implementation. The Commission is committed to following up on the recommendations. We are currently preparing a progress report on the implementation of our 2010-2020 European Disability Strategy. It will be published before the end of this year. Your report provides practical and useful input. We are also analysing the numerous contributions received during the public consultation on the strategy, which was carried out earlier this year. I would also like to highlight the fact that the outline for a European Pillar of Social Rights, which I proposed in March of this year, includes a principle, No 16, on disability. I am therefore glad to use this opportunity to invite you all to contribute to the ongoing consultation. As to the recommendations specifically underlined by the UN Committee, the Commission also announced its intention to withdraw from the European Monitoring Framework and has stopped participating in the meetings of the Framework. We are currently in the process of legally formalising this action and we are also advancing in preparing a list of legal acts, which will complement the EU Declaration of Competences attached to the Council decision for concluding the Convention. Reading your report confirmed my conviction that we share a joint commitment and we should work together towards achieving these goals. I agree that the EU itself should make sure that we set an example by being a disability-inclusive organisation in line with the Convention. We need to look at our own institutions and pay attention to our own employees with disabilities by providing the support and protection that they and their families need, and by ensuring the accessibility of our own venues. We need to act on our commitments in consultation with, and with the participation of, organisations representing persons with disabilities. As was highlighted in your report, we continue to provide financial support for organisations representing a variety of disabilities at European level, and to work on a daily basis with them. They contribute significantly to the proper implementation and monitoring of the Convention at European and national levels. In the end, we all share the objective of a Europe where all people can fully enjoy their human rights and fundamental freedoms.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2016-07-07.json", "name": "Martina Anderson", "mepid": "113959", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. – Mr President, the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is exactly the sort of thing that the EU institutions should be working on. I want to commend the rapporteur and the other MEPs who were working on this file, and I look forward to working with them in the future. I am happy that the institutions of the EU have acknowledged their shortcomings in relation to persons with disabilities. However, I am unhappy at the fact that the much-talked-about replacement to David Cameron, Theresa May, has wedded herself to repealing the Human Rights Act – the Act which gives us access to the European Convention on Human Rights. That will damage those who are trying to get access to those rights for people with a disability. I want to say that I and my party, Sinn Féin, as a delegation here in the GUE/NGL Group, will challenge that if it is the outcome of the contest that is taking place at the moment, because we cannot have a situation where persons with a disability are denied access to the European Convention on Human Rights.

So it is now in the Action Plan on democracy and human rights and I welcome that, but I would like to see the Special Representative on Human Rights, human rights dialogues with third countries and country strategy papers on human rights, really champion the Convention and champion the rights of people with disabilities in terms of Europe’s influence worldwide.  Secondly, I say to our friend Ms Thyssen – and I think we will be working even more closely in the next period – do not just do what you would have done anyway in the Disability Strategy. You and your colleagues do some good things and we support you in doing it, but the Convention is a different legal obligation for us in the European Union and we have to show that we are acting differently because of that legal obligation, and not simply redress what we would have done anyway, and pretend it is to do with the Convention. We have to do better than that.  Finally, I was involved in the lobbying for the Convention. I am deeply proud of that and people with disabilities were there, and their organisations, it was fantastic, but when the review came out, the Commission did not undertake a formal consultation with people with disabilities and their organisations – they did informally but not formally. I want to ask you, when it comes to the next review conference, every time you send a delegation to the UN to discuss the Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, to involve disabled people, involve disabled people’s organisations – nothing about us without us. I know you say those words.

We must ensure that the implementation plan of Agenda 2030, the Paris climate agreement and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction is being carried out in line with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. We also have to take into account the pledge to leave no one behind, which is in the remit of Agenda 2030. Disabled people suffer disproportionately during crisis situations. This is especially true for disabled women and girls. Their empowerment to become actors in humanitarian crisis situations is a step towards ensuring that their needs are also addressed. I would like to highlight the importance of giving support to the organisation and participation of persons with disabilities in the process of drafting legislation in partner countries. This would be an efficient way of ensuring respect for their rights, and civil society is particularly important in this respect.  Finally, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is central in working towards ‘Nothing About Us Without Us’ and this must equally be fulfilled in EU external action.

Freedom of movement for European citizens is a fundamental right that is actually denied to almost 80 million of our citizens and they cannot be equally involved in our society and culture, but also tourism, which is also an important economic branch of the European Union. In our report, we highlighted several facts on which the Commission, the Council, parliament and in fact the whole of European society should work together.  Thus, one intermodality of transport that enables, in addition to new technologies, the development of new jobs, the development of new services and jobs not only for citizens of the European Union who are employed today, but also for people with disabilities who can thus participate equally as members of society. The European Disability Card is a project for all Member States to accept.  And that is why I urge the Commission and the Council to incorporate precisely these values into any future amendments to directives and regulations to encourage Member States that today still have too large barriers in public transport, in tourism, in inaccessible to all those cultural and artistic facilities where people with disabilities and persons with reduced mobility should participate as should all other citizens of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2016-07-07.json", "name": "Silvia Costa", "mepid": "96917", "text": "  Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth, the Media and Sport. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is very important that we adopt this report today on monitoring the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in the European Union, which, I would remind you, is binding and is an integral part of the Union's legal order. It provides not only, in Article 3, for the prohibition of all forms of discrimination but, in Article 21, the right to education, inclusive training, cultural and civic life, sport and creative activities. And it is not acceptable that, even today, in many education systems in some Member States, the realities of school and training segregation, the rejection of students with disabilities and also the lack of family support services, guidance and educational support persist, which, I would remind you, must be personalised and implemented throughout life.  In this regard, I would like to point out – and I am very pleased about this – that next year in Italy we will be celebrating the 40th anniversary of the law that has included handicapped children in all schools of all levels. Of course, there is still much to be done, but this is an important fact. We call in our opinion – which has been taken on board and I thank the rapporteur very much for this – that the European mobility and educational and voluntary exchange programmes be open to disabled boys and girls and that the financial support already provided for in the Erasmus+ programme be strengthened.  Access for disabled people to communication, culture and information technologies appropriate to different disabilities is also crucial, and we call for the Marrakesh Treaty to be transposed for the blind. It is absolutely necessary to define the structured dialogue with representative associations and to involve them already in the formulation of implementation policies and the Convention from the Accessibility Act.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2016-07-07.json", "name": "Heidi Hautala", "mepid": "2054", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. – Mr President, it is my pleasure to speak on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs. It is important to note that that committee also adopted its opinion in full unanimity. So we all agree how important it is that the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities will be fully implemented and that all EU and Member State legislation will be brought into line with the Convention. This requires a thorough evaluation of all EU legislation. I want specifically to highlight the importance of access to justice. Access to justice is not just about fair legislation: it is about legal procedures which must be adjusted to the needs of persons with disabilities, inter alia through EU judicial training programmes. There must also be an individual and tailor—made complaint mechanism to ensure that all the rights encompassed in the Convention are provided not just on paper but in reality.

Of the 80 million women and men with disabilities, half of them women - almost 46 million, which makes up 16% of the population of the European Union - and I would like to refer in this second shift especially to them.  They face multiple discrimination—women and girls—often face many obstacles in order to exercise their rights; they undoubtedly have a much greater risk of violence, injury, exploitation and ill-treatment and are therefore often in more vulnerable conditions.  There is no doubt that their access to employment and education is also more difficult. If we compare the employment rates of women without disabilities and women with disabilities there is also an abyss; also in their access to education, for which we demand in these concluding observations an inclusive education, an education for all.  In this case, the committee's concluding observations are very clear: they call for the gender perspective to be considered in all areas in which the Union works and, in particular, in the disability strategy and the gender equality strategy.

This report is of historic importance because the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was ratified by the EU in 2010, the first of the various UN conventions. In 2015, we reached the point where the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities sent the EU final conclusions with strong proposals. Today, the European Parliament is debating and voting on this subject. On behalf of the European People's Party, I was able to work very well with the reporting woman. The report points out that the scope of crpd principles is much broader than the issue of discrimination. I would like to draw attention to the importance of digital techniques, as they facilitate social inclusion for persons with disabilities, including assistive technologies.  I regret that a disproportionate number of people with disabilities in Europe do not yet have access to the Internet and therefore are missing information and opportunities. The unemployment rate among persons with disabilities, especially women, is extremely high and it is therefore necessary to go beyond the framework of protected employment and create employment conditions for people with disabilities that introduce them into the open labour market. Finally, on education: I am convinced that equal opportunities can only be achieved if the conditions for inclusive education must be ensured in all areas, including the different types of education and training and lifelong learning. If we provide these, then the change will be truly noticeable. That's what we all work for.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 11, "date": "2016-07-07.json", "name": "Vilija Blinkevičiūtė", "mepid": "96681", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Dear colleagues, Commissioner, first of all, I sincerely thank the rapporteur for the excellent report and for our close cooperation for people with disabilities, and I am pleased that this cooperation has led us to strengthen certain aspects of the report which are very important for people with disabilities. And indeed, in the report, we are now paying more attention and highlighting those employment problems for people with disabilities and the obstacles they face and hindering their entry into the labour market. And indeed, one of the most important persistent problems is discrimination against people with disabilities in the workplace. We must combat this, and I congratulate both the European Parliament and the European Commission on taking certain steps to strengthen the protection of persons with disabilities against discrimination in all countries of the European Union. However, we still have a long way to go to make jobs in the Member States truly accessible to people with disabilities, and also to create working conditions that enable people with disabilities to work. We must also ensure equal access for people with disabilities to education and vocational training. All these aspects are essential to create real conditions for people with disabilities to work and live as independently as possible, to realize themselves in the professional field, and thus to contribute to society. I therefore agree that we must call on the Member States to grant employers certain tax incentives and other incentives to actually employ people with disabilities. And of course this is only one of the incentives, but states need to take full advantage of them, the opportunities available to encourage the employment of people with disabilities. Another very important area that I want to draw attention to is social protection for people with disabilities. Social state support for people with disabilities, whose employment rates are indeed low, often becomes the only source of livelihood. Without social assistance in the European Union, as many as 70% of people with disabilities would live on the brink of poverty. The United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities stresses in particular the negative impact of indiscriminate austerity measures on the social protection of persons with disabilities. After all, austerity has indeed been made first and foremost at the expense of the most vulnerable people. We must therefore correct this, adopt specific measures in the Member States to improve social security for persons with disabilities.  And one more thing I want to draw attention to, all the more so because the honourable Commissioner is here. The Commission is late in the 2010-2020 a mid-term review of the European Disability Strategy. Indeed, I believe that that mid-term review would be of great use to those decisions that we need to take both at European Union level and in individual Member States, because we will simply know then the real situation of our disabled people.

It needs to be strengthened so that people with disabilities can actually work and those companies do not go bankrupt. But here is one side. The other side is that not only people with disabilities in social enterprises can work in social enterprises, but also in the overall labour market, so that employers have an interest in recruiting people with disabilities in the open labour market.

This number makes us aware of the great challenges, how much responsibility and how much work still lies ahead. It is said that the measure of modern civilization is its attitude towards people with disabilities. Another motto is also known: there is no disabled person, there is a man. It is therefore our sacred duty to ensure that persons with disabilities have an inalienable right to dignity, the right to equal treatment, independent living and full participation in family and social life, and to ensure the development of the capacity of children with disabilities and their right to complete integration into school.  But we must also bear in mind very important issues: the disabled do not need comfort, only understanding, they do not need pity, only genuine respect, nor do they need extra legal solutions, only legal guarantee of equal opportunities and equal treatment.

Today we are discussing Parliament’s response to the CRPD concluding observations as to how we are implementing the Convention, and in this context I want to thank our colleague, Helga Stevens, who has been an excellent rapporteur.  So what is Parliament saying? Well, the process of drawing up the document was as important as its content, and in that context people with disabilities were involved in all committee meetings which were accessible. So the phrase ‘nothing about us without us’ was taken seriously by the rapporteur. We also see that the principle of stakeholder consultation is woven right throughout this report. The report takes a rights-based approach and in order to vindicate those rights we need adequate legislation. We already have anti-discrimination in the area of employment and occupation etc. but we need to find some solution to the fact that the anti-discrimination directive which would ensure equal treatment outside the labour market is stuck in Council. Our role here is as legislators, as is that of the Commission, and in that context we have to ensure that all legislation is disability-proofed – both current and future regulation. In this context also I want to agree with my colleague Richard Howitt when he asks the Commissioner to go above and beyond what is already in the pipeline.  The rights of persons with disabilities must be mainstreamed in our work here; it must never be an add-on. Once we have that mind-set, I believe we are on the right road. There are excellent proposals in this report but I shall just highlight three which I think are of crucial importance.

However, it can be left on paper if it is not fully implemented. And that's where the problems start.

While, for the implementation of the UN Convention it \"raises its hands high\" and refers to the Member States, in other matters it appears combative when, for example, it is going to put forward tough budgetary measures. For the contract it declares not competent. I shout, with all my might, that the rights of people with disabilities outside the common European policy must be an incentive to create this common policy.  I call on the Commission, on this sensitive issue, to stop hiding behind the institutional deficits of the European Union. To take new legislative initiatives to ensure the universal and uniform application of the Convention in all Member States. The implementation of the Convention is a 100% political issue. If the European Union wants to become a real Union, it must not hesitate to implement it fully, even if changes to the Treaties, new legislation and new funding resources are needed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 19, "date": "2016-07-07.json", "name": "Tatjana Ždanoka", "mepid": "28619", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mrs Stevens for her really great job. We have a very useful and well—balanced report which focuses on those recommendations that fall only within the EU’s competence and pays special attention to the EU institutions, which are to be a role model in implementing the Convention. The Commission and the Member States have to take the necessary measures to mainstream disability in all legislation, policies and strategies. All persons with disabilities are entitled to full participation in society and support from publicly funded systems. We therefore have reasonable concerns that the European structural and investment funds are being misused to promote institutionalisation. Therefore it is extremely important that the report contains strong recommendations on spending, withdrawing and recovering payments if the obligation to respect the fundamental rights of persons with disabilities is breached. Being a long—standing member of the Committee on Petitions, I can confirm that a considerable number of petitions from persons with disabilities are submitted to the Parliament every year, demonstrating their difficulties with regard to access to work, employment, education, transport or participation in political, public and cultural rights.

You have had this merit, because the people with whom you have worked out this work are exactly the people who will benefit from it and will be able to say: 'We have entered these rooms, which very often keep us out'.  I am extremely pleased about this because the subject, as well as this subject, touches me closely and I am glad that our position is one of those times in which it is shared. It is sometimes strange to see that on certain issues Parliament has such shared positions when we seem so far apart from each other. Instead, the rights of people with disabilities must be a priority, a commitment, one that does not make discounts, that does not allow any kind of deprivation, that sees us committed and united in order to guarantee them.  Unfortunately, austerity and the economic crisis have, alas, placed a huge burden on people with disabilities. But we have talked about the need to support independent living, concepts that, unfortunately, are still far from being fully implemented in Italy today. In Italy it is still difficult to talk about care givers, de-institutionalization, support for independent living. May this be a commitment, let this be a starting point to be able to fully implement this convention in our country. Architectural barriers are still a reality, unfortunately, in schools and the first commitment is precisely to support education, to include children with disabilities in the world of education so that they become a resource.  People with disabilities must be an extraordinary resource, a resource for which our commitment must be worth whatever effort we must make. This work, I think, is proof that no commitment is ever enough when it comes to people who are not vulnerable. We are used to thinking of these people as if they were vulnerable.

Mr President, this report on the implementation of the Convention on Persons with Disabilities signed with the United Nations is obviously a problem. On the form, it is part of the first and only agreement signed with the United Nations, with this anomaly that, 28 Member States having already signed, the European level is supernumerary. On the form again, the multiplicity of commissions consulted makes the final text totally inaudible. On the merits, the systematization of the criterion of subjectivity of disability, by definition vague and unvaluable, is in total contradiction with certain national laws, including French law, which recognises that the handicap, admittedly suffered, is above all a functional and objective deficit, which is the indispensable condition for a fair regal regal compensation. In substance, this text also multiplies the commonplaces not only in that it admits disabled people of all categories, but also in that it considers as victims of discrimination children, women, the elderly, the sick, migrants, the poor and LGBTI people, which, de facto, determines that the only standard for you would be a young man , healthy, rich, sedentary, in full possession of his intellectual and physical means and heterosexual. It is not me who says it, it is the exact mirror of your right-of-hommist discourse. So I'll let you think.

Unfortunately, however, not all disabled people enjoy the same rights in the European Union and the situation is not the same in all the countries of the Union. Unfortunately, my country, Greece, has been a very negative example in this area, especially since the economic crisis for which the Union is not without responsibility has broken out.  Memorandum obligations and economic cuts did not exclude disabled people. Reductions in disability pensions, the abolition of tax relief, deliberate reductions in disability rates by committees, the difficulty of access to high-cost medicines and access to the national health system, the lack of qualified teaching staff, the under-functioning of educational institutions, reductions in the salaries and pensions of parents with disabled children, have brought these individuals and their families to despair. The biggest victims of the economic crisis are the disabled in Greece.

I welcome this report. It brings us a step closer to achieving equal rights and opportunities for people with disabilities. It highlights amongst other things elements related to employment and education, which are particularly important if we are to help people achieve independence and realise their full potential. I especially encourage further development of incentives for employers who offer jobs to people with disabilities. Opportunities need to be created so that everyone can become as independent as possible and participate in all domains of life. If these issues are not addressed, they will only result in greater social exclusion and poverty and we cannot allow that. I believe that limited access to education for individuals with disabilities is bound to have a negative impact later on in their lives and limit the choices and possibilities at a later stage. So I call for provisions that will help people with disabilities participate in courses which will enhance their competences and skills, including participation in apprenticeships. There is still a lot that needs to be done, but we must remember that one—size—fits—all solutions are not the answer. We need to focus on the diversity of problems that people with disabilities face on a daily basis.  Finally, the European Union should act as a beacon in promoting the rights of persons with disabilities. We have made big strides at EU level in this regard, and I am proud of that, but unfortunately disregard for the rights of – as well as discrimination against – people with disabilities are still felt within the EU despite the fact that they are all embedded in our Treaties.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 26, "date": "2016-07-07.json", "name": "Marita Ulvskog (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "96672", "text": "   Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Welcome, Commissioner.

It is against this background that the European Parliament's proposals to comply with anti-discrimination legislation and to meet the requirements for a European Accessibility Act should also be seen. In order for this to become a reality, more hard facts are needed about the living conditions of the disabled. Above all, a broader and deeper commitment is needed from all Member States. A concrete proposal that we could implement at European level is to open up existing EU programmes for citizens with disabilities, such as the Erasmus+ programme. In the field of employment, there are, of course, a number of incentive and support programmes in terms of the conditions and establishment of people with disabilities. It is not enough, but it is important that it exists, because this often means that other non-disabled people have better and more human health and safety at work. So we all serve as citizens of society or as employees of a company. We all benefit from a community building that assumes that everyone has rights and that everyone is needed.

The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities aims to combat discrimination and social racism against such persons. In Europe there are currently 80 million people with disabilities, of whom around 46 million are women and girls. At the same time, the participation and access of people with disabilities to the labour market is particularly problematic, as within the Union only about 48% work, while only 27.8% have completed higher education studies.  Moreover, in countries such as Greece, the troika has greatly reduced disability pensions, leading people with disabilities even further to social exclusion and making their standard of living more difficult.

Poverty is an obstacle to access to basic needs such as nutrition, health care and water, and these factors, in turn, can lead to disability. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is clear in addressing this problem. However, our foreign policy and, above all, trade further impoverishes developing countries by undermining, interlessing, public services and thus undermining fundamental human rights. We must help strengthen public services in developing countries, especially health and education, and not undermine them by seeking the profit of our businesses. Only in this way, with quality public services, early medical care and less inequality, we will be addressing the real problems of people with disabilities in the world.

At the outset, I would like to congratulate you on a great report and the commitment of a wide representation of people with disabilities, and thank you for your excellent cooperation. I share the view that accessibility is as important in the physical environment as it is in relation to information and communication technologies. Digital skills or the use of modern technologies are becoming an indispensable precondition for the functioning of the labour market, so the availability of technologies and equipment and the promotion of employment-friendly skills education are crucial for building an inclusive society in which all citizens can exercise their rights and contribute to the common good. New technologies, while an opportunity to remove barriers, can also be a source of limitations. The widespread introduction of touch screens prevents visually impaired people from using elevators and many other devices on their own. Can a solution that leads to the exclusion of a large group of citizens be called modern? Certainly not.

Thirdly, Mr Becker referred to sport and I agree completely with him: Paralympics, Special Olympics, do fantastic work for people with disabilities. I had the honour, when I was president of the GAA, of hosting the Special Olympics in Croke Park a few years ago and the result of that is that we have such wonderful movements as the Kerrys Stars.

This issue already affects 80 and soon more than 100 million people in the EU.

Mr President, people with disabilities are the most sensitive and often the most neglected and wronged group of any society, especially the Greek one, which suffers from the consequences of the memorandums. Despite the big mouth about protecting human rights, the European Union is not pressuring lenders to exclude from austerity measures the funds allocated to people with disabilities. With few exceptions, people with disabilities are sensitive people, have good character and love everyone else, and they grieve because we, who are able to do so, do not care to the extent that we can and should for them.  So first as people and then as citizens it is necessary to press the state to take care of people with disabilities, to make sure that they integrate them into society, to educate them, to find them a job and to enable them to develop their qualifications in order to thrive. In addition, these individuals want our support.

There are more than 80 million people with varying degrees of disability living in the Member States of the European Union, of whom only 58% are in the labour market. Among women with disabilities, the employment rate is downright alarmingly low, at 44%. It is therefore very clear that a significant proportion of people with disabilities remain outside the labour market and that those who have employment largely do not make full use of their competences and skills.  In order to tackle the demographic problems facing Europe and maintain the current standard of living, all the labour resources at our disposal, including people with disabilities, will have to be fully exploited. Social economy and the new technology sector make disability very often no longer a significant obstacle to work. There are still barriers in our heads. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was intended to help us change the perception of people with disabilities. However, practice shows that there is still a huge problem with this. I do not understand why the Council did not agree to include disability documents within the scope of the Regulation on the recognition of public documents.

I have heard a great deal of congratulations here with regard to the rapporteur and the rapporteurs of the various committees that have contributed to this report, and I would like to reiterate my support. This is an excellent report. I would also like to thank you all for today's constructive discussion. I would also like to point out that there has been excellent cooperation between the three political European institutions to conduct dialogue with the United Nations Committee. This too is proof that there is a real common will to make progress on the application of the UN convention. Today's discussion has shown that there is indeed a strong commitment to apply and implement the Treaty, to respond to the challenges we have faced in giving people with disabilities, men and women, the full opportunity to exercise their fundamental rights, their human rights. We must not forget, as you rightly pointed out in the report and as Mr Howitt also pointed out, that this is indeed a human rights issue that goes beyond social law, employment and social policy. Only by ensuring a coherent application through the various political policy areas will we be able to effectively shape our commitments. A lot of specific questions and comments have been made. It is leading us too far and there is no time to go into it in detail, but this is nevertheless the case: the accessibility bill, which as you know is pending in Parliament and in the Council, is making reasonably good progress in the Council. I hope that this proposal will continue to work hard in Parliament, so that it can reach conclusions quickly. With regard to the pending proposal for a horizontal directive against discrimination against people with disabilities, you know that at the beginning of this legislature the new Commission withdrew a number of proposals that had been pending for a long time in the context of good governance. However, we have not withdrawn this proposal, because it is precisely the Commission that attaches great importance to it. Moreover, Mr Jourová continues to urge the Council to make further progress so that this proposal can eventually become law. Another specific question concerned the Marrakesh Convention on Copyright. In this context too, you know that a proposal is pending and that we hope that the Council will eventually act properly so that we can work effectively with it. A question has also been asked in the interventions of the \"catch the eye\" procedure on the funding of the Paralympics. I will be happy to keep in touch with Mr Becker and Kelly to inform me exactly about the state of play so that we can see what we can do. You know that the budget is a complex matter, but I would like to listen in more detail to the concerns to see if we can do something. I would also like to say something about the involvement of civil society. I want to assure you that I attach great importance to this, and so do the people in the gallery. We attach great importance to the input of people with disabilities and to good, permanent contacts, almost on a daily basis, with their organisations. We therefore welcome the alternative implementation report of the European Disability Forum. In preparing the Commission's report to the United Nations, there have been several meetings with the organisations. They have also been involved in the study that my services have commissioned in preparation for our report. We also convened the interested parties in the autumn of last year for a specific session devoted to the final remarks of the United Nations. Finally, the Commission has invited the supervisory structure, which includes the European Disability Forum, to join our delegation in Geneva for the evaluation of the United Nations in the summer of 2015. However, the supervisory structure has chosen to participate separately in this meeting. That is why she was not a direct member of our delegation. To conclude, I would like to point out that the comprehensive nature of Mrs Stevens' report is a great help in preparing our progress report on the European Strategy for People with Disabilities, on our mid-term review. It also certainly helps to make further efforts, which for my part go beyond our strategy for people with disabilities. The report encourages us to make further efforts to address the comments we have received from the Committee of the United Nations is really adequate to respond.

The involvement of people with disabilities was crucial during the whole process, and we should not forget that the Convention puts new obligations on the EU. I can only reiterate that freedom of movement, especially for workers, is also a right for people with disabilities and this also includes full and equal access to the Erasmus + programme. With regard to the exercise of political rights, this is just one example of where people with disabilities continue to be left out. Changes must be made so that people with disabilities can fully exercise their right to vote and to stand as candidates during elections. Again, I would like to mention the Disability Intergroup, who signed many amendments and were actively involved in the whole process of the report.

In Malawi alone, there have been 65 recorded violent incidents since 2014. A mixture of folklore and belief systems that openly stigmatizes the condition by association with omens and bad luck versus ideas of the magical healing powers of dismembered limbs has resulted in an extremely dangerous and hostile environment for those poor individuals with albinism. The associated social stigma has devastating consequences for employment prospects and access to health care, as well as often having adverse effects for the social standing of other family members. There is a clear need for educational programs and of course for efforts by the criminal justice authorities to bring those to justice who have carried out acts of violence attacking albinos.

This indicates a growing and real threat to the lives of this part of the population. National authorities must be more committed to protecting this vulnerable group, and to emphasise educating citizens and promoting the rights of people with albinism.

One such case is the persecution of people with affism in various African countries, notably Malawi. As you know very well, these unfortunate people are abused, attacked, socially excluded, mutilated, raped, prejudiced and murdered.  Because I am opposed to any discrimination based on race, gender, colour and specificities, I strongly condemn this racist behaviour of African governments and, above all, of the Government of Malawi towards people with affism. It is not acceptable for African governments, which complain about racism against Africans, to behave in a way that refuses others to behave.

Could we not in conjunction with United Nations organize major educational conferences in Malawi where we will be able to highlight to the people that their superstitions are groundless, baseless, and show them that albinos are the exact same as everyone else.

Madam President, I support the joint resolution which I too have co-signed. Discrimination against people suffering from leukopathy and violation of their rights is a frequent occurrence in many African countries, notably Malawi, which is one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world, with 50.7% of the population living below the poverty line. According to Malawi police, at least 65 incidents of violence against people suffering from leukopathy were recorded in 2014, of which 18 people were killed, while incidents of illegal trade in bones and body parts of these individuals are very common.  In the face of the ever-increasing repression of human rights in Malawi, the European Union should take immediate measures to protect people suffering from leukopathy and to condemn the murders and exploitation of these people. In addition, it should support equal access for these people to health care, education, and social and legal protection.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 74, "date": "2016-07-07.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Madam President, I share the surprise of our colleague any time that we hear people saying what the European Union should or should not do and then saying that it should not exist. I see that contradiction and actually see the contradiction of their sitting in this Hemicycle – that is probably the first contradiction they are living.  Anyway, I would like to thank you for this unanimous work on a very important issue. Over the past two years, Malawi has faced a very worrying increase in human rights abuses against people with albinism, including children. These abuses include violent attacks, as you have all described, abductions and killings. Such violence exposes very deep-rooted problems of discrimination against people with albinism across many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, not only in Malawi, but also in Tanzania, Mozambique, Burundi and other countries. On 13 June we marked International Albinism Awareness Day, which was proclaimed by the UN General Assembly. That was an important step to raise awareness, together with the recent appointment of the first-ever UN independent expert on the enjoyment of human rights by persons with albinism. We support this kind of global awareness steps, we actively support them and look forward to working together with the United Nations in this educational and awareness-raising campaign, not only Malawi but also in other countries.  In line with these international commitments we need to take all possible measures to provide greater protection to persons with albinism at risk and to investigate crimes committed on that basis. The prejudice at the root of these discriminations needs to be addressed and confronted very openly, so we constantly urge the governments of the countries where these attacks take place to raise awareness throughout society regarding persons with albinism, including at the family level, and to enforce respect for their rights and dignity.  Comprehensive strategies to eradicate discriminatory practices against persons with albinism are needed, including to ensure that they have adequate access to health care, social services, employment and education. This issue does not only relate to Malawi, as I said, but to many parts of Africa. It is then important that countries also share best practices in protecting and promoting the rights of persons with albinism and work together for the prevention of cross-border crimes related to this issue. The European Union, through our delegation, is working and will continue to engage with governments and with the civil-society actors in these countries. Some people believe that there is not much we can do to change social behaviour, prejudice, superstitions. I do not agree. Norms and attitudes can evolve if we embrace a cooperative approach to our partners, if we work together with them and try to change on a daily basis the roots of a behaviour that can and must be changed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 75, "date": "2016-07-07.json", "name": "Isabella Adinolfi (EFDD)", "mepid": "124831", "text": "  in writing.

Despite the international importance of the issue and the adoption of a number of laws in some of the countries concerned, killings, abductions and other forms of human rights violations do not seem to cease.

Discrimination can lead to lifelong traumas and psycho-social problems. People with albinism usually do not have sufficient health care or the right to education. Despite the international mediaisation of this problem and the adoption of new legislation, there are still very few people prosecuted and convicted and there are still criminal offences and torture. The greatest threat to people with albinism in Africa is widespread superstition about the special, magical abilities of their bodies that bring happiness, wealth, and health. This leads smugglers to hunt for albinos and then trade in their bodies. In 2015, there were 448 attacks on albinos in 25 African countries, and this is probably even lower than in reality, as the authorities do not systematically monitor and document such crimes.

It is, and it is a fundamental one, but it is also, as many of you mentioned, an issue that risks fuelling tensions in a region that definitely does not need further tensions. So, it is a human rights issue, but it is also an extremely serious geopolitical concern.  What can we do? First of all, what we have done already, because I’ve heard in this Chamber today suggestions or proposals. Let me remind you all –maybe you know already, but still a reminder may be needed today – that our EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Stavros Lambrinidis, visited Bahrain for the second time last year and had a comprehensive visit that allowed frank discussions on all issues and, in the follow-up of that visit, we established an EU—Bahrain Human Rights working group, that met for the first time this year, in April. So that kind of working relation on these issues, including all difficult issues we have on the table, is ongoing. If I have to assess whether that has brought results today, I have to say, obviously, that we are facing extremely difficult situations, but the suggestion of establishing a working group on these issues with them and having our human rights representative working and visiting the country constantly is there, as well as when it comes to statements and declarations – the last one I think we released just yesterday – to highlight our preoccupation and concern at the deterioration of the human rights situation in the country. So we are constantly working on this.  Many worrying pieces of news have come out of Bahrain recently, and you mentioned them all. Let me stress that this includes the ongoing judicial proceedings on the suspension of Al-Wefaq, the sentence against the Secretary—General, Ali Salman, as well as the re-arrest of Nabeel Rajab and measures preventing activists from travelling abroad. As I said, all this is worrying in itself, but it will also hamper national reconciliation in the Kingdom and will have a spillover effect in the whole region that is extremely relevant. So we expect these decisions to be reconsidered in a fair and transparent manner in full respect of Bahrain’s international obligations and its own internal constitution. We will continue to liaise closely with all EU Member States that are present in Manama to attend trials of prominent activists and advocate transparent judicial proceedings. On a number of occasions, such as during the visit of Stavros Lambrinidis, we have called for the release of those arrested in the context of peaceful political activities and we are constantly doing that. We know very well that speaking up on this is important from the EU side as such.  This is crucial, not only on the issue of human rights in itself, but it is also crucial – as was mentioned in one of the last interventions – to overcome the deep polarisation of the country itself. So, it would be beneficial for Bahrain itself, for its stability and its internal healthy societal development, to go in that direction. The EU, both in Brussels and through our delegation, will keep working to protect and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms. This is consistent with Bahrain’s international commitment, but also with the recommendation set out by the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry and the recommendations made during Bahrain’s Universal Periodic Review process. It is first and foremost, as I said, in Bahrain’s national interest to facilitate and support national reconciliation through a peaceful, inclusive reform process, as was mentioned, and as there were commitments during 2011. It is – and I would like to stress this – in regional and global, including European, interests to avoid new tensions arising in a region of the world that cannot afford further tensions. On the contrary, the region needs reconciliation and de-escalation of political confrontation and this is exactly the work that we doing on a daily basis, both speaking up and engaging quietly not only to promote human rights in the country, but also to avoid further tension in the region.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 97, "date": "2016-07-07.json", "name": "Monica Macovei (ECR)", "mepid": "96824", "text": "  in writing. – The human rights situation in Bahrain is getting worse by the day.

The recent arrest is part of a string of abuses against political dissidents, human rights activists and the opposition in general.

I will meet the President of Myanmar as well as other leaders of the region next week at the ASEM Summit, so this will again be part of our commitment and engagement with them.

On the occasion of the EU-Myanmar Human Rights Dialogue, our EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Stavros Lambrinidis, who is here with us today, visited Rakhine State to assess the situation and to advocate measures to improve human rights. As you know, we have also tabled a number of resolutions on the human rights situation in Myanmar in the UN General Assembly and in the UN Human Rights Council, with a strong focus on that.

I think that we need to support its efforts, which, as has been said many times here, should be directed towards the prevention of disputes, their active amicable resolution.  And the second area where the UN should certainly be involved and where it should have our support is the protection of human rights, the Charter of Human Rights, which contains a certain necessary minimum.

The fight against discrimination based on disability is also enshrined in the TFEU, and Articles 21 and 26 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights prohibit discrimination based on disability and provide for the equal participation of persons with disabilities in community life. On the basis of these important premises, the full inclusion of people with disabilities represents not only a right and a well-deserved benefit for those concerned, but also a resource for society as a whole, which can benefit from the value and different competences of these people. Their inclusion, regardless of a country's socio-economic, political or cultural situation, is not just about development, it is about human rights.

The founding legislation requires the Union to combat any form of discrimination on grounds of disability and confers on it the power to adopt legislation to address such discrimination. Moreover, our principles should go further than eliminating discrimination. Our actions must be aimed at creating an inclusive society in which people with specific abilities can be realised as equals to other citizens. The rapid uptake of digital and information technologies provides a wonderful opportunity to make easier use of the specific opportunities of people with disabilities, to better exercise their rights and freedoms, to lead independent and active lives.

Energy drinks have a high sugar and caffeine content and they are known to cause headaches, sleep problems and behavioural problems in young people who regularly consume them.

In recent years, we have seen an increase in protectionism among the Member States of the European Union. This is partly due to the economic crisis. This problem also affects trade in agri-food products, where non-tariff barriers against specific groups of exporters are increasing. We have already signalled the seriousness of this problem with various organisations. We have also taken various actions, including organising seminars and workshops in the European Parliament in June 2015 and February this year. At that time, we based, among other things, on a report by a recognized research company carried out as part of the project \"Single Europe – Varied Food\" conducted by the Federation of Agricultural Industry Associations, a member of the European organization Copa Cogeca. The report shows the increasing prevalence of non-tariff barriers for food exporters.  The most popular ways of inhibiting exports are: increased frequency of sanitary inspections, press campaigns with negative overtones, the need for many years to keep records related to transactions, additional certificates, short validity of permits, etc. It is estimated that more than 30% of products exported between EU countries face non-tariff import barriers. The losses resulting from the additional measures to be taken by exporters in relation to these barriers are estimated at around 4% of the total value of exports. This is a very worrying phenomenon because it threatens the proper functioning of europe's largest and most important project, the Single Market. The increasing introduction and conflict of non-tariff barriers for food exporters by Member States in the internal market undermines one of the four fundamental freedoms of the Union, namely the free movement of goods. These measures not only discriminate, but also affect competitiveness in the internal market in a way that may have a negative impact on the economy of the Union as a whole. This is all the more important given the serious crisis currently facing the European agri-food sector and, in order to resolve which, inter alia, the smooth functioning of the internal market is necessary. Protectionist measures may also have a negative impact on the functioning of small and medium-sized enterprises in the agri-food sector in the internal market. I would therefore like to ask the European Commission, on behalf of our Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the following inquiry. Firstly, what legal action does the Commission intend to take against Member States that apply discriminatory practices to food exporters in the Union? Secondly, has the Commission analysed the above-mentioned problems and is it considering introducing EU rules prohibiting practices that negatively affect food imports into a Member State within the single EU market?  The idea is to ensure the proper, fair, transparent functioning of the Union's internal market for the sake of food producers, sellers, but also consumers.  Thirdly, in the context of the internal market strategy adopted by the European Commission in October 2015, I would like to ask whether the Commission is considering proposing decisive measures that would limit member states' use of protectionist measures and illegal practices in the internal market.  Will the Commission examine the possibility of introducing Union legislation prohibiting such practices on food imports, in order to ensure the proper, fair and transparent functioning of the Union's internal market and for the sake of food producers, retailers and consumers, and when does it intend to do so?", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 643, "date": "2016-07-07.json", "name": "Violeta Bulc", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament for raising this question. The Commission shares the concerns presented by Mr Siekierski. The single market for food should not be hampered by unjustified or protectionist measures. Such measures can negatively affect the competitiveness of the food supply chain and restrict retailers’ sourcing decisions. Enforcing respect of mutual recognition – meaning that goods lawfully marketed in one Member State enjoy the right to free movement and can be sold in another Member State – ensures the smooth functioning of the single market for goods, including food. Finally, to tackle the issue of national technical regulations used as straightforward barriers, the Commission is committed to boosting the application of the mutual recognition principle, still not used to its full potential. As announced in the Single Market Strategy, the Commission intends to revise the mutual recognition Regulation in 2017. It will also adopt an action plan on mutual recognition. The Commission also stands ready to investigate, under competition rules, any agreements between operators that would lead to discrimination against imports from other Member States. To conclude, let me say that that the efficient monitoring of the application of EU law is an important part of the Commission’s better regulation agenda.

On 1 July, it was 48 years since the European internal market was achieved, and I sometimes have the impression that we are moving away from this internal market.

I think we need to move in the direction of a better movement of goods. I would like to draw attention to another related issue, because if we are faced with a difficulty in the internal market to move goods better, whether food or not, we also have another problem, which concerns the import and lack of control over imports from third countries. I take an example, that of the lighter used to light the cigarettes of European smokers. 80% of lighters sold in the EU do not comply with EU rules.

That's what that study says.  However, this study also speaks to some non-carin barriers that I personally think should be included, for example the obligation to publish information about the origin of the product because this is something we need to know, we need to know where the products come from, what these products are like and what the composition of these products is. However, we have a single market, we have a single agricultural policy, we have a duty-free union and we have to have and create a real duty-free system with all the additional regulations that include all this that this study has stated, and preferably some other elements because I think that this way, how some states function with each other and boycott each other and create administrative and other obstacles, does not make any sense.

The creation of barriers to trade inevitably leads to distortions of competition, and protectionist barriers to trade only harm the European idea. The Commission should therefore intervene directly if a country wants to hinder internal trade by means of excessive special rules. However, fair competition also requires agreement and compliance with common standards.

I have denounced these attacks on the Commission. I have been told that you will act with a decision, but we do not see the effects. The cases are repeated: intolerable aggressions within our European Union. That way we can't build a real single market.

Every moment must be worked on, States must be required to monitor it permanently and to react firmly to these barbarities and to these obstacles that my colleagues are denouncing, which prevent it from being a reality.  But, there is much more, because the single market does not protect our producers. They are suffering abuses of the marketing chain, they receive prices of misery for their products and we do not have a European standard prohibiting such practices.

Efforts are continuing to create additional rules, requirements that would restrict the entry of products from other countries into the market in that country. So basically we want to play an unequal game. A good example is that a couple of years ago, britain chose a way of labelling food in traffic light colours. At first glance, this system seemed useful, as it informed consumers about the fat, sugar and salt contained in the products. However, synthetic materials were ignored. Thus, products with more fat produced from natural products would be rated worse than the leaner, but produced using synthetic materials. The question therefore arises as to whether the intention was to take care of the health of consumers or whether certain products were intended to be excluded from the market. The system also sought to detract from sales of products from other countries, as consumers often choose an even worse-rated brand, which they know, rather than one that is not known to them. I support various labelling initiatives that help consumers get caught up, but these systems must also take into account the specificities of food packaging in other countries.

This Parliament played a key role in the data protection reform which will enter into application in 2018 and further strengthen everyone’s right to data protection. China has not enacted any legislation on the protection of personal data. Under the current and future data protection legislation, personal data transfers to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection are possible only if the EU data exporter provides adequate safeguards or if the transfer falls within the scope of one of the strictly interpreted regulations. These safeguards include the use of tools such as standard contractual clauses or binding corporate rules, which are of particular relevance for cloud computing. Now, as in the future, responsibility for the supervision and enforcement of data protection legislation lies with the national data protection supervisory authorities and the courts. National data protection authorities are endowed with effective powers of intervention. They have the power of ordering the blocking, erasure or destruction of data and of imposing a temporary or definite ban on processing. While the Commission has not engaged in bilateral discussions with China on the protection of personal data, it is involved in the work of APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) – of which China is a member – on this issue. In particular, the EU is engaged in a dialogue with APEC to explain the requirements under EU law for binding corporate rules to function as adequate safeguards enabling the international transfer of personal data. Regarding possible data localisation requirements, one point of concern is the question of public security authorities’ access to personal data transferred from the EU to China. The extent of such access affects the validity of safeguards and therefore the lawfulness of transfers to China. As such, it is within the remit of the supervisory authorities of EU Member States competent in the field of enforcement of the Data Protection Directive. China has adopted or proposed a number of laws and regulations dealing with aspects of cyber-security and national security over the past 18 months. The Commission has welcomed the opportunity to comment on a number of them and welcomes China’s efforts to enhance transparency in the legislative process. The Commission has made it clear to China that global businesses need to be able to transfer, and potentially to store, personal data to different locations for commercial, security and supervisory purposes.

China and the EU are different in their underlying approach to personal data processing. In China today the data protection recipient is not an individual or a data subject, as in the European Union, but a consumer. There is no data protection authority or any other state agency to monitor the protection of personal data. Courts are apparently the only viable remedy for the protection of individuals in this regard. Over the past few years, China has enacted a series of data protection-related legal texts. This initiative has to be strengthened and tested. While commercial and other relationships need to be stifled on data protection grounds, concrete and specific policy recommendations need to be provided to China. China would have the opportunity to demonstrate that its recent data protection effort is part of a persistent policy and not just a pretext to attract more internal and external information-processing businesses.

It is clear that, in today’s digital world, cross-border data flows are indispensable for our economy, businesses and societies. We must pay particular attention to the transfer of personal data. Citizens’ rights, as provided for by the Charter of Fundamental Rights and secondary law, must be fully respected. In this regard, it is important to emphasise that transfers of personal data can take place only if adequate safeguards are used by the data exporter. Such safeguards can be provided, notably, by means of contractual clauses binding the exporter and the importer of the data. These include obligations as regards security measures; obligations to adopt technical and organisational measures to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access; information provision to the data subjects in the event of transfer of sensitive data; notification to the data exporter of access requests by a third country’s law enforcement authority, or of any accidental or unauthorised access; and the rights of data subjects to access certification and erasure of their personal data; as well as rules on compensation for the data subject in the event of damage arising from a breach. The model clauses also require that EU data subjects have the possibility to invoke the rights they derive from contractual clauses as a third party beneficiary before a data protection authority (DPA) and/or a court of the Member State in which the data exported is established. With regard to transfer between different entities of a multinational corporate group, controllers can rely on binding corporate rules (BCRs).

As you will know, two Member States recently decided to apply their minimum wage laws to drivers from other Member States active in road transport operations: Germany in 2015 and France from last Friday, 1 July 2016. We need to join our forces and coordinate our efforts to move towards a single European transport area in which road transport services are not only safe and efficient, but at the same time socially responsible. Only then can road transport contribute adequately to a fairer and deeper internal market – one of the key priorities set by President Juncker for this Commission – a market which is shaped by people for people, which respects workers’ rights and contributes to the developing society and economy within the EU.  As regards especially the introduction of minimum wages, the Commission welcomes such national measures. This is clearly in line with the social policy commitments of the Commission. However, such national measures must be fully compatible with EU law, notably the Treaty principles on free movement of goods and the freedom to provide services. This implies, for example, that any restriction of such freedom must be necessary and proportionate in view of the objectives pursued.  Let me be very clear. The Commission fully supports the principle of the minimum wage. However, we consider that the systemic application of the minimum wage by France and Germany to all international transport operations touching their respective territories restricts in a disproportionate manner the freedom to provide services and the free movement of goods. Because of the highly mobile nature of workers in road transport, a driver often works for very short periods of time in several Member States in the course of international transport operations. The application of national measures regarding minimum rates of pay to even a very short—lived presence would create an unjustified and disproportionate administrative burden on road transport operations, without applicable benefits for their workers.  The Commission has already taken the initiative to have in—depth discussions with the French and German authorities on this issue. Unfortunately, we failed to find an amicable solution in that context. The Commission also undertook a thorough legal assessment of their national measures. On this basis, the Commission decided on 16 June to open an infringement procedure with respect to France and to proceed further with the current infringement case with Germany. The German and French cases also demonstrate that the implementation of the Posting of Workers Directive to road transport is raising particular legal questions and particular difficulties. It is also clear that all Member States potentially face these same questions and difficulties. This is why they call for an EU solution. This is necessary to prevent the emergence of uncoordinated national measures, fragmenting the internal market. The Commission already recognised this fact on 8 March 2016 when it adopted its proposal to amend the Posting of Workers Directive. In that proposal, the Commission announced its intention to clarify the application of the directive to road transport in the context of the sector—specific legislation. We are currently working on finding the most appropriate solution at EU level to address these challenges. This is done as part of our review of the road transport legislation. This review should lead to presenting a series of road initiatives in 2017. We intend to take advantage of these legal proposals to propose rules to clarify the application of the Posting of Workers Directive to road transport. Our objective will be to design effective enforcement mechanisms which combine the objectives of the internal market, fair competition and the protection of workers’ rights.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 684, "date": "2016-07-07.json", "name": "Janusz Lewandowski", "mepid": "23781", "text": "  On behalf of the PPE Group. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by Commissioner, i would like to thank you very much for The European Union is filled with confessions of love for the common market and competition, but with the second of these declarations of this market and competition there are fewer, not more, as illustrated by the recent agricultural debate.

And it is precisely in the European transport sector that it must be a matter of protecting the existence of both lorry drivers and properly operating companies. It must finally be over that business models are favoured in Europe that are purely aimed at exploitation and purely at undercutting competition. There is so much abuse in the transit sector that there has been no other solution. We have a European labour market in reality, but as long as the Commission does not come up with European rules or wait – the problems have been known for a long time – the Member States must have the right to regulate this themselves. That is precisely what France and Germany are doing, in order to prevent this abuse, which you are all aware of here in the room.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which I fully understand the contradiction we are facing here. On the one hand, the interests of many transport companies that operate throughout Europe, across the EU, want ingesbiting their services, having to cross many Member States, but also the legitimate protection of people who often suffer from commercial fraud, because different standards are quite simply undermined between the Member States, people are recruited in their own country through companies, but then often get contracts from their country of origin, but at the same time, for three weeks to nine months – as studies show – are staying in the country for which they do not even get the contract. In the end, I say clearly that when it comes to To achieve both – on the one hand, the possibilities for the free movement of services and the transport of goods, but also to protect the fundamental rights of employees – then we have more to answer than just the question of whether an infringement procedure can be used to respond to the fact that the Commission has for years ceased to be subject to any control over the implementation of EU transport and road transport directives in the Member States, or has not been influenced by the fact that such fraudulent applications can be used by different member States.

Decisions by the Governments of Germany and France requiring carriers from other European Union countries to apply the minimum wage in transit and international transport are contrary to the principle of freedom to provide services, infringe competition rules, increase the operating costs of European companies and result in the loss of many jobs. Even more harmful are the additional administrative requirements imposed on carriers from other countries, such as the need to keep extensive documentation in the language of the country of destination or the obligation to open a representative office. These actions are contrary to European law and clearly to common sense.

I would like to remind you that, according to Eurostat 2014, GDP per capita in Germany was EUR 35 200, in France 32 400, while in my country, Portugal, it was EUR 16 600. This means that attempting to require the application of national minimum wage regulations to all cross-border transport activities will necessarily result in increased losses for transport undertakings, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises which will see their competitiveness particularly impaired, and will prevent the proper functioning of the internal market. I believe that the provisions of German and French law will make it difficult to enjoy the freedoms of the internal market, since, in addition to what I have already mentioned, it will also entail a disproportionate bureaucratic and administrative burden for transport operators.

This is what we need to take into account as well. I would like to stress once more that the establishment of national minimum pay rates is considered by the Commission as a very positive development. We fully understand the objective of the social protection of workers pursued by the German and French authorities. But of course the national measures should not be misused. This is our core message. While protecting workers effectively, they need to respect EU law so as to preserve the proper functioning of the internal market with all the benefits it brings across the EU.  Let me stress that the Commission sent a letter of formal notice to Germany in May 2015 challenging the systematic application of the German minimum wage to all international transport operations and transit. Since then, the Commission has been engaged in a dialogue with the German authorities to reach a satisfactory solution without the need for further procedures. This is by far the best possible approach. I was really hoping we would find a solution during the process, but we have exhausted this possibility and we are now moving on with legal proceedings.  The administrative burdens related to the notification and controlling requirements imposed on foreign operators constitute one of the aspects that have been analysed in the letter of formal notice. In the pursuit of constant improvement, we will seek to find appropriate measures to create efficient, safe and socially responsible road transport services where people are at the heart of EU transport policy. This is the ambitious and challenging goal ahead and we must all do our utmost to contribute to its achievement. This will be the line that the Commission will follow when preparing the 2017 road initiatives. One of its aims will be to enhance the proper enforcement of the existing EU social rules, as well.  Please let us not forget our core objective – the core objective of the EU – which is a single market, the basic foundation on which the European Union is built.

Unfortunately, in some Western European Member States, laws on the minimum wage in the transport sector are introduced, citing the concept of social dumping, with reference to those in Eastern Europe, who are falsely accused of unfair competition. These rules shall also apply to persons operating only temporarily in their territories. Thus, in Germany, a minimum wage of EUR 8.5 per hour is imposed on foreign freight carriers and persons, and France is preparing to do the same. Such legislation strongly affects the proper functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness of SMEs. Furthermore, the financial possibilities of transport companies in the Eastern States to pay their employees at a certain required level cannot be compared with those of the Western States, a different approach being likely to lead to the end of some transport operators.
