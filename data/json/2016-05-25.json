[{"id": 0, "date": "2016-05-25.json", "name": "Zijne Majesteit Willem-Alexander koning van Nederland.", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, it is a special experience for me to be in your midst during the Dutch Presidency of the Council of the European Union. You represent the citizens of the Union at European level. Their wishes and expectations, but also their worries and their fears. Their ideals and their hopes, but also their disillusionments and their anger. Everything that moves the European electorate comes together here and can be said and heard here. You have an important task, a difficult task too, especially now. There's a strong wind blowing in Europe. Much of what is dear to us Europeans is under pressure. Two months ago, this city, this district, was hit by extremist attacks that killed thirty-two people of different nationalities. We are thinking today of their families who have been scarred for life by pain and grief and those who have been injured and are working to their recovery, as best we can. Brussels, the city where Europe meets, was touched in the heart. As well as Paris, last year, and so many places in the countries around us. I mention Ankara, Aleppo, Beirut, Baghdad, Sousse, Lahore. Violence and oppression control the lives of millions of people in the regions around Europe. Entire societies have been disrupted. In the end, many feel compelled to flee. This requires many of the countries that receive the largest flows of refugees: Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and a number of countries in Africa. The Member States of the European Union are also affected by the refugee crisis, some more than others. This puts the social strength of the Member States and solidarity within the Union to the test. People need shelter, a place where they can really feel at home. As the German philosopher Rüdiger Safranski wrote: \"Wir können global kommunizieren und reisen, wir können aber nicht im Globalen wohnen. Wohnen können wir nur hier oder dort.\" It is important to always have this human attachment to a place in the world of its own. For many Europeans, one's own country is an important anchor point, with its history, tradition and customs experienced as its 'own'. This also applies to the seventeen million inhabitants of the European part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Dutch love their country and are proud of the legacy of Erasmus, Hugo de Groot, Spinoza, Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Cornelis Lely and Johan Cruyff. But in all the attachment and love for one's own country, it must never be forgotten what we owe to the wider European civilisation and to the peoples and cultures around us. And it is not about the least values. It was the Greeks who laid the seeds for the democratic state form that we cherish. The Italians gave us the Renaissance, a vibrant source of innovation in culture and science. It was the French immigrant Christophe Plantin who published the very first dictionaries of the Dutch language at the end of the sixteenth century. German and French thinkers like Leibniz and Voltaire laid the foundations under our Enlightenment. And it was our British and Polish allies who fought Dutch freedom with great sacrifice in 1944 and 1945. Achievements are rarely purely national. The deeper you dig, the stronger the root systems of our countries and cultures are intertwined and connected. You can delineate a territory, not a culture. Europe also represents a civilizational ideal of personal freedom and human dignity, equality and humanity. Twice my mother addressed your meeting, in 1984 and in 2004. It recalled the high expectations many young people had of Europe in the early 1960s. \"What had begun with such prosaic concrete building blocks as coal and steel grew into a movement that would remove the dividing walls in Europe, keep the peace and give our continent new resilience and energy,\" she said. I was born in 1967. A defining moment for my generation was 1989, when dividing walls between Eastern and Western Europe that seemed untouchable shook and fell on their foundations. The end of the Cold War was the beginning of a new era. There was room for new connections. It became clear that European countries have a common responsibility. There was gradually another realization. The position of Europe and the world has changed within a few generations. Europe no longer automatically sets the tone in thinking. We are no longer the centre of the world, neither economically, nor geopolitically, nor culturally. The values we consider universal are not taken for granted everywhere and are under pressure in many places. Precisely because we believe in these values and in our common tradition, our cooperation is so Important. No longer the past, but the future forces it. In these times, we have to ask ourselves: what Europe do we stand for? What do we dare to be proud of? The main focus is often on the problems, the flaws and the worries. But these concerns, however large and justified, must be seen in the context of what has been achieved through European cooperation. There's nothing that gets used as quickly as peace. Since the Schuman plan, no Member State has fired a shot at another Member State. In our Union, power relations are embedded in legal relations. I am one of the first generation of Europeans in history to share this happiness. And I wish future generations the same happiness. (applause) The choice of European integration was a choice for a common anchoring of a free and open society in a common legal order. Five hundred million Europeans have found each other in a Union of shared values. The achievement and enforcement of this has been and is accompanied by a great deal of discussion and emotion. Tempers can run high, even here in your Parliament. When translating abstract values into concrete laws, rules and plans, there is a fierce debate. The differences can be big. This is sometimes seen as a proof of Europe's weakness, but it is a testament to Europe's strength. Critical reflection, freedom of expression, debate and democratic control are all part of our lives. Only in dictatorships there is no public discussion.  Why is it important that we keep moving together? We give the answer to that every day. In almost all the major challenges we face, there is a call for better cooperation. Controlling refugee flows. Combating trafficking in human beings, terrorism and crime. Improving our energy supply. Climate change control. Enabling economic growth and new jobs for the more than twenty-two million Europeans who are out of work. And also: strengthening our position as a morale beacon against the powers that threaten freedom. In all these tasks, we need each other.  As Erasmus wrote 500 years ago, \"Nothing is easier than overcoming those who are divided.\" Europe is one in its diversity. Everyone's input is essential. The European bouquet is not complete without the Spanish carnation, the French fleur-de-lys, the Greek acanthus, the Danish margriet, the German cornflower, the Austrian edelweiss, the Croatian iris, the Dutch and Hungarian tulips and not without the English rose. The European Union can face the world with its head held high. But that does not absolve us of the duty to be open to criticism and also to look critically at ourselves. Often we do not address urgent common issues until the need has increased so high that there are no more alternatives. This has happened in the banking crisis and, more recently, in the humanitarian crisis caused by the flow of refugees from Syria and other conflict zones. Anticipation is not Europe's strong suit. After all, Europe cannot move faster than the Member States allow. The interaction between the Union and the Member States, and between, for example, this Parliament and national parliaments, on new challenges and problems on the horizon is therefore more important than ever. At the same time, this also places demands on the way Europe operates. This also applies to the strengthening of our economy. Our young people are our future capital. Are we doing enough to provide good future opportunities? The untapped potential of our internal market has been estimated at EUR 1 250 billion. Sixty years after the creation of the common market, that has to give an explanation. Economic and social perspective for all is essential. The work on this involves much more than just driving economic growth through the single market. After all, our common legal order is also a social legal order. It is also about equal opportunities. The right to study, work, undertake and make use of facilities in another Member State is a fantastic achievement. But we must never forget the perspective of those who stay at home. They experience not so much the extra possibilities, but extra competition. Europe now means to some: to spread your wings. And for others: arrange. Many people's concerns about this Europe are easily met with unease about the way in which the European Union is governed. Some see Brussels as a bogeyman and meddler rather than an ally. A long effort has been made to maintain a European ideal. An image of an ever-expanding expansion of European construction. But as with the construction of a stable bridge, the material laws of tension and stretch and the anchoring of the base must always be taken into account. In order to prevent a breaking point from reaching. This need to 'strengthen the support structure' is recognised within the European institutions and also within the European Parliament. The answer is: not more rules, but rules that work better. Concentration of European attention on the main issues, which really require a common approach. Decision-making as close as possible to people themselves. This not only strengthens the effectiveness of the EU, but also addresses the concern of citizens losing their grip on developments and losing their cultural identity. Citizens can only become European citizens if they continue to feel at home in their own country, city and village. Europe starts at the kitchen table. A proud European is - and should be - a proud Finn, Frenchman, Pole, Portuguese, Brit, Bulgarian, Greek, German or Dutchman.  No political order can do without a close relationship with the public. The European Union must not be an elite project; all citizens of the Member States must be able to feel at home in the Union. After all, the European Union is ours. From the professor, the truck driver, the small business owner, the job seeker, the retired factory worker, the refugee with a residence permit, the school leaver. Every year, one in three Europeans visits another European country. So two-thirds do not. For all these citizens, the European Union must have sufficient powers of say. Our Union is there for the travelling and for the fasts. As a directly elected institution of the European Union, you have a special responsibility. Compared to your electorate, but also to the many who make their voices heard in Europe only through national elections. The results of elections and referendums - including in my country - can complicate developments in the European context. But the European story can only be written together. It can only be further advanced if voters and elected voters want to listen to each other, in Europe and at home. For 60 years, European cooperation has been a bridge that we are building into the future. Initially, the bridge was narrow, but over the years the base became broader, the requirements were larger and the ambitions extended further. Whether the construction can carry us is up to us. Everything depends on the extent to which we manage to keep the connections strong and the structure stable. You, as representatives of the citizens of Europe, are essential in all their diversity. But no matter how great the diversity is and how much we differ from each other, there is more, much more that unites us. I wish you all the best of luck in your important work.

The first will boost cross-border online trading across Europe: removing barriers, raising consumer confidence and ending discrimination. The second responds to new digital realities, with a modern policy approach to online platforms and broadcasting rules. Both packages reflect commitments that the Commission made in its Digital Single Market strategy that I presented to this House in Strasbourg one year ago. Both are vital for a properly functioning Digital Single Market across all countries of the European Union. Let me begin with the e-commerce package. We want to open up the e-commerce market so that it becomes truly pan-European, with fair conditions for consumers and business across the EU’s internal borders. While more and more goods and services are traded over the internet, cross-border online sales within the EU are only growing slowly. This should change. Consumers as well as businesses deserve better. They should not be limited to their domestic markets. They should be able to make the best of the opportunities offered by Europe’s single market in the digital age. Our package addresses three main areas. First, it will prevent unjustified discrimination, online as well as offline. In a true single market, you should not be discriminated against based on your nationality, residence or place of establishment. However, that does not mean making companies sell or deliver goods in every EU market. But if a consumer comes to their online store, they should be treated as if they were locals – not treated differently. But this would not include the obligation to deliver: traders would not be required to deliver cross-border but sell to them as to customers from their own country. Second, it will increase transparency of parcel delivery prices, encourage competition, and make regulatory oversight of cross-border parcel delivery services more effective. This will help consumers get a better and affordable deal, also a wider choice. It will help small e-retailers to reach new customers. It will create more business for delivery providers. And to be clear: there is no intention of imposing a single price across Europe. Third, our package will raise consumer and SME trust in e-commerce by clarifying the nature of unfair commercial practices and strengthening the enforcement of consumer rights across borders. It will also strengthen cooperation between national consumer protection authorities. Together, these measures aim to remove the main barriers to e-commerce. Online platforms are a new reality to which Europe should respond and should embrace. In a short time, they have transformed our daily lives: how we sell, shop and travel; how we learn, create and are entertained. They bring many benefits to consumers, to wider society, to industry, business and SMEs. The guiding principle and objective is to create the right conditions for platforms to innovate, scale up and grow in the Digital Single Market. But they should do so in a fair and open atmosphere. That means equal conditions for fair and open competition. Everyone involved in the market – traditional and online service providers – should play by the same rules, with no discrimination. Our assessment has shown that platforms are innovative, have a positive impact on our economy, and increase competitiveness. It shows that the EU is quite good in areas such as the app economy, health, finance and the collaborative economy. In order to thrive, all platforms – including European ones – need a legal environment that gives them certainty. This is why we are very clear in our communication: there will be no horizontal new regulation or regulator for platforms. We will not change the current e-commerce framework and its liability provisions. Of course, platforms – as well as all internet providers and online intermediaries – have to respect EU law and fundamental rights. They also have to act responsibly regarding content, and keep their activities transparent. These are important principles. This is why we are taking a problem-driven approach. It means that if we see an issue with platforms in relation to copyright, we solve it in our copyright rules. If there is an issue related to telecoms, we solve it in our telecom package. The first steps in this have already been taken today, with our proposal on the Audio-visual Media Services directive, where online platforms are a part of this instrument’s new scope. The principles that I mentioned also apply to broadcasting, where the significant presence of online platforms and video-on-demand providers has transformed viewing habits and behaviour. Today’s rules need to change to reflect this new reality, and make sure that everyone follows the same rules. Since it has worked well, there is no need to change the ‘country of origin’ principle. Media service providers will continue to be subject to the rules of the country where they are based. Our proposal will also bring more flexibility to advertising rules, and bolster our efforts to promote European creative work by raising its prominence. It will strengthen protection of minors who go online to view content. It will strengthen the role played by national media regulators. I look forward to working closely with the European Parliament, so that together we can turn these two important packages of proposals into a reality. They are essential for building the Digital Single Market that Europe needs: one where all Europeans will gain.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 10, "date": "2016-05-25.json", "name": "Andreas Schwab", "mepid": "28223", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the Mr Vice-President, I would like to thank the Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which First of all, Vice-President Ansip, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, congratulations on this package. We believe that the European Commission – at least from the point of view of the European People's Party – has taken the very right steps that need to be taken now, while at the same time taking caution in the areas where we need to get a little more exploration from the markets to be sure that we are taking the right steps. The important big point you are making is the proposal on geo-blocking, the last area in which businesses have re-established themselves in the European internal market in recent years, where consumers end up being left behind. The example of Disneyland in Paris has been the most prominent, there are many others. Here, I believe, you have set the right priorities in the right interfaces, where uniformity is really needed in the European internal market. Of course, we will have to deal with this critically in the course of the consultation at one point or another. Some say that more is possible in certain areas, but we want to do so to the extent that all Europeans ultimately benefit from this package. Commissioner, you have also said that you want to reject the platforms of horizontal regulation. This is probably the right step on the basis of the findings of the sector inquiry, but in our view this does not mean that there is nothing to be done about it. In the area of network and information security, we have already taken the first steps in platform legislation. You yourself have announced that, where necessary, you want to take further steps in a sectoral way. We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are very keen to follow this path, because we believe that fair competition between online platforms in Europe across the EU, but also with those who work here from outside Europe, is necessary to ensure that the European internal market with 500 million consumers benefits in the end.

It has taken a long time, but it is finally here, and I can only congratulate you on that. Our Parliament has been working since 2011 to finally get this package off the way. I think in the analogue world it would be completely unthinkable for a buyer to be turned away in a shop simply because he lives in another state. This is exactly what is currently happening on the Internet. That is one of the things that we must definitely prevent in geo-blocking, because it is simply discrimination against people depending on the country they are from or whether they have a credit card that has been issued in the right country. This is unacceptable in an internal market in which we want to put people at the centre of our concern. You have also said that you do not want a horizontal approach to the platforms. I congratulate you on that. As we in our report in January, we in Parliament said that this would be the wrong way to go, because the platforms are so different that we cannot find a solution for everyone, but that we must address the specific problems in these areas, if they have to be, also in a sectoral way. I think that's the right approach, so we can move forward. What also needs to be addressed, and I hope that this package will also be very strong for consumers, is that we also have more transparency when shopping on the Internet, so that citizens are not over-privileged by the fact that there is non-transparent information or hidden fees or that the company says only at the end of an order process. : Sorry, we can't ship to your country because, for example, the package costs are too high.

Mr President, the Commission wants to harmonise all the rules on internet purchases and make it a single market. This is not illogical, but it is very much at the same time, and that also means that the concrete problems for SMEs and also for consumers are sometimes not solved. I would like to give you two examples, there are many. The Commission recognises that it is often difficult for SMEs to be clearly visible in the results of search engines, such as Google, or on price comparison sites. Large companies have more money to prioritise on platforms like this and the result is that the consumer does not get a comprehensive overview of all providers. Although this is an acute problem for SMEs, the Commission will first continue its studies for six months to see if this can be solved through self-regulation. I think that's a missed opportunity. Every day that a company is not visible on platforms costs revenue and further undermines the level playing field. I therefore call for more capacity in this area.  Another example: a practical problem that consumers face is the extortionate prices for concert tickets. In its proposals, the Commission insists that a website offering such tickets must charge the same price to all consumers in the European Union. That's nice, but a much bigger problem is the lack of transparency from the various ticket providers. For example, large batches may be sold privately and tickets on the organization's site sell out, but are offered on the internet through other merchants at extortionate prices. Is the Commission going to do something about this?", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 15, "date": "2016-05-25.json", "name": "Julia Reda", "mepid": "124816", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, the long-awaited proposal for a regulation on geo-blocking could have been a really good proposal if you had been just a bit more ambitious, Commissioner. It has clear rules for banning geo-blocking, it addresses the concerns about the applicable law and the obligation to deliver it in a very clever way, but unfortunately at the same time it also misses the core of the problem. We all know that, when we ask consumers what they think about geo-blocking, the first thing they think about is ‘this video is not available in your country’. Video is, of course, completely exempt from the regulation and – apparently at the last minute – other copyrighted content has also been removed from the obligation to ban geo-blocking. Now you say that we will deal with copyright problems in copyright proposals, but the problem with this is that there is a lot of geo-blocking of copyrighted materials, particularly videos, that has nothing to do with copyright. So where will these issues be addressed? I do not see anything in the audiovisual regulation that would address the geo-blocking of videos that is not for copyright reasons. I do not think it is OK just to say that it is a copyright problem, because quite often it can simply be the seller who decides for commercial reasons that dividing the market will make him more money. So the Commission, and now Parliament, has to be extremely careful not to create any regulatory gaps, so that the end result will really be an end to geo-blocking in the whole of Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 16, "date": "2016-05-25.json", "name": "Barbara Kappel", "mepid": "125024", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to take a iendled with the ENF Group.

This point included four sub-items. The first point is better rules for cross-border e-commerce. You said at the time that 11.7 billion euros could be saved for consumers every year if there were better online trade. The second point is that cheap cross-border parcel delivery is made from the knowledge that high prices and inefficient parcel delivery naturally hinder online trade. The third point is to prevent geo-blocking, and there is certainly a need to strike a balance between consumer interests and legal certainty for businesses. The final point is better access to digital content. I would say that the package presented today will certainly lead to an improvement in consumer protection. Online shopping will be easier and cheaper. Will consumers be satisfied? If they can buy online but the retailer doesn't have to deliver, it may detune some. But in general, it can certainly be said that it leads to an improvement. Confidence is also improved by removing fraudulent websites from the web and by improving identity identification.

Access free from obstacles and barriers to the single market will certainly give more opportunities, and it is a great step forward that citizens and businesses, consumers and operators can take their rights with them within the Union: digital rights, productive rights, consumer rights, rights and values; in short, they can turn without limits and obstacles. Small and medium-sized enterprises, commercial and productive enterprises, which are very afraid of these changes today, must also be helped to manage this transition, to seize opportunities and to manage risks. We in Parliament will pay close attention to regulation, as has been said in the speeches. It will be very much up to regulation to facilitate this process in a positive sense, reducing its risks: clear, flexible regulation, with a great deal of attention to all rights.

I believe that we need to be ambitious in addressing the reasons why companies geo-block, from parcel delivery to contract and consumer law and VAT and copyright as well. As long as the reasons to geo-block exist the companies will continue with these practices. The purpose of all this is to get more companies to sell online, not to scare them off.

A clear example is parcelry. Competition in the most lucrative segments of the postal market serves to dismantle public postal companies, precarize employment and increase the cost of services. Today's regulation contains elements that deepen in this regard and are absolutely unjustified. I am also concerned about the idea of continuing to treat digital platforms as if they were offering new services, as they only provide the usual services, only in another format. A driver must have the same rights, work in a taxi or for Uber. And the same in other sectors such as telecommunication or hospitality.

I have now had journalists, journalism students with me, who have asked me about the biggest problem for working in the European Parliament. In my view, one of the biggest problems is a lack of European publicity. That is what we need for a European democracy, for a European society. If I now look at the proposal that we want to abolish geo-blocking for games, but not for videos, you can see how much this proposal is market-driven and how little socio-political, democratic. After all, from the point of view of news, of producing news itself, of starting a public European discussion, video is far more important than games.

We come to different political decisions if we want to support a maximum profitable business model or if the perspective is to allow as much communication as possible for citizens.

You do not have a sovereignty strategy, even in Europe, in the face of foreign technologies that are technologies of domination. Your single market, therefore, will deliver even more European data to GAFA (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) working with the U.S. secret services, for America and its companies, against our companies. Yesterday, in 1990, we had the world's largest e-technology market with Alcatel. Germany's Siemens also held in a very good place. We should have created a European monopoly, which your competition forbids. Today, Alcatel is destroyed by its alliance with the United States, Siemens is outpaced in favor of American and Chinese companies, because there was no protection of the European market, as we had protection of the domestic market before European rules. Russia and China have pursued a policy of sovereignty to meet these challenges, Europe has not. Today, you offer a European cloud. It is ok!

Although video offerings on multimedia platforms are now included in regulation, the distinction between linear and non-linear remains, despite the fact that Parliament has now called three times for this outdated demarcation to be abandoned. Television and the Internet have grown increasingly together, and the audience has become completely uninterested in this separation. We must finally set a European framework that guarantees the availability of audiovisual media services in accordance with uniform rules, regardless of time and location. Your proposals on the direct participation of video platforms in national film funding funds and on making advertising times more flexible are to be welcomed in principle. In terms of content, this should be allowed to be advertised, which is also legal to buy. If we are too restrictive here – I believe that this is the case in some places – and global Internet advertising will, above all, threaten the advertising revenues of private television providers, and they urgently need it in order to be able to present us with a good programme. I will work to ensure that clearer rules on the discoverability of journalistic content are enshrined in the directive.

At the same time we as legislators, and European institutions as a whole, are losing credibility. To this end, we have to ensure future—proof legislation which we adopt swiftly. This is why I am certain that the Commission will come up with a proposal for a full ban on geo-blocking sooner rather than later. On platforms, they are so diverse and different, as you said, and I am glad the Commission has not decided to legislate on something that enriches our lives, that fosters innovation and, most importantly, can be regulated when and if necessary, as we have seen in the past through enforcing existing anti-trust rules.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 43, "date": "2016-05-25.json", "name": "Nicola Danti (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124821", "text": "   Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Vice-President, let me express my deep appreciation for the work of the Commission, which is slowly realometing the ambitious objectives of the Digital Single Market Strategy.

The measures presented so far and the many that are coming up can offer new opportunities for citizens and consumers. Ambitious e-government plans will be able to develop a more effective and efficient, cheaper public administration and provide citizens with higher quality services. European consumers will benefit from clearer and more homogeneous contractual rules, the full development of e-commerce, the portability of online content, the removal of geoblocks and other barriers that are currently anachronistic.

Without fear of emphasising, I would like to say that at a time when the European Union is facing its greatest point of crisis, at a time when citizens have the perception of institutions far removed from their concrete needs, digital technology can be a key element on which to rebuild a new sense of belonging and with which to project our continent into the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 44, "date": "2016-05-25.json", "name": "Henna Virkkunen (PPE).", "mepid": "124726", "text": "   – Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Commission on today's digital package.

We know that it is still a big problem in Europe, that at the same time as people, goods and capital are moving across borders, digital services often continue to stop at borders. It was downright astonishing to read that Commission report, which had examined 10 000 e-commerce, and more than 60% of these online shops were covered by country restrictions and, in fact, only one third of online shops allowed purchases between the countries of the European Union. So it is very important now that the Commission today has put forward a proposal to lift these unjustified land restrictions. It will hopefully boost e-commerce in Europe and increase competition. Of course, the challenge in legislation all the time is that technology develops much faster than legislation and, on the other hand, consumer habits and expectations change very quickly. In other things, it is important that the legislative framework is also flexible enough in that it encourages new innovation in Europe, because we know that one of the biggest challenges facing Europe is precisely how we are coping with competition in the digital economy, for example, compared to the USA or Asia.

But first, I would like to thank you for your strong support for the package we are proposing today. I am looking forward to having really fruitful cooperation with you. I am ready to come to all the parliamentary committees and all of the party groups of Parliament to discuss these issues. Regarding geo-blocking, we all know that this is a real headache for our businesses in the European Union and also for our citizens. We know those fears about mystery shopping surveys but, once again, 2% out of all the people who tried to buy goods or services from another Member State could not get access to those websites because their IP address was wrong, from the wrong country; 27% of those people who could get access could not register because once again they were from the wrong country; 32% of those people who were lucky enough to register were faced with delivery problems; and the 26% of the people who did not have any kind of delivery problems could not pay. We have the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) in the European Union, but 26% of people could not pay! All in all, just 36.6% out of all those people who tried to buy goods or services from another country were able to do so. This is not a single market. This is not at all the single market we have to have in the European Union. We have to fix those problems. Our proposal was to set an obligation to sell like at home, which does not mean that there will be an obligation on the deliverer. Sellers have to treat those buyers coming online from other countries differently from local people and I cannot agree with Vicky Ford, who said that we will put some kind of additional obligations on our small companies. No way – they have to sell like at home. This means that the sellers’ law has to apply. If I want to buy a bottle of water, as a consumer, I will take those risks and I do not care if there is French writing on the label rather than Estonian. It is my risk. If there are some defects in goods or devices, then I took this risk and I have to take the equipment back to the place where I bought it. So there will be no additional obligations and no additional risks for sellers. Our proposal will make the role of businesses easier and it will also be easier for our citizens. Regarding parcel deliveries, some people said that this is already a well-organised area and there is really no need to intervene. Yes, it is well organised in some countries. In the Netherlands the difference between domestic parcel prices and cross-border parcel delivery prices is just 1.6 times as much, but in one EU Member State this difference is 22 times as much. We do not want to start to regulate those parcel delivery prices, but we would like to ask for more transparency. We believe that if there is more transparency then we will get real competition and our citizens and our businesses will get more affordable prices. Regarding the scope – a question which was raised by Julia Reda, Jan Albrecht, Eva Paunova and many others – of course we can be more ambitious, and I would like to be more ambitious, but my aim is not to be the most ambitious guy in the world. I would like to achieve some concrete aims and if those proposals are too ambitious then I think it will take years and years and we will not achieve any of our aims. But our aim is to take a step-by-step approach and I am sure that then we will achieve some aims, but of course this was a compromise. Consumer organisations asked for a wider scope but, for example, those who represent the music industry in Europe were against it. So we had to make some compromises. Regarding platforms, we decided not to take a horizontal approach but to take a preventive approach, which also means that there will be action. Today we already made our proposal about the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, and our aim was to make those advertising rules, sponsorship and product placement, more flexible. Today we also made a proposal about the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. This also means that there will be more transparency for platforms. At the end of September we will make our telecom rules proposal, then a second package proposal on copyright, and an e-privacy proposal. It will also be all about our platforms.

We therefore need harmonisation of tax legislation, as well as a pan-European deposit guarantee scheme, in order to eliminate the uncertainty that undermines banking systems, particularly in the Mediterranean Member States and especially in Greece.  This is the only way to smooth out the huge differences in business and household borrowing rates between Member States, which result in investment apnea and an increase in unemployment in the economically weaker Member States of the Union.

In 2013 only, the customs authorities recorded as many as 87 000 cases of such fraud, with an estimated value of EUR 36 million of articles retained amounting to more than EUR 768 million. In this context, the European Commission has presented a three-pillar e-commerce development plan aimed at preventing the above-mentioned problems and achieving the objectives of the Digital Agenda. Its elements are: preventing unjustified geo-blocking, reducing costs and increasing the efficiency of the delivery of foreign parcels, and better protection and enforcement of the law.

In my view everyone should be able to purchase goods online everywhere in the EU and have it delivered to their home country paying the existing parcel delivery price.

The economic backdrop is one of gradual recovery for our economy, despite a difficult global environment. EU annual growth reached 2% in 2015. Our first-quarter growth this year was higher than that of the United States. Unemployment is certainly still much too high in some Member States but, across the board, it has fallen to its lowest in five years. Today, there are five million more jobs than in 2013. Confidence is gradually returning – we see it on investment, on consumer spending, on lending. But we must remain alert. Our main trading partners’ slower performance is a cause for concern. Last year, growth outside the EU fell to its lowest since 2009 as emerging markets performed less well. Against this backdrop of uncertainty, growth will depend on the opportunities we create for ourselves. We need investment, structural reforms and responsible public finances. We need to stay the course. This Parliament has played a vital role in this strategy. You made it possible to launch the Investment Plan for Europe at record speed. In less than one year, it has triggered EUR 100 billion in new investments, and delivered finance on better terms to more than 140 000 SMEs. It is generating structural change. Until now, European investment has often been dominated by a limited number of large, expensive projects. Today, we are starting to see more local projects, which are smaller and more diverse. Public money is mobilising private finance, and supporting structural reforms. We see more interaction between the European Investment Bank and local institutions. In short, we are beginning to see the kind of investment that the market has often failed to deliver. Our Fund is helping to find new treatments for Alzheimer’s disease; transforming old industrial sites into new offices; bringing energy efficiency into our homes and cutting our bills; and lending a hand to start-ups who were turned away by other lenders. Investment is high on the agenda of the G7. And we have a good story to tell. We will also deliver better news on Greece. Last year, we fought hard to keep Greece in the euro area. Today, the economic data is better than expected. Greece should return to growth in the second half of 2016. Unemployment fell in 2015, and the government reached a primary surplus of 0.7% of GDP. The stability support programme agreed last summer has laid the ground for long-term stable development. Above all, we have managed to secure Greece’s place in the euro area. This week’s agreement on the completion of the first review of the programme only confirms that. Discussions on reducing the Greek debt burden have now started. This recognises the collective effort made by the people of Greece. Today, the Greek economy can turn the corner, and we are confident that international investors will follow. Within the G7, the European Union has always fought for a global economy that is governed by rules, increasingly transparent, and as fair as possible. In other words, we strive to export our best practices to the global stage. At this week’s summit, we will continue these efforts. Together with our G7 partners, we need to demonstrate that global trade can work for everyone – not just for every country, but for every part of our society. We know that, in the short term, globalisation produces winners and losers. This has helped to fuel populist forces around the world. And so our challenge is not only to shape the rules of the game and to ensure that they are respected, but also to argue that our long-term prosperity lies in openness and exchange. Over the last year, the European Union has taken the lead on tax transparency. We now have a ground-breaking agreement on tax rulings, and earlier this year we adopted a new proposal on country-by-country reporting. Our message is clear: everyone must pay their fair share. We must now work with our G7 partners to ensure that this is a truly global effort. If our own Member States have agreed to put in place central registers of beneficial ownership, then our partners must do the same. For those that try to evade their duty to society, there must be no place to hide. We must be equally firm on those countries that do not play by the rules. Free trade must be fair trade. I can assure this House today that the European Commission stands by a robust trade defence system. If somebody distorts the market, we will take action. This Commission has launched a record number of trade defence measures to respond to the dumping on Europe’s steel industry. At the G7, we will argue that offending countries need to produce clear and measurable plans to cut over-capacity. International monitoring must ensure that everyone complies. Let me now turn to the global refugee crisis, which is rightly high on the G7 agenda. This Commission has argued from the start that only global solutions will work. Here, once again, this Parliament has helped to deliver a European strategy that is comprehensive: saving lives at sea, providing humanitarian assistance, strengthening our borders, supporting the countries most under pressure, relocating and resettling people in need of international protection, returning irregular migrants to their home countries, and creating safe and legal routes for asylum-seekers from outside the European Union. In 2015 and 2016, the EU will have devoted more than EUR 10 billion to managing the crisis. This strategy has given us the breathing space to look to the future. Together with our G7 partners, we must now develop a truly global response, backed by proper resources, and capable of addressing the root causes of migration. An international resettlement programme is urgent and necessary. Only by giving asylum-seekers a legal route to safety will we convince them not to risk their lives. This is the best way to break the business model of the smugglers. And the best way to restore dignity to those who genuinely need our protection.  Let me conclude with climate and energy. This week’s summit of the G7 is the first since the Paris agreement. The real work starts now: modernising our economy and changing the way we produce and consume. This in turn requires new incentives across the entire spectrum of policy. The best of our businesses have read the signal: leading European companies are changing their business models, and creating new jobs that require new skills, innovative processes and investments. The European Union must have the ambition to be a world leader in renewables: the sector now employs over one million people and generates EUR 130 billion in turnover each year. European companies today hold 40% of all patents for renewable technologies. But major obstacles remain. In 2013, across the world, subsidies for fossil fuels amounted to almost EUR 500 billion. That is a lot of money being spent very badly. The G7 has promised to phase out those subsidies by 2025. Next we must push the G20 to do the same. As we approach this week’s summit in Japan, the need for political coordination at the global level is as compelling as ever. From a slowing global economy to a global refugee crisis, the countries of the G7 need to show leadership and join forces. As the European Union, we will continue to make the case for a global economy that is governed by rules, and an open society that seeks prosperity and security in its exchange with others. In today’s uncertain world, our contribution really matters.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 71, "date": "2016-05-25.json", "name": "Paulo Rangel", "mepid": "96903", "text": "  on behalf of the Ppe Group. – Madam President, first of all I would like to greet the Commissioner, Vice-President Timmermans, and I would like to say this.  It is clear that the agenda of this G7 is extremely broad. Here, the Japanese Presidency did not hesitate to put, at last, a kind of passage through all the themes and I would like to focus on four main themes. The first is about investment and then, frankly, I think the European Union has to make some effort. I do not think the Juncker Plan is enough because the most relevant economies of the European Union are also represented here individually (I am thinking of Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy). They themselves have to make their efforts and, in particular, some of them are able to make an investment in quality and qualifying infrastructure, which can play a start-up role in the European economy and the global economy, and therefore, as President Obama said in his very recent Hanover speech, it is important that the G7 countries also make an effort to make that investment. Secondly, I think it is essential and that affects us too, the European Union, is the tax issue and especially the issue of tax havens where I think we can do much more and the G7 has great responsibilities. It is also important to involve these countries and not just Europe in the refugee crisis. Canada, Japan, the United States, Australia cannot isolate themselves from this fight. And finally, I'd like to leave just one word, and with that I'm done, on an essential point that is the Zika virus. We talk a lot about Ebola but Zika is coming to Europe, it is already reaching the southern shore of Europe, and it is essential that the G7 tackles this problem.

The agenda of the summit in Japan is very ambitious and so, we hope, are the conclusions, from foreign policy, to climate change, to sustainable development. A central point will be global trade, on which we need a new impetus that will strengthen isolationist tendencies and which will ensure that the rules are respected by all, because only by complying with these rules can global cooperation work. In this respect, in line with the resolution that this Parliament voted on two weeks ago, we hope that a coherent way of relations will be found with China, a fundamental partner, but one that must also be involved in the definition of fair and sustainable trade. This applies above all to the question of granting market economy status, as well as to overcapacity, especially in the steel sector, and to respect for common rules for market access.

Madam President, Mr Vice-President, I would like to thank the commissioner for his work and for his work At the top of the G7 agenda is the global economy, and I believe rightly. There are the following reasons for this. Firstly, the world economy is not growing as fast as it used to, and third-world countries will suffer above all. Secondly, the main engine of the world economy, international trade, is stuttering. And thirdly, of the regions represented at the summit, the eurozone has been holding the red lantern for some time. That is why I would like to give some advice to Presidents Tusk and Juncker on their way to Japan. Firstly, make a commitment to a fresh start in world trade. Key words here are TTIP, CETA and TPP. Globalisation is not just an economic phenomenon. It brings not only goods, services and goods around the world, but also ideas such as democracy and human rights. Secondly, resist the sweet poison of a possible devaluation race. And thirdly, you will certainly be asked why the eurozone has been floundering for years. The answer lies in the one-size-fits-all currency. Currencies must correspond to economic realities. We must stop subjecting the economic, financial and fiscal cultures of the countries to the needs of the currency.

I also share a lot of what the Vice-President has said on a number of important points – I think points that are relevant for the agenda, points where the EU has a lot to show. Against the background of the all the crises that we are facing I think that there are plenty of positive messages, and I am glad that you have raised this.  I also appreciate what you have said about investment, structural reforms and of course sound finances, as well as the distortion of the market and the response the EU has to make in this respect. But you have also used the word confidence, confidence in the markets – I would use ‘confidence’ in a different context: confidence in the G7. I think that the reality is that from the last summits of the G7 we do not have that much to cheer about. The G7 for me is an important forum and it can be a very successful one, but there are ingredients which are absolutely key.  Problems identified – we have mentioned some of them and I think we have plenty of those. Then we need to be able to arrive at a certain degree of consensus if not unanimity. That seems to be much more problematic, which brings me to the third ingredient, namely that it might be key – and that might be an opportunity for the EU,  not just on concrete issues, but in general – to take up leadership. Clearly what the G7 is lacking in recent years is leadership, and the outcome of the G 7 reflects that. That is a reality, and if we look at the agenda, the agenda is full and relevant, but we already know in advance that it is going to be extremely difficult to agree on the common growth strategies. The ministers were unable to agree on it. Hopefully the summit will do better, but on one of the key points on the agenda, clearly we are unable to agree or we have difficulties.  So I would expect President Juncker and President Tusk to show leadership in this respect and not just to show in our windscreens what we can be rightly proud of, but really take up the leadership and deliver.

Instead, I see in the European semester that the proposals on ecological fiscal policy have been reduced and not strengthened. So be brave in this area yourself, and the G7 should realise what it has announced. My second point is that two months ago, this House adopted a report, the Goulard report, calling for stronger rules against conflicts of interest, accountability and transparency of global institutions.

How embarrassing it must be for the EU’s representatives to turn up to each G7 with yet another excuse for economic failure. This time, according to the Commission’s own fact sheet, they intend to claim that despite a more difficult global environment the EU’s recovery continues. That reminds me of the old line about never letting the facts get in the way of a good story. We are told the economy in all Member States will grow next year, albeit unevenly – that is one word for it. The Commission’s G7 factsheet says that investment, although still low compared with pre-crisis levels, is ‘gaining traction’. Traction in my country is what we put patients in when they have serious fractures. Let me remind you that the crisis was in 2008, yet recovery has still not taken a firm hold. The fact sheet hopes to get average unemployment in the EU below 10% in 2017. That is not a fact sheet, it is a wish list. And it is always ‘jam tomorrow’, is it not? As the much-loved British sitcom character Del Boy used to say, ‘this time next year we could be millionaires’. It is not going to happen under the euro, the euro is a losers’ currency.

In this context, its analysis of the fact that most economic factors and indicators have been improved at EU level should be a boost to those countries of the European Union that are not at this level, neither in terms of growth nor in terms of reducing employment and implementing structural reforms. In this regard too, the European Strategic Investment Plan should be a benchmark and an indicator of the direction of further development of a number of Member States.  What seems essential to me for this G7 meeting is that in addition to the topics mentioned by Mr Timmermans, when it comes to jointly finding solutions to both the migration crisis and the refugee crisis, we need to see what the contribution of the European Union can be in linking this crisis to the objectives of sustainable development policy of the European Union and agenda 2030.

I believe that it is also important to go further in terms of bilateral relations and multilateral relations, that is to say, to have solutions that are more binding, more transparent and that introduce reporting, country by country, at international level. The second issue is that of international trade agreements. There is a lack of transparency, we cannot watch helplessly negotiations the content of which we do not know, especially when they concern social, environmental and consumer safety standards. The last issue, which is lacking, is the activity of multinationals and respect for human rights. I believe it is important to guarantee the UN's guiding principles on business and human rights.

But that does require a great deal of effort on the part of the world's major powers and European opinion plays a very important role in creating a more favourable environment, with greater transparency from a commercial point of view, from a budgetary point of view and also from a fiscal point of view, to combat tax evasion and fraud. Because if we do not, in fact, we are creating the conditions for protectionism to come back in force with all the tragic consequences that may result. The second thing I would like to mention here is precisely the need to project the treatment of the refugee issue at the global level.

I have to say to the Honourable Member Giegold, who had two specific questions for me: on the first question I will have to get back to you in writing because I cannot answer you immediately; on the issue of expert groups and conflict of interests in expert groups, we have had a long debate also with the Parliament and with Dennis de Jong, another of your colleagues, on this, and the Commission’s position will be forthcoming before the end of this month on this specific issue. In general, I would like to say that indeed we face huge global economic challenges on the issues we have discussed, but I think drawing up the drawbridge and building walls is not going to get us out of this conundrum. So all those who say we should break with neoliberal policies are right... but I am not sure that is what they are talking about. I think global trade will be necessary to create innovation and growth in the European Union. If you look at the challenge we face, given our demographic situation, then if we stay where we are, the best possible option is to defend what we have, which means, very simply, that we will slow down decline. So if you really want to use the opportunities that global developments are offering, you need to move towards a sustainable economy, you need to embrace the digital single market, you need to create an energy union and you need to make sure that your economy becomes circular. For all of that, you need change. You need to take the necessary steps in that direction. That is the only way we can create enough economic growth which is sustainable, which does not deplete the Earth but which maintains our natural resources and which will enable us to create the social environment that is wanted by the vast majority of Europeans. We need growth for that, given our demographic challenge. That is what the Commission will be advocating in the G7 – to use the opportunity that global trade offers without being naive about the abuse of the elements of global trade if we do not stick to the rules and if we do not have fair play. That is the essence of what we are doing. I do agree with all of those who have said that we need to have an enhanced attention towards implementing the Paris agreements. Again, if you follow my reasoning that we need a sustainable economy, we need to make sure that we slow down global warming and that we actually do what we promised in Paris. For that, concrete measures are necessary and they need to be discussed in the G7 framework. Finally, let me emphasise – and I cannot say this enough – the migration and refugee crisis is here to stay. It is not something that will end if, at last, the war in Syria comes to an end. Look at the huge demographic pressures we will see from Africa and elsewhere. It is in our essential interest that we create sustainable growth in our neighbourhood. And when I talk about our neighbourhood, I mean the wider neighbourhood, including the whole of Africa. The G7 should be talking about that as well. This is about migration, this is about opportunity, this is about decent, rule-of-law-based government and all these things have become factors on a global scale for the decisive choice Europe needs to make: whether we want to export our stability and our prosperity, or whether we want to wait until we import instability and poverty from elsewhere. That, I think, should be the position of the European Union in the deliberations in the G7.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 100, "date": "2016-05-25.json", "name": "Bert Koenders", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, first let me apologise for my late arrival to this important debate. I have already apologised to Mr Telička, Mr Lebreton and also other colleagues here today. We really had a big conflict of interest because of the visit of His Majesty the King, but we have made sure that we made notes. I have heard your comments and would like to reflect also from the side of the Council on some of the issues that you have mentioned in the debate. Now, as the First Vice—President of the Commission said, the G7 leaders will discuss various topics of global importance and, crucially, on which the G7 can provide leadership. The European Union’s internal and external challenges, as we know, are closely intertwined, and therefore it is important for Europe to make use – if I can put it in those words – of this important meeting. We have, more than ever, an interest in being at the G7 since our internal and external security are so intertwined. The issues of migration or terrorism speak for themselves, and we need to take a comprehensive approach to the challenges we face with our other colleagues in the G7. Let me start with an issue which, as you know, is very high on our agenda: the refugee and migration crisis. It is still one of the most urgent and immediate challenges facing us. I think it is not only a true test for our union and our neighbouring states. The European Union has pushed for the issue to be discussed at the level of the G7 in Japan because we are seriously impacted – the rest of the world, by the way, is also impacted – but we see it as a global challenge in need of a global response, and this is why Europeans are making sure these issues receive appropriate attention at a global level. I hope we can become as concrete as possible in these areas. Of course the G7 is not an implementation agency, but it can give the leadership to ensure that is also a global responsibility. Our leaders will update their counterparts on the measures we have taken to address the crisis. Our actions and financial assistance will be more effective if properly integrated in a global effort to address migration issues and promote international peace and security – think about the debates we will have on issues like Syria but, more generally, the transformation in the Middle East. Managing migration is therefore not a European but rather a global responsibility, requiring collective solutions in full respect of our obligations under international law. The G7 is expected to call for a global response. It is a privileged forum, not just to discuss these issues but also to forge partnerships and launch, I hope, collective initiatives for a more equitable burden-sharing. My second point is, of course, the global economy. I think we are constantly reminded that the global economy recovery is too slow, that it does not deliver enough jobs, that downside risks are accumulating, and therefore it is the right time for this group of G7 leaders to clearly signal that securing balanced and inclusive growth not only remains a top priority, but to recall that we have to get our own houses in order in our individual countries. But obviously there is also a collective responsibility. We have seen, I think, that those are the lessons learned by different partners in the G7; that taken in isolation, monetary, fiscal and structural policies do not suffice to boost economic activity in a sustainable way. Additionally, and given recent movements in currency markets, it would also be timely to reaffirm existing exchange rate commitments and call on all to refrain from competitive devaluations and to resist protectionism. This is a risk that we are all faced with, and I think the G7 will have to take some leadership on this. That brings me to the third point: international trade. In 2015, G7 leaders underlined the importance of trade and investment as key drivers of growth, jobs and sustainable development. Tomorrow’s summit will have an important role to play in strengthening the future of the multilateral trade agenda. In this context it is important that on 13 May the council confirmed the broad support for the Commission’s proposals regarding the EU strategic objectives for the post-Nairobi period. Importantly, I think, public trust and support for the free trade agenda has decreased in the context of disappointing global trade in recent years. So we need to get the people back on board, and I think leaders should be clear about the benefits of maintaining economies open and free from protectionism, as well as the importance of multilateral and bilateral trade and investment agreements for growth and jobs. I think it is important that we ensure that we have a much more equal level playing field, and addressing the issue of industrial excess capacity would be part of the solution. Besides that, we should honestly address the concerns of the public. If you look through the history of the world economy, you see that people’s social protection actually leads to openness of international economies and not so much the other way around. Ladies and gentlemen, let me finish with two other issues that I wanted to mention: taxation, another priority that we share with the G7. Now that Panama papers have shown how critical it is to develop and implement international tax standards at the global level, the EU has been at the forefront in fighting tax fraud, tax evasion and aggressive tax planning. We have transposed the exchange of information requirements, adopted the fourth anti-money-laundering directive, which makes available information on beneficial ownership, and I am pleased to report today that the Council has formally adopted – after receiving your opinion – the fourth revision of the directive on administrative cooperation as regards country-by-country reporting for multinationals. I think this is important progress. The Council has also adopted conclusions on an external strategy for effective taxation, calling for the establishment of an EU blacklist for non-cooperative jurisdictions, and Ecofin is working on a possible general approach on the anti-tax avoidance directive. I think it is well legitimate to expect the G7 to show some ambition – I hope a lot of ambition – in this area as well. Then on the two last points: the fight against terrorism will inevitably be a key priority for the summit as well. The heinous terrorist attacks which countries nowadays face are every time a direct assault not only on our security but, as we know, on our values of freedom and equality and our way of life. We cannot and will not retreat in the face of this threat. Since last year’s meeting, while the territory which Daesh previously controlled has shrunk, especially in Syria and Iraq as the group has come under sustained military pressure, the threat it presents to the European Union and its partners across the Middle East and North Africa particularly has grown, and we just have to open the papers to see every day what horrific attacks we see in different parts of the world , especially in the Middle East. The summit here of the G7 will be an opportunity to take not only stock of the measures but to examine what additional steps the G7 could adopt. We hope and expect to endorse an action plan on countering terrorism and violent extremism which will highlight the G7’s commitment to making international cooperation against such threats as effective as possible. Furthermore, leaders will discuss the broader political situation in Syria, Iraq and Libya. They will also discuss Ukraine. It is vital that the commitments taken under the Minsk Agreement are fully implemented and that the parties remain fully engaged in the process. These are challenging times for the G7 on several fronts, for the European Union. That is why I think it is important that we enlarge our community of nations that work pragmatically, but on the basis of our common values, on the issues I just mentioned, on the basis of their commitment to the rule of law and human rights and, very important, to solidarity and promotion of rule-based international orders. These are values that also bind us together as Europeans, and in particular guide your work in this House, and I look forward to a strong message of confidence by G7 leaders and to their guidance on policy actions on the several fronts.

It is key to ensure the public’s trust in data flows: trust that is based on a proper framework of protection. Of all transfers of personal data outside the European Union, the transatlantic flow is by far the most important one, be it for commercial or law-enforcement purposes. It is in the interest of the Union and its citizens that the European Union/US privacy shield ensures this certainty and trust, especially after the Schrems judgment by the Court of Justice of last October. This has shown there is legal uncertainty in this area of vital importance for the transatlantic economy. It is also important for European medium-sized businesses, as they are dependent on this adequacy decision – for lack of other instruments – to ensure safe data transfers to the United States. The Commission should fully take into account the Court’s ruling on the safe harbour regime. The new adequacy decision must provide a level of data protection that respects the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Treaties, as well as the standards set by recent case law. Strong safeguards are the key to restore the public’s trust when it comes to transatlantic data flows. The Council trusts the Commission to ensure the highest possible data protection standards, including clear and directly-applicable principles such as purpose-limitation, rights of the data subject to access and correct their data or to object against the processing, and an effective system of oversight-enforcement and redress of possibilities. Furthermore, the Council supports the efforts of the Commission in working with the United States on improving some aspects of the privacy shield and hence ensure a legally and politically sustainable framework. In that regard I believe, for example, that bulk collection by the United States should only be acceptable under certain circumstances. In that same spirit I welcome the creation of the position of an ombudsperson as an additional mechanism for the handling of complaints submitted by citizens. For the transatlantic transfer of personal data for commercial purposes, the Council considers that the Commission should adopt its adequacy decision on this new transatlantic framework in a speedy manner while ensuring data protection rights. The Council also welcomes the agreement reached in the negotiations between the Commission and its United States counterparts. We are confident that the ongoing internal negotiations on the side of the Union between the Commission and national administrations will lead to a positive outcome, thus paving the way for the new framework to enter into force. As regards data protection in the area of criminal law enforcement, the Council aims at adopting a decision to sign the Umbrella Agreement in time for the agreement to be signed on 2 June at the EU/ US Justice and Home Affairs ministerial meeting in Amsterdam. Shortly thereafter the Council will ask the European Parliament’s consent to conclude the agreement. The agreement does not provide a basis for the transfer of personal data across the Atlantic but will enhance cooperation between the European Union and the United States by setting common data protection standards in this area. This is good news from the European perspective, as the US commits to respecting higher standards than in the past when receiving personal data from Europe, and I think that is very necessary. Thus the agreement will significantly contribute to restoring trust in transatlantic data flows for the purpose of fighting serious crime by adding a supplemental layer of data protection requirements on both the Union and the United States. The Council considers that the agreement represents a clear improvement to the current situation, notably as regards judicial redress, where the US has so far for the first time agreed to extend such rights to EU citizens. This means an EU citizen can now benefit from equal treatment and will have the same judicial redress rights as US citizens. That is why we hope that this Parliament will share our positive assessment of this agreement. The European Union has a great interest in facilitating smooth and safe transfers of personal data to the US that ensure the respect of our citizens’ fundamental rights, both in the commercial and in the law-enforcement area. For example, an EU citizen’s name is identical to that of a suspect in a transatlantic criminal investigation. Their data has been transferred from the EU to the US and erroneously gets collected and included on a US blacklist. The EU citizen now has the right to request their name to be deleted by the authorities. To give you another example in the area of commercial data flows, the privacy shield will offer a significantly-enhanced system of oversight and enforcement, which will enhance the credibility of the system. In the law enforcement area, we will be able to offer strict data protection requirements as well as basic rights to access and correction to our citizens in all instruments covered by the scope of the Umbrella Agreement. Therefore, we hope that the Commission will soon take a decision on the EU/US privacy shield that fully respects the data protection acquis and which will be good for business as well. We are also confident that the Umbrella Agreement is a step in the right direction, as it strengthens legal safeguards for our citizens and enables effective transatlantic cooperation to fight serious crimes.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 108, "date": "2016-05-25.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr. President and honourable Members of the European Parliament, Mr Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am pleased to be here again to speak on the important topic of transatlantic data flows. As you know, the Commission has been working on several fronts to restore trust in transatlantic data flows following the Snowden revelations in 2013. The key measures include the adoption of the EU data protection reform, the Umbrella Agreement for data exchanged for law enforcement purposes, and the new EU-US Privacy Shield to ensure a higher level of data protection for commercial transfers of personal data. The EU-US Privacy Shield arrangement is essential for the continuation of transatlantic data flows while guaranteeing our citizens the fundamental right to the protection of their personal data. We negotiated the Privacy Shield with the US on the basis of two sets of guiding principles. First, our 13 recommendations of November 2013 and, of course, the criteria set by the Court of Justice in the Schrems ruling. Following two years of talks, I am convinced we have overcome the weaknesses of the old Safe Harbour system. Let me briefly summarise the main improvements. First, US companies receiving personal data from Europe will have to comply with stricter rules on how to use and read that information, and their compliance will be monitored closely and proactively by the relevant US authorities. Second, individuals will have access to a number of redress mechanisms to ensure that any complaint will be properly investigated and resolved. Third, we have received written commitments and assurances on the limitations and safeguards when personal data are accessed by US public authorities. This concerns in particular the sensitive area of national security. More specifically, the US Government has assured us that bulk collection will be used only in exceptional circumstances and that even then it applies filters and other technical means to minimise the data collected. We have received an explicit assurance that there is no mass or indiscriminate surveillance. It is the first time we have obtained anything like this from the US side. It is a crucial and central element that makes for a more robust framework than the Safe Harbour ever was. Fourth, as part of the Privacy Shield framework, the US Government will for the first time create an ombudsperson mechanism that will ensure that complaints or enquiries from EU individuals on national security access are addressed in a timely manner. I believe that this too is a major and unprecedented achievement, and again, nothing remotely comparable existed under the old Safe Harbour. This will apply to all transatlantic data transfer be, they under the Shield or under the modes of transfer. Finally, once put in place, the privacy issue will be continuously monitored, in particular through an annual joint review. During this process, we will check that the various oversight and redress mechanisms are operating effectively, and we have formulated clear conditions for suspending our adequacy decision in case commitments are not met by the US or answers given in the annual joint review are not satisfactory. As you know, the independent data protection authorities brought together in the Article 29 Working Party issued their opinion on the Privacy Shield on 13 April. They have welcomed the positive elements in the shield and the improvements compared to the Safe Harbour. But they have also voiced some concerns and recommended further improvements. We take this expertise very seriously, and we are now working on the more critical aspects and are adapting the adequacy decision accordingly. Some of these recommendations can only be addressed in agreement with the US Government, and we are in discussions with them on those points. That includes, for instance, clarifying the independence and functioning of the ombudsperson mechanism and making more explicit the principle of limited data retention. This is an important exercise if we want our data protection authorities, individual consumers and companies to have full confidence in the new arrangement. The Member States support us in this approach, and we trust that our US counterparts also realise the importance of these further clarifications. Once we have reached the necessary qualifications and improvements, we will then submit the draft to the Member States in the Article 31 Committee. Our target remains to have the framework up and running by summer. That brings me to the other important file which will soon be submitted to the European Parliament for its constant: the Umbrella Agreement. This agreement seeks to ensure the protection of personal data exchanged between the EU and the US for the purpose of law enforcement cooperation. The signature of the Umbrella Agreement is expected to take place at the EU-US Justice and Home Affairs Ministerial meeting in Amsterdam on 2 June. Parliament will be asked for its consent before the Council can decide to conclude this agreement. I seek your support for the Umbrella Agreement as it will bring clear improvements to the protection of personal data transmitted in the course of transatlantic law enforcement cooperation compared to today’s situation. As you know, the Umbrella Agreement is not an agreement that authorises data transfers, nor is it an adequacy decision. Rather, it adds the necessary data protection safeguards to existing transfer agreements between the EU or its Member States and the United States or where transfers are carried out based on national law. Many of these existing instruments for law enforcement cooperation with the US have no – or very few – data protection safeguards. This is the unfortunate status quo that the Umbrella Agreement seeks to tackle. Without the Umbrella Agreement, this unsatisfactory situation would continue for many years to come. Where personal data of US persons are transferred to Europe, they already profit from the high level of data protection afforded by other rules, be it at EU or national level. Therefore, the Umbrella Agreement aims at rectifying the existing imbalance of protections on both sides of the Atlantic. This way, the agreement will also restore trust in transatlantic data transfers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 109, "date": "2016-05-25.json", "name": "Axel Voss", "mepid": "96761", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which Minister!

In my view, however, a 'sunset clause' is not necessary at all, because we have a strong annual monitoring mechanism, which can then also constantly eliminate the so-called left-overs. It is not necessary because we need a permanent, stable and legally secure framework, nor is it necessary, because that would ultimately make these annual reviews superfluous. I also think that we should wait for this new mechanism to work before it can even be stopped, and in the end it is really just a matter of distrust of the Commission to accompany this procedure sensibly. However, I also believe that the Commission has learned its lessons here. In my opinion, the demand for a data protection shield is also politically ridiculous, because one simply does not want to make a decision, is it enough to have a privacy shield or is not enough, and then you actually have a certain disorientation. However, it is important that we also ensure a certain degree of legal certainty for our companies, SMEs and start-ups, provide concrete frameworks for transatlantic data traffic, and that is why we would support the Privacy Shield.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her This is a subject that has been a concern for us here for a very long time. In fact, we have discussed Safe Harbour in a wide variety of formations, controversially, and there has always been an uncertainty, which was ultimately resolved only by a citizen's complaint, and this Schrems judgment has gone down in history and shown us that it is very important that we remove uncertainties. The Privacy Shield attempts to eliminate these uncertainties. You presented the guidelines to us in February, and it is clear that progress has been made, that we have also been able to clarify certain things with the American partners, also in accordance with the case law here. I believe, however, that it is still a situation where we still have uncertainties, where we do not really have the great clarity yet, and that, of course, also means the risk of ending up in court again. That would not necessarily be positive for our image as legislators, as executives, and it is not positive for industry either. We – the LIBE Committee – were in the Us last week, and we could see that there is a great understanding of the European position, that there is a will in the United States to updo the principles of jurisprudence. This applies to public authorities as well as to the data industry. I believe that more could have been achieved, but I believe that this resolution lays down the criteria that are very important. We need more clarity, especially when such phrases as 'written assurance' are used, what is the legal nature of this, we need clarity on the ombudsman. This was not so clear as we have seen, and the judicial redress, which is so important, should also be seen from this point of view, whether the phrase 'only for EU citizens' is not enough, because we also have third-country nationals in Europe who are protected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights. So these uncertainties need to be removed. It is important that we have these agreements, and the framework agreement is also a great step forward, because we could not have achieved anything on our own. We can only do this together.

Mr President, transatlantic data transfer is essential for our economy, security and trade. With the Privacy Shield, we are now achieving an unprecedented level of data protection.  It's a very big step in the right direction. The rights and legal protection of EU citizens when transferring data to the US are greatly improved. However, some political groups and MePs continue to believe that only a copy of European law can suffice. But this is simply not realistic.  The United States is an independent nation and an important strategic ally of the EU, but we must not forget that they are not members of the Union. Of course, the European Commission must look at how the Privacy Shield can offer the highest possible standard. The new rules must also be able to pass a possible test by the Court of Justice, so that our companies and SMEs are not in a situation of legal uncertainty.

The problem is that this privacy shield is very unlikely to be operational. We are here today thanks to a young man called Max Schrems who was stubborn enough to litigate before the court for many, many years and to do what the EU institutions should have done, namely stand up for the interests of the EU citizens. Because I recall that this House has called repeatedly for the repeal of safe harbour and the Commission did not move, so it took one Austrian student to make sure that safe harbour was repealed. Now I am not the least bit convinced that things like written assurances or an ombudsman or a review are going to do the trick. My doubts are shared and in different wordings by Working Party 29, Working Party 31, the EDPS and various legal experts. So I do not understand why we have to keep repeating the same mistakes over and over again. We have a responsibility and a duty to make good-quality legislation and here it seems to me that the Commission is ready to take a decision knowing that it will not stand up in court. This is not about making political compromises – you know, maybe I could agree with Mr Voss or maybe not – that is all not relevant. There is only one yardstick: is this, yes or no, Schrems-proof? And I am not yet convinced that it is. It is an improvement, it is a step forward, and I am glad that the Commission is willing to discuss further adaptations, but ultimately this is also about the US getting access to a market of 500 million consumers, so they too have an interest in moving. Finally, we did not say anything about the umbrella agreement in the resolution, we will come back to it, but I would really like two things. I would like, first of all, for the European Commission, before we talk about giving consent or anything, to finally declassify the reply it gave to the question of LIBE about the legal status and the scope of the umbrella agreement compared with other legal instruments – really give us this information. This is only a legal assessment, how secret can it be? Secondly, the Commission itself has clearly stated that removing the exemptions to the Privacy Act in the US is a precondition for the umbrella agreement to be valid.

If you look at this sign, which is supposed to protect our fundamental right, the fundamental right of 500 million people here in the European Union to privacy, this sign turns out to be a sign made of papier-maché, which softens at the first rain. It is a terrible thing that it took a ECJ ruling to overturn Safe Habor. And now, with what it has presented, to the kind applause of the local grand coalition, the Commission is countering this very verdict. Not even the demand for a 'sunset clause' could be won by the majority of this House, that would have been the least. After all, everyone in this area knows very well that the repackaged agreement has no treaty character at all and is not enshrined in law.

Yes, several issues have been clarified, but no, the legal system of the United States has not changed, and this is actually what the European Court of Justice has said: the legal system does not provide for adequate safeguards. And yes, we know – let us be honest – that those changes will not come tomorrow. We will not achieve that now. So the question is: while we are lining up all the criticism with regard to the insufficiencies which are out there, do we say: yes, there needs to be renegotiation in the future; yes, there needs to be re-opening of these files, because we are not there? Or are we saying: no, everything is fine, everything serves for adequate safeguards and we just will vote for it and for the future it will stand, although the Court may take it down again? I think that is dishonest. So the only honest action at the moment would be to set a sunset clause to limit the validity, and that is what we are bringing forward for this resolution.

Mr President, one of the greatest risks that the rapid evolution of technology has created in modern man is the interception of personal data from social networking websites and their processing by unauthorised persons. Particularly in the United States, this risk has taken on enormous proportions, because the legislation itself allows our intelligence services, our well-known C.I.A. and the National Security Agency, the NsA, to collect, process and retain such information, many times over a period of more than five years.  Indeed, in the name of the US national interest, these services may collect and process information not only of Americans, but also of nationals of other States, in their own states.

It is extremely important in this digital age, which is not just a digital economy, to strengthen trust and security in transatlantic data exchanges and to ensure legal certainty for businesses and citizens, based on a robust legal framework, in data protection regimes that are equivalent and less vulnerable to criminal use, which clearly still does not happen in the United States.

To ensure a right solution for transnational data flow is especially important for SMEs that have less legal and investment possibilities and which will be the important beneficiaries of such an instrument.

I believe that it is a good approach to rebuild the transatlantic trust and strengthen the data protection rights on both sides of the Atlantic.

Among others, it strengthens Member States’ data protection authorities’ role in the process of claims investigations. The legal remedies are strengthened for EU citizens and residents also by the creation of an ombudsperson, and it would work on both sides of the Atlantic.

We must therefore enforce the strict obligations imposed by companies on the personal data of European citizens and the monitoring of compliance with these obligations, but first of all we must highlight the transparency obligations borne by the United States, with truly effective redress procedures.

Of course, as defined under the new regulation, US public authorities are supposed to have access to personal data and do so, supposedly, under restrictions and under supervision, so that there is no generalised access.  At the same time, Europeans should have the right to request an investigation or to file complaints in the event of a breach of their personal data.

But doubts persist, and it is very important that we keep our guard very high to ensure the adequacy of this new privacy shield agreement with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

It is always very important that that we hold it and it is also inspiring for the Commission, both for myself and my colleagues. You are right that the flow of data from the European Union to the United States is really massive. We needed to come forward soon with the new system which will protect the data of European citizens, not because of big companies which have this data flow as a basis for their business, but, as has been mentioned here several times, it was also in the interests of European small and medium—sized enterprises, for which it was a real disaster that they appeared in legal uncertainty. This is just the circumstance which we had to take into account when we worked on this issue after the court ruling – and also before, of course. We needed strong assurances from our American counterparts. We needed to achieve legal certainty and to put an end to uncertainties where the companies were in a very difficult situation. During the negotiations I called our situation and the way we wanted to conclude these negotiations ‘trust and check’. We need to have elementary trust towards our American partners that they will comply with their own laws and that they will do what they have committed themselves to in the official letters signed at the highest possible level. I will share with you today that I cannot say that that Privacy Shield, as a mechanism to protect EU citizens’ data in the United States, is perfect. It cannot be perfect and I will never be totally satisfied with it, because there were objective reasons why we could not achieve more. One is the matter of the American legal order, which Mr Albrecht very rightly pointed out here. We do not have any power to change legislation in the United States, but we will keep monitoring developments in this field in the United States and we have expressed many times our conviction that the data will be better protected in America if they have the proper data protection law. We cannot do much more. The second objective, where we could not do more, is access to data for national security purposes. Look at the situation in Europe. Here the Commission and the European Union does not have any power to ask the secret services to be more transparent and to inform people whether they are using their data or not. Not even the Member States can do that. Certainly we wanted a similar thing when we negotiated the conditions in the United States. So these were our limits. I must say very openly that we are not fully satisfied, but we are satisfied in the sense that we achieved the maximum which was possible. But what is more important is that we must not be satisfied for the future. Satisfaction must not be our leading principle for the years to come, because the Commission has committed itself – I have committed myself and my colleagues – to monitor on a continuous basis what is happening in the United States. We will do it in a very transparent way through the annual reviews, where we expect all who are to contribute to input the trustworthy data showing the illustration of the situation as it stands, both in the United States and in the European Union. I think that this annual review and the very strong suspension clause is quite a strong safeguard and strong measure. I am convinced that we do not need any sunset clause, as has been proposed here. Mrs Sophie in 't Veld is absolutely right that the Schrems ruling helped us. I am sorry we waited for it from the moment when we knew that this has been lodged at the court, because we were already convinced before the ruling that the decision would give us proper arguments and proper benchmarks, which will help us negotiate this stronger position. I must say that it helped in the negotiations and we very precisely took article by article in the Schrems ruling and we renegotiated in a very tough way with the American partners, referring to the court decision. I cannot be sure that the new court ruling will not be as strict as the previous one, but I am confident that we tailored the Privacy Shield system on the requirement of the court. So again, we did our best. On the Umbrella Agreement, I do not know about a situation where we would keep some something secret. There were many written questions, which we answered, to the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE). I would like to ask you again not only for your support for the Privacy Shield but also for the Umbrella Agreement because, as I said in my opening speech, this is a real improvement in the protection of data in the exchange between law enforcement authorities. We should take into very serious consideration that this is also about the data of witnesses and victims of criminal offences, and this plays an important role in the strengthening of cooperation between the EU and the US in criminal justice and security matters, because we all know that the security situation is worsening and that we will have to do everything we can to have better, swifter and safer cooperation between the law enforcement authorities in the United States and the European Union. So I would like to ask you again for your support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 134, "date": "2016-05-25.json", "name": "Bert Koenders", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, honourable Members, Ladies and Gentlemen. First of all, thank you very much for this debate, and thank you to the Commission for your clarification about the Privacy Shield and the further planning. I think this debate makes clear that smooth data flows can never mean uncontrolled and unchecked data flows. The basis of data flows should always be the trust of our citizens that the data are being used in a just and prudent way both in Europe and the United States. And if a citizen has the feeling that this is not the case, he or she should be able to object to this use. At the same time we know – and I think that many Members have expressed this today – the enormous importance of smooth data flows for governments, companies and American and European citizens, who are reaping the benefits of this. It means companies are being enabled to operate more effectively and efficiently on the European and American side of the Atlantic, and therefore we are talking about a very important issue. It also means we will be able to fight crime more effectively and increase the security of both our continents. So we have to see to what extent this can all benefit us, and I think the proposal that has been made is therefore so important. First, on the Umbrella Agreement. I think – and I refer to many questions that were asked on this – it is important to say that the agreement itself does not constitute a legal basis for the transfer of personal data, it only supplements other agreements with a common set of data protection safeguards. I think that is very important. Finally, as you know, the agreement can be suspended in cases where the parties do not live up to it. So that is important. A few questions were raised on the ombudsperson. I think also here we have to underline the fact that the ombudsperson is an additional mechanism compared to other systems. So, in itself, it is not sufficient legal protection. It will not replace more substantive forms of legal protection, and I believe that it is a step forward that the United States has been willing to create this mechanism and trust that the handling of complaints submitted will be conducted in a proper manner. I would like to point out that the ombudsperson does not fulfil its position in isolation but, as stated in Annex III, works in cooperation with the internal regulators of the agencies who will need to provide information and answer questions. I would say that also many EU Member States provide for an ombudsperson-type oversight on intelligence activities in our countries. I think, correctly, it was pointed out that the arrest was, if you wish, a catalyst for something that is, I think, a very improved deal. The Court was important; it reminded us that an essentially equivalent level of data protection in a third country can only be met if government access to the third country meets the standards of necessity and proportionality. If a third country allows for massive and indiscriminate collection of data, the standards are not met, and in this case the representations by the various US government officials clearly indicated that the US has adopted laws and policies combined with a system of oversight and redress possibilities in order to avoid the massive and indiscriminate collection of data. The main rule is: targeted collection of data, bulk collection, is secondary, and bulk collection, if based on a proper legal standard and with sufficient safeguards to protect the rights and interests of data subjects, is acceptable, since it is not massive and indiscriminate collection of data. Then about the ‘sunset clause, I do not want to repeat; I agree with what has been said by the Commissioner. I know it is a big point of discussion also in your Parliament. I agree in this case with Mr Voss that we do not need such a sunset clause, since there is a strong element of annual review and monitoring foreseen in the agreement. Finally, I would say that we deem that the Privacy Shield and the Umbrella Agreement offer the safeguards needed to justify our citizens’ trust. We hope, therefore, also, that the European Parliament will consider all the positive aspects. It is also true here to say that the better is the enemy of the good. It is important that we can now make progress on this; it is important for our citizens and our businesses – EU citizens in particular – when consent is given, hopefully to the conclusion of the agreement.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 135, "date": "2016-05-25.json", "name": "Isabella Adinolfi (EFDD)", "mepid": "124831", "text": "  in writing. – Data flows between the EU and the US are the most intense in the world and are an essential element in trade relations, especially for US multinationals. In October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the Safe Harbour decision by ruling that national supervisory authorities can assess the adequacy of the level of protection guaranteed by a third country and in the event of suspending the transfer of data. The Commission has thus drafted a new decision, known as the 'Privacy Shield' in order to ensure respect for the privacy and personal data of European citizens. This decision, however, does not guarantee an adequate level of protection and protection of the fundamental right to the protection of personal data. In the USA, in fact, the data of foreigners are nothing more than a good that can be used as best you believe without any respect for privacy.

The fact that, because of lower requirements compared to EU data protection law, the agreement gives a comparative advantage to US companies. I believe that there is also the possibility that the agreement will be found invalid in the future, just as it did in the case of the Safe Harbour agreement.

In the area of health, where we can bring a relationship closer to our citizens, only consistent action by the Commission is necessary and permissible.  The increased incidence of chronic diseases, including cancers associated with hormones such as breast cancer and prostate cancer, and the increased number of diabetic patients and reproductive problems obliges us to act.  All the more so because the hormonal disruptors we associate with all of the above have great potential for irreversible effects, and the cost of treatment is estimated at a high of €150 billion a year. Given the fact that, for a number of reasons, the health coffers are already limited, preventive action at union level is necessary and economically justified.

Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Theresa May for Thank you, Commissioner, for the announcement today and the statement before the June meeting. I'm happy about that. I am also pleased to see the opportunity to talk about scientific criteria for endocrine disruptors.  But I would like to remind you of the history we have. This is one of the more striking cases where EU law has been deliberately ignored and disregarded for other interests. For more than two years, the Commission has completely ignored the presentation of scientific criteria, although since December 2013 it has been obliged to present them. We must have these criteria. They are necessary to enable us to continue our work and phase out hazardous chemicals. I'll be clear in case the message hasn't gone through. It is unacceptable to ignore obligations imposed by the Commission under EU law. European citizens, the European Parliament, eu countries and the Court of Justice expect the Commission to respect its duty through the Eu Treaty, to promote the health of its citizens, and these are not trifles we are talking about.  Endocrine disruptors are all around us. They are found in food packaging, in our children's toys, in our clothes, in our drinking water, and they are linked to a wide range of diseases. Diabetes, various cancers and problems with fertility, and it is particularly ominous that young children and fetuses are particularly sensitive to these chemicals, the effects of which may manifest themselves much later in life. It is therefore to be welcomed that the Commission has now signalled that it will finally discuss the scientific criteria in the College in mid-June. The Commission can be sure that there are many of us who will follow that meeting closely, and I would urge the Commission here to take account of the European Parliament's previous positions on the criteria.  Led by the S&amp;D Group, Parliament has repeatedly strongly opposed the Commission's proposal to introduce potency as a demarcating criterion for the definition of endocrine disruptors. Such a demarcation would unduly limit the definition of endocrine disruptors and make it scientifically deficient and therefore incompatible with the classification of carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction.  The fact that potency is not allowed to become a guiding factor in the criteria is a key issue, not only for us in the S&amp;D Group and the European Parliament, but also for many Member States. I would therefore like to emphasise once again very clearly to the Commission that we will not accept such a model. Among the options analysed is the roadmap published by the Commission in 2014.

The Commissioner has accepted the December court ruling and has publicly committed to hastening the adoption of the criterion. I welcome that. In addition, we have legal advice from Parliament’s services which has acknowledged that taking further action against the Commission would be superfluous given that, as soon as the criteria are published, there would no longer be a case.  So I look forward to the work that we will begin in June when we see the criteria. I would just like to take this opportunity to restate my own position, which is that these criteria must be scientifically robust and fit for regulatory purpose. They need to ensure that human health and the environment are protected, taking into account the possible consequences for the agri-food sector and the need to encourage innovation and the development of new plant protection solutions. Parliament must be serious about supporting the Commission’s initiatives on better regulation and improved evidence-based policy making.

Let me quote from the legal opinion from the Parliament’s Legal Service, which is really crystal clear – and be aware that people from the Legal Service are the most cautious people on planet Earth, and when they are so crystal clear, there is really something there. Let me quote: ‘There is no doubt that, to date, the Commission has not yet taken the measures required under Article 266 of the Treaty in order to comply with the General Court’s judgment.’  That is more than crystal clear. Simply, the Commission is not complying with the Court’s ruling. So when the Commissioner starts his statement with: ‘Once again we are discussing this topic’, this is not because we as Parliament want to continuously discuss this. It is because the Commission is refusing to comply with the Court’s ruling – the Court’s ruling that was crystal clear in saying that no impact assessment of the social and economic consequences was necessary before the independent scientific criteria would be set.  In the correspondence between President Juncker and President Schulz, President Juncker was still talking about the necessity to first finalise this impact assessment. Commissioner, can you please assure us that the Commission is not going to firstly finalise this impact assessment before setting these scientific criteria? European Union citizens are losing trust in the European Union.

And it can make you very sick: breast cancer, testicular cancer, fertility problems. This is just a sampling of all the ailments you can get from it.  Just this week, doctors sounded the alarm because of these substances in medical devices, such as infusions and respiratory hoses. Children can get sick of this for the rest of their lives.  The European Commission is structurally refusing to remove these sickeners from the market, deliberately putting the health of 500 million citizens at risk. In doing so, she is ignoring her own laws and is flotiling a ruling by the European Court. That's a big scandal.  My group has today agreed to a resolution on endocrine disruptors, but as far as I am concerned this Commission needs a much stronger signal. As far as I am concerned, this Commission would not have been here after today either.  This Commission is in reserve time. If the Commission does not act immediately, I guarantee you that there will be another vote of no confidence before this summer.

It is not that we are against an impact assessment; the point is, for this required action of the Commission, an impact assessment is not required. And every time you then replied: ‘But what is wrong, are you against an impact assessment?’.  You were always dodging the issue and therefore we asked for another legal opinion. There is a very clear Court ruling saying the Commission is not complying with its own rules. So we asked again for a legal opinion – my colleague Gerbrandy has already quoted from it, so I will take some other quotes just to make it very clear once more: ‘The General Court rejected the Commission's argument that an impact assessment was required’. It has been rejected! And still the spokesperson of the Commission back in December, in response to the General Court's ruling, was saying: ‘We are continuing, we are on track for the impact assessment’. In the letter from Mr Juncker to Mr Schulz, he was also pointing out that: ‘We are here, working on an impact assessment’. And the conclusion from the Legal Service – and that is indeed the same conclusion that Mr Gerbrandy was noting – is that the Commission has not yet taken the measures required under the Treaty.  That is why we are discussing this here again. We want scientific criteria. You are still not delivering on that. That they will be coming in June, it does not matter, you are too late with that, but you are still using the argument that an impact assessment is needed.

Possible related diseases are reproductive, behavioral, learning diseases, cancer and, most likely, obesity and diabetes. But the citizens must also know that the European Commission should have defined the list of these endocrine disruptors, but it has not done so. The Commission was therefore condemned by the Court of Justice for failing to comply and, despite this, completely disregarded the provisions of the Court of Justice.

Madam President, Commissioner, endocrine disruptors are a serious and widespread structural threat to people's health, as our citizens come into contact with these substances on a daily basis. That is why such a subject deserves the European institutions, which have regulatory and regulatory powers, to take real responsibility. And in this, the Commission has failed in its task. On the one hand, the reasonable period between the publication of the regulation and that of the delegated acts is not respected. However, neither institutional complexity nor the need for impact assessment is acceptable to justify such a delay in the face of the importance of the health issue. I also point out that, while the European Regulation is directly applicable throughout the Union, the Commission gives itself the luxury of hanging out to publish delegated acts. This is an illustration of regulatory opacity. It is good to want to legislate better, but it must be applied to oneself. On the other hand, the seriousness of the danger requires that there be no debate on the assessment method and that one does not wait for clear evidence to act. Worse still, using an impact study to try to define criteria for endocrine disruptors before the publication of delegated acts is a diversion from regulatory authority. The Commission therefore avoids its responsibilities and the disclosure of its true intentions. It also contributes to the deterioration of the sense of decision-making, the lack of transparency at the very source of regulation and the dispersion of power. The Commission has committed serious and serious misconduct and yet appears to be ignoring the requests of the Court of Justice. However, the motion of censure was a strong political act to punish the Commission. No, Dear Lamberts, this is not a disproportionate tool, it is part of the rules of power and, today, I have the impression that some unlucky groups want to get out of this case, where Parliament would be very complicit in the Commission for its inaction.

Allowing low-potency endocrine disruptors to be marketed would be very serious, as it would be risky for exposure to them that turns them into deadly poisons.

Second, I would like to mention about scientific opinions. You mentioned scientists in common positions, speaking about potency and other things. Now, it was my intention to invite different scientists, to organise several debates, and then to organise a platform and today they have a common position. Of course in this position many issues are on the table.  Some of you raised questions about the issue that the Commission is in delay. Yes, of course. We started with a roadmap, with four options. It started with possibilities to deal with, how to describe and define, final scientific criteria. Interim scientific criteria are in place and you know this very well. And the Commission follows interim criteria. Some of you spoke about how to regulate. All things related to the Plant Protection Regulation and the Biocidal Products Regulation are under Commission supervision and we follow interim criteria, and our consumers are protected in this area.

The European Commission, Parliament and the Member States have been working to correct this. Together we have enacted legislation on electronic identities and signatures: e-ID, e-procurement, and of course the Connecting Europe Facility for digital service infrastructure. All of them will help to remove these digital barriers. It is now time to utilise this joint work so that we create a new generation of eGovernment services that will help to create growth and jobs, the digital single markets and to rebuild people’s trust in governments. It was with this objective in mind that the European Commission presented its eGovernment Action Plan in April. This plan can be the political instrument to advance the digital transformation of public administrations across the European Union. It will address the problems faced by people, businesses and public administrations through the strategic objectives set out in the Digital Single Market strategy. The plan has three main aims: firstly, to modernise public administrations using key technical building blocks; secondly, to achieve movements across a border using interoperable digital public services; thirdly, to facilitate digital interaction between administrations, people and businesses for high-quality public services. The EU eGovernment Action Plan runs to 2020 and will promote the take-up of eID, one of the digital service infrastructures funded by the Connecting Europe Facility. The European Commission is promoting this through awareness campaigns and also through public and private sector grants for its implementation. Digital-by-default is one of the underlying principles guiding the work of the new eGovernment Action Plan. Many Member States are applying or intending to apply the digital-by-default principle while keeping other channels open for those who are unwilling or unable to interact via the internet with governments. All activities and initiatives led by the Commission will be prepared in line with our better regulation standards. This includes assessing the ICT impact of Commission proposals. Public-private cooperation is required if there is to be a needs-based service delivery. This also applies to collaborative service creation and the private sector’s provision of services based on open public sector information. The Commission strongly supports this kind of collaboration as well as the private sector’s involvement in jointly creating online solutions. The Commission also funds several innovation projects under Horizon 2020 in this area. Since open data is essential for developing such services, the Commission recommends that the public sector make its data available electronically. It will itself guide the way forward by making its data available through the European Data Portal. ‘Once only’ is another key underlying principle of the eGovernment Action Plan. Applying this principle in the European Union could generate annual net savings of around EUR 5 billion per year by 2017. The principle means that people and businesses should supply the same information once only to a public administration. Public administration shares this data internally with due respect for data protection rules, so that there is no additional burden for people or businesses. Rather than forcing them to fit around these processes, it calls for the reorganisation of public sector internal processes. The Commission is considering applying the ‘once only’ principle in several policies. Under the Horizon 2020 programme it has called for a pilot scheme driven by Member States for applying the ‘once only’ principle across borders for businesses. The Commission is considering the gradual roll-out of this principle in its interactions with suppliers and grant participants. It will examine the possibilities for introducing the ‘once only’ principle for other interested parties. I would like to conclude by emphasising the need to support the use of e-ID. It is essential for ensuring a high take-up of digital public services. Together with the digital-by-default and ‘once only’ principles this will guarantee less administrative burden for people and businesses.

The need for these digital electronic identification options is increasing on a daily basis, because more and more citizens are now also using services that can only be used safely – and certainly in the interests of citizens and users on the one hand, but also certainly in accordance with the legal requirements on the other. And for that we need secure, reliable services. There are, of course, – and you yourself come from Estonia – a number of Member States of the European Union that have already taken the first steps. The Estonian Prime Minister was only in Berlin at the beginning of the week at the Federal Government's retreat and presented these plans. In Germany, there is already a pioneer, which unfortunately is used very little, because the connection of the identity document to digital business must ultimately be done via an interface that has not yet been sufficiently clarified. Estonia has developed very quickly. However, I believe that we must agree that every new means that we use in the European Union has one imperative: absolute data security for users and absolute security, as far as it is required by the public. That is why we should try to establish the internal market through electronic identification. We should not now develop 28 different national systems, and then look at how we can combine them. At the same time, however, we should also take seriously the legitimate concerns of the Member States and economic operators for safe procedures and work together to find ways in which the European Union can take an important step into the digital future with the eGovernment Action Plan.

Modernising society, which we need and these new resources made available to us through digitalisation, can also mean very many very positive advances, and we should make use of them. However, and I agree with the previous speaker on this, we must ensure that these funds that are made available are secure. Data protection is extremely important, and we must also ensure that it is important, especially for our companies, which sometimes also have to transfer sensitive data, that the hacking of this data is prevented, that security in these areas is particularly high and that it cannot be used by certain people for which the data is not intended. This is an enormous challenge, because it is not just about the means, the possibilities of combining one with the other, it is also about all the avenues and also the apparatuses on both sides, which must be just as safe. When we hear how easy it is to eavesdrop on something, we have to be very careful.

E-government and everything that goes with it, such as e-identification, should be encouraged as much as possible. A legitimate question has already been asked about the visibility of the instruments that already exist, which are often unknown to citizens: a problem that we often have to deal with in Europe. In the context of e-government, I also think that it is very important that we make more and more use of the 'only once' principle, because the complex application procedures and administrative burdens that come with it often constitute a barrier for businesses and citizens.

So it is the same with the digital revolution. It creates new opportunities but it also has new challenges around cyber security and privacy, so therefore I think that the digital identity should be at the heart of our digital policies. E-ID will be the key to address challenges of privacy and cyber security and to the growth of digital economy. All these passwords, logins and all that is needed, are needed to be replaced by online measures which are secure. Edward Lucas wrote in his book Cyberphobia about this trend for passwords for everything, and he says that it is a recipe for catastrophe because it is a system which is very difficult for the humans to remember but very easy for the computer to guess. So many Member States have already developed means of online identification, but in some countries citizens are not even aware of this, because they do not have any online services that they can use e-identity for. So what is the incentive to do it in the first place? Therefore I have two questions for the Vice-President. Given that from September 2018 all Member States will be required to recognise all notified national E-ID means, what will be the concrete actions taken to ensure that this is implemented in time but also that Member States have the online services available for their citizens? The other question, as we need to lead by example: is the Commission intending to actually implement this in the Commission, so that the Commission will also recognise E-ID’s place, and when will this happen?", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 168, "date": "2016-05-25.json", "name": "Isabella Adinolfi", "mepid": "124831", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, more and more activities linked to the exercise of fundamental rights, such as freedom of expression, are taking place online.

We, as legislators, have the task of identifying the potential and critical issues that technological progress determines, so that we can legislate effectively, protecting above all the weakest. When it comes to electronic identification and authentication services, certain fundamental issues must be borne in mind, such as the way in which personal data is collected and stored and whether or not the operators of such data and the provider of the identification service itself are public. I believe it is essential that identification services should be managed by the public, given the sensitivity of the information collected, yet this is not always the case in Europe. For example, Italy has also relied on private individuals to develop these services (Telecom Italia and Infocert) by allocating part of the funds of the Connecting Europe Facility.

In particular, many do not have documents identifying them and several refuse to give fingerprints. I have therefore asked the Commission whether it intends to equip the host authorities with facial recognition systems. This recognizes or confirms a person through a digital photo or movie and compares selected facial features of a person with a person's database. Commissioner Avramopoulos' response was that the Commission would evaluate and explore further technical and legal options. Such systems can be installed at all external and critical cross-border checkpoints. The sources of data and information are inexhaustible and can easily be worked with the existing EURODAC, AIS and VIS systems, as well as the europol databases and member states' intelligence services.

According to my understanding, all the services provided by our governments had to be digital by default, open by default and cross-border by default. We all know that those e-governmental services will make our governments more efficient, more transparent, which is extremely important, but if those services are provided in a really transparent way, then this will not create the best environment for corruption for example. Not everybody will be happy about this, and also those governments which will provide internet-based services are, as a rule, more inclusive governments. But to involve our people it is extremely important. It is important by the governments to provide their citizens with a single digital identity, and this identity has to be strong, because this is all about trust. Once again, if people do not trust those internet-based e-services, they will never start to use those services. About efficiency. Single digital identity makes those governmental services but also private services cheaper than usage of traditional signatures. So it is not polite to provide examples always about Estonia. But in Estonia we think that just because of usage of digital signatures, we were able to save one working week per year, which is equal to 2% of our GDP, which is equal to our defence expenditure. We can say defence expenditure in Estonia is coming from digital signatures. So it is a question about efficiency. I would like also to underline the importance of the ‘once only’ principle. I know once again from my own experience how important it was to introduce this ‘once only’ principle. In Estonia it took six years to get those first one million digital signatures and then we introduce, the ‘once only’ principle. It means the state has the right to ask for information from their citizens or their companies only once, and it gave a real boost on usage of those digital identities. Now, in the country I know best, they are getting more than 1.3 million digital signatures per week already, and the population in Estonia is 1.3 million inhabitants. All those digital solutions provided by our governments had to be user-centric, and if those solutions included digital identities, they will be really user-centric solutions, then people they will use those solutions. If signing digitally will take four or five minutes, nobody will start to use those solutions. There are some really good examples. For example, in Austria I know people they are using mobile identities quite often, in some other countries also, it is common to use mobile identities instead to use those Smart ID cards. Those solutions, digital solutions, they have to be user-centric and then people they will use those solutions and our people they have to be absolutely sure that those solutions are there, also really safe and well protected. It is true that our registers do not talk with each other. We have in all the countries digital prior business registers, but it is very difficult to get information in a digital way, in a trusted manner, from another country from those business registers. If somebody wants to make business for example here in Belgium, but he is coming from some other countries, then how those local people they know who has mandate to represent this company here in this country? It is so easy theoretically to get information from business register, but in real life paper is needed. In the 21st century paper is still needed for that. We have some quite good examples about the regional cooperation, about mutual recognition of digital identities – I know best about this example we have in the Baltic States and between Finland also – but there are some other examples also. We have already eIDAS Directive which allows mutual recognition of those digital identities, but full implementation of eIDAS directive takes some time. We have implementation acts. There is cooperation networking in place. The eIDAS Observatory will be launched in the second half of 2016 to boost online trust security and transparency in the digital single market and to facilitate the use of cross-border electronic identification and trust services. But I absolutely agree with those people who say that the European Commission has to lead by example, and we will try to do that. So e-procurement it is a real challenge for all of us. According to analysis prepared by the European Parliament, if we will be able to use e-procurement across the European Union, we can save one billion euros per year. But also this service is based on strong digital identities. In the European Commission we have to be ready for full implementation of e-procurement. About organised crime and the refugee crisis. Once again, single digital identity based on biometrics is needed. As we know, just recently it happened so that one of those terrorists was able to change his identity in the European Union even 7 times. It is a shame. So we have to build up really good interoperability network and we have to introduce in all the EU Member States strong digital identities, and we have to fully implement the eIDAS Directive.

Around the EU, consumers are overcharged for their energy bills. In my country, the UK, consumers overpaid GBP 1.2 billion a year for their energy bills between 2009 and 2013. Over 50 million citizens are living in energy poverty in the EU and are forced to choose on a daily basis between heating, cooling or eating. Around the EU, consumers are willing to invest in energy efficiency and self-generation projects, but are hindered by heavy administrative burdens and high upfront investment costs. Throughout Europe, energy markets are not transparent and are not competitive enough. In this context, industry fails to pass falling wholesale prices on to consumers. Energy bills are becoming increasingly complex and citizens are not able to compare offers easily. Many consumers are on outdated energy contracts, unaware of their ability to switch.  The ‘new deal’ report, on which we will be voting tomorrow, highlights key recommendations to address these problems. Regarding the retail energy market, to increase the transparency and clarity of bills, we need to include peer-based comparisons and information on switching in those bills. Consumers should be placed on the most appropriate tariffs, and suppliers should notify them about their cheapest offers. We need to eradicate termination fees and penalties for switching suppliers. And finally, social tariffs should be maintained for the most vulnerable. Regarding self-generation, we need to set up a common legal framework for the right to store and sell excess electricity at a fair price. We need to promote new business models, collective purchasing schemes and innovative financial instruments to incentivise self-generation and self-consumption. And on energy poverty, we need to focus energy efficiency objectives and funds on our most vulnerable citizens. We also call, Commissioner, for a definition of energy poverty and an Action Plan from the European Commission.  I was very pleased that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy voted on Tuesday, on the energy efficiency implementation report, to place tackling energy poverty at the heart of energy efficiency. Energy efficiency can be the glue of social cohesion and European integration. I strongly believe that proposing a meaningful level of ambition in the revision of the 2030 energy efficiency targets is a necessity. For every 1% improvement in energy efficiency, three million more homes can be properly renovated and seven million citizens lifted out of energy poverty. As a conclusion, I want to highlight that energy is not a commodity: it is a basic social right. As a conclusion, I want to say that this report is about the widow in Bulgaria, unable to compare energy offers and unaware that she could save money by switching. It is about the student in the UK, living in a rented flat, poorly insulated, and with inefficient heating. It is about the young couple in Malta, willing to invest in a solar panel, but facing high upfront investments. And it is about the long-term sick person in Spain, too frightened of costs to turn on their air conditioning in August. It is about benefits for all, and 28 Member States working together to end energy poverty.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 186, "date": "2016-05-25.json", "name": "Maroš Šefčovič", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, putting citizens at the heart of the Energy Union and tackling energy poverty deserves our full attention and thank you very much for the report. The report is very timely because the energy transition and the new technologies are changing how the energy markets work. This can and must bring benefits to all consumers, be it households or industry. However, it is a fact that retail markets for energy are not working today for consumers as they should. Consumer satisfaction and engagement in the energy market remain persistently low, and we have seen a trend of rising energy prices for end-consumers across the EU. The New Deal for Energy Consumers is about correcting these shortcomings. Our objective is to deliver: a competitive, technology-driven and fair energy market which delivers high-quality energy services to consumers. This means removing barriers for companies with innovative products and services which try to enter the market. We want a market where consumers can make informed choices about the way they consume energy and about the sources of energy they want to consume. And we want a market-based framework to protect vulnerable consumers and fight energy poverty. In the short time that I have today, please let me mention a few issues to make this more concrete. We want bills to be clearer and easier to compare with alternative offers. Therefore, we are analysing possibilities for an EU certification scheme for price comparison tools. We have to work on removing the barriers for switching between providers. Barriers still exist and harm both consumers and innovative companies. I am pleased to see that Parliament recognises the importance of smart technologies in the energy sector. Technology costs are falling rapidly. This means that more and more consumers could reduce their energy bills by using technologies like rooftop solar panels, heat pumps or smart meters. Demand response and storage solutions must be developed. This is beneficial for energy efficiency and for consumers. But, as rightly pointed out in the report, we need to put the necessary enabling legal framework in place. We must adjust our rules to the energy technologies of the 21st century. We need a better framework for decentralised generation and self-consumption. We need more cooperatives, aggregators, and energy service companies in order to ensure access for those who are not in a position to self-generate, such as tenants and vulnerable consumers. And finally, we need a better and informed debate about energy cost, taxes, levies and subsidies. Therefore, we will publish in the second half of this year a report on energy prices and costs that will enhance transparency on the different components of energy prices in the Member States.  The cost of energy leads me to the second topic of today: Energy Poverty. Let me mention a few figures. In 2014, approximately 10% of EU citizens felt that they were unable to keep their homes adequately warm. Since 2000, the share of energy spending of the lowest income households in their total income increased from 6% to 9%, which means a 50% increase. This is significant for the small budgets that these households have. I know from my Energy Union Tour and from the country analyses which we drew up, that we have a very diverse picture in Europe but energy poverty is an issue everywhere. Of course, well-targeted social policy measures are the most direct and effective tool to address poverty. This is, correctly, the competence of the Member States. But nevertheless, the Commission is analysing if and how our work can support the Member States in addressing energy poverty. The fight against social exclusion and poverty is a cross-cutting policy issue, so let me mention just a few examples.  We are analysing if a definition of energy poverty is possible and how it could help address the problem. With your support, thanks to your pilot project on fuel energy poverty, the Commission is considering an energy poverty observatory. This will help us to quantify, monitor and identify best practices and we expect to launch this in 2018 following an open tender. We are working with the Member States to share good practices. As an example, Bulgaria was mentioned by our rapporteur and Commissioner Arias Cañete is travelling just now to Bulgaria to speak about the topic in the context of electricity market liberalisation, an area where the Commission services have provided support to Bulgaria in recent months. The Commission agrees that energy efficiency is the most effective way to prevent energy poverty. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions and energy bills. It contributes to better health and living standard, and as for all energy efficiency measures, it creates jobs in the local economy. We have underlined the importance of energy poverty from the very beginning, and we promised in the first State of the Energy Union Report that we would pay particular attention to the issue when reviewing key legislation in 2016. Therefore, the report and the resolution which we discuss today are very timely. I would like to thank Theresa Griffin and all other colleagues involved in this for their work. I would also like to acknowledge the resolution on meeting the anti-poverty target in the light of increasing household costs which this Parliament adopted on 14 April 2016. I can promise that we will examine all your recommendations on tackling energy poverty very closely. I am very much looking forward to this debate and I would like to thank you for giving me the floor.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 187, "date": "2016-05-25.json", "name": "Seán Kelly", "mepid": "96668", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, firstly let me thank the Commissioner for his good words and also Theresa Griffin for her work on this file and her willingness to cooperate and seek to find good compromises. I must say that it was a privilege to work with her. I think the report we will vote on tomorrow will send the right message. It puts forward some good ideas about how we can lower energy prices for all. We should not underestimate the importance of this issue in a wider economic context. Reducing energy costs, and therefore household costs, is a massive opportunity to ease the burden on already stretched household budgets across Europe. This can in turn boost consumer spending power, give a boost to businesses and help to bring economic growth across the EU. For me, the best way to deliver this new deal for energy consumers is by putting in place a well—functioning market and a well—functioning energy system. Competitive markets increase transparency and comparability of prices, and better-informed and empowered consumers will help energy become far more affordable for all. I think one important aspect of this is increasing the share of the retail price on which retailers can compete. In Europe retailers can only compete with each other on about a third of the price. The rest is made up of taxes and add-ons. Increasing this share by reducing the amount of government add—ons would increase competition, drive down prices for consumers and, at the same time, allow retail prices to better reflect wholesale prices, enabling proper market signals to occur. The other part of this debate we are here to address is energy poverty. I think the differing definitions of energy poverty in different Member States, based on different climatic conditions, is something we need to strongly consider before thinking about an EU-level action, but that should not distract from the importance of this issue. In Ireland, we define energy poverty as an inability to heat or power a home to an adequate degree. A household in Ireland that spends more than 10% of its income on energy is considered to be in energy poverty. As a country that has the third highest energy prices in Europe, this is of course a big issue for us, and I am pleased to say that we put in place a strategy to combat the problem early this year.  I look forward to further debate and progress on this very important issue.

Energy has become a social right, a social good, the access of which we must guarantee, especially to the most vulnerable groups. As Colleague Griffin said, it is not a receipt that many elderly people in the European Union even die, in winter from the cold or in summer from the heat. It must be a priority within the Debate of the Union for Energy. Congratulations to my colleague Theresa Griffin on the excellent report, which highlights all those points on which we must influence to combat energy poverty. I would fundamentally like to highlight three points. Firstly, the role of energy efficiency as the first source of energy, and I thereby appeal to member States' compliance with the Energy Efficiency Directive, so that within their national plans they may establish a space, a clear commitment, to the renovation of the buildings of the most vulnerable people.  Secondly, I reiterate and join the claim of a European framework for self-consumption that guarantees this right, because today it is not a receipt that in Spain it is prevented, even retroactively now through legislation against consumers, that solar panels be legalized or that the establishment of new facilities should be prevented , while we see in Germany the efficient and effective functioning of cooperatives in neighbouring communities. And thirdly, I think it is essential to talk and address fair taxation. We all know that more than 50% of the price or invoice component paid by citizens for energy through the European Union as a whole are energy policy taxes, other than the cost of production or distribution. We need to have a fair and transparent debate, that we deal with taxation progressively, within the design of the energy market. In short, there are tools to ensure access, democratize energy and eradicate poverty. What we have to put on our part now is the necessary political will.

We believe the best way to ensure energy security for the whole of Europe and to provide the lowest prices for our citizens is a properly integrated gas and electricity market. I want consumers and businesses in my constituency to be able to buy their energy from any company in the EU. I want an energy system that is fair on consumers and helps to protect the energy-poor. I am happy for the Commission to share the best practices of Member States in combating energy poverty. Customers should receive clear information in their bills, and switching energy suppliers should be a simple and transparent process. I support the call that energy providers’ websites and digital invoicing should be fully accessible to disabled people. Whilst energy poverty needs to be tackled, the best way this can be done on a European level is through having a properly-functioning and competitive single market that delivers low prices. It is not for the EU to say how Member States deliver their social policy programmes. I doubt that the broad common and non—quantitative definition of energy policy that the rapporteur calls for will achieve anything at all. I do not want the Commission to bring forward an action plan or to propose legislation on this subject, because these are matters for the Member States. The rapporteur calls for a legal maximum percentage increase in the costs that distribution networks can charge. This is surely a matter for national regulators. We do not need EU legislation on this subject. We also do not need her recommendation that certain levies and network charges should be ‘progressively applied’. Has she thought what this means in practice? It is not the EU’s business, and it is also inappropriate for her to call for a ban on doorstep selling by energy companies.

Mr President, I would like to thank the The European energy market is undergoing profound change and we need to ensure that consumers are at the heart of this change. Only a competitive, transparent and liberalised internal market will ensure that consumers also benefit from this change. Therefore, a New Deal for energy consumers is urgently needed. However, it must become a New Deal that also empowers consumers to make informed decisions and actively participate in the market, rather than patronising them. As the shadow alDE rapporteur for this report, I am convinced that the best measures for reducing consumption and costs are more competition, better information and better consumer involvement. Firstly, we must ensure that there is real competition in the energy market and that the switch between suppliers is simplified. Similarly, regulated prices must finally be phased out. Secondly, we need comprehensible, transparent and easily accessible information for consumers, especially with regard to energy bills. Thirdly, it is important to improve the opportunities for consumers to integrate into the market, including as producers and investors. Information technologies such as smart meters, smart grids or online platforms can open up new avenues, especially when it comes to managing demand. In the same way, we need to break down the existing barriers for prosumers.

This transition should not be handled from above, by private interests, but by a real energy revolution of popular participation, democratization and empowerment of people in something as basic as energy. It is therefore necessary to establish a legal framework for energy producers and consumers. A European framework prohibiting retroactive measures and 'taxes on the sun'; drastically reduce administrative and financial barriers to promoting investment in renewables, and that this investment is by households, cooperatives or even local administrations. Fifty million people in Europe suffer from energy poverty, while energy oligopoly accumulates benefits — to name just one example, Gas Natural declared a profit of 1.5 billion euros in 2015.

Thank you, Mrs. Griffin, for your work and for your willingness to agree. This own-initiative report on 'Establishing a New Agreement for Energy Consumers' certainly comes to this house as a positive part of the building of the energy transition we are trying to build. The main thing about the report is that it is right in the point of view. The view of the citizen, of the passive ex-consumer, now become a producer, distributor, storageer and consumer of an energy whose marginal cost is getting closer to zero every day. That is why this new European regulatory framework, general and aware of the real diversity of the situations to which it should apply, is necessary. But we go to the decentralized, democratic market—despite the fear this term generates in some groups—and based, of course, on renewable energy. A market with transparency, price comparison, conscious demand to decide freely, smart meters, open competitiveness and effectively reduced prices. This is the not-too-distant scenario that this report draws and which we are now calling on the Commission, Commissioner, and the Member States. And that is why it makes sense that we are also dealing with the question of energy poverty and the answer it needs today.

Mr President, the forced introduction of hugely expensive wind energy will further increase the already sky-high consumer prices of electricity. The Commission believes that prices will rise less if all European households are constantly monitored by hundreds of millions of so-called smart consumption meters. In the Commission's view, a household cannot simply consume electricity without the consent of that meter approved by the Commission. For households, however, the bill is mainly determined by the environmental taxes to pay those same windmills, in addition to energy taxes to satisfy the endless hunger for money from our socialist governments. Mr President, I believe in the market. If it can be cheaper, then so will consumers and producers. They don't need Europe for that. If your proposals have some realism, why is there not yet a small-scale energy economy? The answer is simple: because it is expensive, because it is complex, but mainly because it is unreliable. And the report makes no mention of this unreliability of small-scale energy. But the wind doesn't blow constantly, the sun doesn't always shine and not everyone has a forest in the backyard.

These efforts, which are positive from any point of view, should be encouraged, driven and accompanied by the Commission as a common good, and I believe that this should also be encouraged in cross-border cooperation environments to expand local networks that will eventually shape a real and sustainable energy transition at European level and, moreover, as the rapporteur pointed out, will be a cohesion factor.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 205, "date": "2016-05-25.json", "name": "Davor Škrlec (Verts/ALE).", "mepid": "124756", "text": "   - Mr. Vice-President of the Commission, in order to achieve our energy climate goals that we have committed to in Paris, we need to move more boldly into an energy transition that will increase citizens' involvement.

It sustainably stimulates the growth of the local economy and employment and effectively solves serious social problems such as energy poverty. In order to achieve this, I believe that several important preconditions need to be met: to provide citizens and cooperatives with access to cheaper capital and to encourage innovative financial instruments and business models, to encourage the development and widespread use of advanced smart grid networks, to implement the smart city concept in cities, and to introduce an obligation in all Member States to use smart numbers.

The reason why we have very high energy prices in Europe and the reason why we are driving our industry into an uncompetitive situation compared to the rest of the world is that we have chosen to rely obsessively on unreliable, expensive, intermittent renewable energy which exports inefficiency to the backup and across the grid. That is the reason, and if we fail to address that reason, we will not solve the problems of competitiveness in the energy market in the European Union, and we will not deliver secure and affordable energy to our consumers. The fact is we have chosen as a deliberate policy to drive up energy prices; we have chosen as a deliberate policy to drive many consumers into fuel poverty; we have chosen to undermine the competitiveness of our industries and to drive energy-intensive businesses offshore to other jurisdictions with lower environmental standards, where they actually emit more CO2 than they would do if we remain.

Mr President, because in the 21st century with such technological development, while energy is fuelling competition and wars, more and more households are being condemned to energy poverty. But because the capitalist path, the European Union's policy of liberalisation and privatisation of energy is a class policy, i.e. profits for the industry's bees and poverty for households.  Typical is the decision of the Greek government SYRIZA - ANEL to reduce the gas tax on industrialists, while increasing the same tax on households in the midst of a tax storm, further reducing wages and pensions with the 3rd and 4th, without end, Greek Memorandum.  This is the energy democracy invoked in the report, even recommending energy production by the consumers themselves, i.e. liberalisation that is supposedly pro-grassroots. There is no good and bad liberalisation, it is always in favour of monopolies. Only with another economy, labour power, can energy from merchandise become a popular right to meet modern needs.

I wanted to highlight three things. Many people have talked about the need to strengthen our approach to energy efficiency and end-use of energy. This is the number one problem in every energy issue. Secondly, prosumer energy cannot be developed without well-designed electricity grids, smart meters, smart grids. These are huge costs and Member States must consider spending these costs, because not all costs can be charged to energy companies. It must also be the responsibility of the budget. And the third thing that is extremely important: cheap, safe and clean energy for consumers requires the creation of the right conditions for energy companies. The common market has already been mentioned. These are those who produce, transmit electricity, work on new production technologies, transmit, store energy and also transmit and produce gas.

One thing I am especially happy about is the fact that now we have some ideas on how to really fight energy poverty. That has a role nowadays in Europe. I worked in the Employment Committee on the issue, and the figures I learned are tremendous. There are people dying in Europe because of the cold, so then in wintertime you may not cut the electricity if it is an electricity house. I learned it is done in Finland, but there are countries in Europe who do not do that, and then I also learned that there are still some countries where the customers cannot change from one company to another, and there are also termination fees. We do not have them in the telecom market, so why do we still have them in the market-oriented energy markets in Europe? We have to get rid of that. I am very happy that the Commissioner is listening here and wait for the proposal on that. One other point is that we also have to make sure that companies pay their taxes.

From here, the Commissioner has received very strong support for market reform and for the need for more transparency and competition in Europe and for consumers to have the opportunity to switch their energy suppliers as well. After all, one of the big reasons why the market is not working in Europe at the moment is that we currently have inadequate energy transmission links, we have too many energy islands and, on the other hand, various subsidies for energy have confused the market. The European Union subsidises energy by around 100 20 billion every year and, in practice, it has led to no one investing in energy without some form of permanent support, and this cannot continue. It is acceptable when new technologies are being built, that it receives some type of investment aid, but if energy is based on the need for continuous, support, it is not sustainable.  The Commissioner has received strong support here in such a way that the European Parliament wants to reform the energy market, to achieve competition and transparency. This is, of course, a major problem for European consumers and industry. In Finland, wholesale electricity prices are thirty per cent higher than in the USA, and there are big differences in consumer prices between Member States.

Achieving this means putting in place a mix of policies appropriate to each regional market and to each sub-regional market. We have to know very well the concrete data of energy poverty in each country to verify the conformity and quality of responses and, on the basis of the concrete data, we have to act both in the field of energy efficiency and in the field of market regulation.

Also, we must make data available for app developers to help consumers to manage their energy consumption. This is essential to get active consumers on board.

Energy poverty affects 36% of Greek households, according to a study by the European Parliament. Last winter, 100,000 households were found, or at risk of being found, without power. As if this 3rd Memorandum were not enough, it added excessive increases in taxes on heating oil and agricultural oil, increases that only manage to reduce the consumption and receipts of the state, while at the same time imposing energy security and burning of inappropriate materials for heating, which has led to smog in many parts of Greece.

I would like to tell you that I was listening very carefully to all the ideas which I think have been mostly recurring in the interventions of the honourable MEPs: how important it is to have a well-functioning market; how needed it would be to restore the real price signals of the energies; what we need to do to have our prices comparable; and what kind of focus we have to attach to crossborder trading, to the interconnectors and to the proper financing of the necessary infrastructure. I very much welcome the support for the democratisation of energy generation, and I agree with you that we still need to do well and ought to make sure that the third package in all our Member States is properly implemented.  I think there was an overall agreement that the best recipe to tackle energy poverty is to focus on energy efficiency, and today’s technologies are already offering us to do a lot to use the smart solutions, to smarten our grids, our households and to use the proper information to customise the services and empower our consumers. I also have been listening very carefully to all the calls from those who want the EU to do the most but at the same time to find the appropriate balance between Member States and European competences. I would like once again to thank the rapporteur for a very timely report because we are now working hard to deliver on the remaining proposals which he promised we would deliver these year – the year of delivery for the Energy Union. In September, we would like to present the package on energy efficiency. We want to include also proposals on how to make our buildings more energy efficient, and many of the proposals which we heard today will be reflected in our proposals for the new electricity market design and for the revised Renewables Directive which would follow later – hopefully before the end of the year.  Despite all these regulatory proposals and the legislative regulatory framework which we are going to create, what I think was also very much reflected in the statements by the honourable Members was the importance which they give to proper investment. We need the financial instruments. We need the investment so we can start this wave of energy efficiency across Europe.  We have already done a lot, because thanks to the budget allocations which have been already proposed, one million households will benefit from EU cohesion policy support to make their buildings more efficient. In this financial period, we will spend EUR 5.4 billion for energy efficiency investment in housing, which is a threefold increase in comparison with the previous period.  But the question is, is it enough? I think it’s not. So therefore I think we need to work on the new instruments, the instruments which we are currently developing in the Commission: smart financing for smart buildings, because I believe that this would play a very important role for the future. Another element which was echoed in the speeches of several honourable Members was that we need to offer more assistance and help to local authorities, to mayors, and to provide them with better technical assistance to help them to develop the necessary capacity, so they can tackle these very complex issues of smartening cities or increasing energy efficiency in their electoral district. And I am very happy to say that we feel we have very strong grassroots support from local authorities, from mayors, for this energy transition, for tackling energy poverty and for transforming their cities into the smart cities of the future. In the Covenant of Mayors we have already 6 000 mayors and we know how they appreciate working on this platform. We are looking for ways to cooperate even more closely with the Compact of Mayors, which is a similar organisation, which was developed in the United States to make sure that these big entities of mayors have more platforms and more possibilities to exchange best practices.  To conclude, I really would like to thank you for all the ideas, for the support for our work, and I believe that together we can really empower consumers in the energy market, and I think that through this it can make a real contribution in the fight against energy poverty.

(2) It is not the energy source per se that harms disadvantaged customers, but unfair marketing practices, which lead to a loss of trust and ultimately reduce individual commitment. In principle, it can be said that the more competitive the energy market is, the better for consumers. The increasing number of customers switching their energy provider is proof of this.

Eradicating energy poverty is one of Europe's most pressing tasks in the 21st century. While around 50 million people in Europe live in energy poverty, statistics show that one in five households, or up to two million people, live in Hungary. This situation is unsustainable, which has not been solved in Hungary by the policy of official pricing, i.e. 'reduction of overheads'. The average Hungarian household uses energy per square metre, almost twice the EU average. On this basis, the energy poverty of a quarter of Hungarian households is not caused by high energy prices in relation to income alone, but in large part by the low level of energy efficiency in buildings. We need to change that as soon as possible. It is unacceptable for someone in 2016 not to be able to heat their home, bathe in cold water, turn on their reading light or charge their mobile phone. Therefore, in my opinion, we must guarantee in EU legislation the minimum supply of energy, the fundamental right to energy, which is a subjective right for all citizens.

Madam President, finally, these two debates that follow touch on issues that are very close and which are linked to the issue of poverty. We talked about energy poverty. Here, if it is more specifically the approach to poverty in a gendered way. What is the poverty situation of women in Europe? Today, unfortunately, more than 64 million women live in poverty in Europe. 48% of them - single women - are unable to meet unexpected expenses. These single women are seen as more vulnerable to poverty. Single-parent families in which women are the head of household more often than men are also at greater risk of poverty and social exclusion, resulting in a vicious cycle of poverty for their children and families. Today, 27% of European children are at risk of poverty. This represents 22 million children in poverty. We have seen that austerity measures, which are often indiscriminate austerity measures, taken in recent years in Europe, have increased inequalities and also the risks of poverty for women and children. The wage gap persists today. We also have the issue of the working poor, precarious statuses and, finally, the pension gap, which represents a gap of 39% and which poses risks of poverty for the oldest people and women. Is it necessary to recall that the europe 2020 strategy aims to reduce the number of people at risk of poverty by at least 20 million? We are a long way from that today. We must break the cycle of poverty, which now affects 127 million people in Europe, including 22 million children. And you should know that, especially with regard to adults, women are more affected by this cycle. Finally, we made a series of recommendations to ensure that this cycle of poverty can be broken. The first recommendation calls for quality public services and free access to education, health and justice. It has indeed been shown that, when public services are of good quality and have a good first line of good quality, there is better efficiency and redistribution of wealth, which is a real social safety net to fight poverty. The second recommendation is the fight against discrimination in employment, which is a source of poverty for women. We therefore call for coordination of parental leave - maternity leave, paternity leave and parental leave - to combat such precarious situations experienced in precarious contracts by women. The third recommendation: an important reflection on minimum income as an instrument in the fight against poverty. We therefore do not ask in the report today that there may be a minimum income, although this could have been the case, but we are asking for it so that there should be an analysis of minimum income systems throughout Europe and identify good practices in this area as a tool to combat poverty. A fourth claim: when you know little about the phenomenon, you can less well provide the solutions. We therefore call for a more reliable statistical follow-up of the issue of gendered poverty in Europe today. We also call for a child guarantee system, as we have been able to obtain in terms of the 'youth' guarantee, that is, where there are significant outbreaks of poverty in Europe today, it is essential to provide budget lines and specific actions to combat child poverty in particular. Finally, we are asking - and this is in connection with the report that was discussed just before - social tariffs for basic goods, such as access to energy and water, which effectively prevents people from falling into this poverty trap. Finally, we are asking that there be tax incentives to fight poverty. I thank all of these recommendations for all of these recommendations, all the members who participated in the development of this report. It was a very constructive discussion and I hope that tomorrow it can be voted on by a large majority.

I would also like to thank her for setting out the recommendations in the report so clearly. While the female employment rate has increased to just above 64% in 2015, women’s lower earnings and under—representation in the labour market continues to mean that their financial situation is less secure than men’s. As we heard, many more women than men are living in poverty in the EU and – as she explained – the risk of poverty is especially high among single mothers, and also among older women. Women’s lower pay and the fact that they often do part—time work and take gaps in their careers often leads to gender pension gaps; women’s pensions are 40% lower than men’s and, of course, women are less likely to have a pension at all. In June last year, the Council agreed some conclusions on the gender pension gap, and these called for work to continue to narrow this gap, and for Member States’ social and employment policies to be assessed as part of the European Semester process.  Last December, the Commission published a strategic engagement for gender equality that set out the overall framework for European initiatives that were aimed at improving gender equality and, in that, priority areas included increasing the numbers of women in work, reducing the gender pay gap and the pension gap, and also making women more financially independent. We continue to keep a close eye on these issues and we have provided country specific recommendations to those that face the greatest challenges. As set out in your report, adequate work—life balance policies are needed so that women who want to can play a full part in the labour market. Last year, the Commission launched a ‘new start’ initiative to improve work—life balance for parents and other people caring for family members. That looks at a range of measures to promote adequate leave and flexible working arrangements and to support affordable professional care services. The second phase of the consultation will be launched shortly, on the legislative parts of the ‘new start’ initiative, and my colleagues will be tabling proposals on that by the end of the year.  The Commission’s plans to create a European pillar of social rights have gender equality also at their heart. The draft pillar that’s now been agreed for wider consultation puts the emphasis on improving the situation of women in the labour market. I think that fairness, which lies at the heart of this report, is central to the Commission’s agenda, and the principle that no one should be left behind will continue to drive forward our work to support greater gender equality in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 263, "date": "2016-05-25.json", "name": "Elnök asszony. –", "mepid": "102886", "text": "   The debate is over.

It’s more integrated than India’s market and that’s not bad considering we have got 28 countries. But although tariffs have gone, non—tariff barriers (NTBs) still exist. We need a proper single market that delivers for consumers and for all businesses. At the moment the single market works for big businesses. They have the economies of scale and the wealth to get around barriers to trade that small companies do not – they just give up. As I’ve gone around my constituency from Stratford to Stoke, small businesses tell me that they often find it much easier to trade with Canada or the US than they do with France or Germany. Artificial barriers and red tape block the free movement of goods and services. So they give up and we lose that trade, and then they watch big companies come in and take over that trade. This fuels a feeling that Europe is just for big business and not for the little guys.  At the same time, consumers lose out. They don’t get a wider choice of products or lower prices through economies of scale that the single market should give them. We know the problem and we’ve been trying to solve it for years, but we haven’t looked at it from the perspective of international trade. It is sometimes forgotten in this house that trading in another EU country is still international trade and it involves different rules, different regulations and different languages. This is what this report is about. It is trying to identify technical barriers to trade within the internal market. Now the term ‘non—tariff barriers’ is well—known in international trade, but it’s fair to say that we had quite a lot of discussion about what it is and what it isn’t within this house, and the definition was tricky to agree on. But one thing that isn’t a non—tariff barrier is workers and social rights. Let’s be clear about that. These apply to everyone in a country and they are non—discriminatory. Nor is it an NTB when governments legislate for legitimate public policy reasons, but their actions should be proportionate. So it is not a non—tariff barrier if an action is proportionate, non—discriminatory and serves a legitimate public policy objective. But protectionism isn’t fair; it kills jobs, it kills growth and it kills competitiveness and it penalises consumers. It exists in a variety of sectors within Europe, and we would challenge third countries if they employed such methods.  Now I believe in competition, and I believe in different economic and regulatory models in EU countries is a good thing as it allows countries to have competitive advantages. This isn’t about harmonization, but where there are problems we’ve got to highlight them, and we found problems in a number of sectors, including retail, construction and professional services, to name a few, and we need to address them. Lack of mutual recognition of testing on goods or professional qualifications is a key example. Do taps really need to be tested 28 times to be sold in 28 different EU countries? Why are British kit cars with type approvals not allowed to be sold in Belgium, for example? Why is does a UK hairdresser with 30 years’ experience have to train for 4 years to be a hairdresser in Germany? It makes no sense. Why does an Austrian ski instructor have to retrain to be an instructor in France? It makes no sense. Why does an online betting company have to have an offline establishment to trade in another country? Why are there fees on global income for supermarkets in Eastern Europe which only hit foreign companies. These are Europeans blocking other Europeans; there’s no solidarity here at all.  Now we don’t need new legislation. We need a change in mindset in national ministries and we need better and clearer enforcement of single market rules by the Commission. We need more collaboration between Member States and we’ve identified these gaps in the report with regard to goods, but I think it’s in services where there are real problems. The notification regime under the Services Directive is a prime example of where Member States have not matched their commitments. The single market should be a partnership between countries and their governments should commit with their actions.  As we’ve seen with this report, Parliament is fully behind this objective, and I hope the Commission is too. It won’t be easy but it’s in all our long—term interests, and I hope this report will provide a new impetus to tear down barriers and create a free single market that delivers for businesses – both big and small – for consumers and for workers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 277, "date": "2016-05-25.json", "name": "Stanislav Polčák (PPE).", "mepid": "124704", "text": "   – I would address the aspect of competition within the single internal market, as my speecher also mentioned.

I think that we are all clear that deepening the single market is the best way not just to improve the investment climate, the business environment and the productivity of the EU economy, but also to improve service to consumers and to our fellow citizens. As he said about the importance as well of making the single market work for small businesses, as a former small businessman myself, that’s a sentiment that I share entirely.  I think although we have successfully removed tariff barriers to trade across the European Union, it’s right that there are still too many non—tariff barriers in the way of the proper development of the single market, and those are the focus of our work today and of the communication on the single market that we are set to adopt in June. This will set out our approach to making sure that agreed legislation is consistently enforced across the EU, and I agree with the importance of enforcement, as well as a series of more targeted actions to make sure that the single market is working as well as it can. So, for example, we will present an EU—wide action plan to ensure the mutual recognition of goods is respected, we will revise the mutual recognition regulation – and the goal is that more companies should know their rights and make the most of the opportunities that mutual recognition could create for their businesses. We want authorities to be aware of their obligations and to apply mutual recognition properly, and we also want to create a culture of mutual recognition that’s based on trust and legal certainty across Europe. We will be taking action to deepen the single market for services, and here I think that digitalisation offers great new opportunities. The free movement of services is of course enshrined in our Treaties. It is fundamental to the single market, but our analysis shows that providing services across European borders or setting up a branch or a subsidiary in another Member State could be simplified further. The Commission estimates that more ambitious implementation of the Services Directive could add 1.8% to EU GDP. So it’s a price worth having.  We want to make the provision of services easier inside the EU. We are developing the services passport, which is a voluntary electronic procedure to reduce the burden for service providers who want access other Member States’ markets. In my own area of financial services we are working to build a single market for capital in Europe – the capital markets union – and at the heart of that project is the goal of channelling investment to projects that need financing. So, to make it easier for companies to invest, we will bring forward proposals to reduce non—tariff barriers that complicate cross—border investment, like differences in insolvency law for example. I think the way to approach this is to identify the barriers that there are to cross—border sale of services, identify those barriers one by one with Member States and work out ways to address them.  I am looking forward to working with the European Parliament in all these areas to take the single market further and to support competition, to support investment and to support growth in Europe. I hope, like the rapporteur, that this report will give us impetus and some of the evidence as well that will help guide us in our work.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 281, "date": "2016-05-25.json", "name": "Elnök asszony. –", "mepid": "102886", "text": "   The debate is over.

While we have managed to eliminate tariff barriers, non-tariff barriers are still a huge problem. However, it should be borne in mind, as the report clearly emphasises, that some of them are used to implement public policies in the Member States and that their removal is not advisable. The problem, however, is any protectionist measures that aim to protect domestic companies from foreign competition. Such measures include the multiplication of formal and bureaucratic requirements for companies from other Member States or the use of excessive unjustified control of economic operators, which effectively discourages traders from exporting their goods or services. Such actions are to the detriment of the European Union as a whole and undermine the competitiveness of the single market.  I agree with the rapporteur that the legal basis for the full functioning of the single market is in principle already being shaped.

Furthermore, it’s a technical subject; it’s virtual currencies and distributed ledger technology, so one would be forgiven by thinking well, this is a dull and somniferous subject that perhaps will gently put us into sleep at this late hour of the day, but of course one would be wrong, because this new technology has a lot of promise; it has a lot of potential. Some people even liken it to the kind of revolution that was sparked by the introduction of the internet, and I have to say – although not all my fellow shadow rapporteurs are here – we had a very exciting, very interesting and frankly very enjoyable time exploring this particular subject.  Let me briefly explain to you what this is about. Fundamentally what this is about, this distributed ledger technology that underlies the bitcoin, which is the most prominent virtual currency, is a decentralised database that keeps a record of any sort of transaction done within that database in a way that is surprisingly safe, resilient and trustworthy even – and that’s particularly interesting – when there’s no central authority in play. This technology can be used – as the title of the initiative report would suggest – for virtual currencies and in order to reduce the cost of financial transactions significantly. Some of you may have wondered why it is so much cheaper to send an email or an SMS than to transfer funds, for example from somebody working in one country and sending remittances back home, because in the end this transfer of funds is not much more than an electronic message even today, but still it can be rather expensive – 7% or 8% of the funds transferred. This technology could help us to reduce these transaction costs significantly in the long run, and I think that if we regulate well we might even have open—access electronic wallets where the transfer of funds would be decided by some sort of least—cost routing.  But of course there are also other applications than virtual currencies. You could use this for clearing and settlement, automatic contracts – for example implementing derivatives on the distributed ledger – far beyond the financial sector. You could use it for digital rights management, for music, films or electronic football tickets. If you want to resell these today there might be a danger that you resell them and then the first person who bought them gets into the stadium and the others are kept outside because they bought the same tickets. This is something you could deal with using distributed ledger technology. It could also be an interesting area for government applications – fighting VAT fraud or using it to implement an innovative land register. Of course, with such new technology it is early days; we are not at a stage where the risks that come with any such technology are systemic. So what we advocate in the report is not to stifle innovation by regulating now, but instead to closely monitor what is going on by the creation of a taskforce which we suggest should be created at the level of the Commission, and then to regulate – if and when the time is right to do so and if and when the structures to do so are in place. That of course doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t do anything right now.

Unfortunately, I can't deal with the positives in my minute, so within the negatives.

It's not just a payment system, like a credit card, but it uses so-called mining to mint money. Its security is based on extreme encryption protocols and open source software: the cautions of the relationship therefore have a common matrix. The currency and financial markets are not ready for this revolution and the banking markets do not want it: the banks, as this currency makes transactions cheaper; currency markets because of the huge volatility of the stock that can destabilize markets.

It is a shame we have not got longer to develop this discussion, but I am sure it is one that we will be able to pursue separately later on, and I am grateful for the work on this technology that underpins virtual currencies, the databases that enable a secure online ledger of transactions to be kept.  I agreed with him wholeheartedly that this is both an important and an exciting area, and I also welcomed the very balanced approach that he advocates that we take, which was not to regulate everything, but to keep an eye on the developments of this, to recognise and embrace the opportunities, but also to be aware that there could be some dangers to which we need to be alert. That is the approach I agree that we need to take.  We have been monitoring this issue for some time as one of the areas of potential risk. We have in recent months accelerated our work in order to investigate some of the concerns raised by the Justice and Home Affairs and Ecofin Councils that virtual currencies could in fact be linked to the financing of illegal or terrorist activities. So I am grateful for the support set out for our plans to bring virtual currency exchange platforms into the scope of the Fourth Anti-Money-Laundering Directive. That proposal is set to be adopted in June; it will ensure that people exchanging virtual currencies for hard currency on exchange platforms can be more easily identified, and it should improve our ability to trace transactions, if the need for that arises.  But, as Mr von Weizsäcker said, while it is crucial that we are attentive to these risks, it is extremely important to remember that the technology that supports virtual currencies has many other uses, and brings with it exciting new opportunities. The distributive ledger technology offers the potential to speed up transactions, to make it simpler and cheaper and safer to gather data and to use it to improve business processes. To give just one example, Blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin, has recently launched a claims record system for reinsurers, and it will use Blockchain technology to record details of claims, so that insurers and reinsurers can more accurately divide the costs between them.  So we need to keep a careful eye on how the technology is evolving and being in used. In the Commission we plan to set up a FinTech task force to monitor developments in new technologies, including those linked to virtual currencies. We will continue to work with the EBA and ESMA, governments and the European Parliament, and also we need to pursue this internationally, in our work with IOSCO and the FSB. We need to be on top of developments, and if the evidence shows that action is needed, be ready to act, but at the same time, we should not choke off the potential that this technology has.  That is why, for instance, I am very interested in ideas being developed in, for example, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, to develop a regulatory sandbox, in order to create a space for some of these FinTech developments to be properly considered. I think it has potential to support the collation of safer, more up to date and more reliable data, it has potential to increase the financial sector’s competitiveness in Europe, it has the potential to improve customer services, and I look forward to working with Parliament as we monitor and develop our approaches to this important new area.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 292, "date": "2016-05-25.json", "name": "Elnök asszony. –", "mepid": "102886", "text": "   The debate is over.

First, virtual currencies are a necessity of the present in which we live. Through ease of use, along with our traditional currencies, these virtual currencies are being used by more and more citizens around the world. They offer the advantage of transaction anonymity and a greater degree of security of personal data. The second aspect concerns the legality of these currencies, i.e. the creation of a coherent legislative framework adapted to both the present and the future. Currently, virtual currencies do not meet many legislative criteria, making it impossible to legalize them today. However, even without existing legislation, transactions with virtual currencies are made easy and their use is taking off, which is why we are obliged to prepare a set of possible solutions for debate. The fluid, national nature of this type of currency and the inability of competent institutions to monitor the flow of financial transactions oblige us to constantly re-evaluate both the benefits and disadvantages of these instruments.
