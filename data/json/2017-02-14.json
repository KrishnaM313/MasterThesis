In fact it was the outcome, dear colleagues, of nearly 10 years of negotiations and debates between the leaders of most of the Western European states, leaders who at that time, as we all know, wanted to build up a united Europe after the atrocities of the Second World War, and it started, as we know, with the historic speech by Winston Churchill at the University of Zurich in 1946. A year later, in 1947, at the Albert Hall in London, Churchill, the British bulldog, made it very clear what he wanted. He said, and I quote him: ‘I present the idea of a united Europe in which our country, Britain, will play a decisive part as a member of the European family’. Moreover, Churchill – and it’s good to remember this – unlike the Prime Minister at that time, Clement Attlee, even wanted Britain to participate in the European Steel and Coal Community, but he lost the vote in the British Parliament by 309 votes to 296, a small difference, I would say.  Indeed, dear colleagues, it is good to remember that at that time the Tories were openly pro-European. And now, more than 60 years later, we think that with these reports the European Union needs profound reform again: let’s face it, our Union is in crisis. Our European Union does not have a lot of friends at home, and certainly not abroad; the Union does not deliver any more. It is always too little, too late, and that, in my opinion, is the reason why many people and many citizens are angry in Europe. They are not against Europe. They are against a Union that does not deliver the right results, that is not capable, for example, of finding the right answers to the refugee crisis, responding to migration, or breaking down the economic stagnation after the financial crisis of 2008.  People are not against Europe. They want more Europe to face these challenges, but they are critical, it is true, of the way that the European Union works today. And that is the reason for these three reports. Brexit, Trump, Putin – I think that there are reasons enough to reform our European Union and to do it in a very profound way. That is the reason for these three reports, which you have to see together as one package. We want to do three things. First of all, we want to create a more efficient Union, for example by slimming down the Commission, ending Europe à la carte, and creating a single seat for the European Parliament. We also want to make the Union more democratic by reforming the European elections, expanding the process centring on lead candidates, and reforming and turning the European Council into what we call a council of states, alongside the European Parliament, in which we serve as the representatives of the citizens. And furthermore we want a stronger Union, better protection for civil liberties in the Union, a Union including a euro zone with a government, a fiscal capacity, a finance minister, own resources, a convergence court, and conditionality. I think that these reports give a good blueprint of what is necessary for the future and that is not a battle between the European Union on the one hand and the nation-states on the other. No, Europe needs both. In this report we are also proposing a green card, for example, for the national parliaments, along with a right of initiative for this European Parliament and for the European Council.  Once these reports are adopted, on Thursday, I hope, what is the way forward? I think that there is one way forward and that is to propose to the Commission, Mr Vice-President, and also to the European Council, that we start an interinstitutional reflection exercise, which is something that we can do better together. We have good experience with the Monti report on own resources. Why not do the same again? And that is not a luxury, dear colleagues: this report is an absolute necessity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Elmar Brok", "mepid": "1263", "text": "Rapporteur. - Mr President, Mr Vice-President, colleagues! Citizens expect solutions from Europe and are angry with Europe because these solutions are not presented. And at the same time, Member States, which intensify this in the debate, refuse this Europe the instruments to solve the problems - knowing full well that a large number of the problems can only be solved collectively. The statements by Trump and others that one want to divide Europe in order to discuss with the individual parts is wrong. Europe is more than the sum of its member states when it comes to our influence in the world. And for this reason we have to make it clear for the challenges that we have, from migration to the consequences of globalization to internal and external security, terror and such questions, that Europe has to deliver here. The Lisbon Treaty provides a multitude of opportunities that are far from being exploited. In other words, the Member States have no alibi that it will not be done, but must allow the Lisbon Treaty to be exploited at last. That must be clear. And this requires, for example, greater use of majority decision-making. It is unbearable that the Councils of Ministers agree not to use the treaty. I think it is contrary to the Treaty to agree on unanimity when a majority decision in the Council is envisaged and that if no consensus is found, something is sent to the European Council, which can only decide unanimously. This is behavior in the Council and the Council of Ministers that is in breach of the Treaty and we should see it clearly. And we must also make it clear that the Community method, with qualified majority voting as the rule, is the method of efficiency, transparency and citizen participation. I think the question of transparency is also important is. That is why we want it to become clear just by changing the statutes of the Council, the Council of Ministers, when it comes to legislation: There is only one Council of Ministers, as the Treaty says, which has to meet in public so that every government has to justify how it voted in a legislative project, so that she can no longer explain at home that she was not there. And the Councils of Ministers are then the committees, as is the case with a sensible second chamber. That can only happen by changing the statutes of the council. We don't need a treaty change for that. Nor should we allow the European Union to be divided. I am in favor of different speeds, but within the framework of the treaty - increased cooperation, permanent structured cooperation in foreign, security and defense policy. But please do not set up new institutions! We want the uniform community institutions that are responsible for everything, and not create new administrations in the Eurogroup. I am against a division between euro countries and non-euro countries, or rather: not-yet-euro countries. I believe that we should maintain that oneness despite the differences that exist. With regard to migration - in terms of trade policy, it is now becoming clear: with regard to migration, we can finally enforce the issues of border controls that we have been calling for for a long time. We want to have a common right of asylum in order to clarify this sensibly. We finally want to try to ensure that the intelligence services of our Member States work together properly in the fight against terrorism, and this through European institutions, so that the citizens are finally protected from terrorism and that there are no problems of competence in these matters preventing us from doing so. We want Economic and Monetary Union to be completed under the principles of solidarity, growth, competitiveness and conditionality. We want to Foreign and security policy move forward.We must see that we are wasting money and are weak, given the EUR 200 billion that our Member States are spending on defense with no result.And I am also of the opinion - Mr Verhofstadt has already expressed it: We are patriots and stand for our nations.Nations will long play a major role as carriers of identity and culture.But we don't have a nation or Europe, we have a nation and Europe.That is the difference.The right-wing extremists here in this House will not take away from us Europeans our belief in our own nations.We don't let the right-wing extremists take the nation away from us.This is politics of the past.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Jo Leinen", "mepid": "4262", "text": "Rapporteur. - Mr President, Mr Vice-President! The world we live in today is in disarray and full of uncertainties. For the first time in the US we have a President with Donald Trump, who is marked by nationalism and protectionism and who is proposing to the countries of the EU to leave this Union. In Moscow sits Vladimir Putin, who is endangering the peace order of the continent, who is putting the neighboring peoples under pressure and who is supporting opponents of Europe in our member countries on all channels. The situation for the European Union is extremely dangerous. The great peace and freedom project of European integration is being put under pressure from outside like never before. Then there is the terrible populism and nationalism inside the European Union. The Wilders, the Le Pens, the Farages, they run the game of Putin and Trump. These new modern populists, who pretend to represent the people, divide the peoples of Europe and endanger a good future for this continent and its people. That must be clear: they endanger our future, they are not the future. We have to tell them clearly. Nobody should believe that the member states of the EU - not even the big ones - are strong enough on their own to prevail against major powers like China, the USA or Russia. In this 21st century world, Europe can only defend and assert its values ​​and interests if it works together. The all too simple slogans of the opponents of Europe are a lie, they are a deception of the people, and we have to oppose that. A clear message must therefore be sent to the citizens on the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome. Together we can cope with the big problems, alone and in disagreement we are weak and have nothing to report. This very message is the basis of the reports we are discussing today and on Vote Thursday. We, the Chamber of Citizens in the European Union, are for a better Europe. We are for a Europe that is capable of acting. A Europe that works with the greatest transparency and democratic participation. Europe must not be the plaything of the great powers, but must shape globalization itself and confidently represent the interests of its citizens. No question about it, the European Union has not given a good picture in recent years. Whether in the financial or economic crisis or with the migration flows, the EU acted too slowly and also too inadequately and that has caused annoyance among the public and the population. There has been no lack of proposals from the Commission and Parliament. It was the egoism of individual member states that repeatedly prevented a solution based on solidarity. We must finally put an end to enjoying the benefits of the EU but not wanting to share the burden among everyone. This needs to end now. We need a new basic consensus on what the EU has to achieve over the next few years, what resources and instruments we are giving it. The EU has added value in all major issues where the nation state can no longer act. These questions then have to be voted on by a majority and the veto must not slow everything down again and again. We need our own funding from the EU so that the net payer debate finally ends. We need an instrument to defend our fundamental values ​​when freedom of the press, the independence of the judiciary or the fight against corruption are at risk. The existing treaty offers many opportunities, but we also need new elements to meet these challenges. We want a big debate about the future and, at the end of the day, a convention so that the new basic rules can be adopted. This debate has to start right now, after Brexit and before the European elections. I hope this Chamber on Thursday - for a strong, for a self-confident Europe - adopted these two reports.(Applause)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Reimer Böge", "mepid": "1037", "text": "Rapporteur. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen! Mrs Berès and I are presenting you today with a report on budgetary capacity for the euro area, a roadmap for successfully stabilizing the euro and deepening the European Union. It is not about creating a gap between euro countries and non-euro countries, but also about stabilizing the euro by regaining confidence within the euro zone to ensure that we become more credible, that we are stabilizing the euro and that we are also internationally as we move forward, we gain more credibility than we have gained in recent years. But fundamentally, of course, this debate is also about our European Parliament sending out signals that we are aware that today it is all about the question of the viability and self-assertion of the European Union, the citizens and the states. Many in the Member States say: Ogottogott, time is so difficult and complicated, we cannot achieve much together. I am asking the counter-question: How much time does what challenges us internationally leave us to finally be able to act and strengthen the European Union? Because in fact, as my colleagues have mentioned, we are partly surrounded by failed states where democracy, human dignity and economic development are not being advanced but are in decline. We live in a global village, and some people in the Union believe that building walls can help. No, it only blocks your own point of view and your own thinking. We are surrounded by autocrats and autocratic regimes and in this respect, democracy, the rule of law and humanism are being dismantled in many places. But let's not kid ourselves: in order to regain credibility, all of these are Appeals that have just been mentioned are correct and necessary. But here too, Mr Vice-President, I say to the Commission: we must finally put an end to the madness of detail, which only burdens us, both in the Commission services and - I am now consciously using this term - in the national bureaucracies. That is not always the framework legislation of the European Union. These are the delegated acts and the implementing acts that cause the difficulties on the ground, because the member states with their national ministries write in a lot of nonsense that makes it difficult for us to be credible. Now to the report on the fiscal capacity for the euro zone: I know that there are different ideas in this House and with this report we are demanding something from our colleagues. But the vote yesterday - in the joint meeting of the ECON and budget committees - showed that we will hopefully get a stable majority for this approach on Thursday too. It's about making an offer. It's about getting away from a patchwork that we have seen over and over again in the past when a crisis swept over us. After the crisis is before the crisis. Hence the idea of ​​developing a supplementary fiscal capacity for the euro zone, but just as open for non-euro countries, with clear guidelines on the terms and conditions, the conditionality. With clear agreements on financing, also with regard to the question of how one can help countries that have found themselves in need due to shock situations so that they can get out of this vortex as quickly as possible. I believe that is a fair and sensible approach that can sensibly complement the tools we have today. Of course, this also means that the ESM should be further developed in the direction of a European monetary fund. The rapporteurs the various reports also agree on how the governance structure should look there in the future.At this point, too, I expressly say that this will not be possible without the support of the national parliaments.They will have to have their role there too so that we can work together to counteract the deparliamentarization in this area of economic, budgetary and financial policy at both levels.At this point, I would once again like to thank my co-rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs of the political groups who carry this report.It was an exciting, a difficult debate.But in the end we will reap a good harvest on Thursday and be able to send a good positive signal for the citizens (applause)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Pervenche Berès", "mepid": "1985", "text": "rapporteur. - Mr President, Mr Vice-President, dear colleagues, sometimes history repeats itself, sometimes history stutters. In this Parliament in December 1998, Alman Metten, one of our colleagues, drew up a report calling for the establishment of an asymmetric shock adjustment mechanism within the euro area. At the time, we hadn't listened to him, we had moved on. Today, the appointment is here. This will undoubtedly not be the first report to mention this need for a euro zone budget, but the meeting point is there. Mr Timmermans, you must tell President Juncker that this issue of a euro area budget must be at the heart of the White Paper. I hear voices here and there saying to us: \"Talking about the euro zone at the time of Brexit is a matter of division.\" On the contrary, I believe that, at the time of Brexit, the situation changes. For a very long time we were unable to complete Economic and Monetary Union because we were waiting for the British. Now, the British want to leave us and it is therefore the time to consolidate this euro zone, to make it the strong foundation of a European Union of 27, to which I aspire, a euro zone to which join all the countries of the European Union, those which are not yet members. But I don't want them to join an incomplete eurozone. Now is the time to do it. One cannot both criticize the monetary policy of the central bank by saying that it is overstepping its powers and leaving governments without the means to intervene. We cannot deplore the low level of investment, including in countries which are not called \"of the periphery\", which are at the heart of the euro zone, and think that the Juncker plan may be sufficient. The issue of investment is not sufficiently addressed at the heart of our Economic and Monetary Union. So, after a lot of other work, this Parliament, for the first time, will decide clearly for a euro zone budget, around three major functions. First, the return of convergence. Do we have enough in mind the reality that, within the euro zone, the divergences since the outbreak of the crisis have been greater than outside the euro zone? If only because the mechanisms of the Stability Pact have undermined the automatic stabilizers within the countries of the euro zone. Do we know that an intergovernmental mechanism has been set up - to be improved - to deal with asymmetric shocks, with the European stability mechanism which is today totally under-employed and which potentially represents a budget of 5% of GDP? from member countries of the euro zone? Do we know that we do not have any tool within the euro zone to deal with an asymmetric shock, a sharp rise in the price of oil, a sharp fall in the level of investment? We are the only integrated monetary space that does not have tools. I hear a lot here and there saying: \"But there is the pact, and the pact should be the alpha and omega of economic governance.\" My dear colleagues, let's be honest with each other. The Stability Pact has been there for 20 years and we have seen its limits for 20 years. What we are proposing with this euro zone budget is simply to equip the member countries of the zone to make their currency what they were promised on the first day by allowing convergence between these economies, by allowing reinstate asymmetric shock adjustment mechanisms. We do not say this in the report, but we are well aware that there is work by experts who are quite ready if the Commission wants to deal with it, whether through a minimum unemployment benefit or what the IMF calls it a “rainy day fund”; it is also necessary, within the euro zone, to have a management of the economy of the zone beyond the rule. This is what, with Reimer Böge, we offer you.Once again, I believe that the main message for us is that in the white paper that Jean-Claude Juncker will put on the table before the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, this issue of the euro area has not been raised.second plan, on the grounds that this would be a subject of division for a Europe of 27 because I believe, quite the contrary, that it is the strongest base on which we can build this Europe of tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Paulo Rangel", "mepid": "96903", "text": "draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. - Mr President, President of the Commission, Vice-President Timmermans, first of all I would like to say, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, that there is no doubt that it is possible today, with the current treaties, to have budgetary capacity and that it is possible to expand it in the future with a revision of the treaties. But more than that, that it is possible to have today, with the current treaties, as the Brok-Branson report shows, to have a common European defense policy, to have a European security policy, to have a European migration policy, having an institutional reform of the Council that can make it a real parliamentary chamber and increase democracy and that all this can be enhanced in the future, in the medium and long term, with a revision of the Treaties. What will come out of the discussion of these three reports, what will come out of the approval that we will do on Thursday is just this: we believe in Europe, we are capable, in the face of what is happening in the United Kingdom, in the face of what is happening is going on in the United States, to present a project for European citizens, in which we can be more united, in which we can reconcile healthy and secure public finances, growth, investment, innovation and, therefore, I would finish, saying this and only this: today we give a signal, here and now, to all European citizens, to the European Commission, to the European Council, to the Council of Ministers, that we, MEPs of the various parties, believe in Europe.

The Commission welcomes the initiatives of the European Parliament to boldly look forward. This is something that our President, Jean-Claude Juncker, has been promoting since the beginning of our mandate. We have closely followed the reports drawn up by Ms Bresso, Mr Brok and Mr Verhofstadt, and also the related reports on the eurozone budgetary capacity by Mr Böge and Ms Berès. My colleague, Valdis Dombrovskis, may also comment further on the latter report in response to this debate. All reports cover a vast range of topics, each of which could be the topic of a separate debate. I will therefore not attempt to comment on the details. My President is currently preparing a White Paper on the future of Europe in the run-up to the Rome Summit in March. We therefore appreciate very much the many interesting viewpoints and proposals set out in these proposals, which provide useful information and also inspiration.  The Bresso-Brok report rightly points to the significant, untapped potential within the existing framework, such as further reform to the institutional structure of economic and monetary union. The Verhofstadt report has a farther horizon and most of its proposals would require Treaty change. Whilst it is refreshing to see such vision, we have to acknowledge that Treaty change is not on the top of the political agenda now, in our Member States in particular. The Commission is convinced that it is our first duty to focus on issues, challenges, solutions and policies that unite us, because in these times of turmoil we will absolutely need unity to stay strong. Moreover, there is ample room in the current Treaties to improve our functioning, as the Bresso-Brok report points out, and as was also explained by the Members this morning. With regard to the Böge-Berès report, it was only adopted last night in committee, but let me say this: our common goal is a more resilient and prosperous economic and monetary union. The enhanced capacity to deal with unusually large economic shocks will have to go together with enhanced convergence among Member States’ economies and we need to break the vicious cycle between banking and sovereign debt. At the end of the day, all of this is about people: too many people in our Union have been left behind, and so the social dimension, with a European Pillar of Social Rights, must become more and more important in strengthening the economic and monetary union. Again, let me reiterate: we appreciate many of the proposals in the report and will assess them carefully for our own reflections on the future.  The European Union is a historic achievement of peace, prosperity and security on the European continent. We are bound together by history, situated together by geography, united by our common interests and befriended by choice. This, then, is the basis upon which we will develop our cooperation.  The outcome of the UK referendum creates a new situation for all of us – the EU and the United Kingdom. We will stand united and uphold the EU’s core values of promoting peace, democracy and the well-being of its people. The Bratislava Roadmap sets out the main objectives for the Union to deliver on now: migration and external borders, internal and external security, economic and social development and youth. Let me be clear: the Commission can only do so much. We can identify, analyse, recommend, warn and propose, but at the end of the day it is the responsibility of all of us, here in Strasbourg and in all of the EU capitals, to deliver. This is not, and cannot be, a pick-and-choose Union. That is why we welcome the joint declaration by the three institutions setting out a shared commitment to deliver on common priorities for this year.  Finally, it is good to look back and commemorate the achievements of those men and women who had the vision and the courage to forge the beginnings of what turned into the European Union. But after looking back, it is essential that we look forward and start working on the challenges we face, using all the tools we have, mustering all the political solidarity we can, in order to deliver the results we must.

These are rules which we have decided on together in this House and now is the time to defend these rules, to implement them and not to question them. President Juncker rightly outlined at the beginning of his term in office the flexibility existing in the Stability and Growth Pact. It is on this basis that we have to apply it. The second step which we have to take to strengthen the euro is use the limited financial resources which we have available to strengthen our economies, not just manage a crisis once it has occurred but help the countries to reform, to strengthen their economies, to become more competitive even before a crisis occurs. We should of course do this without increasing the burden on the taxpayer in the European Union, not by a single cent. This is why we need a fiscal capacity which is precise in scope and very effective in its implementation. If, as the report put forward by my colleagues Ms Berès and Mr Böge proposes, a finance minister is created, then the first and primary task of this finance minister will be to apply rules in a transparent, automatic and predictable way in regard to all Member States. The report also proposes in the long term the creation of a European monetary fund which is a worthwhile endeavour and in this process, of course, conditionality is important and also the political independence of this European monetary fund. If a fiscal capacity is to be created, it should also give states from outside of the European Union the possibility to join it in terms of benefits, in terms of contributions and in terms of governance. And to conclude, some of the steps which are put forward in these reports can be implemented in the short term, some require Treaty change and, as Vice-President Timmermans indicated, this is a longer term process. Today we are, of course, at the beginning of this longer term process of stabilising and strengthening the euro, developing it in the right direction.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 15, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Maria João Rodrigues", "mepid": "124737", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, the European Union must define an ambitious roadmap for the future. The European Parliament wants this to happen at the Rome Summit and, indeed, in the White Paper that is to be presented by the Commission. We should not wait for upcoming national elections. The European Union is being challenged right now by the combined effect of Putin, Trump and internal nationalistic voices, and we believe that this is the time for the European Union to assert itself as what it is already: a powerful democratic political and economic entity. We need to translate this into a roadmap with better European solutions: better European solutions for growth with an investment strategy, a strong social pillar and completing economic and monetary union with a proper fiscal capacity; better European solutions to our security problems, certainly by advancing European defence and internal security, and also by ensuring a proper European asylum system and the proper management of migration, in cooperation with the European neighbourhood. But the European Union should also send a message to the world, saying that we, the European Union, are in favour of openness and cooperation based on a properly regulated global economy. The world is waiting for this positive message from the European Union. Then we need to translate all this into new means of taking action. That has implications for the Community budget.

Five theses on the systemic reform of the European Union. First, there is no need or need to amend the treaties. Such a need would exist if there was a widespread belief that repairing institutions is a condition for good policy. Meanwhile, the Treaty of Lisbon is a relatively new treaty, internally flexible, allowing for the use of various variants, and it is worth taking advantage of this. Secondly, the crisis of the European Union is not institutional, it is an elite crisis. This is a multiple crisis. Much criticism has been said about Euroscepticism, a tendency that wants to disintegrate the Union. But there is also the other side of the coin: this is centralism and protectionism that harm Europe. In fact, protectionism also comes from moderate governments, which are closing markets at the expense of competitiveness. What does the Union need? The Union needs mutual trust between the European institutions and the Member States. On the one hand, the European institutions should respect the competences of the Member States, and on the other hand, the states should have a greater capacity to share responsibility for Europe. We need a synergy of European states and institutions. And from this point of view, both reports, the Verhofstadt report and the Brok and Mrs Bresso report, do not correspond to the European challenges. Especially the Verhofstadt report strengthens integration around the euro area, does not trust the member states and introduces majority voting. In fact, it does not hide the fact that those countries that will not accept tight integration will find themselves outside Europe. It is a pity that the opportunity for a pragmatic approach was not taken, to actually reform the European Union within the framework of the treaties.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 17, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Charles Goerens", "mepid": "840", "text": "on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, thinking about the future of Europe may seem less utopian than you might think. Altiero Spinelli did this in the midst of the war and later in the early 1980s, in the midst of an economic and institutional crisis. Many of his proposals have been taken up in the meantime. So let's be more confident or, to put it in Churchill's words, \"the pessimist is the one who sees difficulties in every opportunity, and the optimist is the one who sees opportunity in every difficulty\". We want to keep the euro, so let's implement policies essential to its consolidation. The report of the five presidents - Brok, Bresso, Verhofstadt, Böge and Berès - provides essential elements for this reflection. We lament the democratic deficit in the euro area, but it is pointless if we continue to oppose real scrutiny by the European Parliament. It requires a change of treaty. We want the Union's foreign policy to have a face, so let us accept the authority of Mrs Mogherini rather than providing for each negotiation a different format in which she does not have her rightful place. It is the High Representative who should lead the way in all these initiatives. We can already do this without changing the treaty. We note with concern the fragility of some Member States which are on the verge of falling into the hands of the populists. So let's put the European citizen at the center of European construction. Regarding European citizenship, this is the most valuable asset in European construction. If you really want to appreciate the value of European citizenship, I suggest you speak to UK citizens who are at risk of being deprived of it. It is in their testimony that you will discover an attachment to our values, an ardor that will not leave you indifferent.

Verhofstadt and the Hon. Bresso and Brok, you will see that the keys to resolving the crisis are missing. There is not even an attempt to understand it, since no substantial error is recognized as such. The solution is purely technical-institutional because crises are seen as external or alien events, not as failures of the Union. I speak of migration policies increasingly based on refoulement, of the devastating debate on Grexit, of Brexit, son of Grexit. I am speaking of the social disaster that pushes so many citizens to despair of the Union. The report of the Hon. Bresso and Brock limited himself to promoting the idea, just the idea, of a minimum wage, when a citizen's income is urgently needed today. The report by the Hon. Verhofstadt is silent on the social question. The speakers ensure that they are inspired by the founding fathers. I don't think they did, because the founders didn't have a specific policy in mind. They contested the absolute sovereignty of the States to put an end to wars, and therefore to the poverty that had destroyed Europe in the 1930s. They had in mind a Constitution that would allow the alternation of different policies, without pronouncing on them. The two reports propose more efficient and institutionally faster techniques to perpetuate the same policies that led us to the crisis. The fate of the Fiscal Compact is exemplary. A ruinous policy that divides citizens and strangers is inscribed in the marble of the treaties, sheltered from universal suffrage, spectacularly confirming that the Union is a market at the service of the strongest, has nothing federal and is profoundly indifferent to the principle of reality.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 19, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Pascal Durand", "mepid": "124693", "text": "on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group. - Mr President, Mr Timmermans, earlier you used the term 'refreshing' with regard to the proposals Mr Verhofstadt sets out in his report. I understand the term, but on the other hand I find it does not measure up to the situation we find ourselves in. Europe is in danger. Europe is a political dwarf. Europe, which is the richest area in the world, is faced with a crisis such as it has rarely known: tens of millions of poor people - as has just been said - global difficulties, dictatorships to our countries. doors. We are in a situation where, finally, we are going to move forward quietly, we are going to discuss ... No, we are in the process of, in a changing world, making Europe leave on a starting line with an injured leg. It does not walk on its two legs, this Europe. Europe is in a democratic deficit. Europe does not have the capacity to join the concert of modern discussions, quite simply because it is not based, at this stage, on a balanced democracy. We do not have a clear legislature, we do not have an executive that responds to that legislature and therefore we cannot continue to function. This is what the Verhofstadt report explains and this is where it is very important. We must now move towards a Europe which functions on the general European interest and more on national selfishness. We must get out of the capacity of the European Council to block decisions taken at the level of this Parliament. We must return to a Europe with a Council which is clear, which is a transparent second chamber. We have to get out of the logic that is currently that of the States to enter into a truly European logic. This is the urgency. We must implement it in the same way we must get out of the logic of the dictatorship of a pact budget to move, as proposed in the Verhofstadt report, towards a convergence code which puts social and environmental questions on the same level as economic and budgetary questions.The survival of the European Union is at stake.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 20, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Nigel Farage", "mepid": "4525", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, I feel like I am attending a meeting of a religious sect here this morning. It is as if the global revolution of 2016 – Brexit, Trump, the Italian rejection of the referendum – has completely bypassed you. You cannot face up to the fact that this bandwagon is going to roll across Europe in these elections in 2017. A lot of citizens now recognise that this form of centralised government simply does not work, whether it is the miseries inflicted upon a country like Greece by the euro, the unemployment caused by bad regulation, or the feeling that none of us are as safe in our cities because of the disastrous common asylum policy.  But at the heart of it is a fundamental point. Mr Verhofstadt this morning said the people want more Europe. They do not: the people want less Europe. We see this again and again when people have referendums and they reject aspects of EU membership. But something more fundamental is going on out there. Yes, you can say they are lying and I have no doubt that many of you here, when you hear what I am about to say, will probably despise your own voters because last week the reputable group, Chatham House, published a massive survey from ten EU Member States and only 20% of people want immigration from Muslim countries to continue. Only 20% want us to continue allowing people in from Muslim countries – which means your voters have a harder-line position on this than Donald Trump, myself, or frankly any party sitting in this Parliament!

It did not grow naturally from the population or only partially. It is a concept of an elite of what are called here founding fathers, who try to make the thing alive with a lot of propaganda and with some treaties. In such an unnatural construction, of course, unnatural effects occur and one of the most unnatural effects is the fact that here in this Parliament the main tone of federal music is played, that Europhanatism is found here, while it is not really normal. Normally, Parliament should be the driving force behind the popular resistance against this European construction, the resistance that is becoming increasingly visible among the population through referendums, election results and the like. The EU critical whole should be heard here and here it is less than ever heard. This morning is a good example of this. Here the reverse effect occurs. Here's a vast majority running behind federal music, which always goes on the same schedule. There are problems, so there must be more European Union, if there are good effects, there must also be more European Union.

Mrs. Bresso and Mr. Brok who want to try to do as much as possible within the existing treaties.

We assume that European integration is inherently good, on the right side of history, for those who think that history has sides – and I am not one of them. But for many millions in Europe the drive to integrate is not self-evident. Indeed, they have grave doubts about integration. This debate should also be addressing these citizens by offering a vision that speaks to the great majority, the doubters included. The message, this ideal message, should go back to first principles. European integration becomes legitimate when it fulfils its primary function, that of conflict resolution. Anything that generates conflict weakens Europe. Secondly, the old principle of parity of esteem for all Member States, small or large, is inadequately applied.

But despite zero interest rates, Mr. Schäuble no longer wants to invest. That's crazy: because if I always sell more than I buy from abroad, someone else has to go into debt.

That starting point offers limitations, but at the same time still plenty of opportunities, because Europe has not always been that shield. This is what the Treaty calls the pursuit of full employment, but the Union lacks the means to pursue this. A clear example of this is the euro. The standard of no more than five percent unemployment is achieved by only two countries. Its policy is not aimed at that either. That is why I am pleased that there is a roadmap for the euro that recognizes that the euro in its current form is not sustainable and that the euro can do so much better.

The citizens, however, want a lean EU, an EU that produces as few regulations as possible and uses money sparingly. Instead, we now have, for example, a report by colleagues Böge and Berès calling for an additional budget for the euro zone - with billions in contributions. Money that would ultimately be used to set up a transfer union. That cannot be the solution to our problems. Instead of actually tackling the problems, and one of the EU's core problems is the euro zone - not the euro as such, but the composition of the euro zone. The euro zone is not occupied by countries that fit together - simply not because of their economic efficiency. Doctoring on symptoms will get us nowhere. Instead, we have to address the problems by their causes. We must therefore finally free countries that are suffering from fiscal gagging - such as Greece - from these shackles, and we must be able to let the Greeks go, for example.

I think what we have to stress here is that the discussion about the future of Europe should not be only an institutional discussion. We should make it very clear to people why we are having this debate. It is not because we love institutional discussions here but because we know that the current Europe is not delivering enough. It is not providing the protection or the future which Europeans demand that we as politicians should deliver. That is why we are having this discussion. Some people – in this room and certainly outside it – claim that going back to basics will deliver, but that is the biggest nonsense ever. Just to mention one example, regarding tax evasion, something that our citizens are concerned about every day is seeing multinationals paying too little tax. Why is that? Because Europe has no competence on this at all. It is a national competence and the national Member States are competing downwards, making sure that, in the end, it will be the people, rather than companies, who pay taxes. That is precisely why ‘back to basics’ will not do. That goes also for the euro. If you look at the eurozone, some people still think that, as long as we follow the Stability and Growth Pact, it will be fine. Well, Ireland and Spain were following the Stability and Growth Pact before the euro crisis. They were doing perfectly well and we still had problems. We had to take emergency measures without democratic control. We have a European Stability Mechanism (ESM), in which it is very difficult to control where the money goes. We have a European Central Bank being forced to step in because politicians are not willing to do their job, and it is a bit cheap to now criticise the ECB for that. Therefore, I am very happy that this Parliament is supporting a budgetary capacity, because people need it. We need it in order for the euro to deliver. I would like to thank the rapporteurs for that strong political statement. I am happy that on Thursday we will give that support as a parliament. However, very importantly, this discussion needs to be held in the national parliaments afterwards, because we will win support only if the national parliaments too, rather than just the European Parliament, are looking for these kinds of solution.

The differences in labor productivity have not diminished. There has been no additional economic growth. Government debt has exploded and Greece is proving to be a financial black hole. The European Central Bank exceeds the Treaty with monetary financing of banks and governments and the exchange rate has fallen completely. Germany therefore loses billions on exports outside the EU.

Central to these is the need to boost aggregate demand and revitalize the euro area. At a time when many Member States are struggling with their budget deficits, it seems that the aim is to increase spending at EU level only because of the increase in spending. Given the difficulties faced by the EFSI and other EU funds in finding suitable projects to stimulate investment demand, the question is, how can increasing spending once again be more successful in that task? National fiscal capacities can achieve the same objectives as euro area fiscal capacities and without the risk of protracted remittances or moral hazard. Why should the euro area continue to be over-indebted and take excessive risks in the future?

It has the merit of validating the need to create a specific budget for the euro zone and its own governance, even if this is, of course, only a first step. There is no doubt that we will have other heated debates, especially on the convergence code in which both do not put the same content. Likewise, its implementation poses the thorny question of its funding, and it is an opportunity to learn the lessons of experience and not fall back into the trap of national selfishness and punitive logic. Deepening Economic and Monetary Union means no longer looking at the situation of one state in opposition to others, as if nothing linked them, but rather looking at the euro zone in aggregate. However, experience shows us that funding by Member States entails budgetary paralysis within it. Whether it is the Union budget beyond the ceilings or the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), we remain in the logic of state funding. That is why we must, on this budget as well as that of the Union, tackle the urgent question of own resources and rely on the Monti report to achieve this. A deeper euro zone also means democratic and transparent governance that emerges from the meetings. This requires a reappropriation of popular sovereignty not only by strengthening the power of the European Parliament, but also by integrating national parliaments at the heart of decision-making.

It is true that a lot can, and must, be done at the national level, but it is essential to understand that we are strong because we have agreed upon, and jointly created, a system of European institutions: institutions which protect us against the risk of abandoning the core shared values that hold us together, institutions which are guardians of the interdependence created over decades of integration, and also institutions which have to progress and deliver efficiently.  The convergence machinery must certainly gather pace. Country-specific situations must be taken care of, but not at the expense of undermining the European capacity to act, of fragmentation, of discarding the Community method of integration. A new approach to the working method of the Union should respond to the growing demand for a more accountable, transparent and participatory decision-making system. We should continuously seek improvements to the way the European institutions work, generously exploiting the potential offered by new technologies.  Most of us agree that many badly-needed reforms can be introduced within the existing Treaty framework and we should use this potential fully, but it is our duty to look seriously into those areas where, without Treaty change, Europe’s capacity to respond to people’s legitimate fears, needs and ambitions will remain limited.

The reports indicate a path that starts from the full use of the current treaties and indicates the bottom lines of their revision and at the same time defines a vision. It does so not by prescribing a policy, Mr Spinelli, but on the contrary by tracing a path that allows European citizens to democratically decide which policies to adopt. What are the basic concepts of this vision? The first is that it is not only possible, but necessary, to reconcile different speeds of development with the primacy of common institutions and the community method. Differentiated integration must be an instrument to unite and not to divide Europe. The second principle is that, to be effective, European governance must be democratic and the principles of attribution, proportionality and subsidiarity must be fully integrated with that of representative democracy at national and European level. These concepts are particularly clear when we address the completion of the Economic and Monetary Union. To function well, the euro needs a third leg alongside the common monetary policy and national fiscal policies. A common fiscal capacity is needed to absorb symmetrical and asymmetrical shocks, precisely to avoid subjecting monetary policy and the Stability Pact to excessive tensions and also to support economic convergence between Member States. This capacity can and must be placed in the Union budget and does not require a reform of the treaties. All this with a clearer division of roles between the national and European level, with a robust parliamentary legitimacy and without erecting walls against countries that have not yet adopted the euro.

Despite nearly a decade of crisis and internal tension, Europe is finally growing again and the eurozone especially is growing again. Last year there was growth of 1.8%, greater than the level of growth in the United States of America for the first time in a decade; three million jobs were created over the course of the last 12 months in the eurozone, a job-creation rate more than 2% higher than in the United States of America. So, if anything, the economic data is showing that Europe and the eurozone have turned a corner and look like a much more stable economic bloc than either the United Kingdom or the United States of America. I believe that Europeans want an integrated single market. I believe they want solid public finances and good-quality jobs with prospects. They want, essentially, political and economic certainty. The great majority of EU citizens do not want a federal Europe. They want a Europe that works for them and their families. There are many difficult issues in these reports.

So we were happily speeding along for a decade until we realised that we had two problems: not everybody was driving as carefully as they should, and, more importantly, not every accident is due to reckless driving, as the financial crisis has shown. That is why we need active safety features such as air bags; that is why we need roadside assistance; that is why we need an ambulance for people who have got hurt. The Berès/Böge report on fiscal capacity gives a good indication of how such features can be created within our common currency. It also acknowledges that some of these features could induce moral hazard, such as not putting on your seatbelt or driving recklessly.

In conclusion I will address the issue of budgetary capacity for the euro area, on which the report by Ms Berès and Mr Böge aims to put forward a consensual position of the European Parliament. We need to see it in the wider context of the work on completing economic and monetary union. The Five Presidents’ Report of June 2015 set out how to go about this. We have already seen progress on the four unions as outlined in the report’s first phase: an economic union focusing on convergence, prosperity and social cohesion; an integrated financial union to finance companies and households better and to ensure financial stability; a closer fiscal union for sound and integrated fiscal policies; and a political union to safeguard democratic accountability and strengthen legitimacy where needed. Further deepening of EMU should be built on the existing instruments, notably the European Semester, putting more flesh on its bones and strengthening its credibility and effectiveness. The idea of the convergence code, creating a more binding framework for economic policy coordination around key economic competitiveness and social targets, would go in that direction. Also any further refinement of our economic and monetary union must fully respect the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact. Only then will we have the stability and credibility we need for more ambitious designs. At the same time, the Five Presidents’ Report also noted that, in the medium to long term, completing the economic and monetary union may require further institutional evolution and new tools. The existing instruments, the European Stability Mechanism, and previously European Financial Stability Facility, and the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism have been successful in overcoming the most difficult part of the crisis. The financial system has been reinforced too through the establishment of the banking union. Looking to the future the Five Presidents’ Report proposes a system of public risk sharing to be enhanced through a fiscal stabilisation mechanism for the euro area as a whole. Its aim would be to deal with major shocks, when national stabilisation systems prove insufficient even if the country hit by the problems has been following all the rules. The main ideas being discussed are all around boosting investment and supporting unemployment benefits, possibly via a reinsurance scheme. Such mechanisms could and should be set up in a way that does not lead to permanent transfers among countries or undermine incentives for sound policy-making at national level. I understand that these are the sort of questions that were at the heart of the debate you had in drawing up the report by Ms Berès and Mr Böge. As the report was adopted in committee only last night, we are not in a position today to give you a point by point, or line by line, commentary. But we will study the recommendations Parliament adopts this week very closely. Our common goal is a more resilient and prosperous economic and monetary union. As Frans Timmermans said, the social dimension also runs throughout efforts to complete the EMU. It is clear that the institutional, political and legal challenges are substantial but it is vital that we overcome them. The Commission’s White Paper on the future of Europe will present a wider vision for the future of Europe. It will take into account the very valuable suggestions in the three important reports before us today, which I know are the outcome of long hours of negotiation. In the weeks and months to come we will continue to work closely with Parliament and the Council in this area. There are no easy solutions, no simple answers to such complex issues. Responsibility and solidarity must always go hand in hand, and only when we reconcile our approaches can we all move forward. Today’s debate, I believe, is certainly a step in the right direction.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 98, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Guy Verhofstadt", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  rapporteur. – Mr President, I will be very brief. First of all, I think that the Commission could react. Fiscal capacity for the euro area has been on the table for two years now and then the Commission comes and says that they have to examine it. But that is another point.  I have heard three fundamental criticisms. The first is that this is too institutional, then that you are creating more – and a bigger – Europe and people do not want that, and that it is too visionary. Those are the three criticisms that I have heard this morning. Firstly, on institutions, it is not the case that we produce a report on institutions because we like institutions and want to create them. No, we do this because they are the only way to tackle the problems we are facing today. We have been talking about, for example, cleaning up the banks. You need funds to clean up these banks at the European level. On refugee flows, you need a border and coast guard to tackle that problem. In the future, on terrorist threats, you will need an investigation and intelligence capacity at European level. So we are pleading for a number of institutional reforms, not because we like institutions, but because this is the only way to tackle at a European level the challenges we are facing today.  The second thing is that this is only a bigger Europe. No, in the report it is about a smaller Commission, and less regulation but more policies – that is what we need – and also social policies and tax policies. And then, finally, it is too visionary. Well I think that in Europe we need a vision and a project again. It is only when we show the way forward and a vision for the future, rather than just concentrating on day-to-day politics, that people and citizens can again be converted to the new European ideals. For the rest, I am very encouraged that a big majority of the House has supported the report instead of the extremes on the left and the right.

As I listened to Mr Dombrovskis, I had the feeling that maybe someone like him could be the first President of the Eurogroup who is also Vice-President of the Commission. But now to the debate itself. First of all, I would like to thank Mercedes Bresso, my co-rapporteur. She had at least as much work on this report as I did. I think that should be made clear and I hope that she can be here again soon to work with us. I wish her the best. The second point is: With the right and left opponents of Europe you can always see: They demand solutions, but constantly refuse the instruments so that the solutions can be achieved. That is, they don't want the solutions. They do not want our citizens to get a solution so that they can bake their rolls out of this unrest. This is anti-citizen behavior, what these right and left opponents of Europe are expressing here, it is directed against the people. The second point I would like to make is this: we have to clearly involve the national parliaments - I forgot that earlier. But it must be clear in the decision-making process: everyone at their own level and no mixing of the levels of responsibility. I think we will get a little further in that sense. One last comment: I am for sovereignty. But sovereignty where it can be enforced. Many say today: You can't do that in Europe because it destroys sovereignty. First, the contracts and the competencies are clear - that is the formal argument. But the other argument is: In many areas the nation state is too weak to enforce sovereignty for its own citizens in this global order. Europe does not mean destroying national sovereignty.

We are making proposals for strengthening the euro area, but also for strengthening the economy in the European Union as a whole. This also applies to the creation of security, both internally and generally in the environment of the European Union. There is a large majority in the population that the EU acts together and that we can therefore solve the problems. We also need fair competition, competition in tax policy. It is not fair that some people can avoid taxes and take refuge in tax havens. We need a fight against social dumping - there must be no social dumping in the internal market - and of course fair trade in the world as well. We discussed the issues related to China, and maybe soon also what could be the case with the US. We have to protect ourselves without being protectionist. The current Lisbon Treaty has opportunities that we have not yet exhausted. We have a multi-speed Europe. It must be possible for one group of states to go ahead and others to follow later. And in the euro zone we need an instrument that makes this zone weatherproof. My aim is to overcome the national silos in the European debate. We just need platforms for a common debate about the future.

Divergences have resulted, and are growing, due to a too fast and blinkered development of the eurozone project, on the back of the EU’s soft power and in disregard of the impact of globalisation. Eurozone rules automatically advantage the stronger members to the detriment of the weaker. Such a situation can only be corrected though political action, not through the addition of new rules to the system.

Thank you, Mr President, for giving me this opportunity to talk to you. It was, and is, important for me to give my first speech outside the borders of Austria here at the European Parliament. (Applause) I thought it would be a good signal, and I am happy to see that the signal got across. I am addressing you, but I am also addressing the 500 million citizens of Europe, so I will switch between addressing you directly and talking to the people of Europe. Now let me continue in German. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen! First of all, briefly about myself because I believe that it has a certain symbolic content for the development of Europe. My mother was Estonian and she was trilingual: Estonian, Russian and German. My father, I would say, was culturally Russian, ethnically Western European, and in addition to my mother's three languages, he also spoke some English. His family, i.e. his ancestors, had emigrated from the Netherlands to Russia in the 18th century - for whatever reason, the family history is silent about it - and had success in Russia for almost 200 years. I - I am now leaving out the whole story of the 20th century - was born in Vienna and grew up in a village in the Tyrolean mountains. I have worked at universities and research institutes in Germany and Austria and I speak three and four quarters of the languages: German and English and the language of my home village in Tyrol - a language, I would say, that is almost incomprehensible to strangers. And that's why I don't like to speak of a dialect. If you don't believe it: For the German speakers in this room: Please translate (the speaker says a few words in Tyrolean dialect.). Big guesswork. That means in high German: Last year is like yesterday. So, I could say: ethnically and culturally I am Austrian - and a child of Europe. This is nothing unusual now, in the near future it will correspond to the European average - if we don't gamble away this future lightly. I was born, so to speak, from a happy combination of many unique circumstances. And that is also the united Europe for me today in its brightest hours: a successful combination of unique circumstances. Unfortunately these days it is necessary to remind yourself of it every now and then. Unfortunately, it is not socially acceptable in the European Union, but it has become fashionable, that you have to decide whether you have to choose, you have to choose between love for your homeland, for your fatherland on the one hand, and love for Europe on the other , between the need for help of one's own countrymen and that of other people, between self-interest and the benefit of others. And this either-or is, I believe, misleading. We can love our homeland and the European idea. (Applause) We can help our compatriots and other foreign fellow citizens. We can use ourselves and contribute to the benefit of all others. None of this is mutually exclusive. On the contrary, I mean: it requires each other, we require each other, we need each other. For me, Europe is a continent of \"and\" and not of \"either-or\". I think it's not an exaggeration to say that this is what makes us unique on this earth. The future of all of us is directly linked to Europe's future role in the world. That is why the future of the EU, the future of the European Union, the future of European democracy were central motives, I would say, concerns of the heart of my electoral movement in Austria, and we won these elections not least because of this clearly pro-European stance. (Applause) I'm telling you this because I'm all pro-European Wants to encourage strength, wants to give confidence. It is possible to win elections with a crystal clear commitment to the European Union. There is no automatic, so to speak, for the Europhoben to take over the issue. My experience is that especially the very young voters - in Austria you can vote from 16, you are entitled to vote at 16 - especially the very young voters do not want their future in the European Union to be stolen from them. Also an experience from the election campaign: among the elderly, old and very old - even older than me, and I am already old enough - memories of the 1930s are shooting up recently, and not entirely without good reason. So in summary: My election as Federal President of the Republic of Austria in December 2016 was a clear rejection of burgeoning nationalism, protectionism and seductive, simplistic populism. It is my conviction, and I believe the vast majority in this room, that violating human dignity, rejecting everything foreign, restricting fundamental values, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms, with new walls and old nationalisms, is no problem solves only problem. On the contrary: you create new ones. (Applause) You create new ones. This is not a prognosis, I would believe it is a finding, from painful experiences, especially from the first half of the 20th century - experiences from which we have, or at least should have learned our lessons. So let's look ahead: Compliance with the law and our common European values ​​are the prerequisites for tackling the many new challenges. If there is a decision-making question today, in my opinion it is not between national on the one hand and transnational or international on the other, but rather: Do we still believe that all people are born free and equal in dignity and rights? Remember, this is Article One of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Do we believe it or do we not believe it? In a few days we will celebrate the 60th birthday of our Union today. These last 60 years have been a success story - sometimes I have the impression that it is more for those who live outside the Union than for those who live within the Union. Next year, 2018, we will commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War, the Hitler invasion of Austria 80 years ago, the end of the Prague Spring 50 years ago. Let us ensure that on these occasions not only are wreaths laid, candles lit and solemn speeches given, but that a new European consciousness is strengthened. Because the EU is the successful project of an open society based on democracy, freedom, human rights, economic success - what we call prosperity - and the responsibility that this entails for all of us. I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that this united Europe is the result of a unique achievement of civilization. We have created this peace in Europe from pure insight - from pure insight - through cooperation and mutual respect. This is an achievement of civilization that we can and should be proud of and that cannot be overestimated. (Applause) I now come to an important point, which in German is called the fight against dwarfing. I don't know how to translate that, but you'll see what is meant in a moment. On the basis of this jointly achieved peace, we can lead Europe to prosperity and prosperity that its individual countries cannot achieve in isolation. It's a simple truth, I believe, a fact that we are stronger together than alone. If we forget this simple truth, we are putting much, if not everything, at stake in this Western Europe matters. Viewed from outside, from outside the Union, it can of course appear more promising and profitable for other states - whether these are neighbors on the Union's eastern external border or neighbors across the Atlantic - to divide the Union, us all, apart. I think it's a waste of time to complain about it. From a real-political point of view, we simply have to expect that some third countries try or will try to weaken European bargaining power. The pure bargaining power is trivially less for a single European state than for an entire continent. I am therefore convinced that it is in the interests of every single Member State of the Union to avoid a relapse into the former small states. (Applause) I'm hesitating a little now. I thought to myself that I could remember a fairy tale to illuminate the whole thing, so carry a little owls to Athens in this room. The fairy tale is that of Hans im Glück, which exists in the German-speaking area, but I think it is similar in many other languages ​​too. This lucky Hans first of all owns a large lump of gold, and for whatever reason he starts a large exchange process. He exchanges this gold for a horse, that for a cow, for a goat, for a chicken and so on. At the end it ends with a simple stone. In each case he lets himself be persuaded that this is good business. Now one can say: that is not very wise of him. But sometimes you get the impression that we are actually facing a point in Europe where affect becomes more important than reason. Let us not be persuaded that it would be good business to trade the power of our large European community for the much smaller power of supposed national sovereignty. (Applause) In the end it would be a loss for everyone. But apart from the bad negotiating position, in one Regression in individual European states would bring us: Which of the big problems facing us, the big problems, could the individual state solve better - whether that's flight and migration, whether it's climate change and energy policy, unemployment and poverty, war and displacement, violence and Terror? To solve all these questions better at national level than in the Community? Don’t make me laugh !, I would say. This can only be solved together, if at all. You may know, I was originally an economist - still a little bit. Who, if not the European Community, has the strength and power to put global corporations in their place when they abuse market power? Who? (Applause) That reminds me of arguments with Microsoft, more recently with Apple and other companies, which I do not criticize in any way. But the rules of the game that are to be negotiated, the rules of the game that are now to be agreed with Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Co, among others, the individual state cannot do, no matter how big it is. Austria definitely cannot do it, but I also doubt that Germany could alone. We have to do this together. (Applause) But together we can also work on a Europe in which the classic human rights principles, human rights, freedom and respect have a chance, respect for those who think differently, for those who live differently, for those who look different - a Europe in which security, Prosperity and social peace are at home. But it doesn't go without saying, we have to work on it. I believe this Europe is incomplete and vulnerable. And you shouldn't be surprised if 28 - I'm still talking about 28 - highly developed industrialized countries write the script for their coexistence in a democratically structured way, then it is clear that this will be neither easy nor undisputed in detail. But it's all too easy here To sow doubt and discord. Do not misunderstand me: I come from a scientific background and I am all too aware of the usefulness, the necessity of doubt. Otherwise neither research would develop, nor would anything move in the world. Politically, it is only important that confidence then outweighs doubt, because without this confidence we will not be able to bring about improvements. Ladies and gentlemen! We - we in this House, the citizens of this Europe - are already deciding together in which direction Europe will develop. We decide how we want to and will see Europe, and we decide how our Europe should be seen around the world, what image Europe will paint. I believe in a united, strong Europe in which the basic values ​​of human rights, freedom, equality and brotherhood - I would perhaps say solidarity these days - a Europe where the rule of law is firmly anchored, where the fight against climate change is taken seriously and where we are able to differentiate between facts, fake news and alternative facts. (Applause) I believe that such a Europe, with its constitutional values, can be a model for the whole world. I don't want to say that with a raised index finger. I just believe that this development over the last 50, 60, 70 years can be a model for this. But we also have to say that these European values ​​are non-negotiable. Ladies and gentlemen! In conclusion - almost in conclusion: In my speech on the occasion of my inauguration in the Austrian Parliament, I addressed the youngest generations directly, and I would like to repeat these words here and now to the youngest among us, directly into the camera, so to speak. Don't misunderstand me - when I look around, most of them are younger than me, but the youngest are they don't. By the youngest I actually mean those who go to kindergarten, who go to school, who may be doing an apprenticeship for vocational training, who are enrolled at a university. To these youngest among us I say: It is you who will rebuild the world, and it is you who will rebuild this Europe. And we, the older ones, where in individual cases it is already becoming apparent that our time is finite, we, the older ones, we need you, we need your passion, your ideas, your contradiction, maybe every now and then your respect, your talents and yours Confidence. This is how this Europe will exist. And together we all have to, we all, young and old, can definitely master these upcoming challenges that lie ahead of us. In any case, we older people must not allow Europe to be stolen from the younger ones. (Applause) You know, destroying Europe is not difficult. But rebuilding what was once destroyed is very difficult, laborious and time-consuming. To use an example from nature: you fell a tree within minutes, but it takes decades to let it grow. So let's not lose our confidence. The European idea is great, it is unique and it is worth all the effort! Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude with a somewhat sentimental anecdote. Recently I read a Scottish crime novel entitled \"Set in Darkness\". This title was taken from a poem by Sarah Williams, from around 1868 I think, and four lines in this poem run as follows: ‘Though my soul may set in darkness, it will rise in perfect light; I have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night ’. Believe it or not, reading that it suddenly came to my mind: these are the stars of the European flag. I could reframe the last two lines, reading something like ‘I do love these stars too fondly to be fearful of the night’ - or to be fearful of the next crisis of the European Union.Thank you for your attention.(The House accorded the speaker a standing ovation)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 123, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "President. –", "mepid": "2187", "text": "  Thank you very much, Mr President.

Economic data now point to several positive points. Growth returned in the second half of the past year and is gathering pace. Indeed Greece has outperformed expectations in terms of GDP growth for 2016 and is expected to grow strongly this year by 2.7%, assuming of course that the programme remains on track. You have no doubt seen the Commission’s winter forecast, published yesterday, reflecting this strong economic performance. Unemployment also continues to decrease, though absolute levels remain unacceptably high, so this is one challenge that must be closely monitored and addressed.  As regards fiscal developments, in 2016 Greece is estimated to substantially surpass its primary surplus target of 0.5% of GDP under the ESM programme. Consequently, Greece is also on track to meet its 2017 fiscal target primary surplus of 1.75% of GDP. This represents strong progress and shows that Greece has come a long way. The completion of the second programme review is at a critical stage and must proceed without undue delay in order to underpin the progress we have seen in the last 18 months. A staff level agreement should be within reach provided that all partners work actively towards bridging the remaining gaps.  Implementation of the structural reforms has also progressed well over the past months and many actions required for the completion of the second review are close to adoption. In November and December the Greek authorities passed several important pieces of legislation through Parliament and the technical work necessary for the finalisation of the remaining elements has continued. At the same time, there is no room for complacency. As we all know, implementation has been the Achilles heel of the Greek programmes. The authorities have to work hard on the measures to be implemented by the second review and avoid backtracking on politically difficult issues.  Ownership is a mainstay of the programme’s success and should therefore be strengthened, especially in the fields of privatisation and energy. Ensuring good governance is also key, especially to ensure the efficient functioning of the Greek state, but I have to note that we have seen consistency from the authorities under the ESM programme and a lot of progress has been made since the August 2015 agreement. I would highlight that, since its inception, the Greek authorities have made nearly 200 measures and sub-measures to comply with the reform commitments. This effort needs to be recognised. Our structural reform support service has furthermore provided technical support in the design and implementation of many of these reforms, for example, in the areas of public administration, renewable energy, privatisation, revenue administration, bank governance and others. In general, cooperation with the Greek authorities has been constructive. With this in mind, it is crucial that all partners now live up to that commitments so that an overall policy package can be reached as soon as possible. This is not the time to call our resolve into question or jeopardise the positive economic signals but to underpin confidence and help jobs, growth and investment to return to Greece. The overall package should encompass programme conditionality, including with a view to the IMF coming on board with an arrangement, but also reflections on the post—programme fiscal path. We will continue to work constructively and urge our partners to do the same.  Finally, I would note that on 23 January the ESM adopted the short—term debt measures that had been endorsed by December 2016 a year ago. These measures are essential and contribute significantly to contain growth financing needs and smooth the Greek debt obligation over the maturity horizon, but they are part of the broader package agreed in May 2016 whose further elaboration we will continue to support in line with the agreement reached. To conclude, the Commission will continue to work actively and constructively to ensure that the second review is concluded as soon as possible and that a balanced agreement is reached. It is important that all parties involved show political will. By keeping the programme on track, we will help to build on the current economic recovery in Greece, allowing it to return to sustainable growth and job creation. Thank you for your attention.

I said to myself: “another debate on Greece”. It's a bit sad that this country, which is an important partner, a country we all love, finds itself once again at the heart of a discussion in which we end up, even when we follow our business, by getting lost a bit . I would therefore like to make several comments. The first is that basically we have the impression that we are still in a crisis management mode after years and that we are not in the gradual implementation of changes that take time. We always have the impression that - and this has been said in part by colleague Bullmann - reproaches, questions that give the feeling that we are not, in essence, managing to resolve the situation in Greece. Personally, I believe that your fairly calm, factual presentation should inspire us all to look at the numbers, to look at what may still be wrong, but also to keep in mind what could have improved, without psychodrama, without constantly evoking, for example, the exit of a country from the euro zone which, for the moment and until further notice, is not provided for by the treaties. Second, among the actors in this psychodrama, there is the IMF. We wanted the IMF to come and perhaps at the height of the crisis - this is why, I believe, we must always make a distinction between crisis management and the rest - its technical expertise and what he embodied were justified. But should we not ask ourselves whether it is normal for the IMF to continue to be in the euro zone forever? If so, maybe we have to accept all the consequences, if not, what can we do? Third, I wanted to tell you that it has an impact on public opinion. He is very sad, even as the numbers begin to improve, that growth is not negligible and that a certain number of indicators are returning to green throughout the euro zone, which we always end up with an impression of clouds aboveour heads, which is very damaging psychologically and politically.Commissioner, I hope that you will be able, along with the other partners - the Central Bank and the IMF - to manage things a little more calmly, to place the Greek government in front of its responsibilities, but also to place the whole of the world.'Eurogroup facing its responsibilities.We can no longer remain in a crisis management mode years after the onset of the crisis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 165, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Δημήτριος Παπαδημούλης", "mepid": "28586", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Mr President, as Mr Dombrovskis told us, and as Mr Juncker, Mr Dijsselbloem and Mr Moscovici have said, according to official Eurostat data, Greece is returning to growth and exceeding its targets. undertake with the agreement. The primary surplus for 2010 was four times what was agreed and for 2016 we have small growth instead of recession. The International Monetary Fund has fallen out of forecasts again and growth for 2017 and 2018 is around 3%. The question, then, is: will you help Greek women and men get to the bottom of the growth and continue to reduce unemployment faster, or will you let time go by succumbing to the blackmail of either Mr Schäuble or the International Monetary Fund? produce instability and regression? Those who talk about Grexit right now are hurting the eurozone and seeking \"Tsiprasexit\". Mr Schäuble must stop playing with matches in a fuel depot. They call him that even in Germany. Not only the Left, the Greens and the Social Democrats. Even Mrs Merkel is going to put the brakes on him.

First of all, we should be happy - and that must be the starting point of this discussion - that we have positive figures again after two years in Greece. That was not that easy, because after all, European politics, together with inconsistent reform efforts in Greece, resulted in another two years of stagnation. Now we are finally moving forward. One has the impression that in this situation political shenanigans are being carried out on the back of Greece. I want to explain this with two or three examples. On the one hand, it is said: The IMF must absolutely remain in the program. On the other hand, they are unwilling to respond to the IMF's demands for debt relief. At the same time - again and again in the German public, but also in other countries - people pretend that no reform efforts are being made in Greece. I am grateful that the Commission has found much more nuanced words here. But people regularly pretend that everything is lost in Greece anyway. The German liberals, unlike Sylvie Goulard here, are calling for Grexit in election campaign mode. You could also say something about that. The point is: That means that Greece's policy is being carried out on its back in a situation where the country could get out of difficulties that actually have national backgrounds. At the same time, reforms are required from Greece; that's right too. But what reforms? They, in turn, are socially one-sided: taxes are to be increased for those who earn poorly. At the same time, the pension system is to be rebuilt, although there is still no basic security in Greece, which was provided for in the memorandum.

The commitments to Greece must adhered to, and Greece needs a sustainable reform course.I am more with the European Commission than with the agitators at various points in this debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 167, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "William (The Earl of) Dartmouth", "mepid": "96958", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, there may be some of us here who are familiar with the song ‘Hotel California’ by the Eagles, which contains the line ‘You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave!’. Well the eurozone is rather like that. Whatever the pain, whatever the anguish, whatever the hardship, whatever the austerity imposed on the Greek people, Greece is never going to be permitted to leave the eurozone. But the inconvenient truth is that Greece is wholly unable to pay its debts. Whatever the International Monetary Fund may or may not say, whatever the posturing of the Commission and the Council – which, sadly, we heard earlier – Greece cannot pay its debts, and what should happen is that the lenders must admit and accept that the money they have lent to Greece simply will not be paid back. In consequence, the lenders must forgive some or all of these loans. But unfortunately, there is absolutely no sign of this happening. It is not often that I agree with a Marxist. However, the Marxist Greek former Finance Minister was correct about the loans to Greece. First of all, not one cent of one euro in the bail-out packages went to the Greek people. The money all went to the lenders. And secondly, the Troika was, and is, playing a game – a comedy, a masquerade – with the Greek Government and the Greek people, but this is very much for real. The game with the loan negotiations was, to quote, ‘extend and pretend’, that is to say, the loans were extended, but the pretence was that they could ever be paid back. Greece has defaulted on its debts at least seven times since it became an independent country. When lenders lend to Greece, they cannot expect their loans to be bailed out as of right, and certainly not at the expense of the well-being of the Greek people and the Greek economy. So, in response to the Commission, to Mr Juncker, to Mr Verhofstadt and to Mr Verhofstadt’s groupies, of whom there are all too many in this Parliament, I would like to paraphrase William Jennings Bryant’s famous ‘Cross of Gold’ speech: ‘You shall not press down upon the Greek people this crown of thorns.

According to the Commission's winter forecast released yesterday, the economic outlook in Greece is good. With economic growth of 2.7%, Athens even outperforms the euro zone, which is 1.6%, that is a third better. But that is the little good that can be said right now. The situation is shaped by political tactics. For example, today's suggestion by IMF boss Lagarde, who, contrary to her previous statements, stated that Greece's debt sustainability without a haircut is conceivable, provided certain mechanisms are adhered to, and that the monetary fund could participate in the third rescue package for Greece. But haircut does not do well when elections are imminent in Germany and the Netherlands. The German finance minister in particular attached great importance to the IMF being involved. I think that's a correct opinion. Once the haircut is off the table, the IMF and European creditors can agree on the amount of the primary surplus. The debt sustainability is then given and the next tranche of the aid program would be due for payment. President Tsipras also needs this money urgently. The creditors are on his neck and so is the opposition. The prime minister is sitting in the basement with the polls, the conservatives have announced tax cuts and 120,000 job creation, and political observers are expecting new elections. It is understandable that the prime minister speaks out against further austerity measures, against tax increases and pension cuts that are being demanded by the IMF.

To impose on the proud Greek people a modern form of genocide.

In modern Greek tragedy the solution will be given by the real God, using as an instrument the party of Greek nationalists, whose impact on Greek society is constantly increasing.

The government is cultivating illusions about a bad International Monetary Fund and a good European Union, of anti-labor best practices, and of course it wants to set up, as we said this morning, its own European Monetary Fund.

The millstones of the negotiations are crushing the workers' popular rights. Tax increase for the poorest, corporate tax exemptions, fifteenth cut of pensions up to 30%, collective redundancies, abolition of collective agreements, flexible work with starvation wages, permanent \"cuts\" in social spending and bloody surpluses.

The only thing we can be almost certain of is that it will be closed by June 2017, to finance the Greek government in a timely manner and to pay six billion euros to its creditors in July 2017, and to avoid a credit event and a forced exit of Greece from the eurozone. In my opinion, Mr Tsipras' government has the main responsibility for the long delay, which raises the social costs of crisis management and limits the positive economic effect of the difficult measures being implemented. Polls show that more than 80% of Greeks believe the government is moving in the wrong direction, and the same is true for 60% of those who voted for SYRIZA in the September 2015 elections. Mr Tsipras' government is politically weakened. It cannot implement what has been agreed and is unable to work out an economic policy that will pull Greece out of the crisis.

If we let the Greeks out of the euro, let us free Greece and the Greeks from their debts: this is called national bankruptcy. The rescue policy has failed. There are only three reasons for an endless number of reasons: First: Greece will never achieve a permanent 3.5% primary surplus. Second: The Troika failed to force the Greek government to take very clear political measures. And as Democrats, we can't even want that. Third, the Greek banking system remains in ruins. 50% of the loans are bad. This is a disaster. So that there are no doubts: The situation is dire for the people in Greece. People are doing badly.

In other words, Piraeus is becoming one of the preferred gateways for \"Made in China\" products, which for years have flooded the European market and ruined our industries.

The policy of patting and keeping it wet that has been pursued so far is therefore not working. So I fully understand Mr Dijsselbloem. I would not dare to appear here to defend that policy. What is needed for Greece? A real social policy. Greece's social policy includes an exit from the eurozone. Because with their own drachma they can grow again economically after devaluation. Two, a true social policy for Greece means debt write-off. And a real social policy for Greece means staying in the EU because then they can continue to benefit from the EU funds.

The Fund's demands for new tough austerity measures in Greece, such as the reduction of the tax-free limit and pensions, are socially unfair and painless since the tax-free limit is not higher than those justified by the economic situation and since pensions already have suffered more than 12 consecutive reductions. At one point, however, the Fund is right to point to the need for drastic Greek debt relief, which is obviously unsustainable at current levels of around 180% of GDP.

We should listen to the people of Greece and, as I understand it, despite the differences that exist between the political parties in Greece, the great majority of Greek people want to remain in the eurozone and in Europe – and they need our support. They are the people we should listen to rather than the ideology on either side of me here. Yes, we can do more, and yes, the Greek Government needs to do more. There is a future for the Greek economy in the eurozone. Having come through the crisis of the last seven years, it is important that we resolve this outstanding issue before June so that there is some certainty for the Greek people as they come to the next phase of implementation. I am sick and tired of hearing that there has been no change in EU policy: there has been change in maturities, and on interest rate policy.

I think it clearly showed that the broad majority in this House shares the Commission’s view that we need to move towards the completion of the second review of the Greek programme without undue delay. The question raised by Mr Bullmann and reiterated by several other colleagues is this: what exactly prevents us from doing so right now? I would say that there are some elements. First, agreement is clearly within reach, so if all sides make the final push, we can do it in a short time. On the fiscal pass: as I said, Greece has overperformed on the 2016 fiscal targets and is on track to meet the target of 1.75% primary surplus this year. A small gap remains as regards reaching a 3.5% primary surplus in 2018, but measures have already been pre-identified which could cover a substantial part of this gap. On structural reform implementation, once again substantial progress has been made. There are some outstanding issues, but certainly with a push from the Greek authorities, those can be closed very quickly. The issue we are currently discussing is to ensure IMF participation in the programme, because, according to the ESM Treaty, we work in liaison with the ECB and, wherever possible, in close cooperation with the IMF. We also know that the IMF has a more cautious growth and fiscal forecast with regard to future Greek performance, and correspondingly a certain gap is emerging vis-à-vis the European institutions’ and IMF forecasts. So we are also working to bridge that gap, but once again, if there is a push and a constructive attitude from all sides, it is certainly doable. With the current state of affairs with the Greek economy finally recovering, and with quite a strong rebound expected in the economy this year, it would be a shame now not to make this final push and keep the programme on track. So the Commission will continue to work to ensure that the programme is on track, that we reach an agreement, and that we can ensure that the Greek economy is finally returning to sustainable economic

– Mr President, thank you for organising this debate at a delicate moment for Ukraine and I have this opportunity, as you already indicated, to participate and step in on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini, since she is unfortunately indisposed. Let me stress from the outset that all the European Union institutions are focusing constantly on the situation in Ukraine. Presidents Juncker and Tusk met last week with Prime Minister Groysman and Commissioner Stylianides will travel next week to the eastern part of the country. The EU Foreign Ministers focused once again on Ukraine during the latest Foreign Affairs Council on 6 February and High Representative Mogherini recently met with President Poroshenko and with Deputy Prime Minister Klympush-Tsintsadze, and after the exchanges in the mini plenary in Brussels I am glad that this plenary session offers yet another opportunity to discuss this issue with you. Ukraine remains at the top of our agenda, because the illegal annexation of Crimea and the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine challenge the foundations of our international system and the security of our continent. But also and foremost because we must urgently stop the suffering of our Ukrainian friends.  The deaths of innocent civilians trapped in a conflict area are unacceptable. And the upsurge in fighting in the Avdiivka area has claimed the lives of numerous people on both sides. Hundreds of civilians have been forced to leave their homes. Critical infrastructure ensuring the delivery of water, electricity, heating and gas has been affected and many civilian homes have been damaged. The dire humanitarian situation has been worsened by the current harsh winter conditions.  Today, the level of fighting has decreased somewhat. The citizens and the authorities of Ukraine have mobilised, together with humanitarian actors. This has helped prevent a humanitarian catastrophe. However, let us not forget that since the beginning of the conflict more than 10 000 people have died. Tens of thousands have been injured and over 3.8 million people remain in need of humanitarian assistance. Next week Commissioner Stylianides will travel close to the contact line and deliver a strong message of European support to the local population. We should all put pressure on all the relevant actors to respect the ceasefire, grant access for humanitarian actors to the areas not under the control of the Government and ensure the free movement of people and goods across the contact line. The tireless efforts of the Organization for Security and Co—operation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission and the special representative of the OSCE chairmanship in office were key to avoiding a more serious crisis. They have our constant and full support, along with our support to the efforts undertaken within the Normandy four format. After two-and-a-half years we still see that the Minsk Agreements have not been fully implemented. A high number of ceasefire violations, views of proscribed weapons including artillery and tanks, restrictions on the OSCE’s monitoring activity and lack of progress on the disengagement of forces and military hardware continue to be reported on a daily basis. There are still many hostages and illegally detained persons awaiting release. A reverse positive trend is needed. The granting of full, safe and unhindered access for the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission and then ensuring full humanitarian access in accordance with international humanitarian principles must be a priority. We have said this and will continue to underline it.  Russia bears a direct responsibility in helping to achieve a solution to the crisis. We will continue to call on Russia to use its considerable influence over the separatists it backs to meet the Minsk-related commitments in full. We also remain deeply concerned about information on the presence of Russian military equipment and personnel in separatist held areas. On 3 February Federica Mogherini had a phone—call conversation with the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, where she stressed precisely the need to ensure an immediate and complete ceasefire to pave the way for the implementation of the other parts of the Minsk Agreements, including the political strand. Ukraine was also at the core of the High Representative’s talks with the new US Administration last week in Washington. She took the opportunity to state once again the European Union’s common position, including on sanctions. We do not see sanctions as an objective but as a tool. We have repeated time and again that when the Minsk Agreements are fully implemented the related sanctions will be removed. This also means that as long as the agreements are not implemented the sanctions will remain in place. Consequently, the High Representative also discussed with her American interlocutors how to best support the implementation of the Minsk Agreements. The European Union stands ready to step up its support for the implementation and we have increased our financial and technical support to the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission. We are preparing a substantial new programme for government controlled areas near the contact line and we want to support economic development, social cohesion and job creation. This will be followed up in the 2018-2020 financial assistance programme to prepare the ground for larger reconstruction efforts once the conditions allow for them. At the same time we consider the new government action plan for citizens in non-government-controlled areas as a major step forward. We are accompanying Ukraine’s reform agenda seven days a week, particularly on the social and economic measures, and in the fight against corruption. The latest Foreign Affairs Council showed once again a strong consensus on continued European support and I am sure that we can count on this Parliament’s political backing for our efforts. The people of Ukraine need the European Union to be at their side to help end the conflict, of course, but also to show that a better country is already in the making with tangible improvements, better services and a better and brighter future for all of Ukraine.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 221, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Sandra Kalniete", "mepid": "96934", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, Mr Borg, to refer to the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine is quite an understatement. There is an escalation of Putin’s war against Ukraine: a war in Europe, which has already claimed more than 10 000 human lives; a war to redraw European borders by force and to upend the European peace order. Make no mistake, Putin’s ambition is not only to control Ukraine. His ambition is to make the EU and NATO impotent, irrelevant and insolvent. The war against Ukraine is a step towards this goal and a test for Europe’s unity and transatlantic resolve. Therefore, we have a vital interest in stopping Putin before he moves on to other countries in Europe. Economic sanctions have so far been the European Union’s only deterrent against his further aggression.

No. We have sanctions, they should be continued, but it is also possible that if Russia goes on in this way we will increase the sanctions and have more smart sanctions against Russia.

I would like to express my thanks to the EU Council Presidency and its view of this conflict. I agree with you: there is no sensible alternative to Minsk II. And in view of the new escalation, which we too are following with great concern and which must finally be stopped, we must at the same time talk about the roots of a possible failure of the Minsk II Agreement and its implementation. Minsk II was designed as an open process. In terms of content, the logic of its individual steps followed the political complexity of the conflict, but in Minsk hardly any guidelines were drawn up for political solution approaches with regard to the conflict points. This was left to the parties concerned by the leaders of the Normandy format. One only wanted to control the process itself through strong personal commitment. As we unfortunately know from other conflicts and international situations, such a system tends to not work if it is not provided with an incentive mechanism for all sides at the same time. For months now, the OSCE has been sending us the same message from the crisis area almost every day: there is a massive problem with compliance with obligations on both sides. Both sides are constantly shooting with weapons that should have been withdrawn a long way from the front line, both sides deny the inspectors access to the object of inspection, both sides obviously operate secret prisons and violate international law. In my opinion, the incentives that are still necessary only begin to take effect when facts are also stated by the EU: for example, that despite laws, corruption is not yet actually fought, that persecution of those who think differently is not prevented.

Ukrainians are actually fighting on three fronts today. They chose one front themselves, and that is the daily work on building the new Ukraine. The progress made in the fight against corruption, in achieving transparency, and in setting up an independent judiciary or a new police force is remarkable. This voluntary work, this voluntarily sought-after front, is being done despite the war and occupation by Russia. The second front on which the Ukrainians are fighting is the front on which people have been dying in eastern Ukraine for almost three years, now over ten thousand people. These people are dead because Vladimir Putin does not want to release Ukraine from the post-Soviet, or should I say neo-Soviet space of power and influence. Avdiivka is the name of a small town that many of you did not even know. When the whole world only had Donald Trump in mind, at the end of January the people of Avdiivka experienced what it is like when the Kremlin decides that the fuse has to be lit again in Ukraine, and what it's like when over Night in the harshest winter, a small town comes under full attack. From Avdiivka to the third front, where the Ukrainians are fighting: while people died in Avdiivka, the voices swelled in Rome, Paris and Budapest, and the sanctions against Russia should be stopped. It was Romano Prodi who interfered in this choir in a particularly shrill way. He has asked: Let's get ahead of Trump and remove the sanctions against Russia. He then declared, in Trump's words: Let's make Europe great with Putin. Against Prodi and others who preach such madness - madness in which, in my opinion, right and left are completely blurred in Europe today - against such At this point I am telling you madness: for the EU, giving up sanctions means giving up another part of itself.Ever since Avdiivka, it has been clear that we really need to talk about tightening the sanctions.First and foremost, we need to talk honestly about Minsk.Minsk should achieve the absence of war.But how can you really achieve peace with an occupier who lies about the occupation and who does not withdraw his weapons and soldiers from eastern Ukraine?So an honest balance sheet from Minsk is what we owe the Ukrainians.Whether you see the EU as a third front or as a partnership, that's up to us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 227, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Jean-Luc Schaffhauser", "mepid": "124755", "text": "on behalf of the ENF group. - Mr President, all elected representatives are not equal, some are entitled to one minute more.

Because we are ideologically and lying. And it is about not repeating the lie: that does not mean that it will become the truth. We are facing an economic collapse: 40% less GDP since 2013. Did you know that imports and exports have been halved? Especially exports, despite the association agreements. We are in the political collapse, the corruption scandals. Despite the lies that say they made an effort - no, never has a government been so corrupt! Today, these corruption scandals lead them to make a new alliance, again with the neo-Nazi parties.

Sadly, the populists now seek common ground and accommodation with President Putin, who shares, for very different reasons, their same animosity and is only too pleased to exploit it, as we now see from what is going on in the French elections. Trump’s continued admiration for Putin, his lack of clarity regarding sanctions and even his mooted Reykjavik meeting are very alarming. But Trump is not Ronald Reagan, Putin is no Mikhail Gorbachev and this is not 1987. That relations with Russia should improve and normalise is, of course, to be welcomed, but this cannot be achieved at the expense of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. I am quite certain that the recent ratcheting-up of aggression in eastern Ukraine is a direct result of Trump’s assertions and is probing the new US administration’s resolve.

Thank you for focusing your attention once again on the situation in the West Bank and particularly on settlements. The international context may be evolving, but the European Union’s position is not bound to change. We still believe that the only possible solution is the two-state solution, and we still believe that the current settlement policy, including the regularisation law, threatens the viability of the two states. You heard it directly from the High Representative last November and then again during the debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs with EU Special Representative Fernando Gentilini and the French Special Envoy Pierre Vimont. We still believe in what the Middle East Quartet wrote last summer, that the two-state solution is in great danger, and urgent action is needed to stop and reverse the current trends. The Quartet identified three major threats against the viability of the two states. First, continued settlement expansion, demolitions and the denial of Palestinian development. Second, violence and incitement to violence which inflict terrible suffering and deepen the mistrust between the communities, and third, the dire situation in Gaza, the continued militant activity and the lack of Palestinian unity.  It is very clear that the situation is not improving and on some issues it is deteriorating. Last November the High Representative said in this Hemicycle that the regularisation bill, if approved, would contradict very openly the Quartet’s recommendations. Consistent with this position, at the beginning of February we condemned the new Israeli settlement announcements and the adoption of the regularisation law by the Knesset.  With this new law, the Israeli Parliament has legislated on the legal status of land within the occupied Palestinian Territory, which is an issue that remains beyond its jurisdiction. Should it be implemented, the law would further entrench a one-state reality, a reality of unequal rights, perpetual occupation and conflict. For these reasons, the High Representative has called on Israel to refrain from implementing the law. On 8 February the High Representative discussed the situation in a phone call with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. She told him that the European Union will continue to work with the two parties, but also with international and regional partners, on the two-state solution. This is the only way to end the conflict and move the peace process forward. In fact, as we face such a difficult situation on the ground, it is essential to preserve international unity both on the fundamental coordinates of the two-state solution and on the way to get there.  International unity has led the Quartet’s report. International unity has led the UN Security Council Resolution 2334 last December, which condemned the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory and reaffirmed that the 1967 lines can only be modified through an agreement between the parties. Resolution 2334 also condemned all acts of incitement, violence and terror and called on both sides to take steps to advance the two-state solution on the ground in line with the recommendations of the Quartet report. Such consensus was confirmed at the Middle East Peace Conference in Paris on 15 January and the need for international unity was also central to the discussion in the last two Foreign Affairs Councils.  Just days ago, High Representative Mogherini headed to the United States for a first round of meetings with the new administration. She met among others with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, and the President’s senior adviser Jared Kushner. With all of them the High Representative stressed that the Quartet report must continue to be the bedrock of international action concerning the Israeli-Palestinian issue.  She also stressed very clearly, in line with the messages conveyed also by leaders from the region, that any move of the US Embassy to Jerusalem could have a very negative and destabilising impact in the entire Middle East at a time when the region needs all the stability it can get. She confirmed that the European Union stands by the international consensus on Jerusalem embodied in United Nations Security Council Resolution 478 of 1980. It is clear that the new US administration is still in the process of defining its foreign policy. We have a duty then to engage with them on the basis of our values and our interests, working to preserve international unity and to avoid any inflammatory moves.  The situation in the region is incredibly delicate and fragile. A peaceful solution to this conflict, or even progress in that direction, could set a whole new paradigm for cooperation in the region, including on security. So our regional partners can play a major role in promoting a solution. The Arab peace initiatives provide key elements for a comprehensive settlement of the conflict, and we hope that we can develop even further the cooperation between the European Union and the Arab League, and between the Quartet and the Arab states.  The current lack of a peace process is no excuse for not trying. There are things that both sides can do today independently of each other that would advance a peaceful two-state reality on the ground. So it is essential to say loud and clear that we do not give up. The European Union and the world do not give up on peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.

Second, because my deep conviction is that we are on the wrong track. The reasons are very simple. Once again, we are embarking on this one-sided path which leads us to focus on only one aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which is colonization, when we know that very well, that is. is a complicated conflict with many facets that cannot be reduced to just one aspect. Equally relevant are issues like security, borders, Jerusalem and refugees, ...; however, we are not saying a word about it. We are doubly wrong in that this will only lead us to alienate Israel, which nonetheless remains one of our important partners and, it must be stressed once again, the only democracy in the region. Not to mention the fact that we will thus reduce our chances of being a credible actor who could help find solutions to this conflict which has lasted too long. It is necessary to take a close look at how the Quartet report is implemented in all the recommendations and to do everything to ensure that direct negotiations resume.

The current lack of a peace process is not an excuse for not trying, as you rightly indicated, Mr President-in-Office. There are things that both sides can do today, independently of one another, that would advance the peaceful two-state reality on the ground. There is no doubt that we need to communicate with Israel and Palestine. We have to influence the processes and ensure that the Middle East process remains credible for the sake of the whole region.

In doing so, Brussels not only goes against applicable law, but also endangers the security of the Jewish state once more. I would also like to emphasize a cardinal fallacy of the EU's Middle East policy. The border between Israel and a future Palestinian state is a necessary part of the negotiation process between both sides. That boundary cannot therefore be the object of an EU declaration that magically turns a temporary ceasefire line from 1948-49 into a binding political boundary.

It is a dangerous step in the wrong direction and it violates the rules of international law. But more is needed. The latest developments show very clearly that words are not enough. In April 2003 the quartet presented its Roadmap for Peace. Today, almost fourteen years later, the two-state solution is further away than ever. In recent months, the expansion of Israeli settlements and the demolition of Palestinian homes and European-funded projects have reached alarming proportions. Human rights organizations are systematically gagged. We can only change this by means of concrete measures. We must make it clear that international law must be respected by both parties. If not, peace and a two-state solution will become a complete utopia. I would like to put a few very specific questions to you.

The blatant violations of Palestinian human rights by the settlers and by the Israeli occupation forces continue. The tolerance led to the Knesset's unacceptable decision to retroactively legalize 4,000 settler houses built illegally on Palestinian property. This decision runs counter to international law and any human rights convention. It also torpedoes any attempt for peace to prevail. At the same time, the Israeli occupation forces continue their operations against the Palestinian people, the demolition of schools and houses, the imprisonment of children, the killings and the persecution continue. How do you expect there to be a prospect of a resumption of peace talks if Israel does not change its stance first? Security Council Resolution 2334, which recognizes illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories and calls for an immediate end to the settlement policy, is an important positive step. The Paris International Conference on the Middle East also sent a message that Israel must end its military occupation of Palestine. Words are enough now, colleagues.

Support was almost unanimous, only the United States abstained. Unfortunately, the Israeli reaction was not long in coming. First he recalled the ambassadors from New Zealand and Senegal, towards which he also canceled the cooperation agreements. Then he warned those from ten other countries. Finally, he stated that he did not want to abide by the terms of the resolution and that he was withdrawing the annual quota of $ 6 million from the United Nations. On January 24, then, the announcement of 2 500 new homes in the West Bank and 566 in Jerusalem, while on February 6 the Knesset approved the infamous Regularization Law which will allow the legalization of 4 000 Israeli settlements in the West Bank. And yet another reaction, that of UN Secretary General Guterres, who warned Israel that the adoption of this law will have legal consequences. On the other hand, Hamas has chosen a new leader for Gaza. This is Yahya Sinwar, 55, a hawk among the hawks. Certainly the worst possible choice for the Israeli people, but perhaps not so bad for its current government. I don't know about you, colleagues, but I don't want to witness what seems to be a path already marked with the escalation of yet another bloody conflict as the only possible outcome. After the substantial failure of the French effort, defined as a marriage without spouses, it is time to give a decisive signal, first of all to the occupying power, which is first step.At least legally, let's put the two parties on the same level.The High Representative formally requests all Member States and the Union to recognize Palestine as a state.A far from neutral American position looms on the horizon.Will we have the courage to support, even alone if necessary, not what is easy but what is right?", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 280, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Marcus Pretzell", "mepid": "124830", "text": "on behalf of the ENF Group.-  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen!Just one day after Ms. Merkel canceled the German-Israeli government consultations, you are trying to rise up here in a tribunal against Israel.Israel is building homes in Judea and Samaria.Israel has something in common with the European Union, because the European Union is also building in Judea and Samaria without a legal basis and then complains that it will be expensive if what was illegally built there is demolished.In this respect, it might be advisable for the European Union to begin to turn the legal standards around for itself.And if you are accusing Israel of promoting one-state politics, well, you are probably right.That is what is called real and security policy for Israel.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 281, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Κωνσταντίνος Παπαδάκης (", "mepid": "125093", "text": "NI).

Killings, injuries, arrests, uprooting of Palestinians, even from their homes inside Israel, and now intensifying new settlements of 4,000 homes made with the tolerance of the European Union, the United States, NATO and their agreements with Israel, despite the so-called complaints.

The ground is being prepared for a new escalation of competition in the region that, once again, the people will pay with their blood. The Greek government SYRIZA-ANEL not only maintains but provocatively upgrades the economic, political and military relations with the criminal state of Israel. The KKE's position remains in solidarity with the struggle of the Palestinian people for the creation of their own independent and sovereign state, on the 1967 border, with East Jerusalem as its capital, next to Israel.

The Israeli Government is on record as being committed to the two-state answer, but they have also said this is presently impossible due to the lack of trust between Israeli and Palestinian leadership, and indeed the two peoples.

Let’s just for once consider the reality – Israel has understandable security concerns, and indeed concerns for its very survival. Many neighbours call for her destruction at the very time that Hamas sits on Israel’s borders fomenting death and destruction. There are constant terrorist attacks against Israel’s civilian population and a recognised rise of anti—Semitism around the world, not least in this place. Thus, Israel pursues policies to safeguard her people and interests, and until until a Palestinian authority can be trusted and Hamas desists from pushing an agenda of extinction, it is unreasonable to expect the Israeli Government to enter into agreements with a dysfunctional enemy.

Albania has been a candidate for EU accession since summer 2014, and since then Albania has made steady progress in fulfilling the accession criteria and the so-called key priorities. The greatest achievement of the country and of all those politically responsible, the government majority and the opposition, is without doubt the adoption of a comprehensive judicial reform. I therefore congratulate the government and my colleagues in the Albanian Parliament who, by unanimously approving the necessary constitutional amendment, paved the way for this judicial reform. The reform of the Albanian judiciary is a milestone, both on the way to the EU and, above all, on the way to a modern Albania - an Albania whose citizens can rely on their state because it upholds, protects and defends their rights . My report is in favor of opening accession negotiations with Albania when the first steps towards implementing judicial reform have taken place. After all, these are the first steps in implementation or the prerequisites for combating corruption and organized crime. Of course, this first of all requires a \"vetting process\" in which all judges and prosecutors are subjected to a review. The credibility and effectiveness of the entire judicial reform depends on vetting. Without a serious review of members of the judiciary, there could be no serious judicial reform. The judicial reform is a long-term process and implementation will continue in parallel with the accession negotiations. Less corruption and less crime, organized crime, are central to the everyday life of Albanian citizens. Albania needs continued success in the fight against organized crime, not only in police investigations but also in law enforcement to the highest level and in the final dismantling of criminal networks. The administrative reform must continue. It is not just a question of Albania's public administration being able to efficiently conduct accession negotiations with the EU. Above all, it is about serving the interests of the citizens and being there for their interests. The report has many other points. It is about the economy, social progress, environmental standards, the protection of minorities and responsible work as an actor in the regional partnership. And of course it's also about flawless, clean elections this year. Vote buying in an Albania on the way to the EU is unthinkable. We are ready to support this course with all our might. I would like to expressly thank my shadow rapporteurs for the good cooperation. You have made a major contribution to ensuring that the European Parliament speaks with a strong voice when it adopts the report I have presented tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 336, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Ian Borg", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur. Let me first of all welcome the steady progress Albania has made in addressing the five key priorities of the opening of accession negotiations. These are positive signals, showing that Albania is on the right path, and we encourage it to continue these efforts. Let me also mention, in particular, the major step Albania has taken with the pivotal constitutional amendments which opened the way to a comprehensive reform of the judicial system, as well as the continued efforts for reforming the public administration. Moreover, we also welcome the adoption of the decriminalisation legislation, which should enhance citizens’ trust in their political representatives and public institutions. We now look forward to its effective implementation. However, significant challenges lie ahead and further efforts are still needed. In particular, it will now be essential to pursue the comprehensive and thorough reform of the justice system, including the court system. This implies carrying out the re-evaluation of all the members of the judiciary. Efforts need to be intensified in the fight against corruption and organised crime, and it is important to achieve tangible and sustainable results in these two areas. I would also like to underline that further progress is key to consolidate achievements towards a more efficient, depoliticised and professional public administration. Let me also reiterate the need for effective legislative and policy measures to reinforce the protection of human rights and anti-discrimination policies, including the equal treatment of all minorities and access to rights for persons belonging to them. Albania also needs to implement property rights. The European Council will consider the opening of accession negotiations once Albania has met all the five key priorities, and this represents a strong incentive to move forward. A constructive and sustainable dialogue between the government and the opposition on EU-related reforms will be vital for the success of these endeavours. This will also be of particular relevance during the finalisation of its electoral reform, ahead of the next round of parliamentary elections, which are scheduled for June 2017. Moreover, I would like to commend Albania’s progress made in several aspects beyond these five key priorities. In particular, we welcome its generally constructive engagement in regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations, which remain an essential element of the enlargement process. In this respect, occasional actions and statements which negatively impact on good neighbourly relations are counterproductive and should be avoided. The Council also commends Albania for its full alignment with the EU’s common foreign and security policy. Finally, we note the progress the country has made regarding its fight against radicalisation, extremism and terrorism, and we encourage further efforts in these fields.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 337, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Johannes Hahn", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Fleckenstein, for his work on drafting this text and his significant coordination efforts, and I would like to include in these thanks the shadow rapporteurs. The work finally resulted in a very balanced text. The resolution captures not only the progress that Albania has made in the past year but also the challenges that lie ahead in order to move the country closer to the European Union. I particularly welcome the emphasis that this resolution places on the reform of the justice system. The consensual adoption in July 2016 of constitutional amendments that paved the way for a deep and comprehensive judicial reform was a major step for Albania on its EU path. The resolution is right to commend Albania strongly for these efforts. Similarly, the Commission agrees with Parliament’s assessment that full and timely implementation of this justice reform remains the utmost priority in Albania. Particularly relevant, of course, is the swift kick-off of the re-evaluation of judges and prosecutors, the so-called vetting process. The vetting process has now begun, with the establishment of the vetting bodies, and sustained commitment and focus in this area is necessary for Albania to further advance in its EU accession process. The Commission’s conditional recommendation on the opening of accession negotiations was clear in this regard. This judicial reform is a major demand from Albanian citizens and its successful implementation will foster public trust in state institutions, enhance the credibility and effectiveness of the justice system and contribute to the entrenchment of the rule of law throughout the country. Moreover, it will bring tangible benefits including economic stabilisation and an increase in foreign investments. Beyond judicial reform, the resolution also provides a clear review of progress on other rule-of-law matters and key priorities for Albania, in particular, on the fight against organised crime and corruption. Albania needs to demonstrate further progress, with a view to establishing a solid track record of investigations, prosecutions and convictions in the fight against organised crime and corruption at all levels. High-level corruption needs to be tackled more effectively, and proactive and effective investigations need to be stepped up. The same goes for the challenge posed by organised crime. More results are needed in dismantling organised criminal networks that operate locally, regionally and globally. In this regard, let me assure you that the Commission will be increasing its technical engagement with Albania on rule-of-law matters. This enhanced engagement will help Albania better address the challenges in this area. I would also would like to comment on the emphasis that the resolution attaches to a number of processes that fall outside the scope of the five key priorities but are nevertheless crucial to consolidating the credibility of the state and its institutions. For instance, as outlined in this resolution, Albania urgently needs to finalise the reform of the electoral system. Cross-party consensus is necessary to guarantee that outstanding OSCE/ODIHR recommendations are met. This includes, in particular, the transparency of party financing as well as the independence and professionalism of the electoral administration. Since general elections will take place on 18 June 2017, the focus must now be kept on visible and targeted adjustments to the electoral code. Lastly, we agree with Parliament’s assessment that the implementation of the decriminalisation process has brought a number of results. That being said, it must also be applied rigorously in view of the upcoming general elections. The Commission maintains its strong commitment to supporting Albania’s efforts to advance further towards European integration, and looks forward to continuing fruitful cooperation with the European Parliament in the months ahead.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 338, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Eduard Kukan", "mepid": "96651", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, it is important to welcome Albania’s continuous progress in EU integration.

Once implemented, it will significantly strengthen citizens’ faith in the judiciary and the rule of law. I would like to stress my full support for this reform, and to the International Observation Mission, which is going to oversee its implementation. Albania should continue addressing the key priorities and show a credible track record for their implementation. This will make it possible to advance further in the integration process.  At the same time, sustainable political dialogue is crucial for the country. Therefore, I want to appeal to Albanian politicians to make efforts and address the OSCE recommendation before the upcoming elections. The elections are an important test for a functioning democratic system and a mature political culture. These elections will be also an occasion for political parties to observe the implementation of the decriminalisation law.

A major problem, unfortunately, is the transformation of Albania into a hotbed of extremist Muslims, with the infiltration of fanatical Muslims from Turkey and Saudi Arabia. At the same time, Albania is pursuing a policy of ethnic cleansing of the Greek minority, violating any notion of law in minority areas, displacing Muslim populations in the southern parts of the country and thus altering the demographic composition of the population. Respect for the rights of all minorities is a prerequisite for the democratization of the country and the progress of the accession process. The Greek minority is being persecuted. Terrorism prevails in minority areas. The use of the Greek language is prohibited, administrative changes are made so that the minorities can not elect local government bodies. Greeks are oppressed regarding the education of their children and the operation of minority schools and universities, for the exercise of their religious duties. The properties of the Greeks are being looted by the Albanian state, ostensibly for reasons of public interest, and are being given to known criminal elements who cooperate with the Albanian state. One point of the report that we should see again is that it calls on both sides, namely Greece and Albania, to avoid statements that provoke tension. This labeling is unfair to Greece, which has long hosted Albanian citizens, offering them work, housing, education and all kinds of assistance, while, on the contrary, the Albanian government incites redemptive tendencies and territorial claims against Greece. Recently, there have been cases even in the Greek army of soldiers of Albanian origin, who are photographed making the signal of Greater Albania, apparently instigated by Tirana.

As a Member of the European Parliament from a Balkan country, I fully support Albania’s accession to the EU and I am very happy that the Foreign Affairs Committee voted with a full majority for the accession negotiations to be opened as soon as there is credible and sustainable progress in the implementation of judicial reform and in the fight against organised crime and corruption. During the past year, Albania has made progress in key reform areas in domestic policies, and for that reason the Commission recommended the opening of the accession negotiations. Of course, challenges persist and the upcoming parliamentary elections in June 2017 will be crucial to further advance the EU accession process. I believe the best opportunity for Albania to show its commitments towards the EU is by ensuring free and fair elections. All political actors and institutions have to guarantee that the elections will be held in compliance with international standards, and civil society organisations have to participate actively in the overview of the whole electoral process. In this regard, I call on the Albanian authorities to take measures to facilitate the possibility for Albanian citizens residing abroad to vote in Albanian elections outside the country. In conclusion, the report underlines the improved political climate in Albania and the fact that some key reforms were consensually adopted in the parliament, notably measures on judicial reform and reorganisation of the judiciary. It clearly highlights challenges that Albania is facing and some of the positive steps that the Government has taken to deal with them – for example, its efforts to counter violent extremism, and the adoption of key pieces of anti-corruption legislation.

In this regard, I would like to remind you of the Bulgarian ethnic minority - the only unrecognized historical minority subjected to brutal denationalization by communist propaganda during Tito's Yugoslavia since 1944. According to various sources, people of Bulgarian ethnic origin in Albania number between 50,000 and 100,000 and have been waiting for decades to be recognized as an official minority. Unlike other communities, which are compact, the Bulgarian one is divided mainly into three different regions, which are not connected to each other. The Bulgarian community is also religiously diverse. For example, Orthodox Christians predominate in Prespa, in Golo Bardo it is mostly mixed Muslim and Orthodox, while in the Gora region Muslims predominate. I also want to call for the acceleration of the railway connection and the highway between Tirana and Skopje as part of Corridor 8, which should connect Albania, Macedonia and Bulgaria.

The first reason is that it either supports or tolerates the actions of certain extremist circles in the country, which in the context of the plans for the creation of a Greater Albania express expansionist aspirations on the territory of all neighboring countries. As far as Greece is concerned, these unacceptable aspirations have been officially expressed by the Prime Minister of Albania himself. So, Albania does not create conditions for a good neighborhood. The second reason is the continuing unacceptable violation of the rights of the Greek minority in the Northern Epirus.

In light of this recommendation, the Commission would like to stress once again that the most important priority for Albania at the moment remains the implementation of justice reform and the swift kick-off of the process for the re-evaluation of judges and prosecutors. May I stress once again that it is about the process and not simply about adopting any kind of legislation. No, it is about a sustainable track record. This vetting process has now started and the Commission is supporting and overseeing these efforts with the launch of the international monitoring operation last week as called for by the Constitution of Albania. We are therefore glad to have the European Parliament’s support in these endeavours and are looking forward to its successful implementation, which will contribute to the entrenchment of the rule of law throughout the country. The observations in your resolution provide good guidance in this specific regard. To conclude, I would like to reiterate that the Commission will continue to intensify its support, monitoring and assessment of the results that Albania will achieve on its reform path.

There is a saying in Germany that means: There is nothing good unless you do it. In this respect, what many of you have said is exactly correct: it is sometimes quite difficult to write something down on paper in Albania. But the implementation has to come so that you can see that the whole thing will be a success. Second, Mr Borg: let's keep our word together. The Albanians deserve it if they hold a proper election and visibly begin implementing the judicial reform, so that the negotiations can also be opened and that there will be no reconsideration and reconsideration and reconsideration.

Commissioner, I would like to congratulate you on all the efforts you make on a daily basis to move Bosnia and Herzegovina towards Europe, especially since we are all here friends of Bosnia and Herzegovina and wish to accompany and help the country in its European integration. 2016 was a particularly successful year for Bosnia's European journey. It began with the official filing of the application for membership of the European Union in February 2016 and ended with the submission of the questionnaire to the European Commission last December, decided by the Council of the Union in the month of September. The progress made is notable and we look forward to the opinion which will be delivered shortly by the European Commission and which will, we hope, enable Bosnia and Herzegovina to obtain the status of candidate country. It is one of the last countries in the region not yet to take this step and I think the authorities as well as the citizens need encouragement. Our encouragement relates first to cooperation within the country, then with the European Commission, throughout the opinion process. It is a cumbersome and demanding process, which must be taken very seriously, and which will be a baptism of fire for the recently approved Coordination Mechanism on European Affairs. We then encourage the authorities to stay on track with the reforms contained in the reform agenda approved in 2015. These reforms, above all socio-economic, are necessary to significantly improve the lives of citizens. We then report, as we did last year, that the political reforms must also continue in order to transform Bosnia and Herzegovina into an effective, inclusive, democratic and rule-based state. However, as noted in the report adopted in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, joint reform efforts continue to be hampered by ethnic and political divisions. It is imperative that progress be made on issues such as the rule of law, the fight against corruption and organized crime, reform of the judiciary and public administration. Despite all the positive points that we have seen in recent times, significant areas of concern persist. This is the case with difficulties in establishing an institutionalized parliamentary dialogue with Bosnia and Herzegovina due to the impossibility of adopting the rules of procedure of the parliamentary stabilization and association committee, or the fact that lasting disagreements have deprived, again, the people of Mostar have the right to vote in local elections. Perhaps the most worrying case is the referendum on Republika Srpska Day, which was a serious blow to the rule of law and a threat to the stability of the country. Unfortunately, the polarization of society by ethno-nationalist rhetoric still continues and threatens to impede progress towards Europe. This is why we want to send the authorities a strong signal for the continuation and acceleration of reforms. There is no shortage of topics that require urgent attention, starting with the fight against corruption, which I have already mentioned. Much remains to be done to establish professional administration as well. The efficiency of the judiciary and the independence of the judiciary also require special attention, among others. In the fight against terrorism and organized crime, we also expect more coordination and determination. Finally, but not at all lastly, there is much to be done to improve the legal and institutional strategic framework for the respect of human rights.The multiple forms of discrimination which remain and which are listed in the report must be taken seriously, starting with the discrimination against citizens noted in the Sejdić-Finci judgment and subsequent decisions of the European Court of Human Rights.Madam President, I will end with this idea of inclusion which should bring hope: inclusion of citizens, more participation of civil society, including on the issue of European integration.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 371, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Ian Borg", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, let me start by welcoming Bosnia and Herzegovina’s significant progress on its path to the European Union over the past year. In February 2016 Bosnia and Herzegovina submitted its EU membership application and in September 2016 the Council invited the Commission to submit an opinion on the application, and significant progress has been made as a result of Bosnian and Herzegovina’s return to the path of reform. Now it is crucial to maintain the positive momentum. Bosnia and Herzegovina should remain actively committed to the opinion process at all levels and to progress in providing their input to the Commission’s opinion. Let me also welcome the signature on 15 December 2016 of the adaptation protocol to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which takes into account Croatia’s accession to the EU. The protocol provisionally entered into force on 1 February this year. It will allow Bosnia and Herzegovina to normalise trade relations with the Union and is thus an important element of the country’s pathway in the EU integration process. The Council shares the view expressed by this Chamber as regards the importance, for Bosnia and Herzegovina, of ensuring effective implementation of the reform agenda in line with the action plan agreed by the country’s authorities. Implementation is for the benefit of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s citizens. We expect the authorities to continue to pursue socio-economic reforms while also focusing on reforms in the field of the rule of law. These include the fight against corruption and organised crime, the fight against radicalisation and terrorism, and reform of the public administration. The functionality of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s institutions, including an effective coordination mechanism on EU matters, remains a priority, and the Council calls on all levels of government in Bosnia and Herzegovina to ensure its swift and effective implementation. This mechanism, as rightly underlined in your resolution, is an essential tool for the country to be able to provide replies to the Commission. I also want to reiterate the Council’s serious concern about the unlawful holding of the entity-level referendum on Republika Srpska Day and the subsequent celebrations. Such actions challenge the cohesion, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. And let me stress here the Council’s unequivocal commitment to Bosnia and Herzegovina’s EU perspective as a single, united and sovereign country. In this context we encourage all authorities to increase the focus on sustainable reforms and to overcome divisive rhetoric rooted in the past. We encourage Bosnia and Herzegovina actively to promote reconciliation and to ensure the equality of all its citizens, in line with the recently adopted legislation on anti-discrimination and the EU acquis. Furthermore, the Council shares Parliament’s concerns as regards the lack of progress in the area of freedom of expression and media, and we expect Bosnia and Herzegovina to intensify efforts to address these issues effectively. To summarise, the Council expects the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina to ensure that the country’s challenges are addressed in a constructive manner, in a spirit of dialogue and mutual understanding. From our side, we will continue to support the country in its efforts to implement the reform agenda and to advance further on its European path.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 372, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Johannes Hahn", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, Minister, honourable Members, I would like to thank first and foremost the rapporteur Mr Cristian Dan Preda for the report on Bosnia and Herzegovina. I really welcome the text which is balanced and largely in line with the Commission’s 2016 report on Bosnia and Herzegovina. It reflects well the state of play in the country.  This report acknowledges Bosnia and Herzegovina’s progress on the reform track, in particular regarding important steps such as: the adoption of a coordination mechanism for EU matters aimed at improving functionality and efficiency in the accession process, progress on the implementation of the reform agenda, and sustained determination to pursue further institutional and socio-economic reforms; the signature of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement protocol in December 2016; and finally the consideration of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s membership application by the Council of the European Union in September 2016 and the invitation to the Commission to deliver an opinion on the merits of the country’s application.  Concrete work has started in this respect with the questionnaire I handed over to the Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities in December 2016. All these efforts demonstrate the strong commitment of the country’s authorities to decisively advance towards the European Union, deliver on the necessary reforms and meet its citizens’ aspirations for a more prosperous future. The Commission is also fully dedicated to advancing Bosnia and Herzegovina’s EU perspective and we appreciate the support this resolution provides for the EU’s approach to the country, in particular the focus, through the reform agenda, on socio-economic, rule of law and public administration matters.  At the same time there are a number of challenges and outstanding issues on the country’s EU integration path that remain to be addressed and which are included in this report. It highlights the need for the competent authorities to provide a single and coherent set of replies to the Commission’s questionnaire. This is a key requirement in the opinion preparation process and the functioning of the coordination mechanism. Which working groups still need to be established, will be tested. The Commission shares the view that the authorities need to keep up their efforts on further implementing the agreed 2015-2018 reform agenda. In addition to socio-economic reforms, I welcome the focus the authorities have put on strengthening the rule of law, including through the fight against corruption and organised crime, the reform of the judiciary and public administration. Another key outstanding issue is unemployment. The country suffers from the highest youth unemployment in Europe and its citizens expect jobs and economic opportunities, not nationalism and divisive rhetoric. Madam President, honourable Members, let me also touch on two specific elements of the report, the reference to federalism and the reference to constituent peoples, where I would like to reiterate the Commission’s position as expressed over the past years on this issue. The EU has no competence to prescribe the internal organisation of a country as long as that country is able to meet its obligation as an EU Member State, and there are various models among the EU Member States. Likewise, as for any EU- aspiring country, the Commission expects that the country progressively aligns its legal system, including its constitution, with the requirements of the EU acquis. At EU level, discrimination on criteria such as ethnicity is explicitly banned. It will be up to the Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities to find legal solutions, compatible with EU principles, providing for the equality of all citizens irrespective of criteria such as ethnicity. The Commission will thoroughly assess the compliance with the EU acquis in our future opinion on the merits of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s application. To conclude, I would like to stress that, during my latest visit to Sarajevo to hand over the Commission’s questionnaire, I witnessed a positive dynamic. The progress that led to this event has shown that Bosnia and Herzegovina can deliver, and I will continue supporting the country in further delivering in the interest of its citizens.

In the existing solutions, Bosniaks can elect representatives of Serbs and Croats, have a majority and form a government without the participation of representatives who are majority elected by the other two peoples. It is a circumvention of the principle of equality of the three constituent peoples in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a circumvention of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as a circumvention of the Dayton Agreement, on which Bosnia and Herzegovina is based. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a predominant country. That is why I believe that the Resolution of the European Parliament should call more precisely, clearly and decisively for a solution to all these difficulties that Bosnia and Herzegovina is facing. Due to the importance of Bosnia and Herzegovina in that area, due to the instability and unrest that threatens the entire area, I call on the European Commission and the Council for stronger engagement in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also in the entire Western Balkans.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 377, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Jaromír Kohlíček", "mepid": "28331", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Madam President, Bosnia and Herzegovina is the last constitutive unit of the former Yugoslavia to be destroyed in a bloody civil war.

More complex than the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina are only the ideas of how to develop relations in the country most severely affected by the wars of the 1990s in the former Yugoslavia. This is an opportunity to ask the question, what is the real reality of Bosnia and Herzegovina today? Regardless of the illegal referendum in Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina faces many major socio-economic and security challenges. However, unlike other countries in the Western Balkans, the reasons for the blockades and crises in Bosnia and Herzegovina are predominantly domestic. If Bosnia and Herzegovina were a different country, its obligations on the European path could be divided into easier and harder, short-term and long-term, but in Bosnia and Herzegovina any shift towards European transformation affects the ossified Dayton order. Political contradictions, economic problems and social uncertainty will not disappear overnight as they are a reflection of a particularly complex state system, which stimulates a culture of conflict rather than agreement. Any solution that will be the result of internal consensus, not external imposition, is to be welcomed. What needs to be particularly sensitive to is constitutional equality and the equality of all constituent peoples and citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In addition, equitable representation should be provided to other communities. The principles of the constitutivity of federalism are very important for the functioning of such a complex and asymmetric state as Bosnia and Herzegovina.

But goodwill alone will not be enough for BiH to function as a state. The Dayton formula has long ceased to meet the needs of Bosnian society, and separatist and centralist aspirations hinder the healing of war wounds and the work of institutions.

It is a middle way for the country to return from a two-decade-long search for a model of how to reconcile three communities that have gone through a difficult war and seek a common future while respecting their differences. Opponents of that middle way, that is, federalism, offer us the same policies that have not given any results for 20 years since the Dayton and Paris agreements. The constituency of the three nations is the foundation of the Dayton Agreement, its integrative factor and the guarantee of the country's stability. Changing the electoral law based on the principles of federalism and legitimate representation is the first step towards restoring trust and stability so that a larger nation will no longer elect political representatives to another nation. This is followed by the implementation of a Constitutional Court ruling that will restore democracy to the local community, as is the case in Mostar, a hostage city of a long-imposed statute that has proved unconstitutional.

I would like to highlight three things. First, in Bosnia there is the temptation to postpone things, not to do them at the right time. We have seen this before and I hope it will not be. I see the danger coming precisely about the questionnaire. They have already started, here and there, to say that the questionnaire must be submitted question by question to political judgment. If they do it to postpone the response, that's no good at all. There is patience, as Commissioner Hahn says, but patience also has limits. Second, I would like to talk about political reforms. We have mentioned in our resolution current political principles in our States, but, of course, these political principles and the debate on the political background should not be a blockage, an obstacle for political reforms. No one is saying that. On the other hand, if the Bosnians, Croats, Bosnians and Serbs are able to make these reforms, if they are able to apply the Sejdić-Finci judgment, if they are able to make a better electoral representation , why not? We will congratulate them. It’s up to them to do it. We are not going to dictate from Strasbourg how to carry out electoral reform. If they are able to do it, well done! Otherwise, they don't block economic reforms. Thirdly, all political groups except that of Ms Marine Le Pen have said 'yes' to support for Bosnia. There is just this one group that, in fact, represents the voice of Russia. As in Republika Srpska, it is not the point of view of the Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but the interests of Russia that are expressed. It's fabulous, by the way, to see that a political group like the one led by Marine Le Pen talks about the interests of the people when you see very clearly how, in this assembly, the interests of Russia are proclaimed loud and clear by these members of the Marine Le Pen group.The people of Bosnia and Herzegovina need to know this.The only people who oppose support for Bosnia here in this Parliament are the friends of Russia, the spokespersons for Russia, and that is shameful for our Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 405, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Președinte. –", "mepid": "33984", "text": "The debate was closed.The vote will take place on Wednesday, 15 February 2017.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 406, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Președinte. –", "mepid": "33984", "text": "The next item is the joint debate on: - the report by Gunnar Hökmark, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Semester for Economic Policy Coordination: Annual Growth Survey for 2017 (2016/2306 (INI))(A8–0039 / 2017), - the report by Yana Toom, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the European Semester for Economic Policy Coordination: Employment and Social Issues in the Annual Growth Survey for2017 (2016/2307 (INI)) (A8-0037 / 2017) and - the report by Antonio López-Istúriz White, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the Annual Report on the governance of the single market in the European Semester in2017 (2016/2248 (INI)) (A8–0016 / 2017).", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 407, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Gunnar Hökmark", "mepid": "28124", "text": "   rapporteur. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the Annual Growth Survey, and my thanks go too to the shadow rapporteurs as we have had very fruitful and open-minded discussions and have achieved a good compromise. We are saying that, in order to secure economic growth, one can have a positive fiscal stance but it must be limited by the rules of the Stability Pact: positive in order to stimulate, stable in order to secure the preconditions for growth. I would like to thank the Commission for its presentation of the growth situation in Europe, and, in the main, we can share its view. Growth is slow and it is fragile, largely because of the unique monetary policy, and this means that we need to make it more robust and to ensure that low growth can be transformed into high growth. That requires, of course, demand, but it also requires investment, it requires structural reforms and it requires stability. There are a number of key issues on which we need to move forward in order to be successful. First of all, we need to recognise that the growth is uneven, it is different in the different Member States, which is why, at the same time, it is interesting and important to look at the aggregated development of the economy. We need, too, to recognise the different situations in different Member States and that requires flexibility in the policy mix as well as different reforms and different reform strategies. However, it is important to note, first of all, that we have a tax load very much greater than that of any other competitive economy. We need to reform public services, to reform the labour market, to reform the rules for entrepreneurship – and we can see, in the differences between different Member States, that more can be done. We need to do more about qualitative budgeting because, at the same time as we have higher taxes than most other competing economies, we are not achieving the spending that we need from our public incomes. The simple fact is that Member States need to start with the most important spending before dealing with things that are less important. We need to ensure that there are fewer hindrances to investment. We need to secure a responsible fiscal policy, creating certainty and stability. By that I mean qualitative budgeting, allowing for investments but also allowing for and securing the stability of our economies. And we need to ensure that we follow the rules. Following the rules entails two different dimensions: first of all, it opens the way for the positive fiscal stance the Commission is talking about, and it also ensures that the rules of the Stability Pact must be respected, because if they are not respected we will undermine the stability and the credibility of the European economy. We have every opportunity to move ahead, and we need to do that on a platform involving all these different policies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 408, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Yana Toom", "mepid": "124700", "text": "rapporteur. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. Although the unemployment rate in the European Union has been declining slowly since the second half of 2013 and some 8 million new jobs have been created today, there is no way we can rest on our laurels. The unemployment rate is currently 8.6 percent. These are the September data. However, it remains even higher in many Member States. For example, the unemployment rate was 3.7 percent in the Czech Republic in December, 23.1 percent in Greece and 19.2 percent in Spain. In addition to the high unemployment rate, the relatively low employment of women is also evident. In 2015, it was 64.3 per cent, which is unfortunately significantly lower than the Europe 2020 headline target of 75%. Here, too, there are great differences from country to country. For example, 42.5% of women work in Greece and as many as 74% in Sweden. So, unfortunately, this is the so-called average fever of hospital patients. This means that country-specific recommendations, which will soon be developed, will also play an important role in this report. However, our work with this document was the coordination of so-called universal measures. After joint discussions between all the political groups, we agreed that they were. 1. Active employment policies and the need to promote socially just reforms in the labor market. 2. The clear aim must be to reduce inequality and wage poverty. Although one of the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy is to reduce the number of people living in poverty and social exclusion by at least 20 million, last year this number fell by only 3 to 3.5 million. At the same time, in 2015, 119 million people in the 28 Member States of the European Union lived at risk of poverty and social exclusion. 3. In the field of education, we must first and foremost close the gap between education and the needs of the labor market. Unemployed and out-of-school young people aged 15-29 are currently almost 15% in the European Union and are at risk of being excluded from the labor market. The system of validation of knowledge and experience acquired in the form of non-formal and informal learning is of great importance here. A flexible education pathway can be particularly helpful for vulnerable groups, such as young people, third-country nationals and refugees. 4. Employment indicators, such as labor force participation rates, youth unemployment and long-term unemployment, shall be part of the Annual Growth Survey. Moreover, these indicators will be brought into line with existing economic indicators, which would allow for an in-depth analysis and more in-depth assessment of the situation in the Member States. 5. With this report, we are taking a step towards establishing European social standards, which must be developed on the basis of country-specific recommendations. 6. The report emphasizes the role of the European Fund for Strategic Investments, which is crucial for strengthening social, economic and territorial cohesion. At the same time, we point to the fact that the work of the fund must pay more attention to so-called territorial coverage, because at present there are more richer countries among the beneficiaries. Finally, I would like to sincerely thank all the shadow rapporteurs. It was a very pleasant and constructive cooperation, and I hope that we will continue in the same spirit.", "language": "en", "original_language": "et", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 409, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Antonio López-Istúriz White", "mepid": "28399", "text": "speaker. - Mr President, I greet the Vice-President of the European Commission, Valdis Dombrovskis, and all the colleagues present. Today, in this debate, we value the governance of the single market. We value all that we have accomplished, which is not small, and all that remains to be done in this unique political project that is the European Union. Regardless of the political storms that can shake us, Brexit, new nationalisms, or better said, political opportunisms of a populist look to the right and to the left, there is something indisputable of which we can be proud, the greatest achievement of Europe, which is its single market. A market of 500 million people that, in the last fifty years, has generated economies of unimaginable scale for European companies, helping us to create transnational competitiveness, new business opportunities and new jobs. A single market that has contributed, more than any other policy adopted in this house or in the Council, to better integrate European companies by offering them international value chains and, therefore, competitiveness on a global scale. The European single market has increased the supply of consumers, offering them lower prices, and has allowed citizens to live, work and study in the place they want. The changing environment of the Union, the external effects of globalization are permanent challenges for the single market, to which it has to adapt. We, as legislators and fulfilling the political mandate that was given to us by the citizens, must permanently optimize the policies aimed at consolidating the economic recovery and promoting convergence towards those who obtain the best results. The obstacles detected in the markets for goods and services are a brake on the productivity and competitiveness of the European economy. Businesses often feel stifled by rules outdated and excessively burdensome. In my report I wanted to highlight the imperative need to remove barriers to the single market and create the right environment for the growth of our economies. At the same time, we have to be especially vigilant about innovation and global value chains that are creating important new opportunities. Digital technologies are transforming many industrial sectors, enabling more efficient production and new and innovative business models. Increasingly, services and industry are coming together in clean and smart business offerings that bring greater added value to their customers. However, this innovation also challenges traditional business models and consumer-business relationships. In this sense, and to improve the European economic model and restore competitiveness, a global combination of public resources, structural reforms and selective investments is required. All the institutions and Member States of the Union must act together if a sustainable recovery is to be achieved and the convergence process revitalized. This requires close involvement of the European Parliament and national parliaments, the social partners, national, regional and local authorities and civil society as a whole. The Investment Plan is now operational, aimed at mobilizing at least 315 million euros in new investments over three years and returning investment to sustainable levels prior to the crisis. This plan, announced and implemented in record time, aims to stimulate investment financing, remove obstacles, increase innovation and deepen the single market. Europe provides the money, but, as always, the Member States play a key role in achieving these goals, and I must say not always successfully. The report of The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, for which I was rapporteur, presents a text agreed between the pro-European political forces, which identify with a better and more efficient Europe. In this sense, IMCO focuses its attention on three fundamental aspects: strengthening the single market pillar within the European Semester process, harnessing the potential of the single market in key growth areas and strengthening the governance of the single market. We ask the European Commission to strengthen the single market pillar through a periodic monitoring system to determine the specific barriers of each country to the single market and to assess integration and competitiveness in the single market. We ask to take advantage of the potential of the market by collecting and working on the information obtained from the Member States, to reshape, incorporate, apply and enforce the regulatory framework of the single market with the ultimate objective of offering very concrete results to citizens. In our view, the European Commission should systematically monitor the application and enforcement of the Single Market rules through country-specific recommendations, especially when these rules contribute to structural reforms. In this context, I recall that the objectives of the Investment Plan for Europe, the Juncker Plan, include the removal of obstacles, increased innovation and deepening of the single market. I want to emphasize, in this regard, that improving the investment environment means strengthening the single market by increasing regulatory predictability, reinforcing a level playing field within the Union and removing obstacles to investment within and outside the Union. Despite the removal of tariff barriers in the single market, a large number of various non-tariff barriers persist, and I believe that strengthening the single market requires urgent action at national and Union level to remove these types of barriers.I obviously want to thank my colleagues and the shadow rapporteurs for the good work they have done: I think our committee is proud that we are working in this regard.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 410, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Jean-Paul Denanot", "mepid": "94282", "text": "draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - Mr President, today I call on our Parliament to integrate three particularly important axes into its thinking. First, the issue of state spending, generated by policies linked to food aid, European defense and international cooperation, for example, should be able to be taken out of the convergence criteria to allow new investments. Second, the economic policies of the European Union, and in particular of the euro area, cannot be confined to strict compliance with the criteria which are now obsolete and ineffective. The reduction of the public deficit must be achieved by increasing tax revenues by combating tax fraud, specifically, and by further taxing financial transactions. Third, now is the time for the European Union to consider the pooling of sovereign debt exceeding the 60% set by the convergence criteria. Imagine, for example, a financial fund common to the 19 countries of the euro zone which would then make it possible, at least partially, to renegotiate their common debts. Jean Monnet said in his memoirs: \"When men find themselves in a new situation, they adapt and change.

Already, earlier this month, the European Parliamentary Week provided valuable exchanges. Events like this are important to enrich our dialogue and further improve the ownership and efficiency of the European Semester. Since its inception the European Semester has proven instrumental in fostering, guiding and supporting the reform process in the Member States and in improving their economic and social performance. This was true both during the crisis and in a more recent context of a moderate recovery. Yesterday the Commission released the winter economic forecast. It shows the resilience of the European economy despite increased uncertainty. Growth at the end of the last year was better than expected and is expected to continue at a moderate but firm pace. For the euro area we see GDP growth of 1.6% in 2017 and 1.8% next year. The EU as a whole should follow a similar pattern, and is forecast to expand by 1.8% this year and the next. The EU’s GDP is now higher than before the crisis and all Member States are set to grow for the next two years. The situation in public finances is also improving. The average budget deficit in the euro area is expected to go down from 1.7% of GDP in 2016 to 1.4% of GDP this year. The average public debt is also going down while remaining at still high levels: around 90% of GDP in the euro area and 85% of GDP in the EU as a whole.  Recently there have been some labour market gains that have supported the expansion of private consumption. Investment still remains relatively weak. Private consumption will remain the main driver of growth, supported by sustained improvements in employment and a nominal wage growth. The global economic context is also improving with global growth reaching 3.4% this year compared with 3% last year.  However, these positive trends go together with a number of challenges and uncertainties, both internal and external, that we need to tackle. Internally there are clear economic and social challenges such as continuously high unemployment and poverty levels, income disparities across and within countries, low productivity growth, and increasing divergence in productivity performance across firms and sectors. Public and private debt levels remain high. There are also persistent pockets of weakness in the banking sector, including high non-performing loans in several Member States. The upcoming country reports will zoom in on where problems occur and where more determined strategies to deal with this issue are needed. The ongoing work to build a true capital markets union is also important in this respect as it aims at widening and diversifying companies’ financing sources. And more integrated capital markets would also contribute to the development of a secondary market for non-performing loans. These challenges remain a drag on our immediate growth prospects, and long-term growth might also be affected as unused labour force and a relatively low level of productive investment can permanently impact our economic growth potential. The over-arching message from the Commission’s 2017 annual growth survey of last November is that we have to redouble efforts amongst a virtuous triangle of investment, structural reforms and responsible fiscal policies. In doing so we have to keep focus on social fairness and delivering an economic recovery that benefits all, notably the weaker parts of our societies. To strengthen the potential inherent in our economies, we need to continue in particular to strengthen investment in education, training and skills as well as in research and development and infrastructure. More efficient public procurement and full absorption of available EU funds can contribute to these objectives. Guaranteeing well-functioning product services and labour markets and promoting an effective uptake and integration of new business models should also remain priority areas for policy makers. National reforms and making the most of the single market in all sectors are essential. Sustainable public finances and remaining alert to the emergence of imbalances in the private sector are the foundation on which to build a sustainable growth. All this is a sizeable agenda and the work on it continues. Next week the Commission will present its country-specific analysis in the country reports prepared by the Commission services. We will then have a sharper image of the challenges and progress made in each Member State. During the period of publication of the country reports, we will strive to make the most of our strengthened dialogue with Member States at all levels, notably through high-level visits to Member States. We have taken particular care to better include them in the writing phase of the country reports as well, and this continued dialogue is of utmost importance in order to come to a common understanding of the most pertinent policy issues. For the 13 countries identified in the 2017 Alert Mechanism Report the country reports will include an in-depth review, analysing the presence and nature of macroeconomic imbalances. On the whole we can expect continued progress with imbalances gradually being worked out. Also next week we will issue an Article 126(3) report for Italy. As you know there is a need for additional structural adjustment of at least 0.2% of GDP in order to achieve broad compliance with the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact this year. The Italian Government has since made a clear and public commitment to adopt the additional measures by the end of April. The Commission is expecting the national reform programmes and the stability and convergence programmes by mid-April. This year again the Commission encourages the close involvement of national parliaments, social partners, local authorities and all stakeholders in the preparation of national programmes. We will present as usual in May the 2017 set of the country-specific recommendations.  The Commission welcomes the European Parliament’s active involvement in the debate on the European Semester; we pay close attention to your views.

This ambition must include investment in human capital as a way of boosting productivity, adapting the skills of workers to the needs of companies and guaranteeing the social integration of the most disadvantaged. Let us not forget, in this context, the fundamental role that the social economy plays. It also involves an individualized approach to the unemployed at the level of the Member States, especially the long-term, ensuring adequate support with regard to training and professional reintegration mechanisms, working so that they do not result in processes of harnessing labor cheap work. It also implies the definition of policies that are based on the virtuous triangle of investment, that brings economic and social return, in the definition of structural reforms that guarantee the sustainability of the European economic and social model and fiscal consolidation, guaranteeing a decent future for future generations. . As tempting as it may be to focus on current results, we must be able to envision the future.

The central issue is clear: the monetary policy of the European Central Bank is not enough, neither to ensure the sustained growth of the economy and employment, nor to promote a new impetus for the prosperity and convergence that Europe needs. For this reason, in this report, Parliament supports a strategy that, not only in words but in reality, is based on a virtuous triangle of public and private investment, namely in infrastructure, socially balanced structural reforms that respect social rights and responsible public finances. , with full respect for the flexibility allowed by the rules. But there is an issue that still needs to be assumed: the proposal, the great novelty of the Commission, is the defense of a moderately expansionist fiscal policy. Now, this novelty after years of austerity is no small feat.

While appreciating the great importance of the European Semester as the EU calendar for the coordination of economic policies of the European Union Member States, it should be noted that in my opinion some problematic issues appeared in the final report. These are provisions that violate the competences of the Member States, for example, the introduction of gender equality in national reform programs, or the issue of gender equality written in the report in a prescriptive manner: gender in reform programs, gender in convergence programs, gender in stability programs, etc. The provisions promoting refugee as a workforce and a factor contributing to the improvement of demographics in the EU countries are also problematic.

We have a good balance and this supports the report of the European Commission. Some points that are important to us: First, we must be clear about economic and budgetary policies. We need stability, especially in the current economic and political climate. That is why it is important that the rules are not only on paper but also observed and enforced. This is essential for the confidence of businesses and investors and for the confidence of citizens in Europe. Second, we reiterate the importance of reforms and modernizing economies. We ask Member States to better follow up on country-specific recommendations. The potential for economic growth, innovation and investment is still too limited. The single market is not yet complete and the rules are not applied in the same way everywhere. Our companies are affected by this. They must have access to venture capital. We must continue to invest in research and development, education and health to be more competitive in the world. My last point is about compromise X, which just failed to make it in ECON yesterday. This compromise adds a new element to the report. It requires more attention to the sustainability of the budgets. We often see a conflict between short and long term political goals. I find the shifting of debts to the next generation for short-term political considerations economically but also ethically irresponsible. To counter this, we ask the Commission to develop an indicator that measures the effect of the budget on future generations. We hope that this transparency will help us make better budgetary decisions, including for our children and grandchildren.

This is what the European Semester and its so-called social recommendations are about, conditional on reinforcing the power of capital over the economy, from privatizations to deregulations. It is a debate that I illustrate with the minimum income, but that is transversal to all the debates on governance and European constitutionalism that we have had today, of whether it is better to add a social pillar to the eurozone or to refound Europe on elements such as the Social Charter, for example. The social democracy continues to defend neoliberal economic policies in exchange for minimal advances in social protection, but both objectives are incompatible in the long term.

We felt that the general message that if only we follow the Growth and Stability Pact all will be well, fails to give some real weight to the need to ensure we have balance between the economic development that we need and the social dimension of our considerations, given that we want to improve the quality of life and future prospects for many people within the European Union. And it is not just, I think, a question, as has been said earlier, about the pursuit of growth. It is a lot as well about its distribution, whether it is inclusive, whether it is actually reducing those gaps that we have, as well, of course, as its environmental effect. We welcome the progress made on achieving a better balance between the economic and social dimensions. It is something that this Parliament has pushed for from the very start of this process. But we still want to assert that employment and economic indicators have to be on an equal footing, because this triggers an in-depth analysis and the corrective action that is necessary in relative Member States. There is certainly a need for corrective action if we are to tackle the gross inequalities that still exist in too many places: inequality of income, inequality of opportunity and too much of that lack of opportunity is still based on social class and discrimination. And some of us in this House, in fact I feel a majority, still think it is shocking that we actually have a gender pay gap and that so many people are unable to use their talents because of discrimination.  So we need to reduce those gaps to ensure that our social security systems can meet the needs of changing societies and our changing work patterns and provide a genuine work-life balance. We need to provide relevant lifelong learning, not least in STEM and digital skills so that people can find new employment in decent jobs that pay a living wage. And we still have too many people in poverty even if they are in work. So we really do need to take seriously the question about adequate minimum income schemes at whatever stage of life you are in. As we have also been hearing, we still have far too many children disadvantaged from the very beginning of their lives and we do need to deliver on the child guarantee. And we also need to deliver on decent housing.

Against this background, my country, Poland, which does not belong to the euro area, shows stable and balanced economic growth, which in 2016 amounted to 2.8% of GDP, and in 2017 it is planned at 3.6% of GDP, while maintaining a responsible budget policy, which is reflected in the deficit of the public finance sector, clearly below 3% of GDP.

The euro is now recognized as an instrument of divergence that has dismantled much of the economies of the Member States, imposing cuts in investment, privatizations, attacks on the social functions of the State and its public services.

First, oil prices have started to rise again and will therefore act as an additional tax on output. The second thing is the euro which has strengthened against the other major currencies. And finally monetary policy has reached its limits and cannot provide any further stimulus to the European economy. So we have to rely on other measures and among them I think the most important are structural reforms and, of course, investment.  The problem with investment is that not only is public investment lagging behind, a long-term trend, but also, what is most important, private investment is not picking up, at least not to the extent expected.

The Juncker Plan has shown all its limitations and its ineffectiveness. Within this growth there are gray areas, but also uniformity, there are areas in which it is necessary to aim for targeted interventions, starting with infrastructural ones to give those areas the ability to attract investments and capital. Then there is employment, uneven employment, also largely insufficient, with an obvious problem that concerns women on the one hand and young people on the other.

But in the face of this exceptional crisis, the response given by the European Commission is practically ordinary, as if nothing had happened since 2014. And I believe that it is necessary to take a turn, a social turn and a turn also in economic policy precisely to combat today the problems that plague us in the European Union as a whole. We need a more social Europe. We need to bet on the increase in wages, not only to make a recovery of a fairer nature, but also and fundamentally so that the recovery is also more sustained over time. We need more support for the long-term unemployed. We need to support more, also, youth employment. And we also need to promote expansionary policy not only with the Juncker Plan, not only betting on the public-private initiative, but also allowing Member States to invest in strategic areas, increase public investment. We believe that in this situation we must not only provide good words and good intentions, but we must find forceful solutions to prevent this year 2017 from being another year in the political deficit and in the political response of the European Commission to the problems that plague to the citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 439, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Tom Vandenkendelaere (PPE).", "mepid": "129164", "text": "- We note that a sustained three-track policy of investment, structural reforms and sound public finances is starting to bear fruit.

The Belgians are, by the way, with an output of 2.9 billion, in a nice seventh place in the European rankings. Second, however, structural reforms are also being implemented. The Member States themselves do learn from each other's good examples, so that the reforms of the labor market ensure qualitative job creation. The figures don't lie there either. In the third quarter of 2016, no less than 2.8 million extra permanent contracts were added. That is six times more than the temporary jobs. Quality jobs offer protection, not only because people earn money, but because they also provide social protection. An adequate social system arms countries and their citizens in times of economic downturn and that is why I am looking forward to the proposal for a European social pillar. However, it is an and-en story. The strict path of the Stability and Growth Pact must absolutely not be abandoned. If we look at the national debt, for example: it is fortunately declining throughout the European Union, but Belgium is lagging behind with a public debt of 107 percent of our GDP.

This time it is done. And this global reflection leads the Commission to assume that a different fiscal policy is necessary, an expansionary fiscal policy for the euro area as a whole, which will probably have to be combined with different approaches in each of the countries.

But it is no less true that there is still a long way to go. The European Central Bank has done its part. Monetary policy alone is not enough to stimulate growth.

The share of long-term unemployed is increasing, employment rates among low-skilled workers have continued to fall by 1.4% since 2014.

It may have taken us years to convince colleagues on the right on the need for more public investment, but I am glad we have got there, given the challenges that lie ahead for everyone. It is good that the EU is experiencing green shoots of growth, but that should not make us complacent. The growth needs to be sustained by four points.

The other is that external risks have intensified. That is why I am convinced that there is a need to increase efficiency and that the Commission needs to pay special attention to this. This requires an even greater partnership between the Commission and the actors, including Parliament and national actors. To do this, we need to be able to discuss each milestone much more intensively and also focus on the 2020 target in a targeted way.

The main question is what we can do to strengthen the economy of the European Union. The answer is that every Member State of the European Union has to have a stronger economy in order to make the economy of the Union as a whole much stronger. Member States have to converge, and they have to converge towards the level of the strongest and most competitive members. How can we achieve this in practice? Firstly, the implementation of structural reforms, as outlined in the country—specific recommendations, is essential. Only 4% of country—specific recommendations are fully implemented, and more than 50% are not implemented at all. We have to support Member States in order to improve on the implementation of the country—specific recommendations and we have to find incentives for Member States to implement the reforms which we all know that they need, and which are written in the country—specific recommendations, but which are not yet implemented well enough. To strengthen our economies so that they can face the next crisis, improving their competitiveness and reforming is the best recipe. The second element is trust.

We need to do more. The aggregated level is important to see, but it is important to see also the different developments in different countries, because there we can see that different policies have been giving different results.

Since mid-2012 when it was initiated, we have come a long way towards addressing the negative feedback loop and other damaging procyclical ties between banks and sovereigns. However, like the economic governance which we have been intensely discussing during the session, also the Banking Union is halfway through. We have unfinished business with the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), with the fiscal backstop, with possible changes in the prudential treatment of sovereign debt to further dealing banks and sovereign, and with possible transfer of the full responsibility for emergency liquidity assistance to the central level.  We also have legacy issues to deal with, such as non-performing loans. What I intended to do with this report was to give a critical overview of the challenges we are facing, while not pre-empting the outcome of the legislative discussions on EDIS, as well as on the new banking package that amends CRR/CRD, BRRD and the Single Resolution Mechanism regulation. The recommendations of the report concern all the pillars of the Banking Union, the supervision resolution and deposit insurance, and it looks into a variety of issues.  Through excellent cooperation with other colleagues, we have built broad consensus on this comprehensive report and we look with much detail into all areas where recommendations can be made. The report has become a helpful stock—taking exercise before handing over to the colleagues leading the legislative discussions. I hope the messages will be taken into account and will feed into legislative debates. However, there are also broader issues in this report which will not be dealt with in the current Commission banking package. I am especially thinking of the fiscal backstop. It needs to be done, and actually there is agreement to establish it. The current solution, credit lines between national governments and the ESM, is not sufficient to overcome the banks’ sovereign vicious circle and do away with the bailouts. Ultimate liability for the financing of the backstop should rest with the banking sector, and not with taxpayers. The backstop should be fiscally neutral over the medium term. There is another set of issues which will not be part of the current negotiations on the banking package because global guidance is needed there. I am thinking here of internal models to calculate capital requirements and the prudential treatment of sovereign debt. In the case of internal models, work is being done at the level of the Basel Committee and also in the EU, at the level of the EBA and of the ECB, as regards the harmonisation of the financial of testing of models.  We need to balance the creation of a level playing field between small and large banks and the transparency and comparability of capital requirements, with the need for risk sensitivity and the possibility to use specific information from banks that can bring useful refinement to the model. In the case of the prudential treatment of sovereign debt, we would like to better reflect the risks involved, and we also hope, with the differentiated capital treatment, to incentivise diversification of exposures across sovereigns. This has to be balanced with the need to keep some kind of safe asset to retain a benchmark for price formation on our financial markets, and not to procyclically penalise financially fragile  governments.  To conclude, let us not forget that with the UK out of the Union, all Member States except Denmark are committed to joining the euro in the future, so we should encourage those countries to see the benefits of joining the Banking Union and of benefiting through Banking Union membership from participation in the decision-sharing mechanism between home and host countries that we have established for the resolution of banks.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 471, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Valdis Dombrovskis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, first of all I would like to thank Ms Hübner for her annual report on the Banking Union. It provides an excellent overview of how much has been achieved since the financial crisis and clearly identifies much of what remains to be done. The Banking Union is central to the new regulatory and supervisory architecture we have put in place. Its main role is to maintain a strong banking system which can effectively finance the needs of the wider economy and encourage economic growth. Ms Hübner’s report is broad in scope, so let us focus on the main measures essential to strengthening the Banking Union.  First, we need to improve the existing institutional framework. That is why the Commission supports a call to reduce national options and discretions, to promote consistency in bank supervision across participating Member States. We will work to achieve this by amending existing banking regulations. The creation of the Single Supervisory and Resolution Mechanisms has improved the coherence of the approach taken by supervisory authorities across the EU. It should now be possible to support a better use of bank capital and liquidity resources across the Banking Union. We are aware that some Member States will have concerns about hosting banks from other EU countries, so our banking proposals aim to extend the use of liquidity and capital waivers with strong safeguards.  Secondly, to reduce risks in the banking sector, our EU banking reform package aims to strengthen the prudential framework and to increase banks’ ability to absorb losses in times of crisis without the help of taxpayers’ money. As set out in your report, the EU regulatory framework must be proportionate and respect diversity in the European banking sector. This is particularly true for smaller banks, for which we want light reporting and disclosure requirements.  EU banks are significantly stronger than they were before the crisis. This is in large part due to their own efforts to adjust their business models, but also thanks to the regulatory reform we introduced, and better supervision. But non-performing loan ratios remain high in some Member States. The Commission is working with those Member States to encourage the gradual reduction of non-performing loans. Banks’ exposure to sovereigns is another area where the Commission is engaged to find a workable solution. We share Parliament’s views that the problem carries many implications. As was agreed in the June 2016 Council conclusions, it is important to await the outcome of the Basel Committee talks before taking a decision at European level. The Commission welcomes the report’s call to complete the Banking Union with a common deposit insurance scheme. We are committed to working with the Parliament and Council to take this forward. Further progress is also needed to build up a sufficiently large and readily available common backstop as a significant strengthening of the Single Resolution Mechanism’s credibility.  Looking beyond the financial risks facing the banking sector, the Commission agrees with Parliament about the need for our financial institutions to have in place strong and well-functioning IT systems. We are committed to working on measures to boost cyber security in the financial sector, and in particular we support facilitating the exchange of sensitive information between banks to prevent cyber attacks while, of course, protecting the use of personal data.  These are just some of the areas that struck me in your report. We share the view that we have strong foundations on which to build, but progress is still needed in a number of important areas. Overall, we can be optimistic about the opportunity to refine our work so as to continue meeting our financial objectives while supporting growth and investment in Europe.

The banking union has led to a major shift from national competencies to the European level. With the European banking supervision and the European resolution mechanism, new, unprecedented structures were created. It is now up to the EU institutions to fill these structures with credibility and content and, above all, to keep them under review. It is also up to the EU institutions to ensure the right balance between necessary European supervision and necessary national supervision, because both are justified and belong together. With the 2016 Annual Report on the Banking Union, the rapporteur has presented a very good report. The report makes it clear that risk reduction in the banking sector needs to continue, both by lawmakers and regulators. The persistently high level of loans at risk of default in some member states still needs to be addressed. The banking union is often referred to as the way to sever the link between banks and public finance. However, the structures of the banking union alone are not sufficient for this; there must be a rethinking of the overall risk assessment. We have to equip the European resolution authority with the right force to intervene in a timely manner to protect taxpayers and savers. We have to ensure that financial institutions have comprehensive, high-quality capital and debt buffers ready for possible settlement situations. The international requirements are an important benchmark for the global competitiveness of our banking sector. At the same time, the EU needs to ensure that its rightly chosen risk-based approach for the Banking Union is applied and implemented.

The absence of European financial supervision was one of the reasons that brought us to the financial crisis. National financial supervision is less effective as banks globalised their activities. The ECB has been reliable and has won strong credibility. The contrast with some national central banks is huge.  Yesterday, for instance, the former President of Banco de España, Miguel Ángel Fernández Ordóñez, as well as his supervisory team, were indicted by the Spanish justice on charges of allowing irregularities in Bankia’s initial public offering in July 2011. Bankia’s IPO was done, even though Banco de España knew that it was close to bankruptcy. It was just done because of the close relations between the Banco de España and Bankia’s Director, Rodrigo Rato. Thousands of people lost their savings and Bankia was bailed out for EUR 23 billion, paid thanks to a European bail—out. This is why the banking union is so important: to say goodbye for ever to the bad practices of many national supervisors in many national central banks in Europe. I would like to call attention to the amendment to be tabled with the Greens and ECR: the use of public money to bail out banks has to be only in exceptional cases. If the rules of the banking union are not followed, as may happen now in Italy, our future will be full of more public deficits and a new banking crisis will put the euro at risk. Only if all Member States comply with banking union legislation will it be possible to create a European deposit guarantee to complete our project and give extra assurance to citizens and investors.

Only Cyprus, in 2013, served as a test laboratory for the Troika to test bail-in, the iniquitous technique of bail-in banks by its own clients, supposedly to protect taxpayers. Since then, the European Union has moved with force and urgency to preempt the banking sovereignty of euro area member states and citizens, and to hand over supervision to the ECB. The Banking Union has been in effect since January 1, 2016 and legally authorizes the European institutions to withdraw customer bank accounts in the event of a banking crisis. This MRU, the single resolution mechanism by the European Union, constitutes an intolerable financial crackdown on citizens. This method is a democratic scandal, a questioning of the right to property and a legalized theft, denounced by the patriots of the National Front, which confirms our political analysis on the consequences of the 2008 crisis and the harmfulness of the euro. I accuse the European Union and the ECB of having put in place in 2016 a regime of financial totalitarianism to save the banks and the euro at all costs. Why? Because in reality the European banking system is in a state of emergency. This is precisely the first finding of this Hübner report. The ECB and the IMF are also worried about the 1 trillion euros of bad loans that are eating away at banks' balance sheets. And they are right, as evidenced by the plight of Deutsche Bank in Germany and the Italian banking crisis. All of this proves that the reassuring stress tests of 2014 were, in fact, completely bogus. Like the National Front, the European Banking Authority (EBA) banking supervision is launching a new alert on the solvency of European banks. For EBA, the toxic assets of failing banks are a not much like dust: it is hidden in bad banks, which will also end up going bankrupt and which will ultimately be bailed out again by European taxpayers.This solution that you reject, that of bank separation and split, is that of independence from private banks, and it requires political courage.However, if there is one characteristic peculiar to the European Union, it is its unwavering loyalty to private lobbies and its disinterest in people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 481, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Gabriel Mato (PPE).", "mepid": "96936", "text": "- Mr President, I would first like to congratulate my colleague Danuta Hübner on his report, and say that the banking union is an indispensable component of the monetary union and a fundamental pillar of a true economic and monetary union.

The Banking Union plays a vital role in financing investment and therefore in promoting growth and job creation in the Union.

Regarding Danuta Hübner's report, I want to mention three things that I think are important. First, on the issue of non-performing loans, it seems to me that the proposal that the EBA president has just made to create a \"bad bank\" needs to be carefully considered. Then, let's look at what is happening on the side of the United States to prevent the re-establishment of a shadow banking system in which our European banks would dump their risks.

A strong response is needed to the persistent instability of the banking environment in Europe. We agree with the invitation of the International Monetary Fund to introduce profound changes, both in the economic models of banks and in the structure of the system, to guarantee a healthy banking system at European level. The crisis revealed shortcomings in the global architecture of the single currency.

So, Mr Dombrovskis, we need a kind of European Glass-Steagall Act. Secondly, there is a need for a European deposit guarantee scheme. Member States have allocated trillions of euros to rescue the banks. In other words, we had socialization of bank losses, and all this was paid by the taxpayers. Thus, in order to save the banks, the public debt was increased. The first memorandum in Greece saved German and French banks holding Greek government bonds worth EUR 150 billion, and after the banks were saved, both in Greece and throughout Europe, they are now attacking the borrowers, who have been impoverished by austerity and unemployment and can no longer pay their loans. We need, therefore, a public fund for red loans in both Greece and Europe so that the \"crows\" do not grab the property of the borrowers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 487, "date": "2017-02-14.json", "name": "Valdis Dombrovskis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, I am grateful to Ms Hübner for her excellent report and to those who took the floor to make interventions. Everything you said points to the importance of having a robust and stable financial system, while at the same time ensuring that banks are able to play their role in lending to the wider economy to support growth and jobs. To address some points raised by Ms Berès on the Capital Markets Union and the Banking Union, it must be very clearly stated that we see the Capital Markets Union as a complement to the Banking Union and not as a replacement. We obviously do not expect capital markets to replace banks in their role of financing the real economy. Indeed, those are complementary projects and need to be seen as such.  I also touched upon completion of the Banking Union, including through the European Deposit Scheme and a common backstop for a single resolution fund. As always, we emphasise that risk sharing and risk reduction must go hand in hand, so we also need to drive forward our risk reduction agenda through our bank reform package and other initiatives which we presented in November of last year, but not limited to that. We count on your continued support in moving forward this important regulatory agenda.
