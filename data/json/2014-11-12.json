On 9 November, 25 years ago, courageous men and women tore down the Berlin Wall – a wall fortified by barbed wire, guarded by soldiers, a wall that arbitrarily divided families, an entire country, an entire continent. This arbitrary division of Germany and Europe was ended by a peaceful revolution on 9 November 1989. No tank rolled, no shot fell, no drop of blood flowed. That night, on 9 November 1989, a European freedom movement culminated in Berlin. Wherever this year of miracles – as the historian Timothy Garton Ash called it – in Europe in 1989, the spark of freedom was ignited. And it was not superpowers, nor were they leaders of states who wrote history, it was the peoples of Europe themselves who wrote their own history and changed the course of the world. Let us remember that workers had gathered at the Gdansk shipyards around Lech Wasa, and Solidarity' peaceful action was not guided by violence, but by John Paul II, who shouted to her: \"Fight evil with good!\" In Prague, the Velvet Revolution took its course when hundreds of thousands of demonstrators in Wenceslas Square shouted, \"Havel on the castle!\" Hungary dismantled its border facilities with Austria – a rift in the Iron Curtain through which tens of thousands fled to freedom. From Vilnius to Riga to Tallinn, a human chain stretched, and the Baltic peoples gained independence with their Singing Revolution. In Leipzig, civil rights activists carried the resistance from the church to the streets with the cry \"We are the people!\", again and again \"We are the people!\". Whether in Berlin, Leipzig, Warsaw, Prague or Bratislava, Vilnius, Tallinn or Riga: the paths to freedom and democracy were different, but they always were: they were peaceful. What they had in common were the people who demonstrated their peaceandiness and courage. It is thanks to you, ladies and gentlemen, the freedom fighters in all these countries, that democracy and freedom prevailed over injustice and dictatorship. These people wanted to get rid of the Soviet yoke. But they were also concerned with something else, a different guiding principle of 1989: they were concerned with returning to Europe. These peaceful revolutions of 1989 were logically completed only with the reunifications – first German and then European reunification by the eastward enlargement of the EU ten years ago, the return of the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe to their rightful place in the family of nations of Europe. The fact that we, ladies and gentlemen, the representatives of these peoples of Europe can work together here – for example today – is due to the courage of the people who took to the streets for their convictions. My dear colleagues. the retrospective transfigures many things. But that banners and candles, flowers and singing, prayers and keychains triumphed over tanks and rifles, over walls and borders, was not guaranteed! How easily these demonstrations could have endd in bloodshed, as in 1953 in Berlin, 1956 in Budapest, 1968 in Prague, or a few months earlier in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. We must remember this today if we are to understand the courage that men and women have had on these streets. Therefore: Nothing describes the epoch after the fall of the Berlin Wall, after the end of the separation better than the first sentence of the Berlin Declaration of 2008, which should also be our leitmotif for the future: \"We are united for our happiness!\"", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "Herbert Reul", "mepid": "28225", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which she has all been rapporteur for her excellent report. The wall is gone. Twenty-five years ago, the Berlin Wall fell; for 25 years, the division in Germany, Europe and the world has been overcome. The wall fell because citizens in the GDR peacefully demonstrated for unity and justice and freedom, because they felt that the authorities were no longer strong enough to stop them. The wall fell because people, politicians in Germany, Europe and the world condemned the oppression in the GDR, the unnaturalness of the wall and believed in the unity and unification of Germany. The wall fell because systems that deprive people of freedom cannot survive. The wall fell because bankrupt systems cannot survive. The wall fell because people in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland created conditions for this change. But it was not a miracle, nor was it a natural event, but the result of a peaceful revolution unprecedented in history, which for months had been rushing from one climax to another at a breathtaking pace. What is certain is that without the numerous civil rights movements that developed into popular movements in the late summer of 1989 and expressed their desire for change in peaceful mass demonstrations, this 9 November would not have existed in Berlin. This fall of the Berlin Wall took place in Berlin, but it is, of course, an event of European significance. How many times have I stood at the Berlin Wall as a young guy! I was very unsure if I would ever see this wall fall. And what uncertainty or even fear did I have when I went to the GDR for visits and had to go through investigative procedures about me at Friedrichstraße station, for example! This repression, this surveillance, this feeling of being monitored, perhaps lasted a few hours for me. The people of the GDR lived under such a regime for decades. All this is over, and that is why we are celebrating these days. But these 25 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall have also brought a bit of normality: it has become normal, one does not remember. Some 23 million Germans cannot even remember the fall of the Berlin Wall, because they were born after 1985.  But these young people can also learn from the fall of the Berlin Wall, just like we politicians do. However, we must ensure that young people learn from it. Politics must pursue and sustain long-term goals and not give up, as parts of the world and German politics have done on the issue of reunification. Politics must also seize opportunities, but it cannot be done without courage. Helmut Kohl seized this opportunity and seized it. We Germans are infinitely grateful for reunification.  And we Europeans have since continued to write our common history. It would not have been conceivable 25 years ago that we would commemorate together in a democratic parliament with Members from 28 Member States.  The world will continue to change. We in the European Parliament can work on these changes. And the fall of the Berlin Wall reminds us that borders can be overcome, that seemingly given conditions can change, that we must never be too sure. This also means that we must defend and fight for achievements worthy of preservation. We must defend and develop this Europe, which we have created together. The fall of the Berlin Wall has become a symbol of overcoming authoritarian systems in Eastern and Central Europe. And this memory must also be kept alive. The South African Nobel Peace Prize laureate Desmond Tutu has formulated a wise sentence with which I would like to conclude: nothing, not even the most modern weapons, not even the most brutally powerful police, no, nothing at all will be able to stop people once they are determined to win their freedom and their human right.

As President Martin Schulz said very well in his effective speech, the fall of the Berlin Wall was an act of liberation: the victory of life against the sadness of oppression. Celebrating the anniversary today means, first and foremost, remembering the victims of that wall – the political dissidents and the many citizens whose lives were disrupted – but it also means remembering those reformers who, before others, understood the true nature of real socialism. I would like to remind you here of Alexander Dubček, whose silence last Friday celebrated the anniversary of his death. But today we also want to look to the future. The first lesson to remember is that against the resurgence of new walls and conflicts, the only antidote is Europe. Europe is a bridge that bypasses any wall. This European vocation for peace is now being called into question by the emergence of new walls, such as the new imaginary wall that divides Ukraine. We will never accept violations of fundamental principles of international law, such as that of territorial integrity, but nor do we accept that some cold war nostalgia should use the Ukrainian tragedy as a wedge between Europe and Russia. The new walls are not just in Europe. Federica Mogherini did well to make her first official visit to the Middle East. Europe, thanks to its new activism, can become a protagonist in the peace process in the region. It is only by tearing down the Gaza Wall, that is, by rebuilding acceptable living conditions in that region, that we will be able to bring peace and development. I understand the appeal of walls, including with regard to migrants, non-EU citizens. The walls evoke enclosed universes, such as the Maginot line that the French eed to protect themselves from the Germans. But then we know how the French fort ended: it fell suddenly and the historian Marc Bloch spoke of strange defeat, because the collapse had occurred first in tempers. Even today, the real European wall does not pass through borders and geographical maps. The real European front is in spirit. After the Berlin Wall, it was believed that the story was over and that it was no longer possible to imagine an alternative to unbridled capitalism. This paved the way for unbridled neoliberalism and inequalities increased. New, often parasitic, pension-based oligarchy has emerged and all too often Europe has been incapable of challenging single thinking and proposing an ambitious agenda of market reforms. Today, Europe must continue along the path of regulating finance if it is not to fall victim to the financial lobby of this great power which threatens the democratic resilience of this great construction which is Europe. It is now up to Europe to show that history is not over, but that the aspiration for equality, freedom and solidarity remains the polar star of our community.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "Hans-Olaf Henkel", "mepid": "124823", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to take back from the ECR Group. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. After 25 years, my compatriots showed once again last weekend how happy they are about reunification and how proud they are that it was possible without bloodshed. But the Germans are also grateful. Of course, the East Germans showed us at that time how to demonstrate courageously, and West German politicians also reacted decisively. I am thinking here of Helmut Kohl, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Willy Brandt. But on this day I would also like to remind you of those who used to be courageous and more determined than we were. My personal first memory was the attempt by the construction workers in East Berlin on 17 June 1953 to shake off the communist yoke. In June 1956, the Poles rose up against the communist rulers in Poznan. In the autumn of 1956, the Hungarians rose up. The whole world held its breath at that time, leaving Hungary alone. I will never forget the names Of Imre Nagy and Pél Maléter. In 1968, the Warsaw Pact tanks from the Prague Spring made a Prague winter. Another name that I cannot forget and which has already been mentioned: Alexander Dubéek. In 1977, the Czech and Slovak blueprint for freedom was published: Charter 77. We remember with gratitude the names Pavel Kohout and Vaclav Havel. Then, in 1978, a Pole was to change everything: Karol Wojtya, the Polish cardinal who had long opposed the communist system, became Pope John Paul II. He probably contributed more to the collapse of the Berlin Wall than any German. In 1981, again in Poland, Solidarity, the model for workers' movements striving for freedom, emerged, with Lech Wasa at the helm. In 1984, another name that kept the world in suspense for weeks and gave me sleepless nights at the time: the Polish priest Jerzy Popie-uszko, a martyr of the Catholic Church and Solidarity alike. In 1989, the Czechs opened the gate to the West to many East German refugees and the Hungarians opened the fence. The name - we all know him: Gyula Horn. In all these years, however, there have also been frequent fighters for freedom of expression and the press and martyrs in the USSR itself, to whom we Germans also owe a great deal, for example Andrei Sakharov, after whom the European Parliament has named his human rights prize, or Sergei Kovalev, one of the co-founders of Memorial. Today, russia is not only a memorial, but today Russia is once again at risk of freedom of expression, freedom of the press and human rights. The Germans also know that none of this would have been possible without the steadfastness of a Ronald Reagan who shouted in front of the Brandenburg Gate in 1985: \"Mister Gorbatchev, open this gate!\" And you know that it would not have been possible without a Gorbachev who did just that. Or think of the Western Allies soldiers who protected us in Berlin. Here we have a group colleague, Geoffrey Van Orden, who was indeed also a British officer in 1989. Yes, the Germans are happy about the collapse of the wall, because they have been reunited. Yes, the Germans are proud that all this was possible peacefully and without bloodshed. But the Germans are also grateful to those who made this possible in the first place.

Mr President, at the time of the worst fraternal war in Europe to date, at the time of the Peloponnesian war, Pericles expressed the following wisdom, which still holds true to this day: the secret of happiness is freedom, but the secret of freedom is courage. And who better than all the people who have been reminded of here who have taken to the streets in Eastern Europe: 1953 in Berlin, 1956 in Budapest, 1968 in Prague.  We in the West were fortunate enough to grow up in a freedom fought by courageous men and women against fascism and National Socialism. Our friends in Eastern Europe have stood up against the second great inhuman ideology that came from Europe, communism. And I am grateful that Hans-Olaf Henkel also reminded us of those who fought against communism in the Soviet Union; I am thinking not only of Andrei Sakharov, but also of Lev Kopelev, Jelena Bonner and everyone else. Their actions were punished with camp detention, exile and exile. This courage that these people have shown is due to the courage to which we today owe our happiness to live together in freedom here. Therefore: the fall of the Berlin Wall was the result of an East German civil movement, but it was part of a European freedom movement. And how much courage it took to rebel against communism was seen on June 4 of the same year, as in Tiananmen Square – what a name! – a massacre was carried out, which the then communist leadership in East Berlin even officially welcomed! The actions of the Chinese authorities against the peaceful student uprising in Beijing were officially welcomed in East Berlin! You can imagine what it meant for people in Leipzig, Rostock, Dresden, Berlin to hear such words. The fall of the Wall, the open Brandenburg Gate – the event and the building – are therefore symbols that belong not only to the Germans; they are symbols of freedom, they remind us to defend this freedom again and again, and they are symbols of hope for people who still have to live in oppression to this day. Yes, things can turn for the better, yes, happiness and freedom can take the place of violence and wall. We want to send this symbol of hope into the world from here. It is possible – where oppression still prevails today. The message of the fall of the Wall, the message of the open Brandenburg Gate, is: Yes, there is reason for hope.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Ladies and gentlemen! It is also important to say, on the occasion of 9 November 1989, our commemoration of that day, what ultimately led to a divided Europe, a divided Germany. There was a war that originated from Hitler's Germany, from fascist Germany, and which cost millions of lives. So it should not be pretended that the existence of two German states, the division of Europe, simply happened by chance. I think we should also think about it. I was born and raised in the GDR. For me, the time of the GDR was a time full of contradictions. It has been an important time for me, and I am still concerned today with why the GDR, why state socialism has failed. All the contradictions are important to me. I don't paint a black-and-white picture, no matter how much others like to do it. For me, the courage of those who did not want to let their dream of a free, solidarity-based, just society be taken away is the example. The peaceful yet powerful protests of Leipzig, but also of 4 November 1989 in Berlin on Alexanderplatz: for me, that was the way to see why the Berlin Wall fell. Without these protests, 9 November would not have existed in this form. But it is also the case on 17 January 1988, when people on the sidelines of the Rosa Luxemburg/Karl Liebknecht demonstration in Berlin rolled up a banner that read: \"Freedom is always freedom of dissidents\" than the GDR regime, not accepting that there are other views and that this is part of a life and a free society, arresting these demonstrators. This has been a signal to many citizens, including myself, that the future of the GDR is in disarray and that things cannot go on like this. (Call) I do not want to talk to you about who understood what in his life and when. But there is also not enough time to record the hopes and illusions with which many citizens of the GDR associated the fall of the Berlin Wall and the opening of the border between the GDR and the FrG – a border on which both camps, NATO and the Warsaw Pact, were heavily armed, a border that had a dual function on the GDR side, because it was directed inward and prevented people from leaving their own country. But there is enough time to make the following clear: 9 November is no longer just a German day of fate. At the latest with Kristallnacht, the Reichspogromnacht 1938, and the fall of the Wall in 1989, 9 November has reached a significance far beyond Europe.  For me, 9 November remains a day of remembrance and joy – of remembrance of the darkest chapter of German and European history, but also of the joy that the fall of the Berlin Wall has revealed an incomparable contradiction: one cannot build a better society in which the freedom of all, the collective, is directed against the freedom of the individual. The reverse is true. We cannot build a better society in which social freedoms, fundamental social rights without democracy and personal freedoms are fought for. However, 9 November was soon followed by a call: freedom instead of socialism. This is just as wrong as the idea that socialism would be possible without freedom.  The turning and fall of the wall were made possible primarily by the people who no longer wanted to accept that change was not possible. The Cold War was not ended by politicians. If it had been for the rulers of NATO and the Warsaw Treaty, they would still be hostile to each other in the struggle for power and influence. The current conflicts between NATO and Russia show how quickly old images are brought up again and old confrontations are revived. Political and economic structures are man-made. People can change them. Just as the rulers in the GDR and in other countries of state socialism deceived themselves when they thought that socialism in its course did not stop the ox or the donkey, so even today many who hold political, economic power in their hands and think that there is no alternative to their policies, who think, for example, that the power of the financial markets is all-encompassing, they think that the debts of the banks can always be burdened. In conclusion, the cry of 'tear down the walls', should also apply today. It should be our responsibility, it should be a European responsibility to have the walls around the European Union broken down so that all with equal rights can also live here.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "Rebecca Harms", "mepid": "28233", "text": "  Mr President, For better, I would like to make a name for my free Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which As a German MEP and as a child of the periphery of the zone, it has never been difficult for me in the last 25 years to rejoice on this day in November about what happened in Germany 25 years ago, because it immediately gave me the result in my immediate surroundings that my freedom has increased. My first trips to the East of Germany as a West German, my later trips to Poland and Central Europe – I don't want to try to explain what happiness and what great satisfaction this means for me to this day.  Germany has changed a lot since 1989 – absolutely for its good. I am glad that many people from all over the world, especially many young Europeans, have made Berlin one of the cities of their heart, and that too was palpable when you looked at what has happened in Berlin these days. \"Thankfulness\" has fallen as a vocabulary, and I can only underline that. For Germany must be grateful for the fact that, especially in the European Union and in the tension with the East, we were then made possible to be this united Germany again.   Since then, we have not only changed, our reputation has not only improved, we have also become insanely strong than Germans, as Germany. The fact that Germany is again a hegemonic power is not good for everyone today. I am often in southern Europe to understand the tensions, including the new tensions. Germany must continue to be grateful for its new hegemonic strength and use it for the benefit of the whole European Union. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen from Germany, we should also reflect on this on such a day. And a second thing is also important: in 2014, which is also 100 years after the beginning of the First World War, and it is a bad thing that the war has returned to Europe this year, and the Euromaidan movement is the continuation of what the fall of the Wall still stands for as a symbol.  Ladies and gentlemen, Germany, together with the European Union, must ensure that this bloodshed in eastern Ukraine ceases. We must not allow Russia today to try to challenge the results of 1990 and 1991. Personally, I was also lucky enough to meet Mr Gorbachev, and I greatly appreciate him.

Mr President, given the circumstances, given the questions, given the doubts that may have crossed some minds, I find it normal, without having been summoned by your Parliament, to appear before you this afternoon at the first possible parliamentary occasion. I was Prime Minister of Luxembourg, you knew that, and I am President of the Commission, you know that. I am not speaking as a former Prime Minister of the Grand Duchy, but as President of the Commission, which has been a long time in his life as Prime Minister of Luxembourg. There would be a lot to say, but I would like to focus on the substance of the problem.  The problem we are discussing is early tax rulings, which in \"English\" are called tax rulings. The Commission has repeatedly confirmed that advance tax rulings are in line with EU law, provided that the same rules apply in the same circumstances to all businesses without discrimination. This is what Luxembourg's tax law says and that is what the administrative practices of that country apply to. The tax law has always been respected and no illegal practice is known to me. But there has probably been, at least I get the impression, an excess of tax engineering in Luxembourg, as in other countries. You should know that early tax decisions exist, and you know, in 22 european Union countries. There is therefore no Luxembourg specificity. We are facing an almost ecumenical phenomenon in Europe and, moreover, also beyond the limits of the European Union. How is it possible that such overinterpretation could take place? This is possible because there is an interaction between different or different national laws as to their nature and normative scope. The fact that there are divergent normative tax rules, the fact that they are applied in several European Union countries, is nothing more than the result of the logic of non-harmonisation or insufficient tax harmonisation in Europe. Yes, we are dealing with the consequences of non-harmonisation or insufficient tax harmonisation in Europe. We - the Commission, the Council - have reacted to this lack of pre-standards that can be reconciled with each other. I myself , there are many witnesses in this room , have worked, whenever Luxembourg or I chair the Council of Ministers, to advance tax harmonisation. I have often told you - and you will laugh today as you laughed at the time - that every time a progress on tax harmonisation has been made in Europe, it is under the Luxembourg presidency. I would remind you that in 1991 we harmonized VAT rates and excise rates. In the face of the disparity in national tax standards, we have adopted a code of conduct against unfair tax competition, which has been implemented and which, in many countries, has led to significant legislative changes, and so on. We discussed this issue within the College this morning. There is an urgent need for action, since many of our citizens do not understand the difference between cleaning up our public finances and imposing businesses and corporations in a fair way, since the impression that emerges from this debate is that fiscal injustice is insufficiently combated in Europe. I made a commitment to you to act on that. I said that during the election campaign and during our debates, when not everyone was the same focus on demanding further tax harmonisation. Tax harmonisation does not mean the end of tax competition: it aims to establish fairer rules between the different Member States of the European Union. We discussed this this morning in the College, and I proposed to my colleagues what I said to you when you did me the honour of electing me President of the Commission, namely that the Commission's ambition is to do everything possible to ensure that Europe, in tax matters, has the same tax base, since in many cases in many cases , advance tax decisions are possible because our plates (gemeinsame Bemessungsgrundlagen) are not in place. We'll do it. The Council is also dealing with a proposal for a directive to this effect and we will do everything we can to encourage it to adopt this directive and get it to adopt it as soon as possible. In the meantime, Commissioner Moscovici will use all the instruments that are available to him today to achieve the same goal. We recently adopted the first part of the mother-subsidiary directive, which puts an end to another source of prolonged disparities and which consists of abolishing the architectural possibility that the different legal characterization of so-called hybrid loans made available to tax administrations. This directive will come into force on 1 January 2015 and will eliminate whole sections of the constructibility of early tax rulings. To date, all Member States of the European Union have abolished bank secrecy. This was not the case several years ago. I proposed to the Commission this morning, and the College unanimously accepted it, that from now on we should ensure, after a review of the existing arrangements and an initiative taken by Commissioner Moscovici, to carry out an automatic exchange of information on early decisions. Commissioner Moscovici and I will propose, from tomorrow, in Australia, to extend the principle of automatic exchange of information on early decisions to the whole of the G20. One of the priorities I mentioned before you was the ambition that was, and remains, ours to fight fraud and tax evasion effectively. There are a number of investigations that have been launched by the Commission into different Member States, including the country I know best. I do not see and understand the comments on this, and I do not understand why there is an attempt to uncover at all costs a conflict of interest for the President of the Commission when it comes to examining these investigations within the Commission. The Commissioner in charge of competition has a wide range of autonomy and I do not intend to interfere in her decision-making process. If I did so, even if I did not have the slightest intention, I would lose all authority in the Commission. If a Commissioner intervened in a state matter in a violent, unreasonable, thoughtless manner in such a decision-making process, the Commission on this point would no longer be able to function. The Commissioner of Competition is free of her actions and movements. I do not understand why I read, and even sometimes I hear, that this is a Juncker v Juncker case. Has there ever been any talk of a Timmermans case against Timmermans because the Netherlands is under investigation? Will tomorrow, when France is the subject of a Commission investigation, will we talk about a Moscovici case against Moscovici? You will discover Commissioner Moscovici in all the fullness of his talents shortly. I repeat that the Commission will do its job. There is an investigation against the country I know best, launched with my agreement by the previous Commission. President Barroso had asked me, as had Joaquin Almunia, if I would rather wait for the arrival of the new Commission. I said, \"Do what you have to do.\" And that's what they did. On all these points, we want to act. We will act resolutely and with ambition. I have a duty of abstention with regard to investigations against the country I know best, but I also have a duty to act, which is to advance taxation and tax harmonisation in Europe. Don't doubt it, I will. But to do that, I need your trust. Without your trust, nothing is possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 30, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "Manfred Weber", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and for the way in which she has been rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has We are certainly discussing an important issue here today that is moving the citizens. Citizens pay taxes, our small and medium-sized enterprises pay taxes and read in the newspapers that large corporations are sometimes squeezing around their tax obligations. It is a big question of justice, and that is why it is important to discuss this here today. But, ladies and gentlemen, when I consider the powder vapour of the last few days, I would like to ask myself the question: have we all been surprised by a new subject? Ladies and gentlemen, even before the European parliament elections, we took a decision in principle on how we deal with tax justice in Europe. The Commission took decisions on this in 2012. So today we are not discussing a new issue that has suddenly appeared. Some clarifications are needed. Firstly, is it a Luxembourg case? Of course, it is also a Luxembourg case, and that must be examined. But God knows it is not a Luxembourg-only case. We have a long tradition in Belgium of the rich settling better in Belgium because there are better tax rates there. The Netherlands is known for being particularly attractive to foundations. I come from the Austrian border region of Germany and I also know how many of our top earners are leaving for Austria. It is nothing, ladies and gentlemen, as far as Luxembourg is concerned.  The second observation I would like to make is: is there a breach of the law? Ladies and gentlemen, after the Treaty of Lisbon – and it is precisely the side that is strongly standing up for the nation states here in Parliament who will fight for it – tax law remains national. It must therefore be said that this is not a breach of the law, it is an interpretation of the respective national facts, competition and, in some cases, unhealthy competition from tax systems. That is behind it! This is not a breach of the law in the European Union! The third thing that needs to be clarified is the question of procedure. I am grateful to Jean-Claude Juncker for making it clear today that he will withdraw from the procedure. He released it and said: of course the Commission must investigate. But he will withdraw. And Mrs Vestager confirmed yesterday in the ECON Committee that there was not even a conversation between her and Jean-Claude Juncker. It will investigate independently, and this will also be done with the blessing of Jean-Claude Juncker. These clarifications are necessary. Ladies and gentlemen, we now come to the political part of the debate, to the question of trying to shake the integrity and also the credibility of Jean-Claude Juncker. Ladies and gentlemen, four days before we voted on Jean-Claude Juncker in the European Parliament, the Financial Times published a very large article on this very issue. So it's nothing new. And although this article was in the newspapers, I voted with complete conviction for Jean-Claude Juncker, because I trust him that he will solve the problems that are on the table. On the whole group, I would like to say that we trust Jean Claude Juncker to tackle and resolve the issues that are on the table for the citizens of Europe. The fifth thing I want to make clear is that do you know what annoys me the most in the whole discussion? That we are once again giving the citizens the impression that the European level has failed on this issue. We are once again playing the ball between Parliament and the Commission. Who didn't get the theme baked? The fact is, ladies and gentlemen, that it is the Member States that are failing. The Council is not present for this discussion. The Member States are failing. How long did it take for the Finance Ministers to finally be able to at least get a grip on tax evasion by private individuals, and we now get automated data exchange? It took decades! Billions of taxpayers' money was evaded because the Member States were unable to deliver. I hope that this time we will be able to get to the bottom of it more quickly, that we will make progress and put an end to tax evaders and stop the initiative accordingly. These are mistakes by the Member States and not by the European level! We would have been active and we were active. Mr President, I would like to end by saying that the future is important. How do we solve the issue? And here Jean-Claude Juncker addressed the right points: we need Transparency in the rulings, as has been indicated. We need initiative to unify the tax base, and we need global initiatives at the G20. Jean-Claude Juncker has our support in this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 31, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "Gianni Pittella", "mepid": "4436", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Juncker, thank you first of all for being here in Parliament. Your presence is an act of sensitivity and responsibility, and we Democratic Socialists sincerely appreciate it. I would like to say straight away that the first feeling you get when you read about the cunning of multinationals to pay less tax is still one of indignation, even when one knows it. Indignation at those companies that make billions in profits and do not pay taxes in the countries where those profits are made. Indignation at those Member States that enter into confidential negotiations with multinationals and are complicit in the attempt. Look at the fact that, as Mr Juncker has said, this is not just a matter for a few Member States. It is a European and global phenomenon. And is it shameful that, while some states – remember Greece? – horse care was imposed in the name of austerity, somewhere else, also in Europe, multinational companies were evading billions of euros from the public purse by not paying taxes. And the worst thing, the most shameful thing, which Mr Juncker himself recalled with great honesty, is that those multinationals, in most cases, avoided taxes without breaking any European laws or regulations. We must no longer allow this! If there is one thing that should unite this House, it is the tenacious and strong will to no longer allow a phenomenon to happen by changing legislation, because we need to change the legislation so that this phenomenon is eradicated. Many of the companies accused of tax avoidance are the same companies that then queue to obtain funding and support from the Member States. The philosophy is to draw on the state when it suits, but to privatise profits. This is the logic of rapacious capitalism, which has little to do with the thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises that are measured on the market every day, without cunning, and which constitute the real marrow, the backbone and the salvation of the European economy. But denunciation is not enough, let us move on to the proposals. Mr Juncker, when the European Commission took office, even when he won our confidence, made commitments, which he reiterated this afternoon. We, as the Group of the Party of European Socialists and Democrats, are calling for a precise timetable for implementing these commitments, and we also add some of our proposals. Fiscal harmonization is all well and good, but we need a stronger boost to the political, social and economic integration of Europe. We also propose to the Commission three measures which come from the report by one of our former colleagues, Mojca Kleva Kekuš, which was adopted by a large majority in this Parliament. First proposal: the Commission could and should adopt a clear definition of a tax haven, which is extensive and also takes account of dubious practices such as tax rulings. The second proposal is that those who are smart must pay. The competent authorities must suspend or revoke the banking licences of financial institutions that help organise fraud. At the same time, companies that lend themselves to these practices must be excluded from European funds, because it is not acceptable to try to escape tax and then beat cash. Thirdly, we want financial information to be reported country by country in the budgets of multinationals. It is right that people should know where multinationals make the profits because it is in that country that they have to pay taxes. I repeat: taxes are paid in the country where they make the profits. On these commitments we will heel the Juncker Commission, we will support it in this way. The Member States are essential, but the Commission makes its proposals. Parliament will help the Commission to defeat those Member States and to show the European public that the responsibility for the fact that the reform process is not moving forward lies with the Member States, not with Parliament, not with the European Commission. Let us go on like this. We do not accept weakening the newly elected European Commission and President Juncker. That would be a gift to Euroscepticism, to Europhobia. It would be a gift to inaction, because our citizens are waiting for answers and we can have the answers with a strong and authoritative Commission and with a President legitimised by the strong will to resolve and reform this sector.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 32, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "Der Präsident. -", "mepid": "1911", "text": "   Ladies and gentlemen!

Firstly let me thank the President of the Commission Mr Juncker for attending today, but with all due respect it is Commissioner Vestager who should be here today discussing these matters. She is leading the Commission investigation into tax schemes in Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Ireland and several other EU countries. As a quasi-judicial investigation, I believe we should await its outcome before rushing to judgments or holding a witch-hunt. The ECR was pleased to hear Commissioner Vestager yesterday tell the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) that she would include the leaked information in her investigation and that she would widen the scope of the investigation if it proved necessary. Although as there has been some confusion today on whether there will actually now be an investigation, a reassurance from the Commission is necessary that this is going to be the case.  The ECR Group has long argued for further action at national, EU and global level to tackle tax evasion, tax fraud and, indeed, aggressive tax avoidance. People are frankly not willing to accept companies that go out of their way to avoid paying what they legitimately owe. Global country-by-country reporting by companies of their sales and profit is long overdue. Although it is a global problem, the EU can play a meaningful role in this field. At Commissioner Vestagerʼs hearing I specifically asked her what she was going to do to close the ʽdouble Irishʼ tax loophole as it may constitute state aid. She confirmed last month, before all these allegations, that it was firmly on her agenda within the framework of EU competition law. However, let us not forget that tax is a Member State issue. For the EU to play a role does not require more EU legislation or centralisation of powers, nor does it need tax harmonisation. Tax competition is of utmost importance in the EU and it encourages us to remain competitive globally. The solution lies in proper enforcement of existing national and EU systems and through greater transparency and greater international cooperation in tax matters through the G8 and G20 level.  I am proud to say that it was my Prime Minister during the UKʼs Presidency of the G8 last year who led these discussions on reporting and tax transparency, and it will be discussed again in Brisbane next week. If Commissioner Vestagerʼs investigation raises questions that need to be answered, then they must be answered here in this Chamber. They cannot be avoided.  Clearly this investigation needs to have the trust of the public. They need to know that whatever the Commission concludes is the result of an independent, thorough and public proper inquiry. We should base our actions and debates not on leaks and not on part of the picture, but on a full, independent assessment by our own competition authority that reveals all the facts.  The ECR calls on Commissioner Vestager to deliver her investigation as quickly as is feasible but also asks for reassurance today on the independence, the scope and the procedure for keeping this Parliament informed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 34, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "Guy Verhofstadt", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, may I say something as a point of order outside my speaking time? No? OK. I am wondering where Mr Farage is today in this debate. He was a specialist in offshore tax schemes in the Isle of Man – he is a specialist and he is not here today! Where is he?  (Applause) We have a specialist there. Mr Juncker can be the specialist at the government level but Mr Farage is a specialist at the private level, so we have somebody who really knows how things work. It is not possible to have him but … (The President reminded the speaker that this was included in his speaking time) Yes, Mr President, you can count my 40 seconds and let us hope that he comes back.  I have three things to say to Mr Juncker and the first is that we now have an investigation by the Commission. Let us be honest about it. It has to be a serious investigation and not just about three special cases in three countries. It has to be about practices in general. The investigation has to be about whether this is in accordance with EU legislation. The consequences of that are very clear. If this is in accordance with EU legislation, there is no problem. Admittedly, if there is no problem then there is a problem with EU legislation, and we have to work on the basis of proposals by the Commission, but if it is in accordance with EU legislation, then OK. Alternatively, if it is not in accordance with EU legislation then, Mr Juncker, you know you have a problem and we have to discuss that together and accept the consequences.  That is my first point. Let us have this investigation but my request is for an investigation before the end of the year. It is impossible for the European Union to continue with a shadow hanging over the Commission for six months now. We already have one lame duck in Washington, it is not necessary to make a lame duck here in Europe right now, so my request is that Ms Vestager be asked to conclude this investigation before the end of the year. My second point is that we need to have a special committee in this Parliament too. Yesterday the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) discussed this and I think there is common ground between all the groups that we should have a special committee. Because this is not only a question of the executive, of the Commission having to look into the matters of the Member States, it is also our task as a European Parliament to have a special committee and to look into these practices. My request to the two big groups, and the other groups, is to support this special committee at the Conference of Presidents. My third point relates to the content. I think it was fantastic how Ms Swinburne tried to explain that it is not necessary to have more Europe. If there is one topic now where we need more Europe, we have it here on the table, and it is a clear indication that what you are saying does not make any sense. How do you avoid these practices if not at European level – with a convergence code at the European level, with European tax compliance legislation at the European level? That is my point to you, Mr Juncker. You have spoken about two decisions taken by the College this morning and I am in favour of that exchange of information. In fact I want to ask you two things, one on European tax compliance legislation – because we need that if we want to enforce a number of practices – and the other about the convergence code.  I do not agree by saying, like Mr Pittella, that we have to harmonise everything. Harmonise everything at what level? Not at the Belgian level, I hope, (inaudible words off microphone), that is completely crazy, not at the French level as regards some taxation. I think we need a balance between, on the one side, enforceable measures and, on the other side, room for manoeuvre for the Member States based on the convergence code. My call to you is to come forward with these proposals. There is a shadow – and you must know that, Jean-Claude – hanging over the Commission. You know that better than anyone because you have enough experience to know that, and we have to remove it as fast as possible. That is the reason why I ask you to speed up the investigation on the one hand, and to come forward with additional proposals on the other.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 35, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "Jonathan Arnott (EFDD). -", "mepid": "124958", "text": "   Mr President, I have a point of order.

Mr President, Mr Juncker, I have not been surprised, but I must confess that I remain revolted every day to see how the richest taxpayers manage to evade tax, often legally, with the complicity of states in a Europe which is a rich continent. This fiscal injustice is for us a fundamental break from the social contract in Europe. Worse still, it is, I think, a breach of trust, the confidence of our fellow citizens in the capacity of their institutions and in the will of their elected representatives to defend the public interest. You know, self-employed people, unemployed workers, social beneficiaries are often blamed. But it is often - and LuxLeaks reminds us - at the top of the income and wealth ladder that the worst profiteers of the system are, not at the bottom. You are, of course, not alone, Mr Juncker. I remember that it is the very liberal Mark Rutte and his counterpart, the not very socialist Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who are at the helm of a tax haven - I am obviously talking about the Netherlands - which is no less raucous than the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, which you had the honour of leading. I am not talking about all these tax arrangements that many European states, including my own, have hidden in their tax code, all of which are tax arrangements that make their state a tax haven. Mr Juncker, as you said, the central issue is harmonisation. It is time for the European states to stop fighting a tax war whose only beneficiaries are big business and big heritage, and the victims, the health of our public finances and through them, the health and well-being of all our fellow citizens. It is this tax war that must be ended by tax harmonisation. You said that you were not going to interfere in the ongoing investigation. I ask you to intervene. I ask you to give Mrs Vestager all the means she needs to expand and deepen this investigation in order to put a definitive end to these tax quibbles of which we are all victims.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 40, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "Paul Nuttall", "mepid": "96805", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, it seems from Mr Juncker’s opening remarks that he is blaming everybody else and not himself and in a desperate effort to throw everybody off the scent he is calling for more EU tax harmonisation. Rubbish, I say. Let us get to the rub of it. The definition of hypocrisy in the Oxford English Dictionary is the practice of claiming to have higher standards or more noble beliefs than is the case, and I do not think anyone in this Chamber could disagree with me today when I say that this perfectly sums up the position of the President of the European Commission here today. When Mr Juncker was campaigning for the post, he stood on a platform of stamping out aggressive tax avoidance by multinational corporations across the European Union, yet it is now clear from recent revelations that he had not practised what he was preaching. Under his tenure, Luxembourg was a magical fairyland for multinational corporations where tax rates of as little as 1% were paid on profits. Mr Juncker, you said that this was within the rules, but equally I say it is morally bankrupt. When asked by one of my UKIP colleagues back in July how you could justify advocating tax standardisation across the European Union whilst overseeing a tax haven in Luxembourg, you simply dodged the question and now we know why. Could this possibly be a case of history repeating itself, because Mr Juncker’s predecessor as Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr Jacques Santer, was forced to resign as President of the Commission under a cloud of corruption back in 1999? I suppose that, if you think about it in those terms, Mr Juncker’s appointment can be summed up by Albert Einstein’s theory of insanity, which is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. I would like to finish by asking this Chamber why the people of Europe are increasingly sceptical about the European Union. Allow me to tell you with one simple sentence: it is because it is always a case of ‘do as I say and not as I do’, and therefore I believe, Mr Juncker, you have two options. One is to honourably resign or, two, at least stand down while an independent investigation takes place.

With a consummate art, I must say, of the distribution, you use the scandal that affects you to ask us to increase your skills. But, Mr Juncker, we do not need to harmonize - in reality to unify - tax laws. All that is needed is a very simple rule that must be implemented, under which multinational companies will be taxed in each Member State because of the turnover or profits they make there. This will be enough to put an end to the fictitious situation that is yours. I am well aware that, even on the socialist benches, Mrs Pervenche Berès approves of your appointment by saying that you may be a godfather (a mafia godfather - it is Mrs Berès who speaks) repented.

Mr President, I understand that everyone agrees that the problem is not just Luxembourg. The answer cannot therefore be exclusively Luxembourgish. In fact, I am no longer in charge of this country, and for the rest, I do not apologize for what I have been able to do for my country. I have never given instructions on a particular tax file. Luxembourg's finance ministers have no instructions to give to the tax authorities. Just as the tax authority does not have to report to the Minister of Finance. Be aware that there are other countries where finance ministers make decisions on early tax decisions. This is not the case in my country. I'm not saying it to relieve myself of my responsibilities. Politically, I am obviously responsible for everything that is done by the tax administration or any other Luxembourg administration. But you have to know the rules. What I have meant before you, as I have said in my time in the various parliamentary groups, during the various televised debates, in the debate we had in plenary, is that the Commission I have the honour of chairing will fight against tax evasion and tax evasion. Why can tax evasion and tax evasion exist? Because we have before us an arsenal of disparate national rules, which facilitates tax evasion by involving tax administrations that must enforce the laws as they are. If they are disparate, and if you organize, with a formidable talent for tax engineering, this interaction between the different national rules, you come to the result that unfortunately we have arrived at, which does not correspond to the requirements for tax fairness. I'll do it. Those who have been with me for a long time, who have been with me, know what my deep convictions are on this point. Do not question the ardour of my convictions on these points. Don't describe me as the great friend of great capital. This must have been a lot of fun in the upper floors of Luxembourg and European companies. Big capital has better friends in this house than I do, believe me. Mr Verhofstadt, I am not very impressed by the fact that you are asking for my resignation, because I do not owe my position to your support. You are consistent on that. You voted against me. It seems to me quite normal that you should ask for my resignation in every respect. Mr. Gollnisch, you need to know before you speak. First, I have never been minister of the economy. I have always had ministers of the economy either liberal or socialist, because I governed with the socialists and the liberals. Secondly, I have not resigned as Prime Minister of Luxembourg. We held early elections, there was no resignation from me. In light of these initial errors, you will allow me not to answer your other questions, which in reality were not questions, but simple insults, to which I will not answer. Frau Zimmer, Sie besch-ftigen sich mit meiner Biografie. Das ist ein weites Feld, wenn Sie dies tun. Ich habe yesterday als Kommissionspresident geredet. Es ist doch wohl die Erwartungshaltung des Parlamentes, dass ich prezise anfàhre und ausf-hre, was die Kommission gegen Steuervermeidung und gegen Steuerbetrug zu unternehmen gedenkt. Genau das habe ich getan und darauf hingewiesen, wieso und weshalb es zu diesen Phenomenen in mindestens 22 Lundern der European Union kommt. Die Kommission arbeitet nicht besser mit der luxemburgischen Regierung zusammen als zu meiner Amtszeit. Es gab wenige Premierminister in den letzten Jahren, die sich so intensiv um gute Beziehungen zur Europ-ischen Kommission bem-ht haben, wie ich das getan habe. Deshalb werde ich auch versuchen, als Kommissionspresident ohnlich gute Beziehungen zu anderen Regierungschefs zu haben, wie das freher der Fall war. Mr Verhofstadt, dear Guy, what about? I am told first: \"Do not intervene, do not interfere in the current instructions.\" Then I was told, \"Please ask Mrs Vestager to complete her investigation before the end of the year.\" I will not do that, because I am not involved in the way Ms. Vestager intends to perform her role. I have every confidence in her. She doesn't need your advice or instructions on what she wants and what she will have to do. (Applause) If it turns out that non-authorized state aid has been decided by some Luxembourg body, why do you want me to resign as President of the Commission? Then I would have a problem. You've been Prime Minister. Can you get up right now and say, \"Never has there been state aid refused and cancelled by the Commission during my time as Prime Minister.\"? You don't know that.

Je veux vous assurer que nous allons continuer de montrer la voie et la voix, à la fois vocalement et dans le sens de montrer un chemin à suivre en la matière. D'abord, quelques mots sur la dimension mondiale. En cette fin de semaine, avec le président Juncker, je participerai au sommet du G20 à Brisbane, parce que l'évasion fiscale est, de plus en plus, un phénomène planétaire et, à ce titre, la coopération avec les chefs d'État du reste du monde est primordiale si nous voulons apporter une réponse efficace à ce problème. À Brisbane va notamment se poursuivre un travail important sur l'érosion des assiettes d'imposition des transferts de profit. C'est ce qu'on appelle l'initiative BEPS et c'est un élément central du programme de travail. La Commission, jusqu'à présent, a été très active pour promouvoir de nouvelles normes ambitieuses. Elle n'a pas eu peur de formuler des propositions et d'être un étendard de cette lutte. Cet engagement porte maintenant ses fruits. Nous nous engagerons afin d'assurer que les travaux sur le BEPS soient finalisés comme prévu, en 2015, pour mettre en place un environnement fiscal mondial plus juste. De la même manière, l'engagement fort de la Commission en faveur d'une plus grande transparence fiscale à l'échelle mondiale a commencé à produire des résultats. Cela veut dire que nous avons contribué avec détermination et avec efficacité aux travaux de l'OCDE sur un nouveau cadre mondial d'échange automatique d'informations, qui garantira un niveau sans précédent d'ouverture et de coopération entre les autorités fiscales du monde entier. J'en viens maintenant à la dimension communautaire elle-même. In parallel, the Commission has also been raising the bar for good tax governance in Europe. Following the 2012 action plan it rolled out a series of legislative proposals and political initiatives to enhance tax transparency and to tackle aggressive tax planning.  In terms of transparency, last month the Council agreed on the Commission’s 2013 proposal to abolish bank secrecy and to apply the global standard for automatic exchange of information from 2016. This was a major achievement in a remarkably short time frame, particularly taking into account the unanimity rule, which we all know is a problem. In addition, negotiations are well under way with our five close European neighbours: Andorra, Lichtenstein, Monaco, San Marino and Switzerland. What for? To ensure that the automatic exchange of information is cemented in our bilateral relationship with them. In terms of creating fair competition, the Commission’s initiatives against aggressive tax planning are also taking root. Member States have agreed to propose changes to the Parent-Subsidiary Directive which will close loopholes and block a common form of tax avoidance. I am heavily investing in the ongoing negotiations on reinforced anti-abuse provisions in order to get to an agreement by the end of the year – this was not totally reached in the last Ecofin Council, but I am optimistic that we will move on. This work runs alongside the ongoing cases, steered by my colleague Margrethe Vestager, which also have fair tax competition as their goal. She appeared yesterday before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and was able to provide all the necessary details on this issue. A few words about that. In any event, as you may already know, the Commission is currently looking into the practice of tax rulings by Member States that could favour some specific companies. The Commission is in close cooperation with the authorities of the Member States concerned to proceed in a constructive and cooperative manner in this area. We have not seen all the information published yesterday. We have at this stage not yet formed an opinion about it as a possible formal follow-up by the Commission. On a more general note, Commissioner Vestager’s services have asked for information from various countries and she will be vigilant to enforce state aid control in a fair and justified manner. For the future, and beyond this, it is clear that we need to take a more systematic approach to the problem of corporate tax avoidance. We need to look at the root causes and consider long-lasting remedies. This includes digging into the question of how to ensure more appropriate taxation for the modern and digital economy. With this in mind, and in line with the mandate given to me by President Juncker, I will give high priority to advancing the common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB) proposal. This proposal is, as you all know, not a mere technical one, far from it. It is mainly political. The CCCTB could fundamentally change the corporate tax environment in Europe, ensuring a closer link between taxation and economic activity and shutting off major channels of avoidance. It must therefore be considered as a key element in our work to secure fairer taxation. For this reason the CCCTB will remain an important political file for me and for this Commission, and we discussed that this morning in the College alongside the proposal which was made here by President Juncker.  The Commission’s recommendation to the Member States on how to clamp down on tax havens is also still on the table. We should explore how this could be taken forward and fully implemented. Finally, as you know, the Commission will not hesitate to complement our toolbox with further initiatives if needed. In this context, we decided this morning – it was discussed a few minutes ago – to further enhance tax transparency, including through more information exchange, and enhance transparency on tax rulings. Madame la Présidente, je conclus en disant que l'engagement de la Commission à lutter contre la fraude et l'évasion fiscales n'est pas nouveau et n'a jamais été mis en question. Cet engagement est aujourd'hui plus ferme que jamais. Efficacité économique, concurrence loyale, justice sociale: voilà trois principes qui sous-tendent la lutte contre l'évasion fiscale. Ce sont ces principes qui, pour moi – dans la tâche qui est la mienne –, comme pour la Commission dans son ensemble, sont et seront au cœur de notre action. C'est la raison pour laquelle le travail de la Commission pour lutter contre la fraude et l'évasion fiscales va continuer avec ambition et détermination pendant ce mandat. Toutefois, il faut souligner – ce n'est pas une façon de se défausser, mais une réalité – que la compétence est essentiellement auprès des États membres. Cela a deux implications. D'une part, si la Commission peut proposer une quelconque initiative dans le domaine de la lutte contre la fraude fiscale, seuls les États membres sont habilités in fine à voter et à donner leur accord. Une prise de conscience et une acceptation de leur part d'agir dans ce sens sont donc indispensables. D'autre part, en raison de la règle de l'unanimité – dont je disais il y a quelques minutes qu'elle était sinon un problème, du moins une difficulté – l'acceptation des États membres peut prendre plus de temps que ce qui serait approprié, voire – je ne le souhaite pas – ne jamais se produire. À cet égard, le rôle à la fois des opinions publiques, des parlements nationaux et de ce Parlement européen est tout à fait décisif pour permettre d'accélérer les choses. Voilà l'esprit dans lequel j'envisage de travailler en collaboration étroite avec ce Parlement européen, votre Parlement, dans les années à venir, pour atteindre nos objectifs communs dans ce domaine qui – croyez-le – sera tout à fait prioritaire pour cette Commission.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 63, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "Burkhard Balz", "mepid": "96997", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her The fight against tax avoidance is, of course, also an extremely important issue for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, but it should be tackled with effective solutions. The issue as such, I believe, speaks for itself. Nor does it necessarily have to be a joke in the past of the President of the Commission or to launch personal attacks against individuals. Last year, including in these last few months, the Commission has already begun important work on which we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats would very much like to build on. The Commission has adopted an action plan and helpful recommendations that need to be implemented. Important progress has also been made in the automatic exchange of information, both at European and global level.  And the exchange of information is now being extended. The OECD standard is becoming an essential tool for making tax evasion increasingly unattractive internationally. Nevertheless, it has to be said that much remains to be done. Tax issues, as we know, have a horizontal character. They therefore also need a sound analysis of the situation in the Member States of the European Union. I believe that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is the right place to work out and demonstrate our further action. In this way, our colleagues can make a full and, above all, constructive contribution. We are in favour of an integrated approach, which can then also be developed by the experts in the technical committee. I think that quick shots, mood-making are really out of place. In the end, they do not do justice to the great importance of the issue either. We want serious, effective solutions and, of course, a comprehensive exchange.

They are a scandal because they have allowed everyone to see, all citizens, the extent and sophistication of aggressive tax optimisation practices in a Member State. But the most serious thing is that, as we know, this is not just a luxembourg practice. The European Commission has 7 investigations in different European countries, but the most complicated thing to explain is the fact that many of these agreements and many of these practices turn out to be legal. The great offices of consultants and lawyers assure you and there is a great deal of immorality here. Companies are operating in European Union countries, they are paying taxes almost nowhere and, above all, they are not paying them where they should be paid. Citizens are crushed in those same countries with taxes and austerity policies, while large multinationals defraud the taxman by billions of euros. This is deeply immoral. And when situations become immoral as is this case, they cannot be protected by European law. The law is for this: it serves to make compatible what is illegal with what is morally unbearable to citizens. That is the function of politics and that is the function of legislation, which means that legislation has to change and has to change at European level. Jean-Claude Juncker knows better than anyone the practices of his country of origin and the credibility of the European Commission and its entire team is that he is the leader, the central agent of a radical change in the European agenda by advancing serious proposals to end these situations. We need a much clearer compromise than the one presented here today, with a comprehensive timetable and a clear commitment to this Parliament that something will change radically in the European Union after this huge scandal. This is what citizens demand and this is what the Council too must recognise by reviewing its traditional law of unanimity, because it impedes the progress that is needed.

No, Luxembourg is an extreme case, because in many ways everything is combined: corporate taxes, taxes on petrol, taxes on Internet trade, benefits for the fund industry. Luxembourg is not a normal country, it is an extreme case. However, it is also a distraction in that attempts are now being made to moralise Mr Juncker's tax avoidance problems, so to speak, on him personally.

The second thing is that you can help us with the Anti-Money Laundering Directive. You know that Parliament has voted for a public register of the final beneficiaries of all opaque financial structures. We expect, in the fight - because it is a struggle - that we are opposed to the Council, support from the Commission, so as to force the Council to accept a measure, on the whole, of public safety. On the convergence front, on tax harmonisation, it is obviously more difficult because you are subject to the law of unanimity. On this point, I will say two things: first, I note that, under the mother-subsidiary directive, the Netherlands, of which some representatives now have all the merits, are currently blocking the anti-abuse measures that are being negotiated. On this subject too, I expect the Commission to increase the pressure, in particular by publicly setting out an attitude which is exactly in line with greater tax evasion. I think that the time is particularly appropriate to point the finger at the Member States that practice dual discourse. On the consolidated corporate tax base, it is clear that adopting this base without adopting minimum rates and therefore some convergence of rates - this does not mean a \"one size fits all\" but at least a certain range of rates under corporate tax - is clearly insufficient. On this point, I would invite you to encourage the States, which, like France and Germany, once said that they would organise enhanced cooperation to form a coalition of volunteers to harmonize corporate taxes.

I am very happy to hear this, but on the other hand, if this is the case, then we have to ask ourselves another question: how is it that those measures have raised so much concern and even outrage among European citizens? This is something we cannot ignore as lawmakers here in this House. Therefore I call on the Commission to work on this in order to increase transparency in all those measures, and also to make sure that discrimination is avoided. Because if this measure is a result of obscure negotiations then of course it may raise the suspicion of citizens. If on the other hand it is restricted only to large multinationals, it again puts small and medium-sized enterprises in a disadvantaged position.

We are also going to look into the interesting proposals that have been raised today and I can assure each of you that every useful tool will be analysed and assessed. I will say a few words on two issues that have come up in several speeches. First, on country-by-country reporting. As you know, the Commission remains committed to an ambitious approach, which we will promote at the G20 as part of the OECD's work. I would also like to examine how transparency on advance tax rulings can also be achieved through obligations borne by recipient companies. The question of the optionality of the excise is, I readily admit. The Commission will need to re-examine how the project currently on the table can better respond to the fight against the erosion of taxable bases. I will refer this matter to the College.  In general, there is a question about the resumption of work on tax harmonization, which I want to get over. Several hypotheses exist and several forms of work exist. Either we take up proposals that are already on the table, or we take them up more sequentially or differently, or we rely on enhanced cooperation. I don't want to rule anything out here.

In the present circumstances, there are two answers to be given. The first, with regard to investigations, has been given: it is a question of letting things move forward with independence, in transparency, with all the diligence and vigilance that are desired and desirable. On this point, President Juncker has made commitments, of course, and Mrs Vestager will be keen to keep them in office. The second is that we have to be, on the subjects we are talking about now, the fight against tax evasion, extremely offensive, extremely ambitious. That is the meaning of what I want to do in the performance of the duties that have been assigned to me.

This is an important moment of change for Europe. A new European Commission is facing many important challenges. One of those challenges is to improve the management of the European Union budget.  At the start of this new spending period, the Court’s annual report says that the European Union’s financial management is not yet good enough overall. The European Union financial managers are responsible not only for spending the money; they must also ensure that expenditure complies with the rules and gets results. As regards spending the European Union budget, over EUR 148 billion worth of payments were made from the European Union budget in 2013. The Court concludes that those transactions were properly accounted for in 2013, which means that we have now signed off a clean audit opinion on the reliability of the accounts every year since 2007. But despite the high level of payments, which were almost 99% of the maximum available for the year, outstanding financial obligations rose by a further EUR 9 billion up to EUR 322 billion during 2013. This is a sign of the growing pressure on European Union cash-flows. The Commission should prepare appropriate cash-flow forecasts to anticipate potential funding shortages for European Union programmes. At the same time, it should also take care to ensure that funding from the European Union budget reflects real cash-flow needs. For example, less than half of the European Union funds paid into financial engineering instruments since 2007 had actually reached financial beneficiaries by the end of 2013. The European Union budget gets spent but too many payments are still not in compliance with the rules. The estimated error rates for payments has been significantly above the ‘materiality threshold’ of 2% for all the years the Court has audited the European Union accounts. In 2013 the Court estimates that the overall error rate is 4.7% compared to 4.8% in 2012. All areas of expenditure were affected by a material level of error. The only exception was the EUR 10.6 billion the European Union spent on its own administration. The Court estimates that the error rate is higher in shared management by the Commission and Member States than in other areas mostly directed by the Commission. Furthermore, although corrective action by the Commission and national authorities helps to keep the overall rate down, significantly more could have been done to prevent errors in the first place. For example, the Court’s error rate in rural development could, in principle, have been reduced from 6.7% to 2.0%, if national authorities had used all the information they had at their disposal before submitting claims to the Commission for reimbursement. The main sources of error that national authorities should watch out for are ineligible claims, serious breaches of public procurement, and incorrect declarations of agricultural areas.  In the Court’s view, the Commission and Member States authorities should concentrate more on preventing such errors that arise for these reasons not least because they put at risk the efficiency and effectiveness of the European Union’s spending. During the 2007-2013 programming period, the managers of the European funds focused primarily on spending the money available, secondly on complying with the rules, and only then – and to a limited extent – did they focus on achieving results. This needs to change. Our annual report provides many examples, drawn from among the 19 special reports the Court adopted in 2013, to show how better focus on results could enhance performance. In this context, the Court welcomes Commission initiatives to move from a culture of spending towards a culture of performance. In the Court’s view, that culture of performance will require first a genuine commitment at European Union and national level to getting the best results possible with limited resources; second, that suitable targets for the results to be achieved as well as reliable information on progress towards achieving them are set; and third, and most important, there needs to be the right incentives to reward good performance and to sanction poor performance. Up to now the European Union financial managers have primarily been under pressure to spend the money or risk losing it. And lastly, it will also be essential to make the overall results achieved with the European Union money more visible. In particular, the European Commission should improve the coverage given in its annual evaluation report to the European added value of the European Union budget and to progress made towards achieving the Europe 2020 targets. European Union financial management improvement is not choosing between spending the money, complying with the rules, and getting results. It is about managing to do all three at once and making the European Union budget more manageable by clear rules, clear objectives and simple arrangements for spending the money. As I hope the Court’s 2013 annual report shows, our institution is fully committed to assisting this Parliament and the other three quarters to achieve valuable results for the European citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 144, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "Kristalina Georgieva", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to start by reiterating in this plenary our appreciation for the comprehensive report the Court has presented and for its constructive recommendations. The Court identified an error rate for 2013 of most likely 4.7%. This is still quite a way away from the 2% materiality threshold that we are aspiring for, but it is a notch lower than last year, where it was 4.8%, and most importantly, what we see is that the previous years’ trend of the rate increasing has been stopped, during a year of a record high EUR 148 billion of Commission-supported implemented programmes. I truly hope that we are seeing the result of efforts that my colleagues in the Commission have been putting in over the last few years, taking advantage of the recommendations of the Court. But if I am to say what to me is the most important message, it is that we must persevere, we must continue this work. Secondly, we are very comforted by the fact that we can reassure our citizens and our staff that the accounts are free from material mis-statements. This is the seventh year in a row, and this is, I believe, a very positive outcome of the work we have been doing, that the error rate on what we manage in the Commission is below the 2% threshold, and that commitments in all areas of expenditure receive a positive opinion.  As in the past, the Court leads us to focus on areas of shared management – cohesion policy and agriculture in particular – and as in the past we are reminded in the report that there is a factor that is obviously impacting errors, namely very complicated rules in public procurement, in state aid, in eligibility. This presents a risk that the Court directs us to address.  We are mindful that we have to intensify efforts with Member States; that this is where the biggest bang for the buck will come if we want to achieve better results in future years. And we also want to remind honourable Members that we have a particular problem still to address, and it is the multiannual nature of our programmes versus the annual nature of the Court’s reports; that very often we face a situation where corrections are made in future years, but are not captured in the year the report is presented. Just to illustrate this difference between the annual error rate and the residual error rate: over the last five years the amount of financial corrections was on average 2.2% of all payments. In other words, this would have reduced the error rate. But I do not want to defend where we are, because what is most important is to look forward, and looking forward I want to make two substantive points. One is that for the 2014-2020 programing period we have introduced new rules around three main principles: simplification, simplified cost options to reduce administrative burden and, as the Court highlights, to reduce risks of errors; ownership, to foster responsibility in shared management among national authorities – and also we want to promote political ownership at the highest national level; and incentives: net financial correction is a very strong incentive for proper control systems, and this is where we want to be for the next programming period. My second substantive point is to very much embrace the recommendation of the Court to focus on performance and to build and nurture a genuine culture of performance. This would be at the centre of my attention; this would be at the centre of my actions. I intend to work very closely with my colleagues in the Commission, with Member States and all other financial actors in this direction. I also would like to assure Parliament that we are taking very seriously and taking to heart the recommendation you have made to us to set up an interinstitutional working group on performance. Virtually in the next few weeks we will pursue the setting up of this group. We have no time to waste! Our citizens expect us to demonstrate that we take good care of the money they give us to serve their interests. From me, President Caldeira, a very firm commitment for a partnership with the Court, walking on two legs – compliance and performance – to achieve results.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 145, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "Ingeborg Gräßle", "mepid": "28220", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the President of the Court of Auditors for her excellent work and for the work she has done. The most disturbing finding by the Court of Auditors – among others in this thick report – is what you have said, namely that results – what we achieve with the money – are that these results come only in third place, that spending money is the most important thing, and, Commissioner, if you manage to tackle it, then you are my heroine! But I am afraid that things will continue as before, because I have already heard the other ten times, namely that everything will be different with the next MFF.  Why do we not know what we have achieved with European money, what results we have achieved? Youth unemployment: what have we achieved in the fight against it? Roma, integration: what have we achieved? Instead, because we can talk so little about results, we're beating each other with error rates, but it's also important because it shows us how administration works. And I have many questions: why is the Error Rate of the Court of Auditors in the Regional Funds so significantly different from that of the Directorate-General for Regional Policy: 2.8% and 6.9%? Or in rural development: the Court of Auditors says 6.7% and the Directorate-General for Agriculture 5.19%. Is this because the Directorates-General are rushing to protect the funds from criticism? Are we dealing with an inherent conflict of interest? You really have something to do with this, Commissioner.  And I also have a few other questions. Financial instruments: Why do only 47% of the funds reach the final beneficiaries? And then there is the state of the fight against fraud: that is a pity when this Office sees its first task in the fight against supervision rather than in the results. And that will soon be your problem, because that is where the grace period expires.  I would like to raise the third point, which is that the authorities in the Member States have given false information. We see the Commission's annual activity reports by the Directors-General as making extensive corrections, and that is why the question arises as to whether, as in the euro area, we need sanctions for false reporting, for false reporting by the Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 146, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "Inés Ayala Sender", "mepid": "28292", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Madam President, welcome, Mrs Georgieva, to this new task. And thank you very much, Mr Caldeira, for the efforts of the Court of Auditors, for the new analyses, for the new projects and for the new proposals, wise and courageous. We therefore have a new Commission. This is a new Parliament and a new budget period. And with the same crisis for seven years, it has already become like a biblical plague, and persevering. Therefore, we also have new challenges: An increasingly limited budget, with payment problems. I've never seen him before. A programme, a promise of Mr Juncker's programme: 300 billion for investments, but with difficult and complex financial engineering formulas, which the Court of Auditors itself warns us about and which will have to be monitored, Mrs Georgieva.  On the other hand, the control of banking instruments, which is becoming more and more difficult and on which we will have to work together with the economic authorities of the Union. And new alarms in income and own resources. The Court of Auditors again tells us that there are problems of credibility, of setting up the GDP of the Member States. We are fueling an increasingly deficit budget and becoming worse-controlled customs, making these own resources also in deficit. Therefore, we have great concerns, not only with regard to expenditure, but essentially also in revenue. Anyway, I thank Mr Caldeira, the Court of Auditors, for pointing out what we have spent on a European budget for 2013: EUR 290 per capita per year. And, of those EUR 290 per person per year that the Union budget has spent, there is only material error — only, even though no euro is liable for error — at EUR 13.6 per person per year. It may seem like little, but even that little is enough to make the work of further deepening and deepening control fundamental. However, I thank you once again for the Court of Auditors also working on trends and magnitudes. As has been said here, the common agricultural policy's EUR 45 billion is reducing the error by 0.2% and, on the other hand, rural development, being a smaller magnitude, we have a higher error rate: almost double, 6.7%, although it is slightly reduced. That is, they are different magnitudes and trends. That is why we are in favour and follow the Court of Auditors in its recommendation to go further towards a culture of results, but with incentives, rather than towards a culture of looking only at increasingly limited spending and increasingly with stronger sanctions that do not incentivize, but generate greater scouring to citizens and the administration.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 147, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "Ryszard Czarnecki", "mepid": "28372", "text": "  On behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab Dear! Thanks to Mr Caldeira, to Mr Lazarou, who is present with us.

I wanted to say that in the latest issue of the American weekly \"Newsweek\" there is such an interesting map that shows what are the main problems of each continent. As far as Europe is concerned, the issue of youth unemployment comes second, and this is what very large funds from the European Union are going for. Let me be honest, I am not sure that these funds are well used. I have the impression that on the contrary.  Ladies and again, it must be said – and this report says this, and it is good – that the financial management of the European Union is still not good, that it is necessary to improve the spending of these funds. The amount of receivables is increasing and will continue to rise. That is EUR 322 billion at the moment, and since the 2014 budget foresees commitments in excess of payments, of course this debt will continue to rise. There is no significant improvement in the level of error in payments. It was a little below 5% and it still is. I would point out that the two most vulnerable areas of spending are regional policy and rural development. It is so important that this is what the poorer countries – the countries of the new Union – benefit greatly from. And this, of course, poses a certain threat for the future.

In this respect we should have in mind that the EU budget should have a robust and consistent system for assessment of Member State GNIs. Correct information in this area is indispensable because the GNI-based own resources form approximately 70% of the EU budget. From that point of view, for me it is strange that the European Court of Auditors has found such a big amount of discrepancies in the work done by the Commission concerning not only its verification strategy, but also the verification process and the whole process of reporting. The Commission in its reply does not agree with most of the European Court of Auditors’ findings. Without going into details of the report, it seems to me that both entities have a completely different approach towards almost everything from a methodological, macroeconomic and managerial point of view.  In this respect I have some doubts. Firstly, after having the negative assessment of the work of the GNI Committee, which includes representatives from the Member States and is chaired by Eurostat, may we rely on the statistical information regularly delivered from these institutions? Secondly, while there are several well-known international organisations that distribute macroeconomic information for the countries in the world, for example, the IMF, World Bank and Eurostat, may we expect to have a sufficient level of similarity comparing the data from all these sources? Despite the abovementioned doubts in the situation, there is something positive. The Commission recognises the importance of the recommendations and agrees to follow them. Additionally, the execution of the European Union budget and the auditing should focus on results and on whether the set objectives are achieved and, in this way, the budget can be improved only if Member States coordinate their activities with local and regional authorities at the very beginning of the preparation of the programmes and procedures.

He himself listed the error rate in the rural development, environment, fisheries and health sectors: 6.7%. Provided that member states act, this could have fallen to 2 %. I would add: regional policy, energy, transport, now 6.9%. If the Member States act, we will get to 3.9%. Employment and social affairs, now 3.1%. With the action of the Member States 1,8 %. It is clear that the Member States must act, that there must be an action plan, led by the Commission, by Mrs Georgieva.

Unfortunately, the report shows that the Member States are unable to guarantee results on funding, because their first interest is to: one, spend the money so as not to lose it; two, to try to comply with the rules; three, only in the last resort, and not always, evaluate its impact and expected results. Allocating all these billions from the sacrifices of those who work and pay taxes and then achieve little, at a time of crisis and fiscal injustice such as this, rightly leads the taxpayer to believe that this European institution is useless and I would add harmful, because it creates an extra passage on the money that could now be managed directly by the Member States.

On the other hand, we are debating EUR 7 billion here, which the Court of Auditors has thankfully uncovered, where 4% of the European Union's funds have not been awarded lawfully, not properly. And I wonder: who takes responsibility where? Is it the people out there in the Chamber of Deputies who are taking responsibility for this EUR 7 billion? Or who else is prepared to take responsibility for this? 120 million people – almost a quarter of the European Union – are at risk of poverty.

As the main weakness of the European Development Fund, the Court of Auditors again mentioned the control systems analysed in the course of the audit of the regularity of transactions. The shortcomings in ex ante controls are worrying, as they should be used to prevent, detect or correct irregular payments in advance. I do not have to explain the current financial situation; we all know that this cannot continue. It is time to send out a signal and to use and strengthen the control mechanisms at our disposal.  This annual report is the twentieth of its kind, and it is a regrettable, if not frightening, circumstance that, after twenty years of monitoring, review and support for the European Court of Auditors, the Member States and the Commission are still unable to spend the budget properly and without a significant error rate.

We have seen that the error rate in the implementation of the EU budget has fallen slightly this year, compared to 4.8% in the lead-up to the eu.\" But is the previous year really the only benchmark that we need to consider? I think no. Anyone who is familiar with European Union funding knows that the expenditure curves develop differently over the course of a programming period. In other words, there are fewer payments at the beginning, and the more projects approved by the Member States, the more payments increase. It is therefore worth taking a look at where we actually stood seven years ago, at the same point of the 2000-2006 funding period. If you do that, you will see that at that time the error rate was at least 7.3%. In other words, the error rate today, at the end of the 2007-2014 funding period, is 2.6 percentage points, or more than a third lower than it was seven years ago. I think this is a political success. What else can be done to further reduce the error rate? This is where the member states are responsible.

When spending the European budget, it is primarily about spending all available resources, and it seems that whether these spendings are taking place in accordance with the rules is not in the spotlight.

There were very clear messages from the rapporteur – the three points that we heard – and also from many who have expressed their desire to see better financial management for the sake of delivering to our people. Let me make three points: One: what exactly is an error rate? This is what it is: errors. Some of this may be mismanagement of funds, some of it may be misrecording, and a small percentage – to be exact 0.2% – is actually money stolen. Of course, 0.2% is 0.2% too much, but we must not confuse the errors that are genuine clerical errors with mismanagement and, even worse, fraud. We have to be clear in our minds what we are talking about, because if we do not define the problem accurately, we will not be able to solve it. My second point is: what are we doing about it? For the majority of errors that are exactly that – errors – we are relentlessly investing with Member States in the training of people who deal with European money. We find this to be a task that deserves even more attention, because if we have people who understand and apply the rules, then the error rate goes down – and we have plenty of evidence that well implemented training programmes lead to a reduction of error rates – then people leave and the error rate jumps up, so this human factor is very important. We are also providing strong incentives in the new programming period: positive incentives – 6% of the money set aside to reward good performance; and negative incentives – more severe clawing-back of funds when there is inappropriate management of EU money. We are doing a lot, and we are keen to do more in simplification of rules. We now have eligibility rules harmonised across different areas, but I can tell you that yesterday I met with my fellow Commissioners who are colleagues in spending areas, to discuss how we can take this forward because it is really important, as the Court told us. My third point is: Do we take this report seriously? Yes. And the Court told us in Special Report No 19/2013 that the Commission adequately follows up the Court’s recommendations and that the Court’s review of a sample of recommendations showed that these, being implemented by the Commission, have improved financial management. We too intend to take this report very seriously, especially in this shift we need to make from a strictly compliance-based culture to combining efforts in compliance with very strong emphasis on performance.

Je crois que tous ceux qui ont œuvré à ces rapports vous en remercient. I would like to address some of the points that were raised in this debate, not because the Court was directly asked to answer, but because I think we need to have a clear idea what needs to be done. In our report we state clearly that we need to change this culture of using the funds because they are available and because otherwise we risk losing them, not having the possibility to use them. We need to make the systems work more effectively. We have shown in our report that the Member States have information to prevent those claiming reimbursement of funds from the European Union funds from making those claims. That is the primary concern. If you want the Member States’ authorities and the European Commission to do their job fully, they need to increase this preventive action. Of course errors may occur, it is human, but when they occur they have to be corrected. In our report we show the likely impact of the corrective action taken both by the European Commission and the Member States. At the end in some areas, even this year, in some operations we have looked at, it was possible to bring down the level of the error very close to the materiality threshold. We do not need to change the rules again; the rules have been changed for this new financial framework. We need now to implement them. We called for a change in the rules; the rules have been changed, so now is the moment for action. The Member States and the European Commission had to take clear action here, by simplifying the rules, by stating clear objectives, by devising and designing programmes for investment that are results-oriented; looking for real impacts on the life of European citizens, but indeed having the right incentives: those that are performing better should have the right incentive for that. Madame la Présidente, j'aimerais conclure en répétant que cette importance nouvelle donnée à une gestion tournée vers des résultats nettement visibles pour les citoyens doit être la clef de voûte pour l'avenir.

This Report of the Court of Auditors assessed that during this period the European Globalisation Fund (EGF) has been very effective and has enabled redundant workers to return to the labour market as soon as possible. The Court also concluded that where the fund was used to co-finance services that were not normally available in the Member States, such as the training of redundant staff, a huge amount of assistance was provided to our people. The Commission, which has spoken on this report, notes that the support provided by the European Globalisation Fund should be seen as financing a set of interlinked measures which, as a whole, contribute to the successful implementation of the operations financed. Indeed, the European Globalisation Fund supports workers by providing a wide range of assistance, including benefits, which ensure that workers have sufficient incomes during the period of activation measures, while at the same time benefiting from various funded instruments, such as training programmes. Lithuania has repeatedly successfully benefited from the support provided by the European Globalisation Fund, such as Alytus Tekstilė, AB \"Snaigė\", and financial assistance has also been granted to redundant workers from the directions of building construction, furniture production and clothing sewing activities.

The EU budget was primarily spent on regional policy, transport and energy (30.4%) and support for agriculture and the market (30.2%).  It is worth noting that there are still worrying developments in the EU budget. Two of them are the most serious. Firstly, there is not enough money in the EU budget to finance all expenditure, as the amount of unfulfilled invoices has already reached EUR 24 billion. This undermines the credibility of the Union and complicates the financial situation of many economic operators. In this situation, EU countries should increase their contributions to the UNION budget much faster by making in-plus adjustments.

This is a process which, in the first instance, concerns the two governments of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, which have worked closely over many years and which effectively began the peace process when they signed a joint declaration in December 1993. The European Union immediately welcomed the signing of the declaration and committed itself to social and economic progress in the region, including under programmes financed by the European structural funds. Over the period since then, the European Union, its institutions and consultative bodies, have taken a special interest in the peace process. For me this is perfectly normal, since the Union itself is a successful example of peaceful reconciliation based on economic integration. In 1994, immediately after the announcement by paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland of a complete cessation of violence, our then President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, declared the Commission’s fullest commitment to the peace and reconciliation process. Strongly supported by the European Parliament, the Commission decided to propose a new support package in order directly to address the process of reconciliation and social and economic reconstruction. This took the form of a special and innovative support programme – the Peace Programme – which was approved by Parliament and Member States in 1995, covering Northern Ireland and the border counties of Ireland, an area today of 2.3 million people. Between 1995 and 2013, the European Union contributed some EUR 1.3 billion to three rounds of Peace Programmes, or almost EUR 2 billion after matched funding by the Member States. It has been used in a distinct manner, supporting cross-community projects in the social and economic fields and promoting shared spaces, while seeking to deal with the legacy of the past. In recognition of the long-term nature of the peace process, for the new period 2014-2020 Parliament and the Member States agreed a new EU Peace Programme. The new programme will have an EU contribution of some EUR 230 million, which will be matched by some EUR 40 million in Member State contributions. The Peace Programmes are regarded as having achieved many positive outcomes, as one very important element in the wider peace process, which, as I have said, involves the two Member States in the first instance. We have always recognised that the programme is not about quick fixes. It is a strategically focused package designed to promote long-term partnership, as well as cross-community and cross-border cooperation. Evaluation of the Peace Programmes has shown a very positive impact on the ground, both in Northern Ireland and the border counties of the Republic of Ireland. The programmes have touched the lives of over one million people, bringing divided communities together, helping to rebuild trust and lay the groundwork for a shared future. The evidence suggests that the project has helped to change people’s attitudes, encourage them to reflect on their own prejudices, recognise the need to respect diversity and work together to build a new society. For example, the Peace III Programme focused on building positive relationships at local level and on helping people to acknowledge and deal with the past. So far, over 25 000 people in the region have participated in the conflict resolution workshops, over 7 000 people have received trauma counselling and over 40 000 participated in events assisting victims and survivors. We have naturally emphasised support for the next generation, through projects that seek to provide young people with the skills and confidence needed to avoid sectarian violence. Importantly, the programmes have helped to give the people in the region a sense of ownership of the peace process by fostering a bottom-up approach and encouraging people to devise their own solutions to problems. Yet, as we know, unrest and persistent disputes have produced setbacks in the ongoing peace process. The European Union, in taking the decision for a further round of Peace support for 2014-2020, has recognised that there is more work to be done. As we all know, the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020 and the regulatory framework for the programmes were agreed later than we would all have wished. The draft Peace Programme 2014-2020 was submitted by the Member States on 22 September and the Commission is currently preparing observations. Under the new programme, among other things, creating opportunities for the young people of Northern Ireland will be essential. It is the young that we must help if we are to sow the seeds of a more tolerant society capable of abandoning the hatreds of the past. We in the Commission will not shy away from tackling sensitive issues and we will seek to ensure that all political parties buy into, and remain supportive of, the new programme. It is important to recall that the Peace Programme, while financially the most important, has not been the only expression of EU support to the peace process. The EU has contributed almost EUR 350 million, over more than two decades, to peace and reconciliation under the International Fund for Ireland. An additional contribution was made from 2007 at the time when the devolved institutions were restored in Northern Ireland and when the outgoing President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, established an interdisciplinary task force within our institution to pursue opportunities for the region across the EU policy spectrum. The Northern Ireland Task Force operates within the Commission under my responsibility as Commissioner for Regional Policy. It has expanded over the years and today is composed of representatives from 18 Commission directorates-general that can play a role in fostering social and economic development in a broader sense. Many of you will have seen the report which was launched at the beginning of this month outlining the activities under the task force over the seven years of its existence. I was pleased to see the positive reaction to the report and the recognition of the role of the Commission from both the First Minister of Northern Ireland, Peter Robinson, and the deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness. I propose to speak to President Juncker about the continuation of the activity of the task force in the new Commission.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 192, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "Seán Kelly", "mepid": "96668", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, as the rapporteur for the International Fund for Ireland in the last mandate, and as the leader of my group in the PPE, it gives me great pleasure to present this resolution on the peace process in Northern Ireland to Parliament this evening. I would particularly like to welcome the Commissioner, who is a former colleague, and to congratulate her on her elevation. It gives me great pleasure to be the first to address her. Without doubt, the whole peace process in Northern Ireland can be looked at as a miracle, because people who probably hated one another, and who were willing to go by the gun rather than the ballot, turned away from that. As a result we got the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive Committee – a system which has worked very well in general over the last number of years. For that, the European Union deserves great credit, and people like Jim Nicholson who have been involved over all that period here in Parliament can testify to how important this was.  Now, however, there is an impasse – and I would call it an impasse rather than an end, because while there are issues which need to be addressed, we hope that this resolution will encourage all sides to come together and to do so in an open spirit. It was particularly great to welcome here over the last couple of weeks the deputy First Minister, Mr McGuinness and, today, the First Minister, Mr Robinson and the Leader of the DUP, Mr Nesbitt, who have all said that Europe is seen as a friend of Northern Ireland. It is in that spirit that we present this resolution, because the people of Northern Ireland want peace.

All the same I think what we want to see, and what we have seen in this resolution, is that issues are dealt with, the overall progress has to be made in Northern Ireland and should not be underestimated or forgotten in this debate. While there have been numerous problems along the way requiring delicate political negotiation, the processes remain largely on track and we need to promote the progress made as a positive example of conflict resolution.  The lesson that can be drawn from the peace process is that the ability to empathise is essential. All sides to a conflict must be able to understand what the other side feels, what it wants and what it hopes for. Political representatives trying to negotiate an end to conflict must be able to place themselves in the shoes of their political opponents and of those opponents’ constituents. This helps to encourage compromise, and as we all know politics is the art of compromise. The role of the EU has been essential in this and the Commissioner has explained what that is.

I welcome the commitment that the Commission continues to support the Northern Ireland Process, the various generations of Peace Programmes attest to this. The establishment of the Barroso task force was also an important sign of the European Unionʼs commitment to progress in Northern Ireland and we must understand that this process is not over yet; the Northern Ireland Task Force still has a valuable role to play and indeed it is promising that Commissioner Crețu appears to be holding the task force in high regard.

If we look back to our own history, the primary objective in establishing the European Union was to end all wars within our borders and to find ways and means of living together. Now, for many people, especially those who have no memory of war, this may seem a very simple, a very straightforward, and sometimes even an inadequate objective because they have grown used to living in peaceful times. It is normal, everyday, and we expect it will always continue. But peace, of course, is never a given. It is never fully and finally achieved anywhere. It is always a process and that is just as true in mainland Europe as it is in Northern Ireland. But the process of peace-building in Northern Ireland is still in its infancy. It is no longer a tiny new-born, but it still requires assistance and support. Like any toddler, it can be knocked over, and it can fall over. All it can do then is haul itself back up on its feet, and take the next step, because there is no other way. The EU has acted as an honest broker and has funded a number of peace-building programmes. The last two programmes had as their priorities reconciling communities and contributing to a shared society, and the new peace funds will focus on young people and children. And speaking of young people and children, in my opinion much greater emphasis needs to be placed on some form of integrated education system where we can ensure cross-community interaction between four-year olds – that would be a positive start.

Republicans who once engaged in terrorism, having failed to achieve their goals, now share power with Unionists in a Northern Ireland Assembly, based on an exclusively peaceful and democratic basis. As we face threats from dissident Irish Republicanism we must again ensure that politics and the power of democracy wins through. Our goal is to build a more prosperous, respectful Northern Ireland. Political stability, the effective functioning of our democratic institutions, is fundamental in building this reality. All recent surveys demonstrate that there is a greater level of support for Northern Ireland remaining an integral part of the United Kingdom than at any time in our history. Indeed, such support is based on strong support from both traditions in Northern Ireland. As we continue with political talks aimed at resolving some of the outstanding problems, including the functionality of government, Unionism does so in a positive way. My party wants to normalise government structures, streamline decision-making and make good government in Northern Ireland easier to deliver.

Summing up their similarities and differences, I would say that both agreements brought peace, but the Erdut Agreement ensured full integration of the speaking area, the constitutional-legal order of the country, while Dayton unfortunately did not allow the construction of a single and functional state. By the Erdut Agreement between Croatia and Serbia, the Croatian danube region was peacefully integrated with the mediation of the international community. This was a kind of introduction to the European future of Croatia.  Its success, apart from peaceful reintegration, is the fact that over two-thirds of the Serb population remains living in the area.

As most Members have highlighted, the EU’s Peace Programme for Northern Ireland is a very important programme. It is a unique programme within the family of EU structural funds. I agree with all of you that consolidating peace and reconciliation also means promoting growth and jobs. This is what we are doing through this programme – creating positive prospects, especially for the younger generation, because we need to stabilise the economy and to assist its recovery. As many of you have said, it is, of course, very painful to see that at the time of the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall we still have walls dividing communities in the city of Belfast. The European project has played its role and over the course of 60 years we have shown that people and nations are able to come together across communities and borders. That is why the leaders of Northern Ireland and the Governments of the UK and Ireland can count on the full support of the Commission – and on me personally – in their efforts to resolve outstanding issues and ensure lasting peace and prosperity. I am looking forward to visiting the region in the near future. This is a personal priority for me and the new Commission.

For our part, we cannot fail to welcome the initiative to organise talks between all the parties, encouraging them to engage in these talks in a positive spirit in order to resolve all the issues still on the table.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 229, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "elnök asszony. -", "mepid": "102886", "text": "   The next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on turkish actions that raise tensions within the Exclusive Economic Area of the Republic of Cyprus (2014(RSP)).", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 230, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "Johannes Hahn", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union For Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Madam President, honourable Members, I have followed closely the latest events in the exclusive economic zone of Cyprus and their implications for the region more widely. We are fully aware of your concerns, not least through the letters and parliamentary questions on this issue received from several of you.  The first thing I want to underline today is that the EU’s position on this is very clear. It has been set out in past Council conclusions, in the Commission’s latest enlargement progress report for Turkey, and most recently by the European Council in October. Still, it is important to repeat this position. The EU stands firmly by the sovereign rights of its Member States to enter into bilateral agreements and to explore and exploit their natural resources when in line with the EU acquis and international law, including the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Let me underline that the EU urges the avoidance of any kind of threat, source of friction or provocative action that could damage good neighbourly relations and the peaceful settlements of disputes. What do we need to do now? We expect Turkey to respect Cyprus’s sovereign rights over its exclusive economic zone, to show restraint and to avoid any more statements or actions that could cause more friction. It is very important that tension is decreased to the benefit of all parties. At the same time we hope that the exploration and eventual exploitation of Cyprus’s natural resources can continue and the benefits can be shared by all Cypriots. But what our discussion today shows most of all is the need for a rapid, comprehensive settlement on Cyprus between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities. In fact, in my opinion, that need has never been more pressing. Let me take this opportunity to encourage strongly all relevant stakeholders to contribute to a positive climate conducive to a Cyprus settlement to the benefit of all, because the division has gone on for too long, and because a settlement would open up the fullest range of options for exploiting hydrocarbon resources in the most economically advantageous way and for the benefit of all Cypriots. The leaders of the two Cypriot communities showed courage and vision in agreeing the joint declaration of 11 February, to relaunch settlement talks. In September they committed to accelerating the pace of the talks. So now I urge both community leaders to find a way back to the negotiating table and to resume substantial structured negotiations at the earliest opportunity, paving the way to a fair, comprehensive and viable Cyprus settlement to the benefit of all. The UN is urging this too. We have a strong political figure in Mr Barth Eide, the UN Special Adviser on Cyprus, who is ready to help the parties bridge differences, get back into negotiations and make real progress. The EU strongly supports his activities. Let me say a word about Turkey more generally too. As a country with a stated European perspective, Turkey must respect the highest possible democratic standards and practices without reservation. We will hold it properly to account on this. To do just that we need to have an even closer and deeper relationship with Turkey. This is one of the key plans for me as Commissioner. This also means developing the relationship more widely: more foreign policy dialogue and cooperation; acting more closely together on the great shared challenges in our region; a close and more productive economic relationship for the benefit of our citizens, especially through the deepening of our customs union; and further progress on the issues of visa and migration. I want to do more to develop a robust EU relationship with Turkey in our interest and to our mutual benefit. Let me assure you again that this issue is high on my agenda, that I am following it closely and that I understand your concerns. Today in Ankara the EEAS and Commission’s most senior official level political dialogue with Turkey is taking place. This issue is firmly on the agenda as there is a sense of urgency in helping to make progress on a Cyprus settlement. I am in contact with the Turkish Government to discuss how we can make meaningful progress across the whole of our relationship. Thank you for your attention and I am looking forward to hearing your views on this issue.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 231, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "Elmar Brok", "mepid": "1263", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. The Commissioner has rightly said that the probable reserves have enormous potential for all the countries in the region. We should not be as stupid as humanity has often been: when we argue, no one has anything after that. From these things often worse things have arisen up to wars. That is why the most important thing is to talk to each other about everything in order to find a settlement in this way. Of course, international law applies. I sympathise with our Cypriot Members, it can be said that if you drill in their waters, carry out investigations, then that is not funny, then that is a breach of international law, whether Turkey is a member of UNCLOS or not. But then, as the resolution says, it should join. I also believe, moreover, that the United Nations is right – as the Cypriot Government has said – that both communities should participate in the deposits in the same way, according to their size, and that they should not be available only to the Greek part. The Turkish Government, which represents the country, is in complete agreement with the European Union. That is why it is indeed very important to enforce international law. But this should be done within the framework of great openness, by talking to each other and seeking a common solution. This is so important, once in order to resolve the conflict itself, which has to do with the division of the island, in order to achieve a return to the unity of Cyprus. But it is also important to resolve this issue as a whole. It is also of interest to the European Union that this issue should be resolved when we talk about the diversification of energy raw materials. It would simply be a stupid ity not to come to a solution here. That is why, as the European Union, we should try to reach out to our Cypriot friends, to defend their right, but at the same time to be open to a solution in the talks with Turkey in order to arrive at a sensible solution.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 232, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "Victor Boştinaru", "mepid": "39711", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D group – Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is important to start by reiterate some of the content of the resolution to be voted on tomorrow. We are extremely concerned about Turkey's presence in the exclusive economic zone of a Member State of the European Union, Cyprus. This must be stopped immediately. We call on Turkey to comply with the obligations imposed by both international law and its status as a candidate country for accession to the European Union and to withdraw its vessels from European Union waters.  That being said, the members of the Group of Socialists and Democrats support without hesitation, and we are now also reaffirming turkey's integration into the European Union here. We are certain that our dialogue with Turkish partners will continue and will have a profitable outcome for both sides. Turkey is a strategic partner for the European Union, and therefore, as long as Turkey is attached to the relationship with the European Union, it will have to receive the Union's guarantees of its European future.  I end by expressing the unconditional support of our group for the continuation of reunification negotiations between the Greek Cypriot side and the Turkish Cypriot side. I am confident that the resumption of pre-conditions-free reunification negotiations is the answer to the Cypriot problem, and that the exploitation of hydrocarbons will be beneficial for both communities, for Cyprus as a whole, and for the states in the region, which will be involved in exploitation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 233, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "Charles Tannock", "mepid": "4521", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, the recent maritime incursion into Cyprus’s exclusive economic zone by Turkey is a clear violation of international law under the terms of the Law of the Sea or UNCLOS. This action is regrettable, and illustrative of the Turkish disregard for the reunification process. After the violation it was inevitable that the Cyprus Government would suspend the reunification talks, and I dismiss the Turkish Cypriot claims that any process should be linked to upfront hydrocarbon payments before a final settlement is reached. Nicosia has offered, in good faith, repeated assurances that both communities will benefit from the future gains afforded by gas revenues. These assurances should be taken by their Turkish counterparts as bona fide. Gas revenues offer the opportunity of a vital economic boost to both sides and could act as an incentive to the reunification talks. Similarly, the early return of Varosha/ Famagusta to the Cyprus Government would be a confidence-building measure from the Turkish side. Finally, it is important to note that ratification of UNCLOS or the Law of the Sea is a component of the EU acquis and that Turkey should be reminded of its commitments to implement the Ankara Accords and its obligations, as a candidate country, to fully recognise all 28 EU Member States, including the Republic of Cyprus.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 234, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "Johannes Cornelis van Baalen", "mepid": "96937", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Madam President, the ALDE Group wants to make the problem not bigger, but smaller, and we can only do this by referring to international law.

We all know that this is not the first time that Turkey has violated international maritime law, especially with regard to the north-western part of Cyprus. This time, however, we are talking about the southern coast of Cyprus, where Turkey has absolutely no place to look for and had not made any claims up to that point. I think it is necessary for the European Parliament to be clear on this. Our Cypriot friends and colleagues rightly expect international bodies to comment on these events and not simply tacitly accept this, especially since it has also suspended negotiations for a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem. Turkey has caused the crisis, and Turkey is also responsible for defusing the situation so that negotiations can resume. I would like to remind you once again that some time ago there was a proposal from Dimitris Christofias to reach agreement with Mr Talat on the maritime zones. This was about making these maritime zones a federal responsibility. The same should apply to gas resources. Unfortunately, these negotiations were not taken up later by Mr Ero'lu, mr. Talét's successor. We therefore urgently need – and I think Parliament must insist on this – a solution to the Cyprus issue, the Cyprus problem.

In line with the values of the European Union and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, I call for a peaceful resolution of the dispute in the context of the new phase of unification negotiations and the creation of a positive climate for both sides. Exploration of potential oil and gas deposits in The Waters of Cyprus is of common interest to the Greek and Turkish sides, among other things, as the effects of adverse environmental impacts can affect the entire island. I therefore propose to lay a solid foundation for future negotiations in this direction in order to rise from particular interests and thus build mutual trust for the benefit of all residents regardless of the ethnic or cultural diversity that has always been and is the recognizable wealth of Cyprus and thus european civilization itself.

A power struggle among members of the ruling elite has plunged the country into a human catastrophe of alarming proportions. The conflict which erupted in the capital, Juba, on 15 December 2013 has created one of the worst man-made humanitarian disasters we are currently facing in the world. Fighting and violence have forced nearly two million people away from their homes. 1.4 million conflict-affected people are displaced inside South Sudan. Over 100 000 of them live in the protection of civilian areas at overcrowded UN bases around the country. Small-scale fighting continues. At the end of October, heavy fighting erupted in Bentiu, the capital of Unity State, triggering condemnations by the EU as well as the UN Secretary-General. Both sides not only continue to build their forces on the ground but also continue to make menacing and quarrelsome statements, and by doing so break their own commitments to seek a peaceful settlement. The crisis in South Sudan has also had a destabilising effect on the region. Over 470 thousand South Sudanese have become refugees in neighbouring Ethiopia, Uganda, Sudan and Kenya this year. IGAD, the East African Intergovernmental Authority on Development, is conducting peace talks. The latest IGAD Summit on South Sudan which took place on 7 November sent encouraging signals, with South Sudanese parties stating their intention to cease hostilities immediately and reach agreement on an inclusive power-sharing arrangement within 15 days. Nonetheless, it is too early to say if a breakthrough will materialise, and there remains a risk of a return to active hostilities in the near future, not least given the political leaders’ weak control of their commanders in the field. The conflict has dramatically increased food insecurity, and disease is on the rise with a dramatic increase in deadly Kala Azar (visceral leishmaniasis) infections. A quickly spreading cholera epidemic was contained after a massive international aid effort supported by the EU, and the looming famine threatening the most vulnerable was avoided in 2014. The European Union has been at the forefront of the response, providing more than one-third – precisely 38% – of all international humanitarian contributions in 2014. The European Commission alone has committed over EUR 110 million for life-saving humanitarian assistance in South Sudan, and an additional EUR 20 million for the refugee response in neighbouring countries. Despite these significant contributions, many of the urgent needs are going unmet. One example: 55 000 severely and acutely malnourished children under five have been treated so far, but there are an estimated 235 000 children facing severe acute malnutrition in South Sudan. The relationship between the government and the humanitarian community is deteriorating. Humanitarian agencies are under constant pressure to conform to the endless demands of authorities, both in government and opposition areas, to control the delivery of independent and impartial aid. In addition, several humanitarian aid workers of South Sudanese nationality have been killed, while some are still missing, and this apparently because of their ethnicity. Let me conclude by stressing that, firstly, a political solution of the crisis is urgently needed as a precondition for peace and reconciliation among the various groups in South Sudan, which the European Union is actively supporting. Secondly, humanitarian assistance saves lives and alleviates suffering, but it cannot solve this crisis. The assistance cannot even be sustained at the current level for very long. Third, as long as a political solution has not been found, and the humanitarian needs continue to exist, we have a moral duty to continue our efforts in responding to the humanitarian needs to the extent possible and necessary, while at the same time political and diplomatic efforts have to be intensified. Fourth, the warring parties in South Sudan have to understand that they have exhausted the patience of the international community. They must get their act together to the benefit of South Sudan’s citizens and the development of the world’s youngest nation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 285, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "Joachim Zeller", "mepid": "96762", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased to see you again in your new role. Colleagues, the debate on South Sudan has again come close to the end of today's agenda. This is roughly in line with the public attention that the situation in South Sudan is attracting. Unfortunately, because the situation in that country can only be described as a humanitarian and political disaster.  Four years ago, people welcomed their independence as liberation from slavery – after fifty years of war and civil war. But people's expectations have not been met, on the contrary; Fighting has resumed in South Sudan since December 2013 as the country's powerful struggle for power and influence.  As the Commissioner said, almost two million people have now been uprooted and forced to flee – hundreds of thousands of them to neighbouring countries, so this is no longer confined to South Sudan. Thousands have been killed or mistreated! Aid deliveries did not reach the addressees, and even the UN refugee camps no longer offered protection. The ceasefire agreement of 7 November between President Salva Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar, mentioned by the Commissioner, is already the third this year. The two predecessors of the ceasefire have not brought peace to the country, the world community must finally act, and together! There must be no more arms deliveries to South Sudan!

Today, however, we have growing concern that there are continually ruptures of fragile high fires—the last one reached last Friday and broke last Sunday—and therefore we are in a situation of continued war. This continuing war is affecting the displacement, as has been pointed out, of two million people, is leading to continued violations of the most essential human rights , up to 10,000 murders – and is also endangering the lives of thousands and thousands of children who, as has just been pointed out, do not have basic nutrition. We know that there is no military solution to the conflict and that efforts must therefore be made to support the African Union in its efforts to engage in a national dialogue on the basis of the agreement reached in Addis Ababa. And that national dialogue has to be a general national dialogue, covering all the causes behind the conflict; it has to be inclusive and therefore incorporate all the actors that are facing each other; and has to build the foundations of a trust that allows us to move towards conflict resolution.

The image that rises up with me when I see it all on the keper is truly shocking. Take the forecast that 2.5 million South Sudanese will face severe food shortages in the first quarter of 2015, i.e. next year. After that, there will be even tougher months. It is clear that the structural approach to the current humanitarian crisis situation in South Sudan calls for an immediate end to political violence. At the same time - and this has been underlined by the Commissioner - European aid remains highly urgent. The Dutch organisations that are closely involved also have a great deal of appreciation for this European support. Only there is one point I would like to raise here. When it comes to deregistration of projects, these organisations are given very little time to register and participate in well-founded ones. That's why they miss the boat. And that can never be the intention. I hope that this will be taken into account by the European Commission and ECHO in Brussels, because there are excellent, well-equipped organisations in the Netherlands with experts keen to participate in European aid for South Sudan.

Mr President, we are once again faced with the situation of a country that is struggling to get out of the difficulties: political, security and humanitarian difficulties, not to mention the natural disasters that are added to it. When it is not cholera, it is famine, when it is not the uprooting of the population, it is the threat to humanitarian workers. South Sudan is fragile, vulnerable, but not without resources. It is against a background of ethnic differences that hostilities have developed in this part of the African continent. Since the regal functions of the State are no longer sufficiently assured, it is becoming difficult in the meantime to get humanitarian aid to the poor people who are in dire need of it. The biggest obstacle to South Sudan's take-off is the country itself, hence the European Parliament's call for the responsibility of the parties to the conflict to respect the ceasefire agreement. Insecurity is the biggest obstacle to the country's development and yet South Sudan should know that the international situation is not very favourable to it as there are many hotbeds of tension, crises and conflicts that require humanitarian assistance from our states and the European Union. In the meantime, the European Union must reschedule its aid, as South Sudan's absorption capacity has so it all disappeared. Our message to South Sudan is: yes, we are ready to help you, including at an international donor conference, provided that everyone, starting with you, get their own work into it.

Namely, the fact is that other security threats and situations, such as the threat of the Islamic State or such as the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, have in some way overshadowed this situation in South Sudan and if you will somewhat reduce the attention of the international community.

Let me start with the first two decisions which concern Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The first one concerns the amendment to Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement which enables the EEA-EFTA states to participate in the EU Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) and in the European Progress Microfinance Facility for employment and social inclusion. It also provides for a financial contribution by these countries based on the same distribution key as EU Member States. The second decision concerns the amendment to the same Protocol 31 in order to provide for cooperation regarding the free movement of workers, the coordination of social security systems and measures for migrants, including migrants from third countries. The EEA-EFTA states – Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein – participate fully in the EU rules on the free movement of workers and on social security coordination. The aim of this second Council decision is therefore to continue cooperation in this area through a financial contribution by the EEA-EFTA states to the monitoring of Union law on such issues. The decision is adopted every year and has become a standard procedure since the conclusion of the EEA Agreement.  The Council adopted both decisions establishing the EU position to be taken in the EEA Joint Committee on 5 June, and the EEA Joint Committee adopted the decisions amending the EEA Agreement on 27 June.  As regards the decision of the EU-Swiss Joint Committee on the Free Movement of Persons Agreement, the Commission submitted the draft decision amending Annex II to the Agreement to the Council. The Council’s decision is expected on 25 November. This fourth adaptation incorporates new EU legal provisions in order to ensure the consistent and correct application of Union legislation and to avoid administrative and possible legal difficulties. This is a technical amendment that will incorporate the changes to the EU legislation, for instance those concerning persons working in two or more Member States, and that will help determine which legislation applies. I would like to highlight that the adoption of this decision will contribute to ensuring that the same rules are applied to the coordination of social security systems, irrespective of whether EU citizens live and work in Switzerland or in another EU Member State.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 323, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "Thomas Mann", "mepid": "1922", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done.

We need to create a climate that encourages the emergence of new SMEs. For the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, this includes, in addition to cutting red tape, above all financial support for these new businesses. Progress has proved effective here, an instrument that facilitates better access to microcredit for those who have been struggling to get access to bank loans. The European Commission's report on implementation of 20 October shows that this instrument has made a major contribution to creating jobs. More than 20 000 prospective entrepreneurs have benefited from loans and guarantees totalling more than EUR 180 million. That gives hope! An EU programme for employment and social innovation has been building on the success of Progress since the beginning of this year.  A study published in parallel with the report shows that the demand for microcredit is far from being met! It is estimated that the gap is around EUR 2.7 billion. There is a need for action here, especially in view of the record unemployment in many Member States. I also support the extension of parts of microfinance to the EEA/EFTA countries, as Mrs Thyssen has just described. The European Economic Area, as a deep free trade area, expands our EU internal market to 31 countries.

I am not sure what role we play here other than for information, but nonetheless we are discussing it, so I therefore have just a few comments to make on the amendments that are in front of us. The first one is to allow the cooperation of the contracting parties to extend to social affairs. By doing this, we will ensure that Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein will be able, for example, to access the Progress Microfinance Facility. As we know, this fund was set up to help microbusinesses. It provides funds of up to EUR 25 000 for small businesses, if they are either setting up or expanding. It is particularly targeted at those who have difficulty accessing credit from conventional credit lines. I am very pleased to see this and to see the good outcomes so far in a recent Commission report as to how this Progress Microfinance Facility has worked. It has given over EUR 182 million to over 20 000 entrepreneurs, and the crucial point is that 60% of those final users were unemployed or inactive, and 30% were women. So it is getting to those who are targeted and, from that perspective, not only do I think it is an excellent facility within the EU, but I am glad to see that it will be extended to the EFTA countries.  The other amendment we are discussing this evening is the amendment to include cooperation concerning the free movement of workers.

I therefore welcome the view that States outside the European Union deepen their agreements with us, adopting them as their own and participating financially in Community policies which, as is the case today, offer great opportunities to small and medium-sized enterprises, especially through microfinance appropriations, which will contribute to improving the European business fabric and , therefore, the well-being of our citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 330, "date": "2014-11-12.json", "name": "Sergio Gutiérrez Prieto (S&amp;D). -", "mepid": "103488", "text": "   Mr President, freedom of movement is one of the basic pillars with which we have built the European Union and, therefore, today I welcome and support the ability to extend this freedom of movement, these agreements, to third countries, to neighbouring countries of the European Union.

Their reluctance to join the Employment and Social Innovation Programme must be of particular concern. In principle, only Iceland expressed its readiness to participate in the programme and Norway declared its participation in one of its axes. Given that this programme aims to develop innovative ways of combating social problems, it is surprising that eea countries are not interested in them, especially as they are acting as effectively as possible in the areas of social policy and the labour market. Perhaps they therefore do not see added value in the EU programme, but only additional costs. It is therefore worth considering whether it has been designed in a sensible way, especially as programmes such as Progress and EURES have long been criticised for their poor effectiveness and no way of improving their effectiveness has yet been found. Nevertheless, the restraint of Norway and Liechtenstein, whatever its cause, should signal to us the need to monitor the functioning of the Employment and Social Innovation Programme on an ongoing basis and to modify its mechanisms where necessary.

Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you very much for the warm welcome I have received here as the new Commissioner in the house where I have worked with so much pleasure for so many years. I am, of course, also grateful for the fruitful debate we have had and for the welcome you are giving to the Progress and EaSI European programmes, to the free movement of workers and the coordination of social security, and for the fact that we also want to share these things with people from the EFTA countries. I have also heard a number of comments, a comment on the agenda in this Parliament. Why are we discussing this here? Well, that is a consequence of the Interinstitutional Agreement between the Commission and Parliament. We are asked to make statements on this subject, and if it is requested from Parliament's services, we are happy to come here to make the statements we were asked to make and to listen to the comments you make about it. Secondly, there was also criticism here that these agreements would increase the rights and freedoms of certain persons. I have to deny that, because no new rights are granted in these agreements. That has to be rectified. Then we were also asked about the timing of these changes. According to some colleagues, including our Dutch colleague Jeroen Lange, the timing seems too late. But the agreement is that the incorporation of the legislative act into those international agreements must be done as soon as possible after they have entered into force in the European Union. So I think that timing can still be considered to have been respected. A number of comments have also been made on the free movement of people and the referendum in Switzerland. I think that this discussion is over the subject of tonight's debate, but I can assure you that the Commission regularly comes to the Committee on Foreign Affairs to inform the European Parliament's colleagues about the relationship with Switzerland on this issue and that the Commission is also prepared to continue to do so in the future. Then there are a few comments on the judgment handed down by the Court yesterday, in which it responds to a preliminary question on the application of German law. This, too, goes beyond the subject of this debate. In any case, I would ask colleagues to interpret this court's ruling correctly. The Court has said that Germany does indeed have the right to deny certain people certain social protection benefits in the circumstances clearly defined in the judgment. But this is such a delicate question that I recommend everyone to read that judgment thoroughly. In any case, it is a judgment that respects the free movement of persons and gives an interpretation, makes a review of a piece of German law. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for all the comments that have been made. You can be sure that, on the part of the European Commission, the programmes mentioned here, Progress and EaSI, will be implemented as efficiently as possible, and, of course, to the free movement and coordination of social security regulations. I would just like to answer the question put by Mrs Jazlowiecka, who asked how it is that some of the EFTA countries do not participate in certain parts of the programmes. Well, Mrs Jazlowiecka, Norway has announced that it will soon join the other part of the programme and Liechtenstein has decided not to participate in everything, solely for financial reasons. Because if the EFTA countries participate in the programmes, they, like the countries of the European Union, are also expected to contribute their share of their funding.

Freedom of movement, which is in fact one of the core principles of the EU, is threatened due to the growing fears of welfare drain, expressed by some of the wealthier nations. Crucially, however, we need to distinguish between free movement of people and free access to Member States’ social assistance systems. It is inappropriate and extremely worrying that some European countries point to ‘benefit tourism’ as a pretext for curbing immigration and hence for restricting the basic rights of the EU citizens. Admittedly, the number of beneficiaries of social welfare in some states, like Germany, has grown in the recent months, yet it has been established that immigrants, on average, receive less financial assistance than the local population in the host country. In Britain, for instance, immigrants contributed 64% more in taxes than they received in welfare in the past 10 years. Even if ‘benefits tourism’ was a real danger, it would still not be a sufficient reason to limit free movement. As I previously pointed out in an open letter to British PM David Cameron, and confirmed by the ECJ ruling from 11 November this year, countries are under no obligation to pay social benefits to migrants if they are economically inactive. Spelling out and uniformly applying such rules across the European Economic Area can counter populist anti-immigration debates, which undermine the very pillars of the European Union.

Whatever some on the Right may contend, economic policy is too important for us to allow it to be based on phantom stories created by populist parties out of electoral interest. It needs to be based on facts and figures. It is a fact that European immigrants to the UK have made a net fiscal contribution of GBP 20 billion to our economy in the past decade. It is also a fact that migrants from the original 15 Member States contributed a staggering 64% more in taxes than they received. The more recent migrants – often vilified in our press – handed over more than 12% more than they received.  It is also a fact that migrant entrepreneurs are helping to create jobs.
