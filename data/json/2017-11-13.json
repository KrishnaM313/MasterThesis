Eurostat publishes European statistical information at regional level in a number of statistical domains in accordance with Regulation (EC) № 1059/2003 establishing a common classification of territorial units for statistical purposes. This information is widely used in the context of the European Union's regional policy. In recent years, Eurostat has expanded the scope of published statistical information to include certain territorial typologies to meet the growing need for relevant information. The Commission has identified these territorial typologies in cooperation with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and has adopted a methodology for their establishment and maintenance, in particular for the degree of urbanization, including the identification of urban agglomerations. However, this regulation does not yet cover territorial typologies, and the current proposal we are considering today is addressing this issue. The proposal would allow data aggregation based on typologies. For example, gross domestic product in rural and urban areas can be compared and employment can be measured according to the level of urbanization. The proposal aims to establish legal recognition of territorial typologies, including the definition of urban agglomerations, for the purposes of European Statistics. The necessary for the calculation of the territorial typological and statistical coordinate networks, based on the distribution and density of the population in the individual cells of the coordinate network, which serve as a basis for the calculation of the territorial typologies. The role and names of the local administrative units, LAU level, are also explained. The proposal also contains provisions giving the Commission the power to adopt delegated acts to adapt the NUTS classification. The Committee on Regional Development in the European Parliament, having regard to the need to amend, detail and update the classification of territorial units for the collection, compilation and dissemination of regional statistics, adopted the proposed dossier under a simplified procedure, without any additions by the Commission. During the trialogue, technical improvements proposed by the Council were adopted by the Council, Parliament and the European Commission. There are two preconditions that need to be emphasized when considering this dossier. The proposed changes and improvements in the typology do not predetermine the identification of specific areas for European Union policy intervention. Some of the proposed territorial typologies are already in use. The proposed system is more flexible and offers a network of types of regions at NUTS level and at LAU level in combination and allows for the collection, analysis and dissemination of statistics to distinguish urban, rural, urban with additional areas, metropolises, suburbs. The establishment of statistical networks at European Union level will allow harmonization of data collection and analysis. In addition, certain terminologically sound definitions are introduced, such as \"urban centers\", \"urban clusters\", \"rural networks\", \"urban areas\", \"densely populated areas\", \"cities and densely populated areas\", \"cities and suburbs\". No effect is foreseen on the European Union budget and I, as rapporteur, propose that Parliament adopt the Commission proposal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 24, "date": "2017-11-13.json", "name": "Marianne Thyssen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, rapporteur, honourable Members, I wish to thank, first of all, the rapporteur Ms Mihaylova, and the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive approach to the proposal. Following fruitful cooperation between the three institutions, in particular at the trilogue, I believe we have reached our common objective. Regions in the European Union are very diverse. We see that regions with urban characteristics sometimes work very differently from rural regions and face different challenges. While urban regions often offer better economic opportunities and infrastructure, they might face problems like pollution, traffic congestion, crime and overcrowding. Rural regions, on the other hand, often lack infrastructure. These differences can also be observed when it comes to coastal regions, in which a large share of GDP is generated by the blue or ocean-centric economy. Tercet will help our understanding of these phenomena by aggregating pre-existing data by typology. By doing so, it will back socio-economic territorial analysis and help to shape good evidence-based policy. The proposal is quite timely as it, for instance, includes a definition of cities that helps support the implementing of the urban agenda and city-focused policy. As of now, there is no agreed legal definition of what a city actually is in Union law and this, as we all know, hinders a common understanding of the term and leads to the risk that we might not speak about the same thing when we talk about cities. To ensure a harmonised use of the term and a consistent application, it is vital that we achieve an unambiguous interpretation of the concept of cities, and of course the same applies for rural areas.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 25, "date": "2017-11-13.json", "name": "Андрей Новаков", "mepid": "107212", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate Mrs Mihaylova on her hard work on this report. When we talk about territorial typologies, I believe that we need even more detailed and detailed comparable information with which to know the exact level of development of each region, urban agglomeration, city or small settlement. This will help us to better refine the legislation and to choose a better policy for a given settlement. I believe you will all agree with me that each region has specifics that require an individual approach. Having said that, I believe that after 2020, cohesion policy funding must rise to NUTS3 level. We should not allow small settlements to become hostages of large and developed cities near them and therefore to be an inadmissible beneficiary under the operational programs. Moreover, we need to add more criteria to our funding approach: the level of infrastructure development and the social index, not just gross domestic product. Moreover, when an important transport corridor for the European Union passes through a region, I believe that the main burden of funding must fall on the European Union. We cannot count on small settlements to co-finance large projects on an equal footing with all other beneficiaries.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 26, "date": "2017-11-13.json", "name": "Tonino Picula", "mepid": "112744", "text": "on behalf of the S&D Club. - Madam President, congratulations to the rapporteur on the encouraging report. We know that Eurostat publishes a wide range of regional statistics in accordance with the Regulation establishing a common classification of spatial units for statistics, more popularly speaking NUTS. These statistics are widely used in decision-making at the level of regional policy of the European Union and in determining the type of support from the Cohesion Fund for which European regions can apply. The current regulation on NUTS does not yet cover spatial typologies, this issue is addressed by this proposal. Spatial typologies are also usable in the European Statistical System, in particular the degree of urbanization and the definition of cities. An example of this is the establishment of conditions for funding from the European Regional Development Fund, for the implementation of innovative measures in larger and smaller cities or suburbs. However, the ESS still does not officially recognize these typologies due to their uncertain legal status. The explanatory memorandum to the Commission's proposals rightly states that territorial typologies have a major impact on regional policies, they provide useful evidence that can help shape adequate proposals and more integrated territorial approaches. This would properly respect the diversity of the European Union's regions. We need more statistics because of the indisputably significant differences between the types of territories, which are not always the same in the Member States. Responding to this need, the proposed regulation aims to legally identify regional typologies at NUTS 3 level, local government units and network cells, in order to integrate them into the existing NUTS Regulation. The proposed territorial typologies of labels are mainly: urban, rural, urban and coastal areas. This will allow thematic statistical regulations and poles initiatives to collect European statistics through territorial typologies in order to effectively determine the needs of individual areas in a fact-based way. I support the initiative, which therefore seeks to establish spatial typologies for the purposes of European Statistics, thus ensuring a harmonized and transparent application at the level of the European Union and the Member States, based on the definition and statistical criteria. However, the division into cities, rural, urban and coastal areas is not comprehensive, this was an excellent opportunity to recognize spatial typologies and European islands with more than 17 million inhabitants and whose special status is already recognized by Article 174 of the Lisbon Treaty. Islanders rightly question how adequate policies can be created for islands at all if their status is not territorially recognized. One of the big problems of all the initiatives we are trying to implement is the lack of statistics on which to base them. The application of island-level statistics would provide a thorough overview of the characteristics of these areas, many of which are common, regardless of the geographical location, size or level of development of the island. Such data should be comparable to other areas of typology and would greatly facilitate the development of targeted provisions of European Union legislation whenever necessary. Insularity as a factor that increases transport costs, reduces security of energy supply, makes access to education more difficult and significantly limits access to the labor market, is a very well-known term for everyone living on the islands - it is time to respect it at European level. The adoption of this Proposal is a good step forward, but we must continue to work on its improvement in order to really prove in practice the unity in our territorial diversity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 27, "date": "2017-11-13.json", "name": "Ruža Tomašić (ECR)", "mepid": "119431", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Club. - Madam President, the spatial typologies that have been used for years by this regulation will be included in the legal system of the Union, so in the future we will be able to count on more accurate statistics according to which many European policies are tailored. I believe that this will lead to a re-examination of some previous statistical divisions in order to make even better use of funds. I will take the example of Croatia, which is divided into two NUTS II regions, in such a way that some of the poorest parts of Pannonian Croatia are placed in the same region with the most developed northwestern part of the country, making it difficult for them to access funds. Of course, this must be corrected. I am satisfied that with this proposal some non-administrative units will be able to deviate from the established thresholds due to special geographical, socio-economic, historical, cultural or environmental circumstances.

So, all these principles are extremely important to me and that is why I believe that in this way the territorial typologies we have, as a proposal for a new concept in some way, will really see the light of day in a far better way than it is today. I have some experience about it as a former Istrian prefect.

What I want to point out in the end are two things. Firstly, I would like to offer the Commission the experience that Croatia has when it comes to collecting data in tourism. Tourism is important for Croatia, but Croatia has excellent experience in collecting data when we talk about the tourism industry.

In Spain, of course - my country - it is a particularly pressing problem, and even the Government itself has created the figure of the Commissioner against the Demographic Challenge to promote a national strategy against this. With this problem that I am telling you - that of depopulation - in mind, this proposal put forward by the Commission represents an opportunity to create statistical instruments that allow the situation in the regions to be analyzed in more detail and to apply Community policies. The report, of course, raises a very positive question, which is to give legal recognition to the territorial typologies that have been used in the European statistical system, so that they serve as categories when designing cohesion or rural development policies and thus allow to compare regions and geographical areas. However, in my opinion, it is a somewhat missed opportunity. I subscribe to what has been said by colleagues regarding the categorization of the islands; and also, on the other hand, when drawing a new grid to distinguish three new typologies — urban centers, urban groupings and rural areas — I think that the topography of the territories should have been taken into account more. A mountainous surface or a flat surface cannot be treated in the same way. This question, which might not arouse more interest, is important to analyze the different territories, because there are population centers located on unevenness, which greatly affects when it comes to finding a suitable place to install an agricultural warehouse with the one to earn a family living.

However, the efficiency of these policies is conditioned primarily by the knowledge of the realities on the ground that represent different particularities from one country to another or from one region to another. Unfortunately, today we are witnessing a consistent migration phenomenon, more precisely, massive concentrations in the urban space which have as a consequence the worrying depopulation of the rural space generated by its lack of attractiveness. However, this phenomenon has different variables from one country to another and from one region to another. Territorial typologies must be harmonized, transparent legal instruments applicable throughout the European Union that will increase the effectiveness of European policies, and in particular cohesion policy. Whether we are talking about employment, rural development, agriculture or tourism, demography or poverty, these must be benchmarks that lead to increased inclusion at European level and strengthen the links between urban and rural areas. The successful implementation of future policies and actions at European level is dependent on the correct understanding of the information provided by the typology of the different regions.

I can really say: Today is a good day for inland navigation. Inland navigation is not that well known, but it is very important for the entire transport sector. The Commissioner will probably join us in a moment. It is the case that from now on, if we confirm the trialogue result, we will have uniform rules for inland waterway training - that is, for skippers, for helmsmen, for able seamans and sailors. Incidentally, all of this is also available in the female form. So there are already some women who work in this sector. The inland navigation sector as a whole also welcomes this regulation very much, for a number of reasons. One is: we need more inland shipping in the future. This is a very environmentally friendly means of transport and we want to intensify it. But we have too few qualified employees. And because of the different training courses we have no employee mobility; we would like to increase that. At the same time, we want to make it possible for a career changer from another area to qualify for inland shipping. And all in all, the whole thing should then happen with the latest technology with the use of simulators and with the exchange of experience, so that afterwards we have even more security through good qualifications and competence on the fuller rivers. It is about general qualifications and also about additional qualifications. Additional qualifications are required, for example, when driving passenger ships or driving dangerous goods or liquefied gas or when driving particularly long convoys or when dealing with radar. These are all extra exams that have to be taken. You also have to take into account that the rivers are very different - different lengths, different levels of complexity. I also learned a lot in the process, for example that the Danube has a particularly strong current and is on some places require special route knowledge, just like the Rhine, for example, which is sometimes particularly busy and prone to accidents. Here, too, you need special route knowledge, and you have to acquire that qualification if you want to drive there. The standards are based on something that has been around for a long time, namely the requirements of the Rhine Commission. There are also some river commissions for other rivers who are very familiar with their river and now allow everything to flow into it. Of course we have old certificates, and we then found an interim solution for how long they can remain valid. None of that was a big problem. The big problem was to see for whom, for which states this should apply. For example, not all Member States have rivers. Malta, for example, has no river, but has a seafaring school. It could be that one day the Maltese will think about it, maybe they want to train inland boatmen and do the practical part - I'm just seeing Peter van Dalen - in Holland. That would be possible. And that's why we said: We have to see who does it apply to and who does it not. For example, we immediately removed the sport boats and also the military and the police and the rescue services. And then we said: You have to think about it, if you have no rivers at all - like Malta, Cyprus and Denmark, which has a river but is not navigable - then you can say: You don't have to do anything at the moment, unless you think about starting an apprenticeship. Then of course you have to fully implement the law. The second is the case of Finland. Finland has many lakes but no direct rivers and is not connected to the European river network. I also learned there: There are Finnish saunas with an outboard motor, which of course don't need a captain's license; that is clear. They now have the option that they only have the Implement recognition of the EU driving license in any case, but also have and are allowed to maintain their own training.But only if the Finnish seafarers - on the lake - do not go to the Rhine, then they must also have the other training.And finally, you can say: everyone else has to fully implement it.So it was pretty complicated to get through this.As I said, I learned a lot about Europe's rivers.And I had a lot of fun, especially with my shadow reporters - I don't even see them all.I know Merja Kyllönen, for example, apologized, she is not there.But many others are there, Peter van Dalen is there.It was very exciting and I think we achieved a good result together with the Maltese.I thank you very much.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 46, "date": "2017-11-13.json", "name": "Violeta Bulc", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, the Commission warmly welcomes the compromise reached by the co-legislators on this file in June 2017. I would personally like to warmly thank the rapporteur Ms Meissner, and Ms Boylan and the shadow rapporteurs who contributed to such constructive cooperation in reaching an agreement. Inland waterway transport is a sector with long traditions and European know-how. It is essential to maintain this high level of professionalism for future generations too. We need to face the challenges of an ageing workforce. This legislation will bring significant benefits in addressing the labour shortage in inland waterways transport by facilitating labour mobility. Crew members will be able to exercise their profession in a cross-border environment more easily because Union certificates of qualifications will be recognised on all inland waterways throughout the Union. This includes: benefits, as now the rules will apply to all the crew members and not only boat masters as currently; and further harmonisation within the Union, as the Rhine certificates will be issued in accordance with the same requirements as those set by the future directive. At the same time, the new rules also take account of the different characteristics of EU countries in order to avoid disproportionate administrative burdens. Last but not least, the recognition will be built on a modern, competence-based system that will increase safety and improve the attractiveness of the profession. Amendments from the European Parliament and the negotiations brought many useful clarifications to the Commission’s proposal and a number of valuable additional competence requirements. In addition, other modifications can be considered as balanced compromises preserving the objectives of the proposal. This legislation represents clear progress in comparison to the situation today and shows that the EU can deliver for small businesses, people and jobs. This move forward is also part of a bigger picture in the context of decarbonisation. Inland waterway transport already transports 500 million tonnes of cargo and provides 1.36 million river-cruise trips. The sector will be strengthened through innovation and the emergence of a healthy and dynamic business environment. This will provide great benefits for the 10 000 companies, SMEs and micro-enterprises already operating in Europe, representing over 42 000 jobs in freight and passenger transport.

On this occasion, I would like to thank Gesine first of all for the excellent work she has done as rapporteur on this file. I also thank the other rapporteur colleagues for the constructive approach in the negotiations. I believe that this report is a success for the internal market because it brings concrete solutions to the problems facing the inland navigation sector. The situation we started from is that we currently do not have a clear system for developing navigation standards and no smooth process for recognizing all existing certificates, especially for recognizing certificates for the Rhine River and the Danube. This is also the reason why the profession of navigator has become unattractive for the younger generations. But what the agreement between Parliament and the Council brings is an effective European system for issuing and recognizing the certificates issued by each Member State. It is of course unfortunate that we have not been able to achieve an implementation without exception of the directive, but I believe that we have laid the foundations for a system that will concretely improve navigation on the main rivers where it is really needed. All European states will be obliged to recognize European certificates, even if they do not issue such documents, and the criteria and requirements included in the delegated acts will be published in all European languages. This was a request of the Social Democratic Group. All this will support the free movement of labor and we will be able to attract more people to this sector. In terms of social issues, I think more could be done. However, it is important that we managed to include it in the recitals the fact that employers are obliged to apply social standards and the remuneration of the states where the activity is carried out, even if the employees come from third countries.In addition, the Commission will need to ensure that these social norms are truly respected and that women's participation is encouraged.In parallel, we have ensured that, in the long term, the Commission will carry out regular evaluations of the new system, especially from the perspective of digitization, which will help us to monitor working and rest times, but also to eliminate existing red tape..That being said, I consider the final result of the trilogues to be very good and I recommend a positive vote from Parliament.Thank you and I hope it will be a step forward for better traffic and better labor mobility in the transport sector.Thank you very much, Madam President.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 49, "date": "2017-11-13.json", "name": "Peter van Dalen", "mepid": "96809", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. - First of all, thank you very much to Gesine for all the work and efforts.

The Commissioner has already said it: there is a need for more mobility. We need more people and in this way we can promote the intake and promotion of qualified people in the inland shipping sector. Competences, the supervisory director rightly pointed out, that's what it's all about now. Of course, diploma and grades, that continues to count, but it is mainly about what skills someone brings. Such an approach also promotes the influx of people who have not grown up in inland shipping from an early age, and in this way we have opportunities for both side entrants and people who already want to move up to other ranks in the sector. , so more opportunities for qualified people. As shadow rapporteur - and the rapporteur has already referred to it - I have also really committed myself to good involvement of the river committees, because the river committees have the people who have the knowledge of the practice, who know what is going on and also know what is going on. should be asked.

With standards to be set across Europe in training and the necessary qualifications to be allowed to work on a ship, not only do all employees enjoy more safety, but also the passengers. It is therefore important to ensure a high quality of training for ship personnel and at the same time to protect boat personnel - sailors. The protection of minors is particularly important to me.

This is clear progress in comparison with the situation today and it shows that the EU can deliver for people and jobs. Before I conclude, let me comment on a few of the Members’ remarks. First, on exemptions, the Commission agreed to well-designed exceptions, in particular for the transposition of specific provisions that have no application in some Member States which have no inland waterways. It makes sense to have these kinds of exception. Secondly, regarding assessments, I would stress that modernising our rules also means moving away from specific mandatory training to ensuring the relevant competences through common assessment standards. So this is addressed as well. I would also like to comment on remarks by a speaker who asked for further support for the sector. Allow me here to draw attention to some of the things that are already happening, and already in the pipeline, which affect the inland waterways sector in a broader sense, beyond considerations of labour mobility. These measures on the table were introduced in the second Mobility Package, in which we introduced combined transport with inland waterways playing a significant role as one of the decarbonised sectors. I would also like to draw attention to the additional financing of alternative fuels infrastructure, which inland waterways should take advantage of.

We have already noticed: we naturally have many advocates of inland navigation around here. I would like to take up what Gabriele Preuss said again: We need more use of the waterways. Most people don't think about it. All of us who have worked on this know the importance of inland shipping. Not all countries have rivers that are navigable. That's it. But especially here in the north - the Netherlands, Germany and, of course, France and Romania - have many inland waterways, and we have to use them more, because it actually relieves the roads and is also extremely environmentally friendly. So it is good that we now want to create more mobility - we all want that - and of course we will also ensure digitization and other improvements - environmental friendliness, etc. I would like to say something again about the compromise that has been raised. It was really nice that we had represented the Netherlands, Romania and Finland with the reporters and the shadow rapporteurs - very different countries. Malta, which has no river at all, had to negotiate the whole thing for the Council. This has really led to the fact that we have figured out how a law can be made so that an EU-wide - I will now say: Driving license for inland navigation, it is of course not said - different ways must be recognized everywhere, if you have a river at all, but that you don't have to implement the whole law, as for example in Finland, where it takes a lot of effort to pour it into national legislation. I think we have really found a good compromise - I'm very happy about that. But that was a very tough struggle. In between we weren't sure if we'd get it right. But it worked.

Unfortunately, Mr. Koch is still on the way. It's nice when you have to deal with traffic problems in transport policy. He asked me to give his speech. I have good news and bad news for you. First the good: as far as road safety is concerned, we live in Europe in one of the safest regions in the world. The number of accident victims has almost halved since 1992. Now the bad news: Despite the sharp decline, around 25,500 people still died on Europe's roads in 2016 - i.e. a small town - 135,000 suffered serious injuries, often associated with permanent impairment. Worldwide, 3,500 people will lose their lives in traffic again today alone. No matter where this happens - our most vulnerable road users, i.e. pedestrians and two-wheelers, are most frequently affected. And an average of 113 other people are directly affected by each accident victim, be they family members, friends or work colleagues. The further reduction in the number of deaths in accidents - Vision Zero -, but also the target agreed by the EU transport ministers in March of this year to reduce the number of seriously injured by 50% make measures necessary to improve the vehicles, infrastructure and the behavior of road users affect. And these measures should not contradict each other, but complement each other. Human error is complicit in around 92% of all accidents, and in 72% it is even the main cause. This makes it clear that we have to start here above all. You all know the causes: carelessness, distraction are just as much a part of it as alcohol and drugs behind the wheel, carelessness, overconfidence and inappropriate speed. Education and training as well as raising the awareness of all road users are good and indispensable, but they are enough not from. In addition to the error-forgiving infrastructure, we need invisible drivers and helpers in an emergency: the driver assistance systems. Above all, they should make a contribution to correcting the misconduct of drivers and minimizing their distraction and inattention. On the path to fully autonomous driving, it will be precisely these technical systems in vehicles that can save lives. Driver assistance systems have to warn drivers in critical situations and give them the opportunity to react in good time in order to maintain control of the vehicle. If the driver does not do this or does this incorrectly, then they should also be able to intervene independently, as it were automatically. The task of driver assistance systems is firstly to inform the driver of dangers and to support and relieve him, secondly to promote a fuel-efficient driving style and thirdly to contribute to the sustainability of road traffic and a smooth flow of traffic. Because then, fourthly, you can increase the driving comfort of the driver. I would just like to mention a few topics: First, the maximum limit for the blood alcohol concentration of drivers or the greater consideration of weaker road users such as pedestrians, cyclists and people with restricted mobility. As far as the driver assistance systems themselves are concerned, I would only like to make the standard installation of safety-relevant systems mandatory. That is why I - Mr Koch - propose: An essential contribution to increasing road safety based on scientific evidence must be made, a positive cost / benefit ratio, and these systems must be ready for the market. That is why I mean that automatic emergency braking assistants with pedestrian and cyclist detection, emergency braking displays, lane departure warning systems, turning assistants - in the case of trucks in connection with a camera device -, tire pressure monitoring systems and eCall for motorcycles meet exactly this criterion.In addition, I am building on a bundling of technical components that help make cars more affordable due to the increased number of units.The penetration of our vehicle fleet is crucial for the effectiveness of these systems.Therefore, the purchase price of the vehicles must not increase so much that in the end the purchase is discouraged.I hope that this will become a consumer right for all citizens of Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 62, "date": "2017-11-13.json", "name": "Violeta Bulc", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to welcome Mr Koch’s report. Thank you for the outstanding job that you have done. It recognises that road safety is a pan-European issue that needs to be addressed through an integrated approach. This implies adequate road safety management, enforcement of rules, driver training, road infrastructure and vehicle safety, as well as post-collision care. I fully agree. Every year too many families have to deal with the terrible effects of the severe injuries inflicted to a quarter of a million people because of traffic accidents. And even worse, every year about 25 500 people die on EU roads. That is a bus load every single day. 70 people. We must act and be more robust in our response, because the outlook is not that good at all. Over the last decades we made a lot of progress in road safety, reducing the number of deaths quite significantly. Thousands of lives were saved. But in recent years this reduction has stagnated. In some countries the numbers are even on the rise, and this is unacceptable. We do have to find a new way forward. Enforcement of rules by Member States on speeding, drink driving, safety belts and other unsafe driver behaviour has already had a positive effect. This is also the case for improving driver training and road infrastructure. The report rightly concludes that these are areas for improvement. The Commission fully agrees with those conclusions, and this is why we have recently proposed new measures, for example on the training of professional drivers. But there is more good news. Commission services have been preparing a revision of the general safety regulation and a pedestrian safety regulation. This has been done in a totally transparent and open manner by involving all relevant stakeholders from day one. In essence, we performed the ultimate peer reviewing exercise before deciding on what we should do and how. We have received very broad support from the European Parliament in this report, but also from the Member States’ road safety advocacy groups, and last but not least, the automotive industry itself. Let us focus now on the accident avoidance technologies. Advanced technologies can help us a lot in preventing traffic accidents from happening all together. One of the most effective technologies available today is automatic or autonomous emergency braking. The car stops completely by itself when it sees that an accident is about to happen. This way, a collision between two cars can be prevented. Another technology that we are looking at is emergency lane-keeping system. It detects that that car has drifted out of its lane for whatever reason, on a collision course, and steers the car back into its own lane. In fact, these two advanced systems will also be used for automated and connected driving. Speeding is one the main killers on our roads. This is why we are also looking into a ground breaking technology such as intelligent speed assistance. Another major challenge for road safety is how to effectively deal with drivers who are too distracted to drive safely by themselves. This was not explicitly developed in the report, but it deserves our attention too. We know about the increase in road fatalities due to growing use of smart phones while driving. Therefore, driver distraction and fatigue monitoring systems are also firmly on our radar. The EU will absolutely be at the forefront of car safety when these safety measures are out into effect. These measures already have a huge potential to protect EU citizens, as standard equipment on all passenger cars. But we should not stop there. The second item I would like to discuss with you is the protection of pedestrians and cyclists in traffic. We must have seen and heard terrible stories of trucks running over children at road crossings and hitting cyclists when making a turn. It is time that we recognise the urgent need for a comprehensive approach to protect the most vulnerable road users against current truck designs, such as blind spots. A first step is to add special detection systems to heavy duty vehicles that will know when pedestrians and cyclists are in the vehicle’s blind spot zone. But the second step is the most important one: designing larger windows. Our analyses show that when a driver can see the danger directly, accidents with pedestrians and cyclists are prevented. With these two steps together, we are looking at a revolutionary approach to make trucks in cities a lot safer for pedestrians and cyclists. The work to draft the new proposed vehicle safety legislation is now in progress, and we aim at including it in the third mobility package coming next year. All in all, the Commission is taking all measures which are in our competent to address this silent killer on EU roads. It is our responsibility to do more. We expect that other actors will play their part as well – especially Member State authorities – when it comes to education, training, enforcement and infrastructure safety.

Road safety is an underestimated problem in the European Union and the personal mistakes are known to all of us. You are from Italy and we know that there are many road safety problems in that country too. Today we are looking at the technical side and we are doing that in preparation for the new general safety regulation when it comes to vehicles. We can do an awful lot in that area. The technical possibilities are almost unlimited with sensors, with side lighting, with beeping systems, and so on. One point does require extra attention: making phone calls, operating a laptop, working with modern means of communication while you drive. You see the number of accidents in that area increasing.

In addition, recent statistics show that we have not been able to reduce the number of deaths and seriously injured people in line with our long-term goals. Traffic accidents are determined by a number of factors and their combinations. From the behavior and mistakes of road users, which include fatigue, stress, distraction while driving and driving under the influence of alcohol and addictive substances, to enforcing the rules, education and training. The condition of the infrastructure, vehicle safety and effective emergency care have an impact. This report focuses on proposals to improve vehicle safety, which should respond to advances in technological development and use other options to prevent accidents or mitigate their consequences. I would like to remind you that, at the beginning of this parliamentary term, for example, we approved the installation of eCall in all new car models from 1 April next year. It was the European Parliament and some Member States, including the Czech Republic, that led the initiative. Driver assistance systems undoubtedly fall into the category of innovations in vehicle safety. For example, an automatic emergency braking system with pedestrian and cyclist recognition can help reduce the number of the most vulnerable road users, who account for 30% of road fatalities. Vulnerable road users are also largely affected by the blind spot reduction system for lorries. In addition to assistance systems, greater safety can be ensured by changing the design of the front and rear of heavy trucks, buses or coaches. Improving visibility can help drivers better assess the situation on the road, prevent a collision or mitigate its consequences. This is especially true when it occurs to a collision with cyclists or pedestrians, for whom such a collision may have fatal consequences.It is still true that the biggest killers on Europe's roads are speeding, alcohol, seat belts, which is why we support initiatives that address these risk factors.I trust that the Commission will take into account the proposals contained in this report in the forthcoming revision of the General Security Regulation, which it intends to present at the beginning of next year.And I hope he won't be late.Ladies and gentlemen, despite all the measures we are talking about today, the most important thing is that, as a society, we perceive road accidents with the dead and seriously injured as something unacceptable that can and must change.On Sunday, we will commemorate World Day of Traffic Accident Victims.It is not enough to remember these everyday misfortunes.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 65, "date": "2017-11-13.json", "name": "Mark Demesmaeker", "mepid": "117477", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. - The figures have already been mentioned by the Commissioner: every year on our European roads 25 500 people are killed and 135 000 people are injured. That is a tragedy for those involved, for families and for our society. Safer road traffic and reducing the number of road casualties is also an absolute priority for us. As very correctly stated in this report, the integration of smart driver assistance systems in vehicles can certainly contribute to this. Agreements are also needed about the quality of those systems and also to ensure that trade is as fair as possible. Nevertheless, I have questions about expensive European studies about binding targets for road checks or, for example, for European interference in the cycling infrastructure, which are requested in the report. Such initiatives, such decisions, are better taken by the competent authorities in the Member States, ie at national or regional level, where they better respond to the needs of the specific context and road situation and the needs of road users there. Flanders, the nation I represent, provides the proof. The Flemish transport minister succeeds in reducing the number of road casualties year after year. Customized policy therefore works.

In order not to go over the very many human and technical factors, which can be solutions and which the Commissioner has detailed very well, I would like to come back or underline two specific points, but which seem important to me. First, recognizing the intrinsic dependence between accidentality and the quality of infrastructure, including the quality of the road network. It should be noted, for example, that motorways, despite their high speed level and their high concentration of vehicles, only represent 5% of serious accidents, testifying to the direct relationship between road safety and the nature and quality of infrastructure. As a reminder, a recent study took stock of the financial situation of truck drivers in Europe. 270 billion in revenue for the States, per year, all taxes combined, for 160 billion in terms of investments, especially for maintenance. It is therefore 110 billion missing that could be beneficial to improve the missing infrastructure. It should also be noted that road accidents, while destroying the lives of families, also represent a high cost for society, particularly in terms of health expenditure. Where there is often insistence on the repressive means available to States, and which are also a source of additional revenue amounting to billions to improve road safety, public authorities should also do their work better upstream, by investing more to prevent risk and save lives. My second point concerns the awareness of the medical profession may be insufficient. I speak here as a former doctor. Everyone knows, of course, that alcohol drugs are dangerous while driving, but it seems to me that there is a real work to be done towards the medical world as regards the road safety problems linked to certain diseases, certain disabilities, certain treatments or addictions sometimes caused by necessary drug consumption, but which has psychotropic effects or effects on driving. These direct impacts on driving safety require better consideration, but also better education, both for the public and above all for the medical profession in the care of patients. Indeed, it seems that the doctor is often turned towards his patient, but not in his capacity as driver of a car, and that the disabilities, the diagnoses, the consequences of the diagnoses that he has made or the treatments that he will prescribe have extremely important consequences for driving. You know that it is estimated that around 10% of accidents are linked either to disabilities that have not been taken into account, or to treatments whose consequences on driving ability have not been highlighted. This is a point that also deserves to be taken into account.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 67, "date": "2017-11-13.json", "name": "Kateřina Konečná", "mepid": "23699", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Mr President, let me first of all thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive and stimulating work. I am glad that many of my proposals have been included in the report, which is very vigorous and ambitious. There can be no doubt that this is a fundamental issue that deserves our attention. In 2016, 25,500 people lost their lives in road accidents in the EU and another 135,000 suffered serious injuries. Despite the fact that Europe is doing well compared to other continents, we can do even more to protect lives. The report therefore focuses, for example, on driver assistance systems, which will significantly improve road safety, and calls for their installation in all new cars. However, modern times raise a number of important issues with road safety. According to experts, in 2020 there will be about 10 million self-driving cars on the roads. So the very basic question is, who should have the \"main word\" in such a means of transport - a car or a person? I am convinced that it must be true that a person is the one who has the main control over everything. Traffic automation should not serve to make the driver a servant, but should be the master who uses technology to the benefit of all road users. Although the debates on this report have often been reminiscent of science fiction novels, there can be no doubt that the future will change the transport sector, and we as the European Parliament and as Europe must be prepared.

I would of course also like to thank the Commissioner for the words she said at the beginning, because it was an initiative by Parliament and we also hope that the Commission will follow suit. Of course, people are important. But it's about the interaction between vehicle behavior and infrastructure, it's not just about better vehicles. That became very clear in the report. Of course, people can be supported, but they cannot be left out, they retain responsibility. That is why the automatic emergency braking assistants, which also recognize pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists, are very, very important. And of course we also want the assistants to keep the respective speed limits; they also have to actively intervene to save lives. It shouldn't be that it is just a regulation that you can abandon at will, but here the technical possibility must also be used. We have been dealing with the blind spot when turning for 15 years. We know it's about the bigger mirrors and then it's always: in ten or fifteen years. In any case, the blind spot when turning must be eliminated and replaced by a direct line of sight. This is very important. It has already been said: the distraction. I was at DEKRA last year. There was a film about basketball players being shown. The audience was given the task of seeing whether everyone had been on the ball. In between an orangutan ran across the field and 90% percent of the audience did not see the orangutan because they only looked at the ball. That means: The distraction is very important for safety. The human being is really crucial here. Alcohol and drugs were mentioned. That is of course important, and it should also be prohibited by law.But also through control, because where a law is not controlled, the law is superfluous.We have now made this design.It is now the Commission's turn, and I would like to express my thanks for the support that the Commissioner has given us.We don't want to wait a year - you said in the coming months - for that to happen, for it to be implemented across Europe, because we want to save human lives.25,000 dead on the roads of the EU are 25,000 too many.We also think of the relatives who continue to suffer from it years later.That is why we have to do something here to improve road safety.This report is the first huge step forward.We hope that this will be implemented as soon as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 69, "date": "2017-11-13.json", "name": "Daniela Aiuto", "mepid": "124842", "text": "on behalf of the EFDD Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the issue of road safety - you recalled today - cannot ignore the use of the most advanced technologies, which can meet us, on the one hand as a support to driving to reduce - l 'my colleagues also said - human error as much as possible, and on the other hand to know in real time if those who drive a vehicle are in the right conditions to do so, that is, if they have a driving license or not valid, or has taken substances that may affect the ability to drive the vehicle. The tools already exist, some only in the experimental phase, but they must be encouraged and implemented. But we know well that safety also depends on the conditions of the roads and infrastructure in general. Often the funds allocated to their care, maintenance and implementation are badly spent or badly managed by the Member States, and in Italy, especially in the South, we are unfortunately well aware of the sad effects of poor maintenance.

First of all, I would like to emphasize that my colleague Koch has put a very thorough, forward-looking report on the table, which contains a lot of useful and worthwhile suggestions. We all agree that safety must be a priority in transport. After all, despite all the technical developments, the number of injuries and fatal accidents is still very high and meaningless. We are talking about 135 000 and 25 000 a year, respectively, in the Union. The report rightly states that there is a need to step up road inspections, install safety systems and modernize infrastructure maintenance, because without them, innovative systems will not work. At the same time, it is a fact that the average age of vehicles running on Europe’s roads is more than 10 years, so it is clear that we are not seeing the latest cars and technologies on the roads and streets.

All of these have, quite frankly, been unacceptably delayed. As the Commissioner said, in the meantime we have 70 road deaths every day on roads in the EU. In the UK, the latest annual figures show a 4% increase in road deaths from the previous year. As a representative from London, I do want to focus on urban areas. The Commissioner is right: what we actually need is a comprehensive approach. Technical vehicle safety measures are important but are only part of the answer.

As stated in the report, the keys to solving this problem lie in training and technology. The report also points to a complementary route to sanctions that really encourages drivers to respect traffic regulations designed to protect them: the idea of ​​decisively linking the taxation of vehicles and the rates they pay for insurance to the security conditions of the same. For this, it is essential to advance in standards that make it possible to define throughout the European Union the scope, operation and guarantees of driving assistance devices and new developments in vehicle design focused on improving visibility and the effect of possible impacts. Finally, the other great key to accident prevention is in the infrastructures: on the roads and signage. We have to guarantee that the former can incorporate devices that, with the available technology, are no longer science fiction. For example, designing and investing in speed limit signs or lane separation bands or road limits capable of interacting with vehicles and thus limit the effect of factors such as distraction, drowsiness, etc., on the deterioration of the road. road safety.

Currently, about 25,000 people die on the roads every year and 135,000 are seriously injured. The European Parliament has in the past adopted a number of important documents that improve the quality of infrastructure and the safety of road vehicles. It was not until 2015 that a regulation was adopted on the introduction of the eCall in-vehicle system. Most accident victims are cyclists and pedestrians. Therefore, a number of EU states and the Czech Republic have adopted regulations on the mandatory wearing of reflective elements by pedestrians under specified conditions. The resolution following the Dieter-Lebrecht Koch report has one gap. There is a lack of regular training of all drivers. Even the best mandatory driver safety assistance components cannot replace this training. With this reservation, I highly recommend the report under discussion for approval.

Many people live with such injuries for the balance of their lifetime. Ninety-five per cent of accidents are related to human error, and technology can play a very important role in reducing those errors. We have seen much, to date, in terms of introducing technology to cars. Seat-belt reminders were a small step that actually does save lives and reduces what could be the horrendous impact of injuries. I am delighted that some amendments I made in relation to heavy goods vehicles were adopted, ensuring that we have ambitious direct-vision standards included in truck design. Commissioner, I am glad you included that point in your speech this evening. We need to address blind spots and protect pedestrians and cyclists. When you think about it, the right place for these large vehicles is not on our roads in urban areas, but we can do a lot in terms of vehicle design to address their safety and the threat that they pose to cyclists and pedestrians.

In these three vectors, there is still much to be done: combating alcohol on the road, remodeling infrastructures and developing safe mobility plans for pedestrians and cyclists, especially in urban areas, and mandatory driver assistance systems, like the e-call system, which is already a reality and was mentioned by colleague Olga Sehnalová. Road safety cannot be just for those who have more money. It should not be only the top-of-the-range cars to have assistance mechanisms offered by manufacturers, such as emergency braking, tire pressure control, the rear seat belt system, etc. It must be made mandatory for all vehicles the existence of these technologies, which help to reduce road mortality. Ten years ago, the industry used the argument that free e-call for all passenger vehicles would represent a cataclysm in vehicle prices. This has not happened.

First of all the infrastructure. We have said many times that we need to direct European money, European funds, the European Fund for Strategic Investments to Infrastructure, but in areas where there is a backlog in terms of infrastructure quality. Then, the quality and professional training of drivers. Of course, here too I argue that we need to change in European legislation the way to check driving licenses, to periodically check the quality of training. We also need better signaling because there are situations in which, due to poor signaling, there are accidents. And, if I think that 51% of road accidents are in urban areas, I think that here, Commissioner, we need to encourage the Member States to allocate funds for urban decongestion of transport and the provision of bicycle lanes to new means, electric bicycles. .

Considering that almost half of the victims of road accidents are pedestrians and cyclists, an effective global strategy for the safety of European transport cannot but start from the roads, from the often obsolete, poorly lit and dangerous infrastructures.

The Transport Ministers of the Member States have already reconfirmed their commitment to improving road safety. This is evident from the very ambitious Valletta Declaration that was unanimously adopted by Transport Ministers in March this year. Notably they called on the Commission to enhance the protection of road users, and especially vulnerable road users, by ensuring the deployment of new safety features for vehicles. This is what we are doing. The Commission is working hard to adopt the proposal to amend the General Safety Regulation and the Pedestrian Safety Regulation. Our objective is to do this as part of the third mobility package in the first half of next year, but this is not all. In the same package we will also present a proposal to improve infrastructure safety. You rightly highlight in your report that we need to improve the state of road infrastructure to increase its safety.  But before I conclude, please allow me to address some of your comments. On driver distraction monitoring, this is indeed on our radar. We have determined that this will be a cost—effective measure to include in the package of measures, so you can look forward to that. On proper tyre pressure, tyre pressure monitoring has been mandatory for all new passenger cars sold since 2014, but light and heavy commercial vehicles, as well as buses, are currently not subject to tyre pressure monitoring requirements. The Commission report suggests that tyre pressure monitoring should also become mandatory in light and heavy commercial vehicles and buses. I hope I can count on your support. On medical prescriptions, this is a perfect example of the need to raise awareness through appropriate training courses and information campaigns. Member States certainly need to work on those issues. Please encourage them. We will only succeed if Member States also adopt an integrated approach. On infrastructure safety, let me restress that this topic will also be addressed in our third mobility package to be adopted in the first half of next year. Our objective is to approach road safety in a very comprehensive, holistic manner. But the good news is – and this is worth mentioning – that we have also engaged our neighbouring countries, including the six Western Balkan countries, Turkey and the Eastern Partnership countries, to join us in our efforts in an active manner because we travel in our neighbouring countries as well.  On affordability, the cost-effectiveness of each specific safety device and technology is a key element of our preparatory work. Our impact assessment will consider, in particular, the impact on consumers. The affordability of the mandated technologies is evidently a must.  All of this will be accompanied by a document setting out our vision for the future framework for road safety post—2020, and key measures that we consider indispensable to reverse the stagnating trend. Allow me to point out one more time that road safety is a shared responsibility. Some of the issues you highlighted should be addressed at national and regional level but, when it comes to leading the world with a highly ambitious and effective approach to improve road safety across the board, you can rest assured that the Commission will make every effort needed.  I certainly treat road safety as a top priority when it comes to my portfolio. This is why we added road safety as an important part of the Spring mobility package, where it will be addressed in a very systemic way. I can only hope that this will be a sufficient push to see statistics on road fatalities and serious injuries substantially decreasing again.  Thank you for a constructive cooperation, in the future as well. Finally, let me thank Mr Koch once again and thank all of you that we care so much together.

Only last May, the plenary debated the situation of Christians in the Middle East. As Vice—President of the Commission/High Representative Madam Mogherini firmly stated on that occasion, the freedom of religion or belief is a fundamental right of every human being. All persons should be able to practise their religion and worship freely, individually or in community with others, and to live free from fear. This applies to people of all faiths, or none, including to Christians. Yet we know that religious freedom is under attack in many parts of our world. Sectarianism is one of the diseases of our age. The millennial diversity of many societies is put at risk by the rise of the sectarian hatred. No continent has been spared from this kind of violence, from South Asia to Sub-Saharan Africa. This Parliament has often focused on the persecution of Christian minorities in the Middle East, and rightly so. Christians are discriminated against, harassed and persecuted in large parts of the Middle East, and the number of Christians is drastically decreasing. Christianity was born in the Middle East; it belongs to those lands, and this is something we cannot possibly forget. If the Middle East loses its incredible diversity, it would also lose its vitality and its greatest richness. At the same time, persecution rarely targets just one minority. As we see in Syria and Iraq, not only Christians but also Yazidis, Shia Muslims and other religious communities are suffering from discrimination, harassment and persecution. Therefore, a long-term strategic approach to protect Christian and other religious groups must focus on addressing those ideologies and changing those state structures that encourage discrimination and violence. Such violence may be committed by state or non-state actors for a number of different reasons. Ideology is certainly one of them, but it is not the only one. In many cases, the persecution of Christians and other minorities has political, ethnic or economic reasons. Very often, it is more about power than about religion itself. This is something we need to keep in mind if we want to make a real difference to the life of Christian minorities around the world. For this reason, our approach has focused on security as well as on culture and education, but also on diplomacy, governance and national reconciliation. We always react with public statements or private demarches to condemn violence against Christians. Let me also focus on other actions we have taken in defence of persons belonging to minorities.  First, since the adoption of the EU Guidelines on the promotion and protection of freedom of religion or belief in 2013, their implementation has remained a key priority for EU action. Second, the EEAS taskforce on religion and culture has led to an increased exchange on religious freedom and religious engagement both inside the EEAS, with Commission DGs and with European Parliament services. The EEAS actively participates in, and co-chairs, the Transatlantic Policy Network on Religion and Diplomacy. A number of concrete initiatives on diversity and tolerance have grown out of this network. Third, the EEAS also actively encourages cooperation among Member States on this issue. The Council’s Working Party on Human Rights (COHOM) created a taskforce on freedom of religion. It works on informal information exchanges on events and situations on the ground, and in preparation of EU resolutions at the United Nations. The Council’s Working Party on Human Rights’ informal meeting in Malta on April 2017 had a full dedicated session on freedom of religion and belief.  Fourth, during this year, the EU’s Special Representative for Human Rights, Stavros Lambrinidis, continued being actively engaged on freedom of religion and belief. He has placed special emphasis on the implementation of the UN Rabat Plan of Action that includes positive elements to address hate speech and to counter violence perpetrated in the name of religion. Mr Ján Figeľ, the Special Envoy for the promotion of the freedom of religion or belief outside the EU, has also worked on the implementation of the EU Guidelines on freedom of religion and belief, particularly on his visits to Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Sudan.  Fifth, the EU also uses all its financial instruments to support this endeavour. The European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights now finances around 40 projects related to freedom of religion and belief accounting for more than EUR 15 million. The Commission’s Directorate General for Development has recently launched a new call for proposals for intercultural dialogue and culture. This programme envisages cooperation with partner countries on intercultural dialogue for peaceful inter-community relations. Sixth, we also continue cooperation with UNESCO, the UN alliance of civilisations, the Anna Lindh Foundation and the Istanbul process.  Seventh, education is the best tool for building open societies and for avoiding radicalisation. In this day and age, education in emergencies and protracted crises has become particularly urgent. Think of the Syrian children, who can only remember a country at war. It is essential to teach them about their country’s incredible diversity and about centuries of peaceful coexistence. A peaceful and diverse future for Syria also depends on their education. Next year, we will devote 8% of the EU’s humanitarian budget to education in emergencies. In the Syria crisis, the EU’s contribution to education is over EUR 1 billion, through the various financing instruments we have put in place since the beginning of the conflict. Let me conclude on another part of our work against violence on Christians that may not be as evident, but which is just as important. In many parts of the world, a sustainable future for Christians and other religious groups depends on the work we are doing today for peace, for national reconciliation, for inclusive institutions. Syria, again, is the clearest example. We are working every day to help Syrians find a political solution to the war and build a country where all Syrians, including Christians, can feel at home. Diversity, respect and inclusiveness are not abstract concepts. To millions of people, they can make the difference between persecution and security, between fear and freedom, between life and death.

I would just like to underline two facts in relation to the persecution of Christians. The first is that this persecution is global in nature and different indicators suggest that it is increasing, even in its most lethal dimensions. Christians are the religious group persecuted in the most countries. And, according to studies, between 60 and 80% of the acts of religious discrimination that take place around the world, carried out by both the States themselves and social groups, affect Christians. The second is that the persecution against Christians continues without receiving the coverage it deserves from the media, the major human rights associations and political institutions, including the European Union. We should be particularly concerned about the destruction of historic Christian communities that is taking place among our Mediterranean neighbors, an ordeal that threatens to spread to refugees who make it to Europe.

But the problem is not the persecution only of Christians in particular: it is the increase in persecution for religious reasons around the world. And there are many examples: the savage persecution of Yazidis by the terrorist group Daesh; the genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar, with at least 270,000 fled and more than 2,000 murdered, a massacre systematically organized by the Government of that country with the connivance of a Nobel Peace Prize winner and much applauded and cheered by members of this House: President Aung San Suu Kyi, who was awarded the Sakharov Prize in 1990; the repression in Egypt of the igures; the persecution in Yemen of the Baha'i religious minority; in Pakistan, any criticism of religion can be condemned with the death penalty; or in Malaysia, where there is a minister, Mr. Shahidan Kassim, who defended this summer to hunt down atheists. And we must not forget the increase in Islamophobia in many European countries, fueled by racist and xenophobic hysteria from all parties of the extreme right, but also from apparently more respectable political forces.

The world today is plagued by protracted conflicts, many of them with multiple ethnic and religious dimensions. Wars and conflicts have created tragedies as part of the reason why more than 65 million people are on the run inside or outside their home countries. Attacks on various religious groups have increased markedly, not only against Christians but also against other religious minority groups, e.g. Shiites and Yazidis. However, the situation for the group of Christians has deteriorated dramatically in recent years. The persecution is global and takes place in various parts of the world, including North Korea, Somalia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sudan, China, Eritrea, Iraq, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Egypt, India, Iran and Turkey. In some countries, the state is the main persecutor, while in others it is individual groups that are at fault - most often, however, it is a combination of both. The main problem is not that it is precisely Christians who are persecuted, but that there are so many countries, regimes and groups that violate religious freedom, which affects all religious groups and minorities. According to the Christian international aid organization Open Doors and their annual World Watch List report on the persecution of Christians around the world, the persecution of Christians has reached new heights, and today more than 200 million Christians face severe persecution for their faith, affecting nearly one in ten practitioners. One region that stands out in terms of the extent and intensity of persecution of religious groups is the Middle East. The number of Christians in Iraq has decreased by 80 percent to less than 300,000 compared to the previous total of 1.6 million in the country. In Syria, there has been a decrease from 1.2 million to 500,000 since the beginning of the war. Although Christians have lived in the Middle East for over 2,000 years, they now make up only 3–4 percent of the region's population. Their continued existence in the region is thus seriously threatened. The ethno-religious division and conflicts between different groups has made all minorities more vulnerable. In some areas, Christians, Yazidis, and other religious minorities have been persecuted by the Daish and killed for their faith. Many have been driven from their homes and forced to seek refuge in neighboring countries and in the EU. In my country Sweden there is today one of the world's largest diaspora of the Christian group Assyrians / Syrians / Chaldeans, and it has grown rapidly as a result of Daish's ethnic cleansing in the Middle East. Daish has certainly been expelled from its strongholds in Iraq and Syria, and some of those displaced may return home, but the situation remains difficult for religious minority groups in the Middle East. Despite the fact that the right to freedom of thought, conscience and freedom of religion is enshrined in international law and is granted to every individual, regardless of religion, many oppressed groups feel betrayed and ignored by the UN and the international community. As one of the largest contributors in the region, the EU has a role to play, partly in promoting political dialogue with a view to enabling a sustainable and peaceful future for Christians in the Middle East, and partly by involving its residents in the negotiations. about their future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 98, "date": "2017-11-13.json", "name": "Margot Parker", "mepid": "124945", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, throughout the UK and in many other countries throughout the West, many Christians have been denied the right to wear a simple expression of their faith, such as a crucifix, in public life. The right to hold and express faith is a fundamental human right which must be protected and defended equally. The UK was founded on a Judaeo-Christian culture and whilst we respect and appreciate the contribution of all, this must be respected.  But the trials and tribulations of Christians in many countries throughout the West pale in comparison to what many must face on a daily basis throughout other parts of the world. The persecution of Christians, Shia and other religions and ethnic minorities, during the rise of the Islamic State was well publicised. However, we must be constantly wary of persecution of Christians: it is still [going on] and many will be unable to get appropriate assistance after being displaced by conflict throughout the region. As the terror of Islamic State rule is rolled back, we must ensure that the seeds of future conflict and societal discontent are averted and reprisal attacks are not carried out. This may not be an easy task, but the cycle of shifting persecution as power changes hands must be broken. As these countries are rebuilt, the place of Christians and their rights must be protected.  The recent political instability caused by the sudden resignation of Hariri as Prime Minister of Lebanon is a sharp warning that the Shia-Sunni war propagated by Saudi Arabia and Iran could be spreading into the country, and we must ensure that minorities are not marginalised in any political fallout from the future developments in this country. Christianity is an ancient religion with firm roots in the Middle East. The place of Christians throughout the region must be protected.

The European Union and various actors must take very seriously the difficult situation of Christians in Syria and Iraq, for example, with as many as 50-80% of Christians having to leave their homeland. The point is not that they have taken some new religion there, but that Christians have lived in those areas for more than 2,000 years - more than 500 years even before the birth of Islam. We should urgently find adequate means to prevent the destruction of the assets of Syrian and Iraqi Christians and the trampling of their constitutional rights. The persecution of Christians is leading to the loss of the strong cultural tradition in the Middle East, and it is also a defeat for all of us. The constitutions of both countries - both Syria and Iraq - guarantee the same rights to the followers of all religions. In reality, however, this is not the case. Christians have also significantly built these societies and acted as balancing parties in conflicts. There should therefore be no basis for persecution. In China, too, North Korean Christians have been persecuted. Some of them have fled North Korea for faith, but some have embraced Christianity in China. Christians who are returned to North Korea end up in forced labor camps, and those camps usually do not survive. It is estimated that between 50,000 and 70,000 Christians are imprisoned in these camps. China must strive to protect the North Korean Christians who fled there and offer them security and allow full freedom to practice their religion. The strong influence of Hindu nationalists on Indian domestic politics has also led to a reversal of general attitudes against other religions. Christians in particular have found themselves on the line there. We cannot accept action like this in a democratic country like India.

At the same time that the possibility of presenting this oral question was raised at the meeting of coordinators of the Fisheries Commission, the answer was immediate and unanimous in the affirmative. And do you know why? Because the fishing sector is always the first interested in maintaining optimal environmental conditions, and the defense of posidonia is a common element of all political groups in the Fisheries Commission. As is known, the Posidonia oceanica is an endemic plant of the Mediterranean, one of the most productive and resistant species in the biosphere, capable of forming underwater meadows of great ecological importance, within which many animal and plant organisms live that are found in it. food and protection. As if that were not enough, it is also an excellent bioindicator of the quality of coastal marine waters. Today doubts are raised about the conservation of these habitats; however, there are times when fishermen are always blamed, and it is not fair that the fishing industry is accused of causing a negative impact on the environment. There are many other elements, such as dredging practices, coastal development, eutrophication and climate change - among others - that have submerged this lung of the Mediterranean in a serious process of regression in recent years, making the posidonia, of slow growth and difficult regeneration, in one of the most threatened marine grasses at the moment. Given the importance of this fact, we ask the Commission to explain to us if it has envisaged any additional measures that could be adopted, not only to protect the populations of Posidonia oceanica, but also to reestablish their populations. In this sense, there are actions undertaken by some Member States - among them Spain, with six Mediterranean marine reserves with grasslands of this species - that have taken concrete measures to curb the impact of human actions and guarantee the conservation and preservation of the marine ecosystem . Within the routines of marine reserve services, the recognition of the state of health of these meadows stands out, and in particular their flowering and fruiting, whose higher interannual frequency and longer seasonal duration seem to be related to global change. Also specific collaboration in projects such as Posimed, in collaboration with different ecology institutes, or the prohibition of diving in integral reserves, or the development of specific content on the values ​​of this species that forms underwater forests of fishing interest. Also the incorporation of content on the need to protect marine habitats, with grasslands being a preferred habitat in national legislation on fisheries and biodiversity. And, finally, the incorporation of content on this species in the educational strategy of marine reserve networks, school campaigns and school outreach, because we cannot forget that environmental education and awareness are essential if we want to stop the deterioration of the Posidonia oceanica and also protect coastal marine habitats. In this regard, and to avoid the enormous pressure to which these essential habitats are subjected for the conversion of carbon dioxide into oxygen, the productivity of marine resources and the protection of the coasts, this House would like to know first hand what data is available to the Commission, as well as its assessment of the investments that have been made through its programs. I announce that, in this sense, I want to celebrate that the level of protection of the Habitats Directive, instrument for the protection of Posidonia meadows.Marine habitats provide great ecological services for humanity and, in this context, posidonia is an important part for the maintenance of this biodiversity.I am aware of this importance, but it is not enough to be aware.What is needed at the level of the European Union is the promotion of similar actions in other Member States, as I said happens in Spain.It is the task of the Commission to coordinate these actions across Europe.And finally, when we talk about the Mediterranean, it is also important that neighboring third countries participate in a joint effort.No matter how many efforts are made in one part of the Mediterranean, no result can be achieved if inaction is the tone of the other part.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 151, "date": "2017-11-13.json", "name": "Claudiu Ciprian Tănăsescu", "mepid": "96847", "text": "author. - Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, concerned about the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystem services, the European Union adopted in 2011 the EU Biodiversity Strategy, which commits the community to halting the loss of diversity by 2020. , many marine species are facing a decline in population and a decrease in range and habitat, which brings to the attention of the European Union the need to supplement measures and actions in the field of protection of the marine environment. This is because marine protected areas are the ecological foundation of the blue economy, as stated in the Commission's report of 1 October 2015 on the progress made in creating marine protected areas. This question concerns a species of grass, Posidonia Oceanica, which is not only one of the most sustainable and productive species in the biosphere, but also, according to researchers at the University of the Algarve in Portugal and the French Institute for Sea Exploration, the oldest living organism in the world, over two hundred thousand years old, with a positive impact on biodiversity conservation. But Posidonia Oceanica is one of the most endangered species of seagrass because it grows at a very slow pace and needs a long time to recover from destruction. Obviously, the new measures for the protection and regeneration of Posidonia Oceanica must be the result of data and information on the evolution of coastal marine habitats, as well as the evaluation of programs and actions already undertaken by the European Union, directly or indirectly, in terms of investment and the impact on the protection of coastal marine habitats and the conservation of biodiversity.

This is an essential habitat as a nursery and refuge for commercial and non—commercial species alike, and it provides a major source of food, regulates nutrient cycles and prevents coastal erosion. Impressively, Posidonia oceanica meadows alone bury some two 2 000 tonnes of carbon each year; it would be interesting to know how this phenomenal seaweed compares with our carbon emissions saving targets or the shift to electric vehicles.  Posidonia beds are a priority habitat type under the Habitats Directive, and Member States have designated around 30% as Natura 2000 sites to protect them. Other measures, such as national protection measures and environmental targets, are set under the Marine Strategy and Water Framework Directives. In addition, the Common Fisheries Policy prohibits the use of certain fishing gear – like trawl nets – above Posidonia seagrass beds and offers Member States special fishing management tools to be used in protected areas or essential habitats. Despite these efforts, in 2013, the status of Posidonia beds was considered unfavourable in four of the seven Member States where this habitat type occurs. And while information on trends is scarce, research studies point to regression rates in the order of 10% over the past 50 years, with losses mostly observed in the western and northern Mediterranean. The Commission expects further information to be provided by Member States in 2018, when they will report on their efforts to achieve good environmental status in marine waters. The decline in the population of Neptune grass is usually linked to coastal development, mechanical damage from illegal trawling, anchoring, beach nourishment, dredging, eutrophication and other forms of pollution. To restore Posidonia beds, Member States must establish site-level conservation objectives and restoration measures. New protected areas are also often designated. Compliance is currently being monitored by the Commission. The Commission is supporting the conservation of Posidonia beds through the dissemination of good management practices, the co-funding of LIFE projects, and financial support under the European Regional Development Fund, INTERREG Mediterranean and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). The good news is that investments through LIFE have played a crucial role in ensuring the effective management and restoration of coastal ecosystems. The programme has funded more than 20 projects since 1992, focusing specifically on tackling Mediterranean seagrass habitat degradation through protection and even restoration. Other cross-cutting coastal LIFE projects have also contributed to the improved knowledge and management of Posidonia beds. The mid-term evaluation of the LIFE programme, adopted on 6 November, details the careful monitoring of investments via outcome indicators and targets. The EMFF also provides financial support for the protection and restoration of marine biodiversity and ecosystems, which includes a common monitoring and evaluation system. The Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, will undertake a review of the performance of the operational programmes, the performance review, in each Member State in 2019. Given its phenomenal ability to absorb inconceivable volumes of carbon from the air, the returns on investing in further conservation delivers an extraordinary public good and a real contribution to shifting to the low-carbon economy. This is a prime example of both why and how we must continue to secure sufficient funding in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 153, "date": "2017-11-13.json", "name": "José Inácio Faria", "mepid": "125101", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, COP 23 dedicated the 11th of November to the oceans and, therefore, I understand that the debate on the protection of coastal marine habitats is not only opportune, but also extremely necessary. When we talk about protecting these habitats that are essential for converting carbon dioxide into oxygen, we have to talk about marine meadows that are vital ecosystems in terms of biodiversity and that provide numerous relevant services for communities and the economy. The oral question is part of the defense of the marine herb posidonia oceanica, an endemic species of the Mediterranean and one of the most productive and most important for the maintenance of biodiversity. However, this important species of slow growth and regeneration has been decreasing drastically in recent decades due to human activity, eutrophication and other forms of pollution, as well as in the wake of climate change and damage caused by the anchoring of vessels. At the Our Ocean conference it was estimated that the total annual value of natural assets in the Mediterranean will be 4.66 billion euros, which represents about 20% of the annual global GDP. However, a strong and sustainable blue economy depends on the preservation of marine and coastal ecosystems and our ability to restore them. For all these reasons, Commissioner, I believe it is essential to address you on the following issues: what is the current situation and the future evolution of marine coastal habitats, particularly with regard to the monitoring indicators of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive associated with biodiversity and integration of the seabed? How does the Commission assess the investments already made through the various research and conservation programs in the context of defending oceanic posidonia and what programs and funding does the Commission intend to put in place to protect and recover oceanic posidonia in order to increase its resilience and minimize the impact of climate change on this species?Commissioner, we urgently need robust measures if we are to have a sustainable future for the Mediterranean and, therefore, I believe that the answer to these questions is fundamental to devising a coherent strategy for the defense of the Mediterranean ecosystem.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 154, "date": "2017-11-13.json", "name": "Ricardo Serrão Santos", "mepid": "124741", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - Commissioner, as has been said here, coastal marine habitats are fundamental for the conversion of carbon dioxide to oxygen, for the productivity of marine resources, the protection of coastal areas and other essential ecological services that they provide to the planet. Coastal marine habitats are those that are most threatened by human action, either because of their proximity, or because these are the first places to receive the influence of activities carried out on land. The European Union, it is recognized, has invested significantly in financing scientific studies and programs for the conservation and restoration of the marine environment. However, in a recent article in the journal Nature, in 2015, it is estimated that, in the last 50 years, there has been a 34% reduction in the oceanic posidonia meadows in the Mediterranean. The case of posidonia oceanica is just one example of how the disturbance of the marine environment can have significant impacts for an entire ecosystem, so the monitoring and evolution of key species, such as this seagrass, is of crucial importance. Monitoring the evolution of the conservation status of species — keys to conservation, the impact of investments made in the conservation and restoration of marine habitats and the improvement of their protection are essential for the protection of the marine environment to be effective and continuous. Knowing and publicizing the results and improvements obtained with conservation and recovery investments to all European citizens and, in particular, raising awareness of the importance of these investments is essential for the work carried out to be even more positive in protecting habitats and marine species. Climate change, which was also mentioned here, is a reality, we all feel the impact of these changes on a daily basis, so the protection and recovery of species such as oceanic posidonia, which exercise actions important in coastal protection and other ecological services, are essential.Protection and restoration of habitats and species are actions that cannot be separated from commitments to reduce carbon emissions with a view to overcoming climate change.The European Union, it is recognized, has been at the forefront and committed to combating climate change.But it is necessary to bear in mind that the knowledge, protection and recovery of marine habitats, in particular coastal habitats, are an important point in combating these changes.I conclude by reinforcing the need to improve knowledge and monitoring of oceanic posidonia, but also of other key species crucial to the conservation and preservation of marine habitats, which so many fundamental ecological services provide to the planet.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 155, "date": "2017-11-13.json", "name": "João Ferreira", "mepid": "96706", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Mr President, coastal marine habitats and the species of fauna and flora that occur in them have a high ecological and conservation value.

We should therefore seriously question our relationship with the environment, when we know that this species dating back millions of years, which has withstood the worst cataclysms, is now threatened. If awareness raising is useful, we must ask the right questions instead of increasing investments, studies and various European programs.

But, today, around 34% of seagrass beds are threatened by wastewater discharges, nitrogen discharges, invasive species such as Caulerpa taxifolia, by the extraction of sea sands or by the anchoring of ships. Faced with these threats, should we create new marine protected areas from which fishermen would be excluded, since it is they who are most often accused of the destruction of Posidonia? I believe that this solution is simplistic and inefficient because trawling cannot, in principle, harm Posidonia meadows. Why? Because trawling is prohibited within three miles of the coast in France and above a depth of fifty meters in Italy and Spain. However, the seagrass beds are precisely located less than three miles from the coast and less than fifty meters deep, that is to say outside the trawling zone. So, rather than trying to impose new constraints on fishermen, I recommend investing in wastewater reprocessing. This is, I believe, the most effective solution. For example, in the creeks of Cortiou, in Marseille, or of Cap Sissi, in Toulon, the herbaria were restored as soon as the treatment of wastewater was improved. Of course, this solution must be applied throughout the Mediterranean. In this regard, I would remind you that, from its creation in 2008, the Union for the Mediterranean designated the depollution of the sea as one of its primary objectives. This depollution therefore necessarily involves reducing the discharge of land-based pollutants into the sea.

This is a serious issue because the meadows of Posidonia oceanica are declining at an alarming rate due to climate change and other human activities. Although the seagrass is considered the most important and well—studied seagrass species of the Mediterranean Sea, to date there has been a limited effort to combine all the spatial information available to protect the meadows across the basin. Its full recovery is usually considered irreversible in a human timescale because it is a slow—growing species with a low recovery rate. The management of direct impacts such as trawling, anchoring, dredging, pipeline refilling can help recovery and promote resilience, although this can take an extremely long time. Transposition of the seagrass is often unsuccessful, largely due to the fact that habitats are still too deteriorated to allow planted seagrass to survive. So what can we do now?

Among other things, it is not an alga, but it is a superior plant and is endemic to the Mediterranean Sea, where unfortunately its presence is decreasing more and more. Due to its particular sensitivity to environmental conditions it has been considered a real bioindicator. Posidonia, among other things, combines some characteristics of terrestrial plants with others typical of algae. Thanks to this peculiarity in the past it had a considerable commercial importance, just think that, not being flammable, its leaves were used as an insulator, for example on roofs, or to integrate certain animal feed, or to pack fragile objects, and was even called the glassmakers alga. So it has a great tradition in our Mediterranean culture too. Its uses were not limited to commercial purposes only and the leaves were also used to heal irritations and inflammations. Posidonia today is essential not only to protect the coasts from erosion, but also to preserve the health of the seas, helping to transform carbon dioxide into oxygen.

The malfunction, insufficiency or non-existence of wastewater treatment and pollution of the estuaries is something that sectors such as shellfish and inshore fishing are continually denouncing, a situation that I have repeatedly brought to the attention of the Commission. And, Commissioner, the answers often reflect passivity or the lack of forceful actions to reverse this situation, both in relation to deficiencies in water purification systems and in relation to pollution linked to mass tourism or different infrastructures in these areas.

We can talk about how beautiful and important the LIFE funds are to recover Posidonia.

This is just one of the species we want to protect because it is obvious that human activity has caused problems with marine habitats, and Posidonia oceanica is particularly endangered. We have already heard that it is one of the endemic species of the Mediterranean Sea, and more than half of the oxygen we breathe comes from the sea. We can call them the lungs of the sea because they enrich the sea with oxygen. Coastal marine habitats are essential for the conversion of carbon dioxide to oxygen and for the productivity of marine resources. Posidonia oceanica is the best indicator of the overall quality of coastal waters because it is very sensitive to pollution and can only grow in clean, unpolluted waters. One square meter of the Posidonia meadow produces up to fourteen liters of oxygen per day. Many species of algae live and breed in it, but also animals, crustaceans, cephalopods, shellfish, sponges, etc. Meadows grow very slowly, as we have already heard, and are even slower to regenerate. These habitats are clearly under great pressure, either directly from humans or as a result of global climate change. They are especially endangered by fishing with a hut and dynamite, but also by anchoring and pollution and construction in the coastal area. Therefore, I believe that anchoring should be stopped by systematically building marinas, and wastewater should also be treated. I personally represent Croatia here, where most of the Adriatic Sea is located, and I am sure that by banning anchoring and better planning, this could be avoided. In any case, we know that the Commission is doing a lot. We heard that from Commissioner Vella. However, we expect the Commission to engage even more.

Posidonia oceanica, an endemic aquatic plant of the Mediterranean Sea, is one of the most resistant and productive species in the biosphere, it is part of an important ecosystem for the conservation of biodiversity and has a fundamental role in the defense of the coasts as, acting as a shock absorber for motion wavy, hinders the erosive action of the coasts by the sea. Nonetheless, its population has declined dramatically over the past two decades due to dredging and trawling, coastal development, eutrophication and other forms of pollution, climate change and mechanical damage caused by anchoring boats. This species is characterized by a very slow growth and, if destroyed, it takes a long time to reconstitute itself.

We are concerned as much as you are about the unfavourable status and deteriorating trends reported in some of these habitats, and we acknowledge Member States’ efforts as well as research work during the last decades to increase knowledge on the status of such coastal habitats. I would like to make some comments. First of all, I agree that fishing is not the only factor affecting the state of the species of Posidonia, which is highly under threat. Mr Mato mentioned restoration. Yes, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) is offering the Member States financial support not only to protect, but also to restore the marine biodiversity and ecosystems, including the Posidonia meadows. What Mr Mato mentioned about what Spain is doing and about what other Member States are doing, they are doing this with the help and support of EMFF.  Protecting marine biodiversity is very much part of a number of actions on ocean governance. We have a number of tools at our disposal including the CFP, Maritime Spatial Planning, the integrated maritime policy, action against the negative impacts of climate change, and all these actions support our efforts to protect the species.  Mr Faria mentioned COP23. Yes, I was in Bonn last week and I was thoroughly pushing, together with my colleagues, the concept that you cannot separate the oceans from climate change – they are both inseparable and they are either mutually constructive or mutually destructive. The benefits that we are getting from the oceans are very clear. The oceans absorb some 90% of the planet’s heat, they absorb some 30% of the planet’s carbon dioxide, they give us some 50% of the planet’s oxygen and they will have to take all the melted ice when it becomes water. The oceans are climate change, as I said. This is something that we are pushing: you cannot discuss climate change without including the oceans in the discussions or in the negotiations. My colleague Ricardo Serrão Santos mentioned the support for protection; yes, they are protected not just through funding from some of our funding schemes but also through legislation and directives, especially through the Habitats Directive. We talked about funding; I already mentioned the EMFF, LIFE, the European Regional Development Fund, and these are all contributing towards the protection of the species. I mentioned as well that LIFE on its own funded 20 projects to specifically protect and restore sea grass meadows. We are also working a lot on the detailing and the monitoring of the investments. What counts is not the amount of money we are putting in; what counts is the output. That is why we are working on the output indicators and on the output targets as well.  I agree with Mr Ferreira when he said that the sea grass meadows have huge value as biodiversity habitat. Unfortunately we keep on repeating, and rightly so, that they are under threat, like all the other species in the ocean, like all the other species especially in the Mediterranean. Mireille D’Ornano mentioned a number of factors affecting these species. This is one example of a species which is giving us a lot of benefit, and what are we giving in return? I mentioned some of the benefits that we are getting from the oceans and in return we are only giving back over-fishing, pollution, eutrophication and all the negative impacts of climate change as well. Mr Goddyn: yes, there are problems not only in trawling zones, and that is why I started by mentioning that the problem is not only the fishermen. I am saying ‘is not only’ because bad practices in fishing could account for and could contribute to the denigration of these matters. We have eutrophication, we have acidification. Just to give you an idea, the acidification in our oceans has increased by 20 % since the Industrial Revolution. When we talk about de-oxygenation, we have today in our oceans four times as many dead zones – without any life, without any oxygen – as we had in 1960. Things are becoming very urgent in all the oceans, but in some areas more than others. Unfortunately, I myself come from the Mediterranean and my heart aches that the Mediterranean – we always say we are different, yes, we are different, but for me the idea of difference should be being different in a positive way, not being different in the sense that we are worse than the other regions. Mr Wałęsa, I agree about the resilience of nature too, because it is very resilient, but nature has to be given a chance. Renata Briano also spoke about the endemic nature and importance of this species to the Mediterranean Sea. We talk about the importance that this species has in the Mediterranean Sea, but unfortunately it is also affected by global threats as well, such as climate change, acidification, temperature increase, eutrophication and so on. I want to mention also what Maria Rodríguez said, because in the Mediterranean this year we came up with the MedFish4Ever declaration where we had all the countries of the Mediterranean for the very first time, all of them signing a declaration, and the declaration refers to the importance and the urgency of protecting not just the fishing species but also paid special attention to the Mediterranean’s biodiversity where Posidonia is included. It is a first step in the Mediterranean because commitment alone is not enough; signing and committing is important, but the most important thing is when it comes to delivery. We have to make certain that what the Mediterranean countries have committed to, they implement. Rosa D’Amato rightly mentioned the negative economic aspects if we are not looking after our seas from a biodiversity aspect as well. Rosa also mentioned renewable energy and this is also something which I have been pulling and pushing for quite some time, because the oceans can be one of our best allies when it comes to renewable energy. When we talk about renewable energy, very often we only think about solar and wind, but we have to start looking, and I have to say with pleasure that Europe is also already looking, at alternative energy coming from the oceans, tides, waves, currents so on and so forth. Human actions were mentioned by Ms Dubravka Şuica and I agree that we are testing our oceans and seas beyond their limits. When we talk about human actions, we should also include factors like climate change because after all climate change is also the result of human actions. Mr Caputo again mentioned that these are resistant species, but they too have their limits, and we have to look not just at the individual effects of all the threats that we have been mentioning, but we have to look at the accumulated effect of all the threats, when you have climate change working along with eutrophication, working along with acidification, working along with overfishing and illegal fishing and so on.  Mr Eck – and I will stop here – mentioned the importance of acting now, and for me this is a priority, because acting and acting together is not enough unless we are going to start acting now. I believe that there is a lot of awareness out there, but unfortunately the urgency is not there. Why am I talking about the urgency? Because I believe that things are moving much faster than we thought.  If I give you an example of the Great Barrier Reef, only 20 years ago scientists were putting the first questions about whether the Great Barrier Reef would take on the effects of climate. It was just a question, and later on they said that by 2050 the reefs would be feeling and having the negative effects of climate change. That was supposed to happen in 2050. Today, we are already seeing that half of the Great Barrier Reef is already dead, 30 years before 2050. We have to act, but we also have to act faster. I also agree with Mr Marias, because this is a species that takes a very long time to grow but you can destroy it in a few moments. With regard to the questions that were raised by Mr Marias, I have taken this on board and I believe that we have sent the information needed. If not, I will check again with my colleagues and make certain that you get the information because I remember that you raised it here.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 167, "date": "2017-11-13.json", "name": "Przewodniczący. –", "mepid": "23768", "text": "Thank you very much, Commissioner!I believe that I will express the opinion of everyone in this House that it is rare for a Commissioner to respond in response to every question raised or every opinion expressed.You did it and we appreciate it very much, although you have outlined a vision that glaciers may disappear, that the oceans may run out of oxygen.After22.00 is not good to go to sleep with such a vision.But that's how we fell out in the debate.I close the debate.Written declarations (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 168, "date": "2017-11-13.json", "name": "Carolina Punset (ALDE)", "mepid": "90110", "text": "written. - The «Posidonia oceanica» meadows are the most important Mediterranean forest by extension, CO2 fixation functions, great biodiversity, housing more than 400 species of fingerlings, most of them fishable or due to their great oxygenation capacity.

Europe has significant demographic challenges and next year, 2018, is a year where we are going to face fundamental negotiations, and this Parliament will have to take a political position on this. We will face debates such as the new budgetary framework of the Union and what are the new Structural Funds Regulations. On both issues, it is essential that there is a political position from this Parliament to determine how we deal with the depopulation processes in the European Union. And I am satisfied with the result of the debate and the vote in the Committee on Regional Development on this report, because it raises fundamental issues and we have managed to position ourselves on issues that I think are important in tackling the depopulation processes. First, the establishment of a legal framework. It is essential that we have the possibility of a legal framework defining which are the territories with depopulation processes that have to be addressed as a priority to be able to solve the problems we are facing at the moment. Also in this report we propose that there are budget items in all the Structural Funds Regulations in order to face the challenges faced by regions with depopulation processes. There is an issue that is fundamental and that we have been raising for a long time, and that it is important that it has been reflected in this report, and that is that the GDP, the gross domestic product, is not the only criterion when taking into account or establishing the distribution of funds. And this is a fundamental question. And I say that it is a fundamental question because GDP, being a fundamental and important criterion, cannot be the only one. Other criteria must be taken into account, such as these depopulation processes, aging, dispersion, the rural environment, fundamental issues, because if not, we will find European regions that are the richest in all of Europe, but have no population. on which to launch the operational programs of the Structural Funds. And coordination between the different funds is necessary. Coordination between the Structural Funds, between the common agricultural policy, investment funds, and so on is a fundamental issue. We have to face the masculinization of the rural environment. We have to implement public service policies in rural areas, which are fundamental. The austerity policy has done a lot of damage to our society, but especially to the rural environment, because when we eliminate a teacher from a school in a city it is important, but when we eliminate him from the rural environment we are closing schools. That is why it is essential to make rural spaces attractive spaces so that young men and women can decide to create your future.We don't have much time: the rural environment is dying;We are closing the towns, they will disappear if we are not able to implement committed policies from the European Union to fight against the processes of depopulation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 171, "date": "2017-11-13.json", "name": "Csaba Sógor (PPE).", "mepid": "39724", "text": "- President!

But allow me as a woman, as a Commissioner, to say that it is inadmissible to have such a speech and to hear such a speech against women in the most democratic House of the European Union. I know your point of view about women. We are not weak, we are not stupid. We are women and we are on an equal footing with you, with all of you. (Applause and cries of ‘Bravo!’) So, above all I would like to warmly thank you for this report prepared by Ms García Pérez. I am very grateful to you for your energy in raising awareness of this important issue of the population of the European Union, and I also want to congratulate you for replying to these kinds of speeches. I was in Poland and I know the reactions in Poland. The Polish people thanked me for taking the floor and I said that this is unacceptable in the 21st century to say that women are stupid, weak. We are not per kilogramme here, Mr! (Referring to Korwin-Mikke)  Your report reminds us of the wide variations in the demographic trends between and within Member States. Already today, many areas in Europe face serious challenges with important social and economic consequences. You know very well that I visited some parts of the depopulated areas in Spain, as well as in northern Europe. I really think this is a very important topic and we have to be very serious. We have a lot of studies showing that population change is determined by the age structure of the population – mortality, fertility and the balance between inward and outward migration. It is not about women staying at home and making children. It is about the economy, it is about families: it is for a better life that they go out because, as you said here, they have no opportunities and not enough investment, not enough means for a better life. So these kinds of thing evolve very slowly, and as a result demographic trends also evolve slowly, including at the regional level.  So it is our duty with public policies to take these changes into account and, as you already said, the Cohesion Policy already contains many provisions to address the specific needs of geographical areas suffering from severe and permanent natural and demographic handicaps. Measures identified by Member States show a variety of responses to demographic challenges. However, whatever actions you take, they might be taken having inclusion and equality as a precondition. And this in turn means providing essential infrastructures such as child care, health care and long-term care facilities. Another important question to address is the integration of migrants across Europe, and I am very grateful that you have included this because it is a challenge that was not foreseen but which we have to face these days. As the report indicates, we must support Member States by reinforcing measures to tackle this issue. You have already underlined here that it is our responsibility to ensure that all migrants are integrated, and this means that they can fully participate in all aspects of our societies and communities, be it social or economic. At the end of the day this is clearly a win-win situation. For one thing, the alternative is unthinkable. Exclusion in any form breeds resentment, confrontation, extremism and sometimes violence. Integration, on the other hand, is a promise of stability and of peace, not to mention the economic contribution that migrants, usually young people, can bring to an ageing population. I believe that the European Union funds, including the Cohesion Policy, can and should provide opportunities for Member States to support such integration measures. In her report Ms García Pérez also touches on, and I saw that many Members touched on, GDP and the possibility of having new indicators to allocate cohesion policy funding. I agree with all of you that GDP alone does not accurately enough reflect the needs of a region, as it leaves out crucial parameters such as quality of life, social inclusion, level of employment or sustainable development. This is why, to complement GDP, the Commission is investigating other indicators, including demographic change. Regarding the new ex ante conditionality on national strategies for demographic development, I will be very honest with you. You know very well that, at the level of political groups, we are all reflecting on how to reduce the overall number of ex ante conditionalities and simplify the mechanism of accession to the European funds. Ex ante conditionalities have proved to be the most effective mechanism to ensure the right framework for investment, but at the same time they are a burden for beneficiaries, and I am of the opinion that we should be careful not to overload the Cohesion Policy with too many conditions. Anyhow, after this very fruitful debate, and listening carefully to your interventions, I am more than ever convinced that cohesion policy cannot tackle demographic change in the EU through a one-size-fits-all approach. Some regions will face sharp population decline while others will experience steady population growth. Demographic changes in the EU therefore call for a differentiated approach. We need to ensure policy coherence and flexibility to address this specific situation, and this can only be done through close cooperation with local and regional authorities.

These demographic imbalances affect both urban and rural areas, and migration trends to more developed regions have led to population movements resulting in depopulation of poorer areas. In this context, investment through cohesion policy and the common agricultural policy has given priority to poorer regions and rural areas. The aim was to strengthen infrastructure, access to services, encourage investment in rural areas and, in particular, attract young people to the agricultural sector, with some positive results. Therefore, demographic change should be a priority in the revision of the regulations of the funds that finance the reduction of territorial disparities.

Demographic change is a decades-long social problem with many and varied causes, and therefore requires an interdisciplinary approach and approach. It is indisputable that the fight against depopulation must be one of the objectives of cohesion policy. In many cases, it is the economically disadvantaged regions that are being hit repeatedly by an aging population, the emigration of young people of working age and a negative natural increase. Cohesion policy, while retaining its fundamental role, can also make an effective contribution to achieving demographic goals. At the same time, it is unfortunate that migration is mentioned in the report as a possible solution to reverse Europe's declining population. I believe that it is completely wrong to think that European regions that are lagging behind should catch up with migration measures. On this issue, immigration policy cannot be placed before active family policy. Rather, the EU should look for answers on how to revitalize the traditional family model and how to promote family-building and family support measures at EU level.

The declining population calls for a rethink of Member States' policies and the search for appropriate responses. Many Western European countries think, as is reflected in the report under discussion, that it is possible and desirable to offset the decline in their countries' populations through immigration. We in Hungary do not agree with this. We believe that immigration involves many risks (such as security policy), integration is difficult, and in most cases ineffective, leading to the emergence of parallel societies. We can expect a solution to the demographic crisis by increasing the level of family benefits and focusing on families and their children. The Hungarian government is working to encourage as many people as possible to take home and start a large family.

It is right that the report calls for the EU to integrate demographic aspects and family support into all policy areas, but I cannot agree that the greatest burden of tackling demography should lie on the shoulders of cohesion policy. Cohesion policy is a privileged and effective instrument that helps to balance the economic levels of countries and regions in the EU and leads to the overall convergence of the Union. If we look at the demographic map of the Union (proportion of citizens over the age of 65), it is clear that in the foreseeable future the demographic problem affects more richer EU countries than those with lower GDP levels, and it is clear that the richer countries they can solve themselves. The demographic criterion would weaken the current GDP criterion. In the long run (measured by today's birth rate), the problem, with a few exceptions, affects almost everyone in the EU and should therefore be addressed horizontally using various instruments.

The countryside is being depopulated and some cities receive population without being able to absorb it adequately. This leads to less availability of public services in rural areas and to an overload of them in cities. The consequences are dire, socially and environmentally. Let us remember that the fires suffered in Spain and Portugal a few weeks ago are a consequence of the neglect of rural areas. Fewer services in rural areas imply more emigrants to cities that cannot absorb them; and thus in a spiral cycle very difficult to contain. All of this is avoidable, with adequate policies, which are certainly not the ones the Union is applying. An example is the CAP, which only favors large landowners and penalizes small farmers, which is one of the major causes of rural depopulation. The countryside and cities need each other, they are interdependent. Let us change the productive model, favor small businesses and farmers and guarantee quality public services that allow the rural population to be established; This will bring a better quality of life in cities and in the countryside, desirable environmental conditions and a greater distribution of wealth.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 192, "date": "2017-11-13.json", "name": "Przewodniczący. –", "mepid": "23768", "text": "The next item on the agenda is the brief presentation of the report by Olli Ludvigsson, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Retail Financial Services Action Plan (2017/2066 (INI) (A8-0326 / 2017).", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 193, "date": "2017-11-13.json", "name": "Olle Ludvigsson", "mepid": "96673", "text": "rapporteur. - Mr President! EU financial services markets for individuals and small businesses are still underdeveloped. Therefore, it is important that the Commission now does its utmost to complete the work on the Capital Markets Union, where the deepening of the internal market for financial services is a cornerstone. It will be interesting to follow what concrete measures the Commission is actually proposing until 2019. At the same time, there are no measures for most of the issues raised by Parliament in the Green Paper on Financial Services. There is still a lack of a holistic approach with the aim of increasing transparency, promoting growth and innovation, reducing the high fees for private pension insurance, mutual funds and other financial services. Digitization will increasingly change consumer behavior and the financial markets. Therefore, our legal framework needs to be adapted at a rapid pace in order to remove cross-border barriers in order to strengthen our European fintech companies in global competition. In my report, I therefore call on the Commission to examine the possibility of introducing a 29th financial services system. We must also address direct deviations in the functioning of the internal market. For example, banks today can cancel debit and credit cards for EU citizens who choose to move to another Member State. Clear EU rules are needed here, which give the national supervisory authorities the power to act against banks. If we are to seriously breathe new life into European cooperation, citizens need to feel that the Union is constantly working to remove obstacles to internal mobility, as we did with the roaming charge. In the future, it needs to be easier for consumers to change financial service providers. That is why I would like to call on the Commission to present a specific legislative proposal that counteracts so-called geoblocking of financial services in the internal market. In the slightly longer term, the Commission will need to present a proposal for a pan-European electronic identification system. With regard to the concrete measures taken by the Commission, I think it is a good idea to propose an amendment to the Regulation on cross-border payments in order to ensure equal charges for cross-border payments and national payments for currencies other than the euro. Another issue is that of 'dynamic currency conversion', which means that consumers today have the choice to pay in euros or in their national currency when paying and withdrawing abroad. It usually becomes more expensive for customers to pay in their national currency. Customers need clear information and preferably an overview of which choice is the most advantageous at each time of purchase and at each ATM withdrawal. With regard to the Commission's statement on developing the internal market for consumer credit, I believe that it is very important to develop effective measures at the same time to counteract over-indebtedness in households. That is why I believe it is necessary to develop an EU credit rating system. I am convinced that we need to see more jobs and increased growth in today's Europe to curb today's expressions of dissatisfaction. With your own income, more people can save in simple and secure financial services to create a better life in the future. In this way, we can ensure a fairer Europe for all.

I think it is a most welcome expression of Parliament’s strong support for the deepening of the single market in retail financial services. We also think that a single market for retail financial services which can rely on innovative solutions is very welcome. To get there we need: first, to increase consumer trust and empower consumers; second, to reduce legal and regulatory obstacles for businesses when offering services across borders; and, third, to support digital innovation in financial services for the benefit of consumers. We are moving fast to implement our Action Plan. At the beginning of 2018 we expect to come forward with a legislative proposal to lower the charges on all cross-border payments throughout the European Union, in particular for non-EU countries. To achieve this, we propose to expand the scope of the Cross-border Payments Regulation and we welcome your support on this. This is particularly important for our fellow citizens from countries which are outside the euro zone. To support the provision of financial services across borders, we will also aim to facilitate the cross-border use of electronic identification. The reality is that more and more Europeans are living and working in an EU country that is not their own. Highly mobile citizens need a means of electronic identification, allowing banks to know their customers wherever they may reside in the European Union. We will bring together the required expertise on e—identification and anti-money laundering to make sure that providers of financial services can work with customers all over Europe.  Lower transaction costs and e—identification across borders are key to empowering consumers. It is a way to help them take advantage of the best financial services that are available all across the European Union. But we also need more market transparency. Therefore we will promote high quality standards of websites which allow to consumers to compare various offers. Moreover, we will investigate any barriers that may prevent consumers from switching to better offers. This will also put us in a better position to assess the possible benefits of additional European product regimes, as suggested in your report. Along the same lines, we will explore ways to facilitate access to loans across borders. We will also address in a more efficient manner the over-indebtedness of consumers linked to credit activities. We will seek to introduce common standards to assess the capacity to take out a loan. We will also reflect on the common principles for lending.  Thank you all for your interventions. This report and our discussion confirm that we share the same vision, namely that the European Union must ensure that all European cities have equal access to financial services of the highest quality. We should always remember that consumers are, first and foremost, citizens. This means that we need to put in place a framework capable of preventing any abusive or opaque practices. It also means providing innovative solutions to overcome any obstacle, whether legal or behavioural, that might unfairly hinder consumers. This is precisely what our Action Plan is about: achieving a single market in consumer financial services that is transparent, fair and innovative. The European Union cannot afford to lag behind on this matter.  Let me conclude by mentioning another key enabler of a deeper single market for financial services, FinTech. The Action Plan referred to our internal task force and the public consultation on FinTech. In early 2018 we will present the fruits of this work and table a FinTech Action Plan. It will offer a vision for a technology-driven and globally competitive financial sector.
