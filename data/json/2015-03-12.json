The sea bass stock in the southern North Sea, the English Channel, the Celtic Sea and the Irish Sea has been declining rapidly since 2012 and will, according to scientific advice, approach its historically lowest level in 2016. The concrete proposals in your motion for a resolution to establish a coordinated approach to the management of sea bass are therefore very important. For the past three years the Commission has worked very hard to broker an agreement between Member States on improved management of this stock. In 2012 the Commission proposed the introduction of total allowable catch (TAC) and has had ongoing discussions with Member States. Unfortunately Member States were unable to agree, mainly because they could not agree on how to share the TAC between them. Last November the Commission proposed alternative management measures, notably limiting the number of days at sea, freezing the number of licences for commercial fishermen and limiting the daily catches for recreational fishermen, all to contain fishing pressure on the stock. Again the Council was not able to come to an agreement on the Commission’s proposal. Considering the state of the resources and the urgency of the situation, the Commission has subsequently decided to take temporary emergency measures for pelagic vessels targeting spawning aggregations of sea bass as part of a response to the state of the stock. These emergency measures are the first element in a package of envisaged measures which the Commission plans to be adopted for the management of sea bass in 2015. The second element in this package is a Commission proposal to limit the catches of recreational anglers to three fish per angler per day. Recreational fishermen produce a quarter of all landings of sea bass and it is therefore important and justified that they contribute to decreasing the pressure on this stock. This proposal is now with the Council, which is looking very favourably at the proposal. The adoption of these rules by the Council is scheduled for 16 March. The Commission is currently discussing the third element of the package with the Member States concerned. This would cover several parts of the commercial sector which also impact on sea bass. It may take the form of catch limits. Once this initial package is in place, and in order to rebuild the stock, we are envisaging including sea bass in the multiannual plan for the Western Atlantic quotas, as foreseen under the new common fisheries policy (CFP).  We fully agree with you that in the preparation of such plans we need to consult all stakeholders, build on their knowledge and ensure a fair approach. We will also need to integrate the latest scientific advice on sea bass in the preparation of that plan.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2015-03-12.json", "name": "Alain Cadec", "mepid": "96849", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Mr President, Commissioner, I thank you for your words. As you rightly pointed out, the state of the bar stock is a concern. The European Union must react and put in place coherent management measures. The European Commission has recently, as you said, taken emergency measures to close the pelagic trawl fishery from 26 January to 30 April, i.e. during the spawning period. These emergency measures are temporary and are not intended to be extended. We must therefore, now, prepare for the future and take a long-term view. I have therefore decided to propose, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, a resolution containing proposals for sustainable management of the bar. We call for a multi-year management plan at European level, in line with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy. This plan will need to be based on sound and scientific advice. This requires an accurate assessment of the status of the stock and its delimitation, as well as the migrations of the species and the precise breeding sites. The resolution therefore calls on the Commission and member states to build on the European Fund for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, which provides for significant funding for the collection of scientific data. It is also necessary to accurately assess the share of the different trades fishing the bar as well as the share of recreational fishing in these catches. We need this information to make relevant decisions. When we work on a management plan on the bar, we will have to look at the different types of measures that are possible. Several options are possible, as you have just said, for example: the establishment of an all-eligible catch total (TAC), the introduction of a minimum landing size or the establishment of biological rest periods during spawning, among others.  These are, at this stage, only options and it will be up to the legislature to make decisions in the light of scientific advice. I would like to take this opportunity to remind the Council that management plans are entirely part of the codecision procedure. A management plan on the bar must take into account commercial fishing, but also recreational fishing, as you said, which accounts for almost a quarter of the catch. The introduction of quantitative limitations for this fishery seems to me to be necessary. The measures to be taken must be prepared by closely involving all the players in the bar fishery, in a spirit of compromise. Advisory boards will have an important role to play in this regard. The management of the bar is everyone's business. It is together that we will find solutions to protect this beautiful species while preserving the activity of those who live by it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2015-03-12.json", "name": "Ulrike Rodust", "mepid": "93624", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group.

I would have preferred that we in the Committee on Fisheries had had a good debate and weighed up all the odds and cons. The shortcut we're making now is actually a little too short.  You can also see this in the content of the resolution, because when I read that there should be a quota for the sea bass, I do not think that this is a good management mechanism for the sea bass. For many cutter fishermen, sea bass is really a fluke, and if we come up with a quota, it will bring a lot of political strife and red tape, whereas we want to reduce the bureaucratic pressure for fishing.

As is well known, we are very critical of this approach. This resolution begins by considering – and well – the lack of scientific information on sea bass, and calls on the Commission and the Member States to carry out an assessment of the appeal.

Undoubtedly, the issue of sea bass, as put out in the resolution proposed by our colleague Alain Cadec, is in fact an early warning about the sustainability of multiannual plans. I understand the attractiveness of this species of fish for the whole fishing industry, for artisanal fishing, for sport fishing, and I believe that we need to ensure a balance between the sustainability of resources, stocks, and the need for fishing, which brings us so many jobs. However, this ban, which will run until 30 April 2015, does not, in my opinion, resolve the issue of the sustainability of multiannual plans. We must find quick solutions, together with the Member States, to unblock this deadlock in the Council, and I must remind the Council that, during this period, on the basis of disputes over Article 43 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Court of Justice has decided to give justice to the European Parliament and the Commission. The fact that this decision has been reached means that Parliament's vision of the common fisheries policy is a fair one, which concerns both concrete fishing opportunities and the need to pursue an appropriate legislative procedure. I believe that, in the case of multiannual plans, we are in exactly this situation revealed by the Court of Justice of the European Union.

The sea bass, which is one of our most magnificent predatory fish, is heavily depleted. Today, the fishing mortality rate for sea bass is four times higher than the level that could ensure maximum sustainable yield, MSY. We are talking about a fish that grows very slowly and does not become sexually mature until the age of four to seven.  The International Maritime Fisheries Council (ICES) warns that a management plan should be put in place as soon as possible and that fishing should be reduced by 80%. Today, sea bass catches are not regulated at all in the EU. There are no limits on the maximum allowable catch, nor are there any quotas. The basically only restriction that is in commercial fishing is a minimum limit of 36 cm. However, it is not only commercial fishing that is carried out. It is estimated that as much as 25% of catches are made in recreational fishing. The Council has not been able to agree on measures. Instead, the Commission has had to pull the emergency brake and stop parts of trawling until the end of April. It is high time to take responsibility for the situation before it is too late. The Commission should develop a draft management plan as soon as possible. That management plan should reasonably take into account all fishing of sea bass, both commercially and recreationally.

The operative word you are using is ‘exploitation’. That is all you are interested in. Eleven years ago, the British Government banned pair trawling for bass. Our then Fisheries Minister asked the French Government to do likewise. They refused. We went to the Commission to ask for a ban. The Commission refused. So our fishermen halted pair trawling – and the French, with the connivance of the European Union, simply took our fish from our waters, and now you have the nerve to punish our fishermen and sea anglers for your own crimes. The common fisheries policy, based as it is on outright naked theft of natural resources by giant businesses under the protection of the EU, is an unmitigated economic, ecological and environmental catastrophe.

We are all aware that hundreds of artisanal fishermen rely solely on bass fishing to survive and that they do not also have the possibility of switching fisheries easily. But we cannot lose sight of the view that, apart from professional fishermen, sea bass, by a very important percentage, is the subject of recreational fishing. Taking action, apart from those taken as an emergency for the pelagic fleet, becomes essential and it must be regretted that Member States have not been able to reach an agreement to ensure the recovery of populations.

I would, however, like to add a point concerning the need for parallel intensive communication and dissemination to the European population on the responsible consumption of this species and beyond. Indeed, if demand remains high because consumers prefer this species exclusively or as a matter of priority over other stocks of sea bass in non-EU waters, they risk being overexploited, thus not achieving the objective of this resolution.

In my region, the south-west of England, many of the recreational fishing boats are actually crewed and owned by fishermen, either doing it on the days when they are not able to go to sea because of EU conservation rules or because they have moved out of fishing altogether.

However, I think that all these measures will be too harsh if this commercialisation is not treated more rationally, and I am aware, of course, that this is an important industry.

I am honoured to present to you now the EU priorities for the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, which resumed its work last week.  This debate gives us the opportunity to publicly renew our commitment to a strong multilateral human rights system. The European Union has been a staunch supporter of the Human Rights Council from the very beginning, and over the years we have contributed to strengthening its capacity to address violations and to promote greater respect for human rights all over the world. For this reason, it was particularly important for the Vice—President / High Representative to participate in this high level segment last week. Her presence in Geneva, together with the EU Special Representative Stavros Lambrinidis, was meant to remind the world, but also ourselves, of the great importance which is accorded to human rights in EU foreign policy. She also wanted to give voice to the work that the EU does and which this House does to uphold human rights worldwide.  The Council is the place where the gravest human rights violations are publicly condemned and where new partnerships can be forged with countries from all regions to take resolute action to prevent and respond to human rights violations and abuses, and to fight discrimination and violence.  Unavoidably, the debate in Geneva is very much focused on the many human rights crises resulting from ongoing conflict or fragility. Your resolution refers to a number of them, and they correspond to the situations that the Vice—President/High Representative highlighted at the Council last week. Firstly, the EU condemns the serious deterioration of the human rights situation in Ukraine, where the price paid by the civilian population is simply appalling – almost 6 000 people have been killed and twice as many have been injured – and where the Tatar community in Crimea is persecuted and journalists and the media are intimidated. Together with partners, the EU strongly calls for an end to violations and abuses, for respecting international human rights and human rights law, for granting safe passage and for allowing the release of hostages and detained persons.  The EU supports the work done by the UN Human Rights monitoring mission in Ukraine, which is documenting violations and will guarantee the accountability of those who have perpetrated them, and calls for unimpeded access to the mission to Crimea.  Secondly, in Syria, entire communities, women and children, are taken hostage both by a brutal regime and by ruthless terrorist groups who wage a war under the false pretence of protecting their religion. The EU supports the work of the Commission of Inquiry set up by the Human Rights Council since we know from experience that restoring justice to the victims of atrocities is crucial to achieving sustainable peace and reconciliation. Moreover, where impunity prevails, there we find disaffection and alienation – feelings which are exploited by extremists. The result is a spiral of violence and destruction which is difficult to control. This is why, when the time comes, we will support also the role of the ICC in addressing these violations.  Third, finally let me mention South Sudan, a country we will discuss afterwards and where the conflict spares no one, not even young children. Here the EU urges the African Union Peace and Security Council to consider the report of the African Union Commission of Inquiry. Again, justice and accountability are vital elements in the reconciliation process for the country.  Human rights are not only violated in situations of conflict. The EU also deems it important to shed light on long—standing and grave human rights violations or accompany countries in transition to democracy. Therefore, we again are a partner with Japan to bring international attention to human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea – a situation which the General Assembly last December, on our initiative, recommended to the attention of the UN Security Council with the request that it should consider a referral to the International Criminal Court. Like you, we have not forgotten the situation in Myanmar/Burma where progress has been made indeed but where, at the same time, we continue to be concerned about the inter—communal violence towards the Roghingya and by the situation in conflict-affected areas and by the possible adoption of legislation on the protection of race and religion. Moreover, the European Union continues to work to bring attention to the rights of children, who are our future but who are all too often the first victims of conflict or crisis. We are the long-standing sponsor of resolutions on the rights of the child, both in Geneva and New York, and support in particular the protection of children from war, violence and abuse. Last, but not least, let me mention the EU’s commitment to freedom of religion or belief on which we are going to table a resolution at this session. We have also just hosted, on Tuesday 10 March 2015, a successful event with UN Special Rapporteur Bielefeldt on the timely subject of speaking out against acts of intolerance, discrimination and violence allegedly committed in the name of religion or belief. This is a complex phenomenon which requires a firm response by states, regional organisations, religious or belief communities, NGOs and by media representatives. Let me say in this respect that realising all human rights for all and fighting marginalisation, discrimination and intolerance is the European answer to radicalisation, violence and abuse. Before closing let me mention three issues of particular importance to this House. Firstly, as you rightly point out in your resolution, civil society representatives and human rights defenders experience harassment and imprisonment, threats and violence as well as restrictions on their activities in many countries around the world. The EU defends their space at the United Nations and raises their plight in bilateral dialogues. We now go beyond traditional diplomatic or political tools, together with the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Brazilian Permanent Mission to the United Nations, the Republic of Korea and Tunisia. In Geneva we have just launched an innovative social media campaign called ‘#I Defend’ making sure civil society has its voice. With this initiative we want to express support to, and solidarity with, human rights defenders and civil society representatives. Secondly, we must lead by example. Our collective commitment to the universal peer review or principal decision to cooperate with all special procedures of the United Nations are extremely important for our credibility and for the credibility of the Human Rights Council. This also means bringing human rights back home and vigorously working on our own shortcomings. In her speech in Geneva the High Representative has openly spoken about the challenge of migration and the EU’s commitment to better protect the human rights of migrants in the future through deeper cooperation among the EU Member States and support for the work of the UNHCR.  Third and finally, let me recall that the credibility of the UN human rights systems rests primarily on the independence and integrity of the Office of the High Commissioner. We must defend this independence by supporting the Office financially and by staving off attempts to place its activities under the scrutiny of Member States. I would like to thank you for this debate and for the recommendations regarding the EU priorities.

The Resolution has reached broad consensus among all the groups in this House, and I think it is therefore worth highlighting the European Parliament's effort to speak with a single voice in the context of the United Nations. In the world there is not a single day when millions of human beings are still persecuted; a single day when barbarism, bigotry, violence rest. There is not a single day when millions and millions of human beings are not deprived of all dignity. That's why we can't give in a millimeter in that fight for defending your rights. Without any relativism. Cultural relativism does not fit in the defence of human rights; religious relativism does not fit; gender relativism does not fit. And, of course, there is no need for commercial or economic relativism. Human rights must be vertebrates of our action abroad. Human rights have to stop being a utopia, to become a reality. We have a great responsibility. You cannot imagine how many people come to us with desperate emails and calls, so that we can make your voice heard in this House. And today I want to pay tribute to human rights defenders working in very difficult areas, journalists reporting from conflict zones, to activists who play their lives every day to defend the rights of all.

With regard to Russia, I would like to highlight one of which I consider to be great contributions to this document, which is to make clear an opposition from the European Parliament in this regard, because we are not only expressly condemning Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, but we also describe its policy as aggressive, expansionist and certainly a threat to Ukraine's unity and independence.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 37, "date": "2015-03-12.json", "name": "Marie-Christine Vergiat", "mepid": "96858", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL group. Mr President, how important are the sessions of the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) to this assembly? I wonder.  Once again, we are holding this debate at a time when the 28th session of the HRC is already well under way and many major reports have been adopted. Once again, the resolution before us ignores its agenda. However, it addresses issues that the European Union would be well advised to take into account, such as the situation in Eritrea or the effects of external debt on the full exercise of all human rights, while the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has just reminded us that economic, social and cultural rights have suffered from austerity policies, which have disproportionately affected the right of peoples to participate in decisions that affect their lives. Everything is said in this sentence.  But to be interested in it, to work on it, to make recommendations in this area would mean that we are also pointing the finger at the effects of European policies, both within the European Union and in its relations with third countries. So we are kicking in and sticking to generalities that are more in touch with the priorities of the Union than with those of the HRC, even if it means accentuating a \"lesson-giver\" side and fuelling cultural relativism. That is not our vision of multilateral relations, nor that of the United Nations. To hear you, Commissioner, I would like to add that I would have liked to hear, for Israel and Palestine, the same strong condemnation of the violation of international law as you have expressed for Ukraine. Just as I would have liked you to condemn with the same firmness what is happening in the Republic of Sudan, where civilian populations are being bombarded by the government of the day.

The annual resolution on the meeting of the Human Rights Council has once again become a successful policy recommendation to the EU delegation in Geneva. It contains demands as to what is to be achieved in the individual country resolutions, for example on Iran, North Korea, Myanmar and Egypt. In addition, we are taking up issues that are new or not yet so regularly and prominently on the agenda of the Human Rights Council, such as climate change and human rights. The Human Rights Council has already recognised the negative impact of climate change on the living conditions of many people, and it is advisable that the EU or the EU External Action Service also actively participate in the discussion to find a good definition of climate refugees. On the subject of armed drones and autonomous weapons, we call for the development of a common EU position on the conditions under which such weapons can be used while international humanitarian law is respected, and we call for a ban on the development, production and use of fully automatic weapons that can be used without human intervention. In the resolution, we criticise the fact that authoritarian states are increasingly competing for major international events in the field of sport and culture in order to bask in international splendour, while at the same time muzzled critical voices in the country. We must take this development seriously, and we hope that the EU will take up this issue. We need to have discussions with national and international sports federations, with companies and civil society. In concrete terms, this must already be done at the first European Games in Baku this year and also at the FIFA World Cup in Russia 2018 and in Qatar in 2022.

However, the Union's interest is to take a clear stand in favour of Bashar al-Assad, because it is for us a bulwark against the Islamic State. If his regime collapses, Syria will provide a backbone for the terrorists, who will use it to multiply attacks in Europe like the one against Charlie Hebdo.  The second example concerns Ukraine. The Union unequivocally condemns Russia and aligns its position with that of the United States. Mr Juncker even wants to create a European army against Russia.

I would like to go back to 1948, when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights came about as a lesson from world wars and annihilation. Since then, there has been a string of conventions to enable individuals to live free and equal in mutual respect for each other. Rights are universal and interdependent and should not depend on arbitrariness. The last declaration forbids us as individuals, as a group and as a state to act actively against its content. Today, despite the hope of previous generations that their mistakes will not be repeated, we are actively opposing human rights both inside and outside the Member States every day. The rights themselves are not guarantees. It is we humans who can give the guarantee. It is therefore up to us to live up to human rights. We must point out against increasing discriminatory laws and violations against people on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity in Europe and in the world. Human rights for women as well as for LGBTQ people, refugees, migrants and children are all equally fundamental to peace and democracy. Men's violence against women is one of the world's biggest security problems. Women's right to education and health, as well as sexual and reproductive rights, are fundamental human rights.

During previous plenary debates on this matter we highlighted the fact that Daesh poses a complex terrorist threat also for Europe. However, we must remember that Syrian and Iraqi citizens are truly on the front line. Daesh’s actions are horrific. The human rights abuses committed by them are increasing both in the number of victims and in atrocity. They include the vicious and barbaric murder of prisoners, abuses of the worst kind against children and women and the persecution of persons belonging to different religions, ethnic communities and vulnerable groups. The kidnapping of more than 200 Christian Assyrians in the Hassakeh region of Syria, at the end of February, is just the most recent in Daesh’s long list of brutal actions that may amount to more crimes and crimes against humanity according to the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria. All of this is in complete violation of international human rights law and goes directly against freedom of religion or belief, which includes the right for persons of all faiths to live and practise their religion freely, without fear of intolerance or attacks. In terms of numbers, the first victims of Daesh are Sunni Muslims. At the same time it is clear that Daesh poses a specific and more deliberate threat to minorities in the region, to Christians, but also to Yazidis, Shabakis and other groups. Let us be clear, Daesh’s actions jeopardise the survival of the multi—ethnic and multi—religious character of the Middle East, and the prospect for inclusive stability in the long—term. The European Union and its partners cannot tolerate this. We also denounce the attacks on, and destruction of, world heritage sites, and the illicit trafficking in cultural properties. This is why on numerous occasions we have expressed views and the determination to contain and defeat Daesh and to contribute as fully as possible, both at the individual level of Member States and the collective level of the EU, to the efforts of the global coalition. We believe that military action is essential, but not sufficient on its own. It is necessary to address the underlying violence in Syria and Iraq, which has given terrorist groups a foothold. It is the instability in Syria, caused by the Assad regime’s brutal war against its own people and the non—inclusive policies in Iraq, that has allowed Daesh to flourish. The Foreign Affairs Council should adopt shortly a new regional strategy on Syria and Iraq, as well as on the Daesh threat, based on the recent joint communication of the European Commission and the High Representative on the subject. A EUR 1 billion assistance package has been mobilised in support of the regional strategy, but it is important to secure additional financial support at bilateral and multilateral level to ensure that the response to the crisis meets the ever—increasing level of needs.

Every day that passes increases the risk of more intense conflict and worsens the already dreadful humanitarian and human rights situation of the long-suffering people of South Sudan. The recent abduction of a group of children in Wau Shilluk is yet another illustration of the complete disregard by all parties for international human rights law. The High Representative Vice-President has condemned them in the strongest possible words. Preventing and responding to violations against children affected by armed conflicts is a top priority for the European Union. We are working closely with Mrs Zerrougui, the UN Special Representative for children and armed conflict, and Unicef to end the use of children in combat. Our delegation in Juba is pressing both the government and opposition forces to release all children from the armed forces and to help them return to places of safety. The European Commission, through its humanitarian aid and civil protection department ECHO, provides funding to Unicef to support the reintegration of released child soldiers from the Cobra faction. Accountability for crimes committed in the course of the conflict is essential to ensure sustainable peace. The EU has called repeatedly for the publication of the African Union Commission of Inquiry report. This is an inquiry launched by the African Union itself and as such is an historic step to assume responsibility for the investigation of crimes perpetrated on the African continent. We look forward to hearing formally what recommendations the inquiry has to make. We believe that the human disaster wrought in South Sudan is the responsibility of its political and military leaders. They resorted to violence rather than debate. There are no alibis. Last week, the two principle protagonists in the civil war once again refused to make the mutual compromises required to reach an agreement that could pave the way for a comprehensive settlement of the conflict. In response, IGAD’s Chair, the Ethiopian Prime Minister, asked regional and international partners to work together to reinvigorate the peace process and agree a common approach. The EU stands ready to support IGAD in this endeavour. The EU Special Representative Alexander Rondos has already been active in supporting the IGAD-led negotiation process. The UN Security Council has also agreed a unanimous resolution creating a framework for sanctions against those who impede the peace process and persons who have committed war crimes. The EU agrees it is important to increase pressure on the parties without further delay. Let me conclude by stressing the following: it is essential that the warring parties in South Sudan put their own interests aside and instead reach a compromise in the interests of all citizens of South Sudan, the world’s youngest nation.

What is happening, in this particular case, is that companies from the United Arab Emirates have succeeded in acquiring specific areas and the illegal expulsion of the Masai from their territory has now begun.  They're supposed to be told they don't have documents proving ownership. But their ownership of the land results from the use, it arises from cultivation for at least five centuries. Therefore, they acquired rights. Property rights are also protected by the Human Rights Treaties. They must also be protected as a minority. Measures are needed to protect them!", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 136, "date": "2015-03-12.json", "name": "Ivan Jakovčić (ALDE).", "mepid": "124754", "text": "   \"Mr. President, this tragedy of the Masai people reminds me of those tragedies otherwise experienced by my Istrians.

This complex topic rightfully deserves our attention as it touches on issues that the European Union takes a keen interest in: human rights, rule of law and governance, and healthy and transparent business environment.  The phenomenon termed ‘land grabbing’ has different manifestations. Reports involving foreign investors or those threatening the livelihood of pastoralist communities have caused concerns. I refer to the most recent shocking case in Loliondo, Serengeti area, where park rangers and security forces burned the homes of Masai villagers, which affected 3 000 people. This was the latest episode in a longstanding conflict where the government’s authority to manage land use collides with the exercise of the pastoralist communities acquired customary rights.  The EU delegation and Member Statesʼ missions in Tanzania have consulted with the representatives of the pastoralist communities and they await the outcome of the investigation launched by district authorities. Land disputes are usually the result of complex and contrasting interests, weak legislation and administration, and poor dispute settlement mechanisms lead to conflicts that occasionally erupt with serious violations of human rights.  Tanzania has made commitments to improve land governance by signing up to the land transparency initiative launched by the G8 or by participating in the multilateral Open Government Partnership. We support these efforts and advocate for efficient and corruption—free land administration and law enforcement.  As we celebrated Women’s Day last Sunday, let me conclude by mentioning a special form of land grabbing that is often overlooked. Women in Africa are often denied ownership of land and lose it if their husband dies. In Tanzania, the EU supports a project promoting women’s ownership of land in densely populated areas. This contributes to a more equitable use of land and a more balanced growth, and ultimately to women’s empowerment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 140, "date": "2015-03-12.json", "name": "Przewodniczący. –", "mepid": "28372", "text": "   I close the debate.

For Skopje, which Greece does not recognise as an entity, the EU, instead of condemning Skopje's provocative and unsymotic attitude towards Greece expressed by the counterfeiting of history and the burning of the name of our Macedonia, is looking for ways to integrate the EU in the future, which finds me vertically opposed.

We think of the many more situations where freedoms to associate, to speak freely, and to report events have been withheld to the detriment of democracy and decency. And in my own constituency, I think of the efforts being made to eliminate the freedom to confer with one’s conscience in the running of private business.

Our experience, which has been created over the centuries as a result of painful conflicts and difficult transformations, should set an example for other regions of the world.

This resolution presents a lying view of the political and social situation in Venezuela, misrepresenting facts, omitting events, in a register of hatred that seeks to justify the systematic interference and aggression that the US and EU have imposed on the Venezuelan people. The systematic attempts to destabilise social destabilization and overthrow elected governments in successive electoral acts are hypocritically omitted, in deep contempt for popular will and democracy, notably through US-funded orchestrated operations such as Operation JERICHO or the La Salida Plan, where the far right takes a leading role, alongside the millions of dollars to finance political parties and anti-government organizations. The reality surrounding events such as the arrest of António Ledezma (preemptively arrested not for being mayor but for inciting and participating in coup smear sprees against the democratic constitutional regime) is adulterated, while the violent clashes in the streets permanently promoted by reactionary forces since 2014, which resulted in the deaths of dozens of people and hundreds of wounded, are forgotten. It suppresses the significant social development that is underway in that country – increased social investment, significant reduction of extreme poverty and malnutrition – at a pace that few, if any of the countries of the signatories of this resolution, will be able to follow.

Venezuelan intelligence arbitrarily detained the opposition leader, the democratically elected mayor of the city of Caracas, Antonio Ledezmo, on 19 February 2015, with no evidence that he had committed a crime, nor had an arrest warrant. Members have called for his immediate release, as well as the release of all peaceful protesters, students and other opposition leaders who have been detained for exercising their right to free expression at protests in 2014. We condemned the execution of seven students in Venezuela. Opposition leaders in Venezuela have been accused in the past of allegedly planning coups without evidence. The intimidation and harsh treatment of opposition leaders and students has intensified, suggesting that fundamental rights and freedoms mean less and less, and even the upcoming elections could be at risk.
