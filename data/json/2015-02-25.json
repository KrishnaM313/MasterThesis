It was extremely important for me to come to the Parliament as soon as the decision was taken in order to deliver this message to you and, through you, to the European citizens. Energy is indispensable. It is the lifeblood of our citizens’ livelihoods and of our economy, yet we have all grown used to paying high energy bills as if it were a fact of life. We have got used to the current threats to our energy supply in winter, and all of us have got used to the threats of global climate change. Yet not nearly enough has been done to really tackle these issues. Today we are taking a big step towards an energy market that is economically sustainable, socially inclusive and environmentally friendly: an energy market that is integrated, interconnected, resilient and secure. It is a triple-win strategy, because it will benefit citizens, businesses and the environment. Let me highlight four main characteristics of the Energy Union. First, the Energy Union, like the European project itself, is based on trust and solidarity. Over the past decades, Member States have come to rely on each other in numerous fields. It is time we also applied the same principle in our energy markets. Member States should in all circumstances know that they can rely on their neighbours, especially when confronted or threatened with supply disruptions. Second, the Energy Union should deliver a free flow of energy across Europe as if it were a fifth freedom. The strategy we have adopted is the most ambitious European energy project since the European Coal and Steel Community. It has the potential to boost Europe’s integration project in the way the Coal and Steel Community did in the 1950s, and it should remind citizens – and also our companies – of the great potential of the common European market. A century ago, when electricity grids were laid in Europe, they were interconnecting regions across the nations. We now have to do the same at European level. We will integrate the 28 European energy markets into one. We will come forward with new legislation to strengthen the European regulatory framework, a necessity if we want to continue to increase cross-border energy flows. We will speed up critical infrastructure projects and monitor them much better because, without this hardware, we will have an internal energy market only on paper. We will encourage and assist Member States to phase out uncoordinated national policies that distort the functioning of the market, and we will produce, every two years, a report on how energy prices are composed, creating more transparency and a better functioning of the market. Energy prices are a real issue for our consumers but equally for the competitiveness of our industry. Thirdly, the Energy Union puts energy efficiency first. We have to fundamentally rethink energy efficiency and treat it as an energy source in its own right. We will come forward with new legislation on electricity market design, and this will ensure that energy efficiency can compete on equal terms with generation capacity. We will promote better access to financing instruments for energy efficiency in the transport and building sectors, notably at local level, and we will encourage Member States to give energy efficiency primary consideration in their own policies. Fourthly, the Energy Union will make our energy system fit for the future – fit for a low-carbon and sustainable economy, an energy system that is driven by renewable sources and in which citizens, cooperatives and local communities can play a much more active role. Consumer empowerment is a key word in this regard. I am convinced that, as a world leader once said, the nation that leads the world in creating new energy sources will lead the 21st-century global economy. I would like Europe to be among these leaders. Europe has all the right elements to be a global leader, a global hearth for developing the next generation of technically advanced renewables. We will better focus our research and innovation policy like storage and electromobility, and we will ensure better coordination between Member States and the EU’s innovation programmes and financing schemes, not only because it sustains our climate policy – the most ambitious worldwide – but also because it offers great growth opportunities for our industry and for job creation here in Europe. New business sectors, new business models and new job profiles will emerge, and to achieve this vision in the future we need to start acting now. That is why today we adopted a concrete plan with 15 action points that translate the Energy Union into concrete deliverables. Today the Commission has set out its vision and its actions to make it happen. Yet the real work starts now. This work has directly involved 14 Commissioners, from energy and transport to research and the digital agenda. They all have contributed their ideas and different perspectives over the last month. This has been a real team effort and I am very proud of that collective approach. As the Vice-President in charge of this Energy Union project, I will continue to work, under the guidance of President Juncker, with all of them and make sure that all parts of the Commission work together. We have to make sure that our actions are coherent and consistent. I will therefore start developing without delay the robust governance framework that the Energy Union needs in order to deliver on its promises. I can already announce that, building on all the expertise we have in the House, the DGs and the Joint Research Centre, I intend to present, before the end of this year, the first edition of the annual State of the Energy Union. There is no time to waste. We need such an instrument in order to constantly monitor where we make progress and where we have to speed up our work. I am, of course, looking forward to coming here to present it to you, the Members of the European Parliament.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission's presentation of the Energy Union Strategy was highly anticipated, because more than ever we need clearer and more robust European energy and climate policies. Jean-Claude Juncker had announced it as one of the major projects of this new Parliament, and the proposal before us today is certainly a very important step forward in responding to the challenges facing Europe. These challenges are numerous: the internal energy market, which is not sufficiently integrated, a high price of gas, which weakens our European industry and contributes to high energy costs for our fellow citizens, a fragile international context and growing uncertainties among investors. We must therefore mobilise to make the Energy Union a success and a bridge towards achieving the objectives that the European Union has set itself, both for the reduction of greenhouse gases and, above all, for our competitiveness and the necessary re-industrialisation of the European Union. Security of supply - as you mentioned - is paramount and the European Union provides 53% of the energy it consumes. Recent events in Ukraine therefore require us to be vigilant and to promote greater energy independence. To do this, we need to use all the different energy sources available in a complementary way, with a market-based approach. This energy security also requires, above all, the achievement of a more integrated internal energy market, with better interconnections, and I welcome the European Commission's willingness to do so.  In addition, the European Commission must strongly encourage Member States to apply existing rules before adding additional rules. Energy efficiency must be at the heart of our concerns to avoid waste. It's fundamental. We must not abandon millions of European citizens who live in energy insecurity. Research and innovation must also be supported in this area. Precisely, the energy transition offers us this opportunity to use different sources of energy. I will end by saying that we have a construction site here, really, and that you can count on us, Commissioner, to accompany you on this project.

It is not only a plan but a strategy. I think it is the very first time that we have had that sort of strategy. We could not have imagined having it in a earlier Commission. I think it is very important. The plan is not only yours, Commissioner, but comes from different Commissioners. It is a holistic approach which makes it extremely important. It is now the place and time to put the patchwork of 28 different Member States and different energy policies behind us, like in 1951 when we had the European Coal and Steel Community which was the basis of the European Union, of economic progress and peace. Today I very much hope that the European solar and wind community will transform our economy into a sustainable and carbon-free economy. Our group is very pleased with the emphasis you put on energy efficiency. This is very important for us. I was very pleased to see that you said not only that energy efficiency is important, but that you regard it as a source of energy. That is really crucial. In that sense, megawatts can compete with megawatts – crucial in our vision for the future. Having said that, of course the implementation will be very important. The implementation of this visionary framework needs to be implemented in the new direction we are taking as Europe. As a political group, we have always said that we need another balance when we look to our economy. We need to invest, and there will be no Energy Union if we are not able to invest in renewable energy efficiency in our infrastructure.  There we have the connection with the Juncker plan and we are currently discussing this in Parliament. You can be assured that our group will put your – and our – priorities on the Energy Union at the centre of the discussion on the Juncker plan. In that way we will make sure that the things we do will create, not just one tree, but several trees. We will create jobs and we will make sure that we have a good and different infrastructure. We will make sure that there is a sustainable future and also secure our energy supply for our economy and for all our citizens.

This is a moment when it can create a genuine and solidarity-based energy policy that is based not on assurances and promises, but on the creation of legal solutions guaranteeing the sovereignty of countries that work together to ensure energy security. This cooperation should consist of investments as soon as possible in infrastructure enabling diversification of the supply of energy raw materials and the development of internal sources of conventional and unconventional energy. These actions are conditioned by the dangers of the Eastern direction. The Union must also speak with one voice in this area, ensuring the security of the Member States. The current proposal from the European Commission should be assessed as deeply disappointing. The assumptions presented are façade in nature and in no way correspond to the current and future economic and political situation of the European continent. I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to build a genuine Energy Union to meet the challenges of the future and underpin the energy security of the Member States. I particularly call on the President of the Council, Donald Tusk, who, during his run for office, ensured that the highest efforts were made with the Energy Union. At the time, he promised a gas solidarity mechanism, joint energy purchases, coal rehabilitation and radical diversification of energy supply sources, including a new gas policy.

Let me then touch upon some key issues to be addressed in the coming months. On governance: it is clear that our security depends on all Member States working together and living up to their obligations. We would like to see the Commission in an even stronger position in this process because we need more ambitious European governance on this issue. We need a truly European energy policy instead of having 28 widely differing policies on this important issue. We, for our part, would like to push even further when it comes to energy efficiency and renewables. This goes hand in hand with strengthening our security and at the same time increasing competitiveness for European companies. We have seen that it works. Just this week Apple announced a huge investment in my own country, Denmark, primarily because of its renewable energy. Companies like this invest in places where waste heat from a data centre can be reused as a source of heating for homes through district heating technologies. So, this is not just good for the environment and the energy security; it is also sound business sense and practice. There are a lot of companies out there that save money for consumers and create jobs and growth in Europe. I invite the Commission to engage with companies like these and see how to find the best solutions for tomorrow’s challenges and to communicate these opportunities to citizens as well as to businesses. Finally, on investment and financing: we have to ensure that the Juncker plan delivers. Private finance is out there; there are projects that desperately need funding; it is up to us to make sure that the Juncker plan works and helps to join all these dots.

Mr President, in the European Commission communication on energy union there are omissions and problematic references. Firstly, it is important to put forward concrete proposals to tackle energy poverty and ensure equal access for all to cheap energy. The proposal to make it compulsory for the Commission to be involved in transnational agreements, from the initial stage to the end, is particularly problematic; so is the proposal to involve the Commission in the negotiations and the attempt to involve them in the trade agreements concluded by the Member States. The role of the Commission must be consultative and voluntary, as this will not undermine the ability of Member States to negotiate the content of their agreements. The Commission cannot claim an enhanced role when the European Union has so far been unable to lift the energy isolation of the Member States and regions of the European Union. Let me remind you that the goal of lifting solitary confinement was by the end of 2015, which cannot be achieved. The Commission cannot ask for increased powers when it has so far failed to ensure the Union's energy security, while at the same time many Member States face serious problems with energy supply. Finally, it is an important omission that there is no meaningful reference to the need to exploit the eastern Mediterranean deposits, and in particular those located in a Member State such as Cyprus, which are important for strengthening energy security in Europe today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 13, "date": "2015-02-25.json", "name": "Rebecca Harms", "mepid": "28233", "text": "  Mr President, For better, I would like to make a name for my free Mr President, I would like to thank the We have always been convinced that the European Union needs a project for the future and that the Energy Union, a European Energy Union, can be such a project for the future. I have often said in recent years that what was in the 1950s, in the founding years of the European Union, the major contracts for coal and steel or the Euratom Treaty must guide us. But it is not acceptable that, when we decide on an Energy Union and strategies for the future in 2015, we are essentially extending what the founding fathers of the 1950s represented as new and future technologies.  And I have to tell you: my fear is that the European Commission is in the process of squandering the opportunities that would be in the Energy Union as a project for the future. Most of what you propose in your Energy Union package has nothing to do with tomorrow's technologies, but very much with yesterday's technologies. There is not much talk about coal, but of course it is in it, which has a great future with you. You talk a lot about gas, but unfortunately it is not the case that a strategy is being developed on how to reduce high gas consumption. Instead of importing the gas mainly from Russia in the future, one simply switches to countries such as Turkmenistan or Azerbaijan. Whether this can be the lesson of this crisis development with Russia, I have great doubts about that, because these countries, too, are by no means to be regarded as sensible or safe countries.  I do not know how you intend to combine all this with the claim that nuclear power is an energy union that is also made for the citizens. The citizens are in favour of climate protection! The majority of citizens are against nuclear energy, and that is europe-wide.

We are talking about an energy union built only of macro connections between nations and only of the ability to invert macro flows; it does not matter what form of energy should flow into it; it does not matter whether there may not be so many non-EU suppliers capable or with the will to give everyone the energy they need tomorrow; it does not matter if even today adjacent apartments are not able to exchange energy independently of monopolies. It has been assumed that this union, which has fallen from above, automatically generates resilience, but it leads us to another dead end, to new dependencies and great disappointments.  For the times in which we live and live, we believe that another form of energy union is appropriate where indigenous generation and widespread food inverted flows of origin compared to the past from individual houses and power plants to large connectors – necessary is true, but to calm the intermittency of renewables of local seasonal and circadian variations of climate and light between distant areas.

These are energy prices. You yourself said that the Energy Union must also include a new concept of the energy market, a new structuring of prices, so that prices are more affordable.

If we are to be an Energy Union moving ever toward renewable energy, we have to find a way of storing it. Pump-action hydro is one method, but we are going to have to put a significant amount of work into understanding how we can ensure that all the energy we create is either stored or used. Otherwise it is wasted, and that would be a serious challenge in going forward. I also believe that right now we must prioritise the North Sea Grid. I think that is ready to go: it is shovel ready. If we can make significant progress on that in the coming year, I think we can actually do good.

But we definitely need also to focus on what we already have: increased internal production, increased energy efficiency, and new and better inter-connected infrastructure. From this point of view I think we need to make use of all available sources, including the Connecting Europe Facility, to speed up the creation of a strategic trans-European network for energy, which will allow us better distribution of all types of energy and avoid bottlenecks.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 44, "date": "2015-02-25.json", "name": "András Gyürk (PPE). -", "mepid": "23816", "text": "   Dear Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your support.

Unfortunately, this is not yet a self-evident market condition in all Member States. Central and eastern European countries still lack alternative supply routes and north-south connections. In many cases, the possibility of two-way flows is not guaranteed and there are no competing sources – at least on the natural gas market.

It was particularly highlighted at the time of the Ukrainian-Russian conflict. Secondly, the development of technical infrastructure is a prerequisite for security and continuity of supply, including, of course, interconnectors, the whole investment programme related to this, LNG terminals, which are being built by individual Member States, new transmission networks, but also connections to other sources of supply.

We must make it clear that this is a violation of European solidarity, which, by the way, is detrimental to everyone.

Of course we could, but I think, as you have read in our strategy, that we are taking the energy security issue to a higher level. Probably never before have you heard such ambitious language as regards the ex ante check of the compatibility of the intergovernmental agreements with the European acquis. Never before has the Commission dared to push for much more transparency when it comes to long-term gas contracts, and never before have we been so clear that we need to diversify not only the routes but also the sources of our energy. We have been trying to present it in the new holistic way, because we have linked it very much with other dimensions and we are very clear in stating that we do not have to import the energy we save. It means we are increasing our energy security. Mr Eickhout and Mr Turmes have been very strong in underlining the importance of the efficiency-first principle, and I agree with them. I think that if you read our strategy in greater detail, you will see that we are not only doing lip service to this principle, we are making this principle operational. We are clearly describing how we are going to use it when we are discussing energy infrastructure projects and how we are going to link it with the funding for infrastructure projects in the future, and I think that we will see that in real life, this principle will be applied, and the Commission will be the first to support its full implementation. I would say 90% of the honourable Members have been referring to the importance of infrastructure and infrastructure development, and I think they are right. We cannot have an internal energy market without proper infrastructure, without proper interconnections. I think that, also in the Commission, we agreed that we need to improve the governance of how we manage, how we follow up on our infrastructure projects, how we can make greater coherence in funding from different sources. We have projects of common interest, we have structural funds in the new Member States, we have the Connecting Europe Facility, and now, thanks to our President, we have the new Juncker investment plan, which of course would be key for this big investment, which must be channelled to cross-border infrastructure. We will ensure that we have a much better governance system making sure that the infrastructure interconnections are built on time, with the support of the citizens and the Member States, and they will make the free flow of energies in the European Union a reality. I very much appreciate all of you who highlighted the issue of the energy poverty of vulnerable citizens in Europe, and again I think that for the first time we have devoted such an important part of the Energy Union strategy to this problem. We recognise that we have a problem with energy poverty, and we are also proposing how this should be tackled. We should increase the competition on the internal energy market, because it should drive the prices down. At the same time we have to have a special instrument which would help, via social means, the most vulnerable citizens to take care of the cost, because in the Europe of the 21st century we should not have such a high percentage of citizens who cannot afford to pay their energy bills. I also would like to reassure Mr Liese and other honourable Members of this Parliament on governance. The Commission will launch dynamic and robust governance for the Energy Union, for our climate action and, as I said, also for our infrastructural build-up, and of course Parliament will be a key partner in this effort. If you study carefully our roadmap, our action plan and all the legislative proposals which are proposed there, it is very clear that they have to adopt it through the ordinary legislative procedure, where Parliament is, of course, a key partner as co-legislator. If you will allow me to react also to some questions related to research and innovation. Mr Duncan was, apparently, reading one of the previous versions of the Energy Union communication, because in the final text I would say that this policy is very much focused: we are focusing on four very concrete areas of research and innovation. We want to remain the world leader in the next generation of renewable technologies, including storage – how to store the energy which is produced by the renewable sources. We want to remain leaders in this market. We want to help our cities to become smart, and we also want to focus our research on how to make our transport much more sustainable. If you will allow me, I should like to conclude with some information on what the new Agency for the Coordination of Energy Regulators (ACER) should do. I think that when we are talking about completion of the internal energy market and about much more cross-border connection, it is very clear that this dimension of cross-border cooperation would be much more important than before. I think that it is very clear that we need to have the possibility to adopt many more decisions at European level. We want to do it within the framework of the current treaties; we believe that with increased powers for ACER and closer cooperation with the European transmission system operators for gas and electricity, we can achieve exactly this, and I think that this was the question proposed by Mr Kofod. To conclude, I would like to thank you for your support, and I would highlight the comment made by Mr Buzek that the proposal is here: the strategy was adopted. What we need now is to use the political momentum to increase the political will in the European Union, in our Member States, to implement this strategy and to work on this together with the support of our citizens. In this case, with such strong ownership, I believe that we will succeed and we will see that the Energy Union is built at an appropriate pace and with appropriate enthusiasm and energy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 69, "date": "2015-02-25.json", "name": "Der Präsident. -", "mepid": "1911", "text": "   The debate is closed.

Until now, energy policies have been the preserve of the Member States, with the consequent and obvious problems in terms of dependence, dispersion and insufficient interconnection. Every step towards a single energy market strengthens security of supply and allows for a stronger common policy for the now indispensable energy transition to a low-CO2 model.  There is not only a need to reduce dependence on third countries, but also the need to give certainty to investments, which is fundamental to achieving this 'momentous' transformation. A transition for the benefit of citizens, businesses and the environment. Today the Commission has outlined its vision, it is now important to move on to the operational phase as soon as possible.

Whether we are talking about Russian gas blackmail or unfair competition from Chinese solar panel manufacturers, the EU must react promptly and with one voice to these challenges.

I agree with the encouragement of the greatest possible interconnection of European energy networks (in particular gas and electricity lines). Many Member States are severely dependent on energy from certain third countries, which significantly reduces their margins in energy procurement. A country's independence depends to a large extent on its energy dependency, so diversification of energy supplies must be in the fundamental interest of all EU Member States. The important thing is that the EU can provide substantial support for the interconnection of energy networks. It is not a good sign that the so-called \"1990s\" To finance the Juncker Investment Package, the Commission would realrare a significant amount from the budget of the European Network Finance Facility, which finances the achievement of this objective. On the other hand, I welcome the fact that the Communication sets out as a priority objective the development of energy efficiency and the strong incentive for the transition to renewable energy production. However, the Commission should refrain from taking any action to prevent the use of renewable energies. For example, we should not limit the planting of useful wood varieties that provide biomass feed material, the production of first-generation bioethanol produced from surplus yields, or support for combustion-efficient biomass boilers. Finally, I do not agree with the significant involvement of agriculture in the scope of the greenhouse gas emission reduction target.

As a renewable energy, Germany imports nuclear power produced from its neighbours, thanks to the interconnection of electricity networks.

The aim of the Energy Union is to reduce Europe's external energy dependency, to increase energy security and to reduce its vulnerability to Russia.

The government has entered into secret contracts with Russia to build a Russian-made nuclear power plant, built on Russian credit, which also relies on Russia for fuel supply and waste management. Orban agreed with Putin to extend the long-term gas deal, while the European Council's decision last March not to organise bilateral meetings with the Russian leadership still applies.

The Council’s deadline for the completion of the internal energy market was set for the end of 2014. In the new international situation the security of the EU is directly threatened. Any further delay is bound to undermine Europe’s internal and external stability. Continued existence within the EU of isolated energy islands depending on supplies from third countries will make the union vulnerable to external economic blackmail. One of the core issues for the future will be offering consumers more diversity and choices. Energy poverty needs to be addressed adequately. The focus has to shift onto reduced and energy-efficient consumption, including investing in zero-energy buildings. Consumers must have clear and real-time information on their energy consumption and costs, and on energy-saving possibilities. The Energy Union has to specifically address the micro-producers.

The main purpose of informal summits is to discuss and consult, not to negotiate. Our meeting was short and the outcome quite concise. It took place against the background of rapidly-changing events. Of the four great challenges on the table, the first was Ukraine. We had an exchange with Ukraine’s President, Petro Poroshenko. He joined us to present the Minsk ceasefire and to share his assessment of the situation on the ground. We thanked Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande for their indispensable efforts for peace as the initiators of the Normandy Four talks. We gave the fragile agreement our cautious support. The European Union still hopes for peace so that the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine can be restored as soon as possible. However, we remain very sceptical. The 2014 Minsk Agreement was not honoured. Debate among the leaders focused on how to support the implementation of the new peace deal. If this does not happen, we will not hesitate to take the necessary steps. The ceasefire, which was supposed to take effect at midnight on 15 February, has been violated more than 800 times according to the OSCE. I am in contact with Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande and in consultation with all leaders. The European Union stands united on this question and will stay the course. Additional sanctions remain on the table. We should be ready for any development, good or bad. On 12 February, leaders recalled the terrible attacks in Paris which killed 17 people. We committed ourselves to a new counter-terrorism work plan. This is set out in the joint statement adopted at the summit. The new work plan mainly requires the European Union to do what it is already doing in the field of internal security, but we need to do specific things better and faster, such as making far better use of the security arrangements of Schengen or reviewing regulations for firearms. The recent fatal attack in Copenhagen underlines the necessity. These attacks only strengthen our determination to fight all kinds of extremism and terrorism. I take this opportunity to express our deepest sympathy and support to Denmark, the Danish people and the families of the victims. Although Libya was not on the agenda of the February informal European Council, the terrible and dangerous events in that country are the latest convincing reason to address this pressing issue. National security is a matter for national governments. Nevertheless, there are important areas where we can support each other and where common action is even vital. In that respect, I warmly welcome the recent progress towards restarting the negotiations on an EU agreement on passenger name records. I have no doubt that we can effectively protect the security of citizens without diminishing the right to privacy. Your help on this issue is absolutely crucial and invaluable. The European Council will come back to this matter in June, amongst other things. Meanwhile our countries will face this threat together, calmly and with determination. As for Greece, our February meeting was clearly not the right moment for uncoordinated negotiations on the Greek assistance programme. We heard from the President of the Eurogroup, who outlined what the state of play was in discussions with Greece. We welcomed Prime Minister Tsipras as a new member of the European Council, who gave us his view of the situation. We agreed that the talks would go on, as they did, at ministerial level so that common ground could be found. I had no doubt that this would happen. Close contacts were maintained with all the relevant parties so that agreement could be reached in principle at the Eurogroup last Friday. I was glad to see Eurozone ministers give the green light to Greece’s reform plans yesterday. Finally, we briefly considered the future of economic and monetary union itself. We need to improve economic policy-making in the Eurozone. All the principal authors of the so-called Four Presidents’ Report were in the room, so the setting was right to open this discussion. President Juncker presented background analysis and posed questions that need to be answered if we are to achieve better economic governance. However, one point is already perfectly clear. After the recent decision of the ECB, the priority is to make national economies more compatible with monetary union. This cannot be done from Brussels but through strong political ownership of economic reforms at national level. We now look ahead to the March European Council. In the next three weeks we will follow the situation in Ukraine and in Libya day by day with great precision. The March summit will also be a time to consider the strategic outlook for the eastern and southern neighbourhoods. We will continue our discussion on the European economy and, of course, we will also focus on an issue that is as close to my own heart as it is to many in this Parliament, that is, the urgent need for a European Energy Union, as Vice-President Šefčovič has just outlined. The European Union can – and must – make progress in this area soon.

We have, of course, a few weeks after the events in Paris, discussed the fight against terrorism and, on this point, we have agreed that the Schengen agreements are not a problem. Schengen is an answer to the problem and we have therefore ruled out, on the basis of the Commission's proposals, any idea of making massive and substanceic amendments to the Schengen agreements. When it comes to fighting terrorism, we must not act in haste. Responses to terrorism are not a hassely. Remember the mistakes our American friends made immediately after the September 11 attacks in New York and Washington. You have to stay calm, but you can stay serious. That is what we have done with regard to the single European passenger data register. On this point, Mr President, I would like to pay tribute to this House for agreeing to reverse a decision that was taken by one of your committees. I would like, Mr President, to pay personal tribute to you because you have done everything in your power to ensure that Parliament, its various committees, its bodies and its members can move closer to the point of view that was the Commission that preceded mine. I am not criticising Parliament for the decision it seemed to have taken a few months ago, because the aspect of respect for fundamental rights and civil liberties is one of the considerations that also drives the Commission's action. But on this point, we will have to act and react with severity. We discussed the European Energy Union at the Council on 11 February. This morning, the Commission took a decision to do so. Personally, I have always considered - but never before - that major projects should be launched at the beginning of the legislature. If I had done it in my previous life, the result would have been better. But, as President of the Commission, I would like to see the major projects, those that reflect the Commission's priorities, start immediately. As a result, we agreed on a green paper on the Capital Markets Union. I know Guy does not like the fact that the Commission is presenting a green paper - he might prefer a blue book, but it would have a partisan connotation. Philippe, of course, likes the green books, but the answers, too, will have to be ultra-green. We will see at the autopsy, if I dare say so. We have launched, as I said, an Energy Union. We have ensured that, in terms of transparency, the Commission's work and working methods are clarified. We intend to make all the necessary decisions on the Digital Single Market, and it will be done in May. As a result, all of the Commission's major projects have been started and the related initiatives will be launched shortly and in order. At the Council chaired by President Tusk, we presented an analytical study on the causes of the economic and monetary union crisis. Since this was the easiest part, we presented our colleagues in the European Council with a questionnaire on the essential points relating to the future of economic and monetary union. I read that some people regretted that I merely asked questions. But if you don't ask questions, you don't get answers. If we want answers - and I want answers on the essential dimension of economic and monetary union - we have to ask questions. We will discuss them with President Tusk, President Dijsselbloem and President Draghi in the coming weeks and we will involve the President of the European Parliament as closely as possible in this exercise. I would like to make it clear here that this is a report of the four presidents. We will therefore associate Martin Schulz with it. This is not a report of the four institutions plus the European Parliament. It is a personal job, so I would like, as the other presidents have done so far, to focus on looking at our personal ideas. Not our institution's. Personally, I have never had a debate in the Commission. Donald has never had a debate in the European Council. As for Mr Draghi, as he is independent, I do not know what he has done but we, the others, who are dependent, we must know that this is a report that reflects the personal views of the five presidents. and I welcome the fact that the President of Parliament is involved in this exercise. With regard to the investment plan, which wrongly bears my name, but I like it, I would like to pay tribute here to the European Parliament, its committees and its two rapporteurs, who are doing an excellent job. Mr Bullmann and Mr Fernandez are working hard to enable Parliament to make a decision on this plan and on the accompanying legislation by June at the latest. I stress the need for a parliamentary decision in June. I would like to remind you, Mr President, that I have knowingly chosen the Community method to adopt these texts. It would have been possible for only the Commission and the Council to take the decisions, but I wanted - because I promised you - to involve the European Parliament in the Framework of the Community method, which I keep saying will have to rehabilitate it, which we have done on this particular point. Today, as the College of Commissioners, we have taken a decision on the budgetary aspects which concern a number of Member States - not one, but several Member States. Given that the attention of the general public, including parliamentary attention, has turned to the case of France, I wanted to tell you that we have just decided, today, to invite France to reduce its structural deficit this year, in 2015, by 0.5%, which will result in the French government having to amend the budget it voted for 2015 by 0.2%. We would like France to reduce its structural deficit by 0.75%, 0.8% or 0.9% in 2016. We will give France an additional two years, but we will increase the procedure for macroeconomic imbalances in intensity. France will therefore be - you will excuse me for the expression - under increased surveillance. I would like to say that it will be accompanied more intensely by the Commission with regard to its budgetary adjustments. So we work, we do what we can. We cannot do everything you want us to do, but for our action we are waiting for the support of the European Parliament. Without the European Parliament, the Commission is deaf and dumb. She doesn't talk and can't act. So let us do something about it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 116, "date": "2015-02-25.json", "name": "Der Präsident. -", "mepid": "1911", "text": "   Ladies and gentlemen!

The Council was meant to be initially on terrorism, but life added two more topics: the Greek crisis and Ukraine under attack. What do those three cases have in common? They are three tests for our European values. The first, on the Charlie incident: freedom of expression, terrorism and security of citizens. We did deliver a consistent plan of action, as was reported by President Tusk.  On the second, Greece: we stood up to the principle of binding commitments of Member States, pacta sunt servanda: the same rules for all on fiscal responsibility. But at the same time we have merged responsibility with solidarity with Greece – and we really did deliver on Greece, as it appears today, President Juncker. On the third case, Ukraine: it also tests our values. It joins the features of the two previous cases: Charlie and terrorism, and Greece. It is about terrorism and it is about economic collapse. The Ukraine case is about changing borders by force and violating national law through state-sponsored terrorism by Russia and by waging war. Will the EU stay the course, to quote President Tusk, of a value-based foreign policy? Shall we be faithful to our principle ‘more sanctions in response to more war’? We are giving a chance to diplomacy through the Minsk agreements, but we should support it with proper leverage and pressure, by imposing an economic cost on the aggressor, by allowing the victim to defend itself against the aggressor, and by supporting its defence capabilities according to two principles of international law: first, the right to defend; second: the responsibility to protect.

An exclusion of the European Parliament would have been incomprehensible, inexplicable and unfair. The European Parliament deserves to be involved in the person of the President and in the value of the institutions.  I'm going to say three things quickly. The first is that the agreement reached on Greece is a good one. We must make everyone understand that the outcome of the elections must be respected and that it is unthinkable to think of revenge. There's a government in office, it may or may not like it, I don't like it very much, but it exists. We need to understand the meaning of that election result, the rejecting of austerity, and we must understand that the government must operate today and must move from the propaganda phase to the stage of choosing on the concrete issues. We need a serious reform process in the areas of tax fairness, social equity, public administration reform and the fight against corruption. On all this we will measures the ability to give answers.  My second point is foreign policy, Ukraine. President Tusk said and I thank him, 'fragile agreement', but, to say the least, we need to make it more solid, keeping up the pressure on Russia and doing everything we have to do about a consolidated ceasefire that could be turned into a peace. Libya: thank you, Mr Tusk, because you mentioned Libya. Libya is a dramatic emergency and does not have sufficient and adequate attention. From there come untold dangers for all of us. It is absolutely essential to focus, I am convinced that our High Representative, Federica Mogherini, will give the right answers.  Finally: immigration, Lampedusa. Right to have upgraded \"Triton\", but I think it is not enough, I think we should try to make Mare Nostrum European. Finally, the fight against terrorism, I will conclude, no pre-emptive measures on PNR, let us move forward, but we know that it is not enough to do PNR to defeat terrorism, many other things must be done and I hope that we will succeed in doing so.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 119, "date": "2015-02-25.json", "name": "Krisztina Morvai (NI). -", "mepid": "96661", "text": "   Mr President, as I wrote to you, you have no right to unilaterally change the agenda that was accepted by Parliament at the beginning of the session, and on this agenda there is a catch-the-eye procedure after this debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 120, "date": "2015-02-25.json", "name": "Der Präsident. -", "mepid": "1911", "text": "   Mrs Morvai, you are right.

It would probably have been, first, the exchange of views with the President of a victim country, then discussions among the EU leaders, adoption of the negotiating mandate and empowering by the Treaty authorities of the European Union to negotiate if it was decided to negotiate. What do we have instead? The Normandy format, whatever that means. Lack of participation by both the High Representatives, the President of the Council and the President of the Commission. And we have the result, and our cautious support and the support without reservations during the G7 debate. Certainly we have a huge problem: not only conflict, we have a real war, breach of international law, annexation of a sovereign country and our lack of decision. We must know that the Russian Federation has not fulfilled any agreement reached in respect of Ukraine, yet, during the informal Council, we decided not to discuss further sanctions and it means that Minsk too is just freezing this conflict. We have to go further and we have to adopt further firm, decisive decisions that empower the EU. I really appreciate the outcome of the informal Council in terms of anti-terrorist measures, including the prospects for the PNR Directive: it is very important. We have been engaged within my political group in discussing this matter. On Greece, there are two sides to this problem. Certainly we have to be very clear in our discussions with the people of Europe about the consequences of monetary union. But we also have to remember that acceptance of Greece was a political decision, as is the monetary union itself, and we cannot pretend that it is only a question of economic considerations now.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 122, "date": "2015-02-25.json", "name": "Guy Verhofstadt", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  au nom du groupe ALDE. – Monsieur le Président, je voulais d'abord réagir aux propos du président Juncker sur le PNR. Le Parlement n'a renoncé à rien et ne reverra rien. Nous avons, à une grande majorité, voté une résolution qui est claire. Nous voulons un PNR au niveau européen. Pour cela, nous demandons à la Commission des propositions sur la nécessité et la proportionnalité, qui sont les deux conditions de base pour avoir un tel système, et nous demandons également au Conseil d'agir, c'est-à-dire d'avancer dans l'approbation de la directive sur la protection des données. Cela signifie que ce n'est pas nous qui allons revoir notre position, mais que nous allons, tous les trois, faire en sorte – si le Conseil et la Commission font ce qu'ils ont à faire – d'avancer ensemble sur ce dossier, et non séparément ou indépendamment. Deuxièmement, Monsieur Juncker, je pense que vous avez produit une note convaincante sur la gouvernance économique. Je pense qu'aujourd'hui enfin, nous en avons terminé avec ces contractual arrangements, cette idée complétement folle sur laquelle nous avons travaillé pendant deux ans et selon laquelle la Commission allait conclure un accord avec un État pour les réformes. Je crois qu'il faut aller dans une autre direction, c'est-à-dire celle d'une convergence globale dans l'Union européenne et dans la zone euro. Là, je crois que l'approche est bonne.  That gives me the third point that has been discussed in this informal Council on Greece. I think it was a wise decision, Mr Tusk, that four months’ more time has been given, because that is the outcome of the deal with Greece, so that they can describe the reforms that they want to make. I think that was a wise decision, but I hope they are going to be real reforms. I see that they want to take on tax evasion – I think that is very good – and they want to make proposals on corruption – but that is not sufficient.  I was not too impressed by the letter of the Greek government of a few days ago. There are other things to do: for example, opening closed professions to young people; downsizing and reforming the public sector is also an absolute need in Greece; and finally, transforming public banks into competitive private financial institutions – something that Greece does not have today. So I think that we have really to wait now for the additional proposals from the Greek Government before we can go further, but I think it was a good decision to take a period of four months, it was not going to be possible to do that job within a few days or a few weeks. I come finally to the question of Ukraine. The issue is, as Mr Tusk said, that the Minsk II agreement has been breached 800 times, and I think that we have to reflect on this. We have to ask the question: is our strategy towards Russia the right strategy? What is our strategy toward Russia? It is: he moves into Crimea and we react; he moves into the eastern provinces of Ukraine and we react; he is breaching the Minsk II agreement and maybe we shall react.  I think that we have to do the opposite – that in a certain way we have to decide already now on additional economic sanctions, not to put them immediately in place but to say to the Russian leadership: if you breach this or that agreement, these are the new economic sanctions that we shall put in place. Not to wait – we always react to a move of Putin – but to do the opposite, deciding with the European Council, based on proposals by Mr Tusk and Mrs Mogherini, on a number of new economic sanctions, and saying to the leadership in Russia that these sanctions are going to be a reality if he continues his permanent aggression towards the agreements that have been made and to the Ukrainian State.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 123, "date": "2015-02-25.json", "name": "Δημήτριος Παπαδημούλης", "mepid": "28586", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Mr President, the answer that the European Union, the Eurogroup, the Commission, the European Central Bank will give to the issues raised by the Greek Government is also a mirror of how the Eurozone will deal with its own problems, because in recent years we have reduced investment in the eurozone, economic stagnation, deflation, the risk of a new recession, increased poverty and unemployment throughout the eurozone. There is a McKinsey study that says that in recent years there has been an increase in public debt across the Eurozone: 15 of the 19 Euro area Member States have debt well above the threshold set by the Maastricht Treaty, seven of the Euro area Member States have more than 100% public debt and the largest increase in debt in recent years is in the four countries that entered a memorandum: Ireland, 172% increase in public debt, Greece, 103% increase in public debt, Portugal, 100% increase in public debt, and Spain, 72% increase in public debt. I note with satisfaction that today the debate on Greece is not in the war-revenge tones adopted by the German Christian Democrats a few days ago, when they wanted to avenge the Greek people for voting against their own wishes. I take a positive note of the statement made by the President of the Commission, Mr Juncker, a few days ago, speaking to the Economic and Social Committee, where you said, Mr President, that you had acted unacceptably as European institutions towards the Greeks, you insulted them and that mistakes were also made in the implementation of the programme. What was given by the Eurogroup decision is not just a moment's breath; is the possibility of combining two things: the first is the need to respect the rules and the second is the need to respect democracy and the result of the elections, which says that something needs to be seen, that we need to change it and that we were wrong. That is exactly what we are seeking, by accepting our commitments and calling for European solidarity in the fight against corruption and tax evasion, by asking for technical assistance – which, as Even Dr Schäuble said, previous governments have refused – we are also calling for the Juncker investment package to be strengthened on the basis of criteria such that these investments are directed to the countries most in need, because they have more unemployment and more disinvestment, and of course also to use the flexibility in the Stability Pact, which a former Commissioner in charge of the matter, Mr. Prodi, had described it as \"stupid\", and the quantitative easing decided by the European Central Bank. I close with two words on the subject of Ukraine. The peace agreement is a small tree. He's in danger of drying out. Our job is to calmly strengthen this peace effort. As for the issue of dealing with terrorist attacks, in addition to our solidarity with the peoples of France and Denmark, I note positively the calm position of Mr. Juncker, that we should not make the mistakes that the Americans made after 2001.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 124, "date": "2015-02-25.json", "name": "Philippe Lamberts", "mepid": "96648", "text": "  on behalf of the Greens/FTA group. Mr President, I would like to focus on Greece, starting with the question: did we really need a psychodrama that lasted almost four weeks? A psychodrama that saw the new Greek government pretend that the election campaign had continued beyond 25 January, by cracking incendiary statements such as :\"Our country is bankrupt\", which would obviously lead to consequences on the ECB's side, or by insisting on returning to the issue of war reparations.  But equally irresponsible was the almost obsessive insistence of a number of Council members to say: \"Greece will pay!\" or, implying, \"Greece will come out!\", as, remember, in France in the 1920s: \"Germany will pay!\". These statements were all the more irresponsible because the leader who made them was none other than the German Finance Minister, and I stress on this, the new Greek government is far more reliable in its promises than the former government of the Nea Dimokratia - the equivalent of the EPP - or PASOK - the Social Democratic Party - in terms of the implementation, quite simply, of a tax system. In this regard, if the European Union could bring both its expertise, but also its strike force to obtain information from third countries such as Switzerland, for example, and in fact the return of a number of unpaid taxes, I think it would do a real service to Greece. Thirdly, the Greek economy must be put on the path to sustainable development. I would say here that we are in line with the Commission's priorities: investment and energy transition - we have already discussed this today. Imagine: Greece could become a net exporter of energy, especially to the rest of the Union. This, it seems to me, is a very useful source of financial resources for the State and for the Greek economy, and we must therefore also give priority to investments, particularly in Europe, in the energy transition in Greece. I would just like to end by saying that no one here can have any interest in playing on the failure of the new Greek government, for lowly political reasons. Because the failure of the new Greek government would inevitably mean the victory of the anti-European populists.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 125, "date": "2015-02-25.json", "name": "Paul Nuttall", "mepid": "96805", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, I will also focus on Greece today.

Indeed, Mr Juncker, you are on record as saying that there can be no democratic choice against the European Union’s treaties. Now does that not tell us all we really need to know about what the Eurofanatics think of democracy? Is it not ironic that you are destroying democracy in its very cradle, Greece? You have allowed Greece to enter a currency that it should never have been in. You have removed the democratically elected Prime Minister when he offered his country a way out through a referendum. You have imposed austerity that has taken the people of Greece to the brink, yet you still shackle this great country with economic chains.  To you I say that sovereignty and democracy in Greece are not yours to take. The Greeks have suffered enough. The battle lines are clear. It is the forces of democracy in Greece against the undemocratic forces of a European Union. To the Greek Parliament I ask: will the 300 stand firm? And to the Greek people I say: be courageous, protect your birthright, you are the creators of democracy and now you must save it. Invoke the courage and spirit of your forefathers. Do not buckle. Do not falter. Do not give in. You are the defenders of democracy now.

And how is it possible to think that a debt of 175% of GDP can be repaid through cuts and sacrifices?  It is with these questions that we must confront ourselves, because the crisis in Greece is not Greek but European and is not economic but political. It is the crisis in a small European country that has the GDP of an Italian or French that could be saved in an instant. It's a storm in a glass of water. It is the crisis of a weak and cowardly Europe, where politicians only look to their narrow national horizon.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be brief, as was the European Council on 12 February. I will respond to a couple of comments that have been made, and which relate specifically to the Commission. First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Maurel, which seems to be a French socialist, for saying exactly the opposite of what the French Socialist government tells me day after day. It's remarkable. I would then like to congratulate him on his sense of humour because he started by saying that many of us are talking. Many? You have a sense of humor, sir. Three? I will tell him and others that I never said that elections would be a neutral event. I made a remark, expressed a basic common sense formula: election results do not change treaties. Greece has taken a sovereign decision and I respect the expression of Greek universal suffrage. Much more than others. But the Greek vote did not result in the simple expression of Greek universal suffrage being annulled by the mere expression of Greek universal suffrage. Next Sunday, Estonia will vote. In April, Finland will vote. Other countries will vote. Do you really think that after every election we should challenge the treaties and the rules? You are killing Europe with that kind of talk. So do not repeat them, because you offend common sense, when it would be better to respect it. But I accept that it is distributed, it seems, in a very uneven way in Europe and among the parliamentary groups. In recent days, there has been a great deal of criticism of the Commission, in a roundabout way, by asking journalists to write down what governments thought. The Commission has been criticised for being involved in the debate on Greece. It's still remarkable! The previous Commission was criticised - often wrongly - for not being sufficiently involved in the management of the affairs of the Economic and Monetary Union. Now we are criticising the current Commission for being too interested in the collective and solidarity management of the single currency! The President of the Commission, who has not acted in the foreground, is not intended to divide Europe. Its mission is to unite Europe, where unity is the order of the day. My social purpose is the unity of Europe, the fight against the gratuitous, fortuitous breaks of European cohesion. So we did what we had to do and - I tell you this - if we had not done what we did, there would have been no agreement on Greece. Ich mag einige Zungenschlege in der Debatte nicht so sehr. Wieso reden wir eigentlich immer dar-ber, dass jemand sich durchgesetzt hette? Wenn sich jemand durchsetzt, setzt er sich immer gegen andere durch.

First about Ukraine. I fully agree with what Guy Verhofstadt has said, that we need a more proactive strategy and I fully agree that unity is not merely a substitute for strategy. I am sure that you know what my intention is when we are talking about a new strategy – I am sure that you have no doubt what I mean. But unity for sure is the first and main condition to do anything in this area. We need strategy, but without unity there is no strategy with any chance of success in this problem. The first reason is a practical reason. All actions, for example sanctions, need consensus in the European Council. This is why unity is not my dream or something like an ideology; this is a practical condition for doing anything about this problem. We also have a second reason for talking about unity and how important unity is today. I deeply believe, and I do not think that it is a surprise for you, that one of the most important goals for President Putin today is to divide Europe and the whole Western community. This is the second reason why I am so obsessed about unity among Member States, and also in the wider perspective, meaning the whole Western community. For sure we have to discuss our strategy during the next European Council in March, but we have to remember that it will make sense only if we stay united. The second remark is about Greece. This discussion is not about ideology; it is not about war against Greece. I do not feel that Greece wants to be a permanent troublemaker in Europe. In fact this is a discussion and these are negotiations about help. Greece needs help today; Greece needs money today; it is not being an obstruction – and we have no time. The negotiations are between Member States, between partners, between friends. The first public declaration I heard from Prime Minister Tsipras after the Greek elections was that Greece wants to remain a member of the Eurozone. The second was that they need our help. I have not heard any realistic proposal of help for Greece from Russia or China. The only possibility to help Greece is cooperation between Member States of the Eurozone, the European Union, and also possibly international financial institutions. This is why we need to work together without these thoughts dividing us. I am sure that it is also clear to Greek citizens. I have no doubt that the majority of them understand very well that we need good cooperation in Europe and that we should not fight against each other. This is why I ask, because of this problem, that we have more respect for each other during the discussion. If we feel offended, then this process will be much more difficult than today and I am sure that we are ready to have a decent and open discussion and not to offend each other.

The Greeks want to get out of their country of 5 years of austerity imposed by the Troika which has cut GDP by 1/4 while continuing to increase the debt rate.

The antagonistic attitude shown towards Greece by both Germany and the Irish Government is indicative of the contemptuous attitude which is held towards those who have suffered the most. Instead of support, both the Irish and the European institutions foisted an austerity agenda on Greece and Ireland and other domestic countries across Europe. This includes the Fine Gael and Labour government in Dublin who themselves have been obedient agents of austerity in Ireland.

The most significant concerns the agreement on a declaration on the fight against terrorism, which indicates areas and a course of action, and requires the rapid adoption of certain measures already under discussion, including the European PNR. While we agree with the need to deal with the emergence of terrorism and international crime, any restriction of freedoms must, in our opinion, strictly respect the principle of proportionality and must not in any way go beyond what is essential and essential to combat these phenomena.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 155, "date": "2015-02-25.json", "name": "Jonás Fernández (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "125046", "text": "  in writing. – The last informal meeting of the European Council dealt, interless with, the Greek public debt crisis, as well as the follow-up to the new report on Economic and Monetary Union, which becomes that of the five Presidents, when the European Parliament joined, which is good news.

In fact I’d go further – where is the humanity? Questioning Mr Dijsselbloem in the ECON meeting yesterday, Dimitrios Papadimoulis MEP – who sees it all first-hand – outlined some of those human sufferings: ‘You know very well that the (existing) programme caused 25% recession in the Greek economy and a huge humanitarian crisis – over 25% unemployment, 2 500 000 Greeks living below the poverty line, nine out of 10 Greeks unemployed who don’t receive a cent of unemployment allowance…’ His words, however, fell on deaf ears. ‘Fiscal targets, 3%, 60%’, that’s all Mr Dijsselbloem understands; all the suffering and misery caused?

Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs, with whom it has been an honour to work, and among all of us we have made an effort to get as fair a report as possible. We analyzed 2013, which was a difficult year for the euro area: gross domestic product fell by 0.4% and unemployment hit a ceiling, reaching 12% by the end of the year. In contrast, the economic recovery began in 2014. The euro area's gross domestic product has risen by 0.9%, and forecasts for 2015 are even more flattering. In terms of inflation, in 2013 the average inflation rate was 1.3%. By contrast, in 2014 we end the year with negative inflation rates, that is, not meeting the target we have set for below inflation but close to 2%. As for credit to the private sector, it remains on negative ground, closing at a negative rate of -2.4%. We need to be aware that without credit there will be no consolidation of the economic recovery. I believe that the European Central Bank and its President are doing a great job of achieving stability in the euro area and are also doing a great job by both the ECB and its President in getting the actors involved to do their job as well.  But it is also true that the measures implemented by the European Central Bank could have been more effective and more efficient in restoring credit to the real economy. We are aware that financial markets in the euro area are fragmented and there is no proper transmission of monetary policy. But we must also be aware that the European Central Bank has had to face a very difficult environment resulting from an unprecedented financial, political and economic crisis and incomplete economic union. And it is not the task of the European Central Bank to complete economic union, but it is precisely to give time to the other actors involved in consolidating economic union and, ultimately, also political union. I think it is fair to highlight the European Central Bank's rapid reaction. This rapid reaction has managed to reduce stress levels in euro area financial markets, not only that, but it has also helped restore confidence in the single currency. Proof of this are the interest rates and risk premiums to which Member States are financed, especially those that have been more ambitious in terms of structural reforms. Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for joint action. An expansive monetary policy must be accompanied by reforms both at national and European level. A good example of this is my country, Spain, one of the most ambitious reform countries and one of the countries that will surely be at the forefront of economic growth this year.  The measures announced by the European Central Bank on 22 January do not have to be a brake, they do not have to be an excuse, to stop further reforming and to continue to make progress in the much-desired and necessary Economic and Monetary Union, but quite the opposite: the measures announced by the European Central Bank must be precisely the incentive we need to continue to do that great work that needs to be done both at national level and at national level European level. Because, ladies and gentlemen, let us not deceive citizens: an expansive monetary policy alone cannot stimulate aggregate demand. The European Central Bank can give us time, but we are the other actors involved, both at national and European level, who need to continue working.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 172, "date": "2015-02-25.json", "name": "Mario Draghi", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  President of ECB. - Madam President, I am very pleased to participate in this plenary debate. To lay the ground for our discussion, I would like to discuss three topics: the ECB’s monetary policy, focusing on the rationale for our latest monetary policy measures; the ECB’s commitment to accountability and transparency; and the progress towards building a deeper economic and monetary union. I will thereby address most of the issues which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) highlighted in its first draft resolution. First, the ECB’s monetary policy. For several quarters now, inflation in the euro area has been on a continuous downward trend. At the same time, in January 2015, market participants were expecting inflation to return to levels closer to our policy aim only over a horizon which stretched well beyond any meaningful definition of medium term. In an environment of weak economic recovery and subdued money and credit developments, risks were increasing that falling inflation expectations would feed back into weakening actual inflation. Such a self-reinforcing process could have posed severe downside risks to our price stability objective. Against this background, we judged that the degree of monetary accommodation that had been introduced in 2014 was insufficient. A more forceful monetary policy response became necessary. With key interest rates at their lower bound, the Governing Council of the ECB considered outright purchases of public securities to be the only remaining instrument which could be activated on a sufficient scale to broaden and strengthen the measures already in place. Thus, we decided in January to launch an expanded asset purchase programme. Under the programme, the euro system will continue its purchases of simple and transparent asset-backed securities and of covered bonds. In addition, we will start purchasing on the secondary market investment-grade securities issued by euro area governments, public agencies and European institutions. The purchases will start in March. The combined purchases of public and private securities will amount to EUR 60 billion per month. The programme is intended to last until the end of September 2016. In any case, it will last until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation which is consistent with its aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. As in the case of existing purchases of private sector securities, the purchases of public securities have a high transmission potential to the real economy. They will further support a broad-based easing of financial conditions in the euro area, including those relevant for the borrowing conditions of euro area firms and households. In fact, we have already seen some positive effects of our measures. Financial conditions in money and bond markets throughout the euro area have eased further. Accordingly, lending rates to households and firms have come down considerably. Loan dynamics have continued to recover, with the growth in credit to the private sector turning positive in December for the first time since mid-2012. Also, evidence from the recent January 2015 Bank Lending Survey provides positive signals, showing a further improvement in credit standards for all loan categories in the fourth quarter of 2014. Moreover, most recently, we have also seen a measurable improvement in indicators of business and consumer confidence. Overall, our measures will support economic activity, underpin the firm anchoring of medium- to long-term inflation expectations, and contribute to a sustained return of inflation towards a level below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Let me now briefly comment on the ECB’s commitment to accountability and transparency. Today’s session is also an opportunity to take a wider perspective on ECB policies. In that context, let me touch upon a topic that is of high relevance to you: the ECB’s accountability and transparency. Accountability of the central bank is the essential counterpart to its independence. To this end, the ECB has an elaborate framework to discharge accountability to European citizens and your House, and today’s debate is a key element of this framework. Taking up new tasks in the supervisory field required adding further elements to this framework, and I believe the first months of operation of the SSM have proved our commitment to accountability in this domain as well. But accountability would not be meaningful without an appropriate degree of transparency. From the start – due also to its unique institutional set-up – the ECB has striven to be transparent. For instance, we were the first major central bank to hold a regular press conference immediately after our policy meetings. The ECB also regularly publishes a variety of data on the execution of its monetary policy operations and the liquidity conditions of the Eurosystem. But more recently, we have decided to go one step further and to publish regular accounts of Governing Council monetary policy discussions, starting with the meeting of 21-22 January 2015, the account of which was published last Thursday. Through these accounts, we are enriching the communication of the rationale behind our monetary policy decisions and seek to give a sense of the discussion that has taken place among Governing Council members and the main arguments that were exchanged. We believe that this will enable members of the public and markets to improve their understanding of our assessment of the economy and our policy responses in the light of evolving conditions: in other words, our so-called ‘reaction function’. In the current circumstances, it will also underpin our forward guidance on interest rates. It will thereby further enhance the effectiveness of our monetary policy. Finally, one comment on the future of European Monetary Union governance. The past few years have been challenging for the conduct of our monetary policy in view of the environment of financial fragmentation, which brings me to the topic of the foundation of our economic and monetary union. At the beginning of the European Monetary Union stood a clear commitment by Member States to converge economically and institutionally. Progress has been significant when it comes to common institutions, at least as far as monetary policy is concerned. We now have not only one currency and one central bank, but also one supervisor, one resolution authority, one crisis-management mechanism and, hopefully, one capital markets union. These institutions are built on the principle of shared sovereignty and of strong enforcement of common rules. Together, these institutions clearly set the euro area apart from the arrangements that were in place prior to the start of the European Monetary Union. But we have not yet reached the stage of a genuine European Monetary Union. Economic convergence has not been as sustainable as was hoped for at the outset. This still puts at risk the long-term success of monetary union when faced with an important shock.  In my view, there are two complementary responses to address this situation. First, the economies of the euro area Member States need to become more resilient. This requires sound public finances, but in particular at the current juncture, decisive reforms of their economic structures. Fully applying the strengthened economic governance framework will support this objective. Second, in the medium to longer term, we need to move from a system of rules and guidelines for national economic policy-making to a system of further sovereignty-sharing within common institutions so as to strengthen our economic policy governance. A common rule is only as strong as the common institution that can enforce it. The discussions on the new Four Presidents’ Report will certainly provide a good opportunity to think further on these matters, and I am looking forward to your views in the upcoming Berès report on the economic governance framework.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 173, "date": "2015-02-25.json", "name": "Valdis Dombrovskis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, let me first of all thank the rapporteur, Mr Zalba Bidegain, and the Committee on Economic and Monetary and Affairs (ECON) and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL) for their valuable work on this report. The ex-post assessment of the ECB’s activities by Parliament is an important part of the democratic accountability of the ECB. This is a necessary complement to the ECB’s independence. The Commission shares Parliament’s view that the ECB’s independence in the conduct of its monetary policy, as enshrined in the Treaties, is crucial to the objective of safeguarding price stability. President Draghi has explained how the ECB has addressed some of the concerns expressed by Parliament during 2013-2015. This has been done in particular through interest rate cuts, the introduction of an expanded assets purchase programme – also called quantitative easing – and the conduct of the series of targeted long-term refinancing operations, or LTROs. With these recent policy measures the ECB has demonstrated a clear commitment to address the risk of too prolonged a period of very low inflation, measures aimed at improving bank lending to the euro area non-financial private sector and fulfilling the ECB price stability mandate. As the measures work through the real economy, they will gradually improve financing conditions, reduce financial fermentation, support growth and jobs and bring inflation closer to the ECB target of below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. The Commission shares Parliament’s views that we need to use the opportunities that monetary policy and low energy prices are creating to move forward with adequate fiscal and structural reforms and policies. We must act both on the demand and supply side of our economies. On fiscal adjustments, according to the latest Commission forecast, the fiscal stance in the EU is now expected to remain neutral in the coming years, which means that fiscal policy will not wait on growth going forward. But Member States still need to secure long-term control over deficit and debt levels. The pace of fiscal adjustment going forward should be differentiated according to the fiscal challenge faced by different Member States. Those with sustainability challenges should continue adjustment and Member States with fiscal space should use it to support growth. We agree with Parliament’s view that there is leeway to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of the budgets. The tax burden on labour remains high in many countries. Public investment was the main item targeted for cuts, in spite of its growth-enhancing potential. So there is scope to correct those policies. The Commission has made stimulating investment one of its policy priorities. The investment plan for Europe will help to reverse the recent downward trends in investment. It will support strategic project and risk finance, especially for SMEs. This will provide an additional boost to job creation and the recovery of the euro area economy. At Member State level, ambitious implementation of structural reforms and product services and labour markets can contribute to increasing productivity, regaining competitiveness and improving the business environment, thereby also fostering investment. This should help to rebalance our growth model. It should lessen the negative impact of the necessary financial deleveraging and should prevent the accumulation of harmful macroeconomic imbalances. Let me conclude by underlining that I see much common ground between your views and those of the Commission. It is reassuring to know that we can count on your support in building the foundations for sustainable growth and job creation in Europe.

The situation in Greece concerns us. We must also think of the other Member States, which have acted in European solidarity and have themselves made great efforts to reform. But today we are talking about the ECB's annual report for 2013. The essential message we are making there is just as valid at the moment: monetary measures are not, in the end, a substitute for structural reforms and fiscal consolidation. Our EPP rapporteur, Pablo Zalba Bidegain from Spain, was right to point out that managing the debt crisis consists of a successful combination of different measures. We must ensure that the right incentives continue to be put in place. The implementation of reforms must not be suspended or even delayed. The effects of monetary policy must be assessed not only in the short term, but also in the long term. Possible deflationary risks are certainly not the only guideline. A permanent low-interest-rate policy makes long-term financing on the financial markets more difficult and gradually deprives European citizens of an important basis for retirement provision. We certainly need to look at how the additional funding provided by the ECB is actually being used. If better financing was intended for the economy, it must end up there. This is particularly true of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are to form an essential pillar in Europe's future investment policy. The transmission mechanism must also work better. Pablo Zalba's report rightly highlights this, too.

I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Sleyley, for his excellent report. Zalba Bidegain, who has given us the opportunity to discuss this openly and to be able to contribute to the drafting of this report in different parts in a shared way. The report was about 2013 but, given the delay, we did not fail to focus on what happened also in 2014 and this beginning of 2015, in this incessant activity almost of the Central Bank, which tried to counteract the fall in the level of inflation to the state of real recession in some countries and the slowdown of the real economy until deflation in some cases , with policies that have tried in every way to add liquidity to the system and which, as has been mentioned, have often also clashed with the vileness of the situation, which has not always favoured the positive transfer of the effects of monetary policies, liquidity injections through policies on ABS and LTRO until this beginning of 2015 when the Central Bank decided on this important policy , also massive, of quantitative easing.  I do not believe that this would take the attention of the Member States away from continuing the process of reform and attention to their budgetary policies, but there was certainly an extreme need if we were to transform, to change once and for all this progressive deterioration in the level of inflation and the achievement of deflationary positions in some countries.  I think we should thank President Draghi for what he has done so far. I think back to the famous 'Whatever it takes' speech in London, which gave an important signal to the market about the irreversibility of the euro area, and I also think that with Jackson Hole it has contributed, together with the Italian Presidency, to a change in European policies that have stopped looking only at rigour, budgetary stability, but have introduced the issue of flexibility and growth in a clear way. , certainly together with the reforms that we continue to see.

Madam President, after thanking the rapporteur, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Zalba, I would like to point out that today's debate gives us the opportunity to raise some serious questions about the functioning of the European Central Bank. Mr Draghi, how will you deal with the conflict of interest that exists within the ECB? Because the European Central Bank has now become a state in state. The ECB is a supposedly independent monetary policy institution, at the same time overseeing Europe's 130 largest systemic banks. But it is also a lender to the Member States of the European Union, having bought, and indeed with a skodo, government bonds worth EUR 217 billion on the secondary market. It made 80% of its profits in 2013. The ECB is also a member of the Troika, which has impoverished the countries of the Memorandum. As early as March 2013, the European Parliament in its resolution has called for the removal of this conflict of interest within the ECB. The Same was asked of you on 14 January by the Advocate General of the Court of Justice of the European Union. All this has led to a transformation of the institution of the European Central Bank. What seems to be of interest to the ECB is to secure profits as a lender to the Member States of the European Union. Thus, the ECB has a blackmail policy towards the Peoples of Europe and their democratic governments, supposedly in the name of saving the euro. This was done against Ireland, it was against Cyprus and a few days ago it was also done against Greece with the illegal decision of the ECB not to accept Greek government bonds in Eurosystem operations since 16 February, and you knew very well, Mr Draghi, that Greece until 28 January is on schedule. Mr Draghi, understand this: you are not the man of Europe. You owe respect to the Peoples of Europe. So stop profiting at the expense of the Greek people and immediately return the 1.9 billion euros of the profits made by the ECB from Greek bonds in 2014.

In this respect, Mr Draghi, I am particularly pleased by the ECB commitment to buy European Investment Bank (EIB) bonds in the coming programme of bond purchases. Three weeks ago the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted by a very large majority to call on the ECB to buy EIB bonds, especially those related to investment in infrastructures, such as energy and transport interconnections Europe-wide. EIB bonds based on those projects should be prioritised in those buyings, as clear projects with proven European added value and a positive cost-benefit analysis. For instance, it is strategic for Europe to connect by freight transport the Mediterranean ports with the European markets.  This real-economy-oriented bonds purchase is very important because the QE has to operate on different national markets, each with varying degrees of risk. Thus, it is possible that the QE mainly generates a hike in the stock market without effects on the real economy. There is also the risk that buying corporate bonds will only serve for big enterprises to arrange buybacks without an increase in investment. In contrast, I think that buying securitised loans to SMEs is an important step forward. I hope that its relative importance inside your programme will evolve positively as the market grows. On the other hand, some voices in the financial markets are claiming that they do not want to sell their government bonds to the ECB. It is due to possible losses in the transaction, as most bonds are yielding much less nowadays than the moment when they were bought and a relevant part of bonds today are in a negative territory. Mr Draghi, one final question. In case government bonds targets are not accomplished due to shortages in the markets, is the ECB ready to buy more bonds from the EIB and ABS?", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 179, "date": "2015-02-25.json", "name": "Miguel Viegas", "mepid": "125100", "text": "  gue/NGL Group. – The ECB was set up with a specific mandate, on a logic based on supposed technical neutrality above any political scrutiny. It follows, however, that, faced with objective reality, i.e. the prolongation of the recession and the ineffectiveness of its policies, the ECB has intervened, clearly outof its mandate. After lowering rates to low levels, and in the face of a lack of tangible results, the ECB has gone from the system's liquidity provider to a long-term financier, with maturities rising three and four years. Directly or indirectly, he began to direct the policies of several sovereign states. He began buying ABS securities, i.e. securitised private debt-based products that were the basis of the current financial crisis. Finally, the ECB takes over banking supervision this year, thus concentrating a set of immeasurable powers, without their counterparts in the chapter of democratic legitimacy. Of course, we are in the antipodes of this model which, in practice, puts at the service of finance and banking and places sovereign states to the dictatorship of markets.  I have some questions. Recently, rating agency Standard and Poor's was ordered to pay a fine of several billion euros for misleading investors about the quality of real estate loans. The ratings of this agency are an integral part of the eurosystem's credit assessment framework, I ask, what assessment is made on this situation? Secondly, according to the opinion of the Advocate General of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the ECB's purchase of sovereign debt on the secondary market is incompatible with its presence in the teams negotiating the adjustment programmes, which are imposed on the beneficiary countries, i.e. the troika, I also ask what assessment does it make of this opinion?", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 180, "date": "2015-02-25.json", "name": "Philippe Lamberts", "mepid": "96648", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, I welcome Mr Draghi to this House. Mr Draghi, as a committed European I have always had somewhat ambiguous feelings towards the ECB under your leadership and you know that. On the positive side I must say that you have always shown decisiveness, even in uncharted territory, when it came to buying time for policy-makers to take up their own responsibilities and for that I believe that we Europeans should be thankful for your action, and I mean it. On the other hand, and you know this, I find that frequently you have overstepped your role by actually stepping into political territory, especially when you were advocating and sometimes intimidating governments into taking structural reforms which were politically oriented. Of course I respect political orientations but I have always said that it was not for central bankers to decide on that. But in the latest case, when the Greek Finance Minister declared his country bankrupt, I recognised that you, as the ECB, had little choice but to take the decision that you took: saying, well, if the finance minister says that his country is bankrupt, if I want to keep the credibility of the ECB, which is of course its golden value, we have no alternative but to say we cannot accept this as collateral. So there I recognise that you had no alternative. I just want to say something about completing the Genuine Monetary Union. You are an independent person and so I would expect you to say the obvious: there has been no monetary union, ever in human history, that has worked without being a true budgetary union, a true fiscal union on the income side of the equation as well as on the expenditure side of the equation. You used to say that. And there is no fiscal union without a democratic union, because there should be no taxation without representation. We do indeed need a federal body that is able to make the necessary transfers to compensate for the macroeconomic imbalances that exist in any monetary union.

I would like to ask you whether you are not enough to have won this battle with Tsipras, but whether you want to win the war with Greece directly, because that is what we are talking about.  This is not, of course, a war fought by armies, but an economic and financial conflict in which the Greek people lose out, and we cannot accept that. The Greek people wanted to give a strong signal at the last elections, the anti-system parties are now the majority, and it is right that this should be the case, because those who have ruled the Greek country over the last twenty years are certainly the first culprit in the situation in which we find ourselves today, guilty, for example, of rigging the accounts to enter the single currency with the complicity of Brussels. , of course, many of the problems that we have not yet been able to solve have begun.  There are rumours on many sides that Greece will be given the opportunity to leave the euro, and these are not dangerous subversives. The last authoritative position is that of a convinced Pro-European, the former President of French Giscard d'Estaing. President Draghi, have you seriously thought about what you are doing? You have deprived the Greek people of their freedom of choice and made their decisions irrelevant. I appeal to the lack of intellectual honesty that still remains, and I would ask you to admit this. He did so yesterday, betraying the real intentions of this Europe when the President of the Eurogroup said that a country's elections cannot change the line already decided.  That you have killed democracy in the very country that created it is also demonstrated by your choice, Mr Draghi, to reject the new Tsipras government, Greek bonds as collateral, by tying liquidity access to the ELA as soon as it takes office. The interests of banks and finance are more important to you than the choices and will of a people. What significance do you give to financial stability if people no longer have jobs and can no longer get to the end of the month?  The ECB's operations so far have been a failure, with the hundreds of billions of LTRO not used to lift the economy, but only to protect the interests of banks, and the same will happen with TLTRO and quantitative easing. The banking system, as it is structured, is certainly at the basis of the current crisis. The only way out of this is to return to a real and clear banking separation, certainly not to the watered-down proposal recently relaunched by the Commission, which is by no means decisive.  Mr Draghi, you have no popular legitimacy but you actually govern Europe and say the laws of it quietly, and unfortunately it is not a metaphor. I hope that you will be aware of this and take note of the fact that this very serious democratic vulnus also has concrete and often dramatic effects on the lives of citizens, who are forced to suffer absurd economic and drastic social measures.

So I will only say a few words about the interaction between our monetary policy and what is called economic policy: namely structural reforms. We have two issues here: one of substance, that concerns the interaction between supply and demand, and one of legitimacy. As far as the substance is concerned, we have to see that the present economic situation of low output, big economic slack in the euro area and great cross-country differences, with a decline in potential output as well, is mostly due to declining investment and increased structural employment.  But first and foremost, the crisis that started in 2010-2011 was a combined effect of several things that went wrong in the financial markets, but also a total loss of confidence. When we stabilise financial markets, confidence in the financial markets returns first, but confidence in real investment takes much longer, and now we see the first signs. So, all in all, the outlook is more positive than it was a few months ago. It is pretty natural: to make a financial investment, confidence can be, in a sense, easier to get back than making a real investment that is going to last for many years. But is monetary policy by itself going to create growth, employment? You seem to give a lot of responsibilities to the ECB; it has far fewer, in fact, than what you seem to be willing to give it. Can monetary policy produce growth by itself? The answer is no. We know that monetary policy can still determine the basic, necessary conditions for growth, but then you have to have an environment that is growth friendly. You have to make the necessary structural reforms. I often give an example: we have taken unprecedented monetary policy expansion measures which certainly made it easier for the banks to give credit. But if someone, for example a youth, was to open a shop and before opening the shop had to wait nine, ten months for the permit, and having got the permit, had to pay immediately a heavy tax on it, what incentive do you think this person has in borrowing money from the banks? That is what I mean by structural reforms; that is what I advocate, and I do not think I am infringing on other fields of legitimacy when I advocate the need for structural policies, because these policies will make our monetary policy infinitely more effective than it is. So that is why, as a central banker, I feel perfectly right in urging governments to undertake these monetary policies. They are essential and a good complement for our pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Certainly, many of you said that we need to reconsider the transmission channels. One lesson from the crisis is certainly that the banking channel upon which this continent has relied for all its history is not enough and has proved to be much more fragile than capital-market-based economies. To some extent this is already happening, and capital markets in fact have expanded; bond issuance on capital markets has expanded greatly in the last two years. But capital markets are not yet shaped for SMEs. Most of the credit to SMEs still comes from the banks. That is why the ECB, through the creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) – and, frankly, even before, by national supervisors – has pursued the objective of strengthening, making the financial intermediaries, the banks, more and more resilient so as to make them able to give credit. But we certainly should work more and make sure that this capital market union that we talk a lot about also has as one of its potential beneficiaries the SMEs: those entities that are not large enough to issue bonds on the capital markets. Some of you touched on the conflict of interests, and there are different potential conflicts of interest one can touch upon. The first is that we do monetary policy, and we also do supervision. The European Parliament has been heavily involved by many of you in making sure that this proper separation would be designed exactly to avoid these conflicts of interest, and frankly I must say that, since the SSM became operative a few months ago, I do not see much of it now. But that, I should say, is really thanks to most of you, or to those of you who have worked on this. Someone said that we are subject to the banks and we do the will of the banks. The only answer there is: just ask them; ask them what they feel. Then there is another conflict of interest: the presence of the ECB in the Troika and how would this square with outright monetary transactions (OMT) and quantitative easing (QE). With the OMT, the opinion that the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has issued says that we should look. It did not say that there is a conflict of interest; it says that we should look further, and we are doing so. For OMT countries we are doing so precisely to see whether our role in the Troika could be in conflict with our role as provider of OMT. So at this stage I can simply say: rest assured, it is not something that we ignore; we are seriously thinking about this. This conflict of interests does not arrive at all with QE. QE is a broad-based monetary policy expansion that has nothing to do with programme countries or not. It so happens that in certain countries which do not have a programme or do have a programme there are certain restrictions on the amount of bonds that we can purchase. But that is nothing to do with having a programme or not having a programme. Let me respond to two what I might call popular mistakes. The SMP profits: you still believe that the SMP profits are owned by the ECB and are kept there? That is not so. The SMP profits, like any other profit, have been distributed to all the central banks – members of the ECB – and the central bank members of the ECB have transferred their profits to their national budgets. And the national budgets have transferred their profits to Greece. So they are there, available for financing. (Interjection from Mr Marias) No, no, no: agreed to transfer the equivalent of income made by the euro system on the SMP portfolio to Greece as grants out of their own budgets as long as Greece complies with the programme.

The ECB transferred these profits to the member banks. The member banks transferred these profits to the national budgets, and these profits are now available as grants out of their own budgets as long as Greece complies with the programme. Therefore this operation reflects a commitment by Member States, not by the ECB. There is no euro system involvement in this operation. Someone touched on the waiver. Let me make it clear that the issue of the waiver is an issue of rules. The ECB accepts from the banks of all countries bonds, government bonds, as collateral only if these bonds are rated above a certain threshold. In the case of Greece, these bonds were below this threshold, and years ago, when Greece accepted the programme and was complying with the programme, we said that maybe we can waive this threshold and accept these bonds as collateral anyway. The thinking behind this was that maybe with the programme, the economic situation will improve to the point where these bonds become better rated, so we can accept that. But when the waiver decision was taken, the Governing Council clearly stated that if it did not assess the presence of a programme, the waiver would be lifted. You say no; we say yes; we do this. We are the ones who actually wrote the minutes of that decision. At some point we decided that there were no other conditions for a successful completion of the review of the programme. So the ECB had no choice other than to lift the waiver. Having said that, we are ready to reinstate the waiver as soon as the Governing Council decides that the conditions for a successful completion of the programme are in place. My final comment is about the future genuine monetary union. It is not true actually; I never said anything about that. I said what I thought I could say in a speech given in Helsinki two or three months ago, if I am not mistaken. But here is exactly a field where a central banker can only point out the fragility of the present construction – which, I fully agree, is a fragile construction – and possibly in general terms what the next steps could be. It is pretty clear that an institution-based integration is much stronger than a rules-based integration. The first type of integration is exactly supplied by the example of monetary policy. There we have successfully, in a sense, integrated our monetary policies. If we go back to the time before the euro, we had a rules-based monetary policy in a sense – you remember that, before the euro? In the budgetary policy we have an integration that is rules-based – and which is the more successful of the two? That is what I basically explored very briefly in the speech given in Helsinki some time ago. Finally, on fragmentation, I think the ones who said that it has taken time for our monetary policy to go and find its way through the economy are absolutely right. It has taken a long time. We started with monetary expansion – monetary policy – almost three years ago, at the end of 2011, and we have started seeing the first positive signs – I would not say now; we have been seeing this in the last two or three or four months. Having said that, we have got to be aware that not all countries are the same. In some countries monetary policy – our monetary policy expansion – was fully transmitted through the economy and immediately produced good effects, and in other countries it did not. And so we should also ask ourselves: why is this so?

Investment policies are therefore good, but we really need more connection with the real economy in order to limit the fragmentation of markets and, above all, to support small and medium-sized enterprises. Today, for the first time, you have explained the content of the expression 'structural reforms' going into detail: administrative simplification, the one that is lacking in many countries and whose lack continues to cause damage and delays to small and medium-sized businesses.  The main problem of this period, therefore, more than monetary policy, is financial policy. The political contact of the ECB and the Greek Government in recent days cannot guarantee prospects for financial stability. We are seeing a ups and downs of the markets every day. From the total contrast, two weeks ago, with the ECB's decision to no longer accept Greek government bonds as loan guarantees, to the growth of Greek stock exchanges, after the presentation of new measures to revive the economy and the decision to extend the bailout until June, and then the two-week extension of the emergency liquidity plan granted to Greek banks by the ECB.  It is today's news that the ECB, the International Monetary Fund and the Eurogroup have given their approval to the Greek Government's programme which, although unclear, seems to give a chance against the risk of bankruptcy. And then, in the afternoon, the statement by the Greek Finance Minister: we will not have liquidity problems in the public sector, but we will have problems repaying the instalments to the International Monetary Fund now and to the ECB in July.  That, Mr President, is precisely this climate of uncertainty that must be resolved. Because you know that Europe's credibility is at stake here.

Fortunately, the European Central Bank has had the capacity, strength and independence to make the choice to make this qualitative leap and thus to make full use of its prerogatives to fulfil its mandate, guaranteeing a credible increase in its budget through, precisely, the programme of purchase of 60 billion monthly private and public securities. An appropriate measure? A measure which, as President Draghi rightly said, has a high rate of transmission to the real economy and which is fully within the mandate that the Treaties assign to the ECB.  Of course, unconventional monetary policy measures are a necessary but not sufficient condition for dealing with the macroeconomic problems facing us, and so what the report says is perfectly true and that they must be placed in a broader context, in an appropriate policy mix that must focus on investment policies, structural reforms and an ability to achieve non-procyclical budgetary consolidation. , but actually a friend of growth. In this respect, I have to say that the recent communication on flexibility and also the decisions that the Commission is taking are heading in the right direction and, together with the launch of the Juncker plan, show an awareness of the need to achieve an effective policy mix, in line with jackson hole's well-known speech. The independence of the ECB requires, as has been said, transparency, accountability and accountability requires transparency, and so, of course, Parliament and the ECON Committee particularly welcome the publication of the minutes of Governing Council meetings, the breadth of which we appreciate and at the same time understand and share the relative limits of confidentiality that we believe are necessary.  The European Parliament is also fully aware of its responsibilities as supervisor of the single supervisor, as assigned to us by the Regulation and the Interinstitutional Agreement, and we will seek to exercise these prerogatives to the full. The first steps of the SSM are encouraging and yet due attention must also be paid to the risk, in some way, that the necessary strengthening of prudential requirements will not, however, have a procyclical effect in contrast to the policy mix that is being built to put Europe back on the path to growth.  Finally, economic and monetary union. I very much welcome the considerations of the Helsinki speech, repeated today by President Draghi, on the need to make a qualitative leap from rules-based integration to one based on institutions. Parliament has given its opinion on this and will again express its opinion in Mrs Berès' report. Of course, it is striking that the document presented to the European Council and the related issues is skirmish, and we would like it not to start from scratch, but also on the basis of the work we did during the last parliamentary term with the Commission document and the reports prior to the four Presidents, this process of deepening economic and monetary union actually takes the necessary step forward.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 193, "date": "2015-02-25.json", "name": "Stanisław Ożóg (ECR). -", "mepid": "124897", "text": "   Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Unfortunately, the future of the European Union is not very optimistic and impressive. Attention should be paid to the fact that economic activity and economic growth remain very low and, worse still, are declining. This is compounded by an intimidatingly low inflation rate that could prove deadly for the European economy. We are in danger of falling prices, lack of economic drive, rising unemployment, which could result in an even greater crisis. I am also concerned about the situation in the small and medium-sized enterprises sector, which employs more than 70% of the workforce in Europe. If there is no access to finance in this sector, it will exacerbate the problem of achieving economic recovery, which is such a major threat to us in the current situation. I therefore call on the European Central Bank to look particularly at this sector. And I am not talking about further regulations for SMEs, on the contrary, about loosening the regulations already in force.  My question also concerns the possibility of economic stimulation other than the redemption of bonds (de facto reprinting of one trillion euros). Will the current solution of such a powerful financial injection not turn out to be too short-lived and short-sighted as a result?

For, even in the European Parliament, Mr Draghi is not even here to listen to Members and it would be good for him to listen to us, because 2013 was indeed an excellent year to show the failure of the ECB's expansionary monetary policy. Investment not only did not increase but fell by 2 % in the euro area and, for example, in Portugal, fell by 14 %. The ECB could well argue that monetary policy has been sabotaged by recessive fiscal policies, but the problem is that the ECB has been an active part of imposing these recessive policies, in violation of the limits of its mandate. And what was the result? The result was that, between 2009 and 2014, investment fell by 16.3 % in the euro area and, despite all this, the ECB continues to impose austerity, as we have now seen in the negotiations in Greece, both before the elections and after the elections, with unacceptable, arbitrary and illegal blackmail manoeuvres.

What we have to regret is that it is perhaps too late, not least because there is already an obvious risk of decoupling between what monetary policy is and its real effects. But in any case, the measures announced by the Bank's Governing Council on quantitative easing are welcome, as well as the appeal that, once and for all, this be completed with fiscal support measures, which has obviously not been done or will be done so far, because everyone knows that the Juncker plan is not a serious plan to address this issue. I therefore welcome the european Central Bank's quantitative easing measure. However, once again, and it has already been said in the debate, we must criticise the european central bank's constantly exerting political interference on issues for which it has no mandate. The Statutes of the European Central Bank do not instruct its Governing Council to have an opinion and policy on certain things, let alone on structural reforms. And not only that: the role we saw the European Central Bank played in the case of Ireland's bailout with the publication of the exchange of letters we saw recently... and the last chapter we've lived on Greece. With regard to the latter, I have to say that the interference which the European Central Bank has exercised in the midst of trading has been totally unacceptable by no means of accepting Greek sovereign bonds as collateral to give liquidity to Greek commercial banking. This decision is an arbitrary decision of the Governing Council and was taken in the midst of negotiation to put Greece in a situation of weakness in the negotiation, and I believe that this is totally democraticly unacceptable and what is the role of the European Central Bank itself.  From that point of view, I believe that the opinion of the Advocate General of the Court of Justice should be held in which he points out that the European Central Bank should now refrain from participating in bond-buying programmes if it is currently participating in a financial assistance programme. I think that was good news.

But what fundamentals will have changed in four months’ time? We will still be in the same position. In the words of the President of the Commission, Mr Juncker, ‘there can be no democracy against the EU’s treaties’. So the democratically expressed wishes of the Greek people will be denied to them once again. One might well ask how will they react to that? Well, it just so happens that, about the same time as this four months’ extension of the bailout ends, the EU Member States must vote unanimously to continue sanctions against Russia. So the EU may well have gained four months but it has given the Greek Communist government an opportunity to threaten to use their veto and by so doing end sanctions against their fellow Communists in Russia. The EU has not so much kicked the can down the road but rather rolled the can a few hundred yards towards President Putin’s panzers, inviting both Greeks and Russians to trample all over it, thereby conflating two of the EU’s greatest catastrophes: firstly, unwarranted neo-imperialist interference in the Ukraine and, secondly, the tyranny of the collapsing euro on southern European states. The EU edges us ever closer to war with Russia, while dictating to the Greek people. Your promise to do whatever it takes to save the euro can only end badly. I was also shocked to see that President Draghi of the ECB did not even stay to hear the views of Mr Gualtieri, the Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the committee responsible for the democratic scrutiny of the ECB.

In 2014, the ECB continued its long-term lending programme to banks with TLTRO. Officially, it is a question of helping the banking system, through preferred-rate loans, in order to open up financing to the real economy. The $1 trillion in liquidity injections from LTROs had mainly enabled banks to improve their financial results by speculating on more profitable sovereign securities. However, the observation is always the same: credit does not pass, banks do not lend and this is especially true for SMEs.  The Bidegain report highlights both the difficulty of access to credit and the interbank crisis, which SMEs still bear the brunt of. This is particularly the case in France, where economic growth is desperately at half-mast. The situation is all the more serious because in the euro area, more than 70% of the financing of the economy is through banking intermediation.  As a result, the ECB has failed and this year's quantitative easing plan can be expected to further lead the balance sheet. This effort will also be in vain.

Fortunately, the way in which the Central Bank, independently, has decided to implement a quantitative easing programme to combat this risk of deflation, is a welcome step forward.

Alternative sources of funding are insufficient, given less developed capital markets, which is why we should strive to develop the potential of banks. In 2013, and even now, the situation regarding bank lending in Europe is unsatisfactory. This is due to the bank indebtedness reported by the ECB's sectoral stress tests.

The bank's policy has prevented a very serious crisis in the last two years. It has avoided the threat of the break-up of the euro area, stabilised the situation on the financial markets and restored confidence in them. It is thanks to Mario Draghi's famous words that he will do whatever it takes to save the euro that something that has not been achieved by the heads of government and the presidents of the Member States for two years has been achieved. Moreover, Mario Draghi achieved this without spending a single euro. I would like to say, congratulating you for this achievement, that the euro area is still in a difficult situation. The investment rate fell more than expected and the savings rate increased. Normally, in such a situation, a fall in the real interest rate should lead to a levelling of savings and investment at a level that ensures full employment. Unfortunately, we now have interest rates close to zero and still savings are greater than investment. This situation leads some economists to thesis that we are experiencing a phenomenon of secular stagnation in Europe. I would therefore like to ask the representatives of the European Central Bank whether they agree with the idea that we are in danger of secular stagnation, i.e. a situation where there is no positive interest rate that will lead to a balance of investment and savings?

We've seen that France is not going to be fined. We have seen a good deal with Greece, which should introduce a reduction in the primary surplus target in June, in the next negotiation.

Of course, the support of the ECB was of great importance; however, the outcome of the negotiations left us with a big question about the financing of the short-term liquidity needs that Greece faces for March until April. Nobody has an answer to that, so a possible response to these needs is the use of ELA funds so that the Greek banks can buy Greek government T-bills.

First of all, I would like to express my regret that Mr Mario Draghi does not seem to think it necessary to listen to the opinions of the Members of the European Parliament. The ECB's report refers to the ongoing balance sheet adjustment process, which is a key problem for economic activity in southern Europe. Draghi has been trying to achieve this process of balance sheet adjustment for years by easing the burden on debtors with low interest rates. But did it work? The results from Italy speak for themselves: since the end of 2013, the number of bad loans in the Italian banking sector has increased by around 20 billion and continues to grow rapidly. We have a clear over-indebtedness situation for many private market participants here, which is obviously not improved by low interest rates. Despite this policy, the Italian economy is on the ground and the indicators remain poor. We know that Mr Draghi and Mr Schäuble have no sympathy with German savers and taxpayers and have just pumped EUR 70 billion back into insolvent Greece. But what about his own country?

It is a risk that the ECB has also calculated when taking measures to pump quite a huge amount of money into the economy, and the deflationary spiral is undoubtedly a huge risk that threatens the economy. The worst option is when prices fall, because everyone expects them to continue to fall, so even people put off their investments and purchases.

This is an important component of the ECB’s transparency and democratic accountability. The ECB has demonstrated a clear commitment to address the risk of too prolonged a period of very low inflation, and it will continue to play a key role in the overall policy-setting of the euro area. It is also now time for public authorities at all levels to take responsibility within their respective mandates. Following today’s debate, I note only that most of the questions were addressed to the ECB, and I think it is up to the ECB to find a way to respond to those questions. I will just take up one point which was been raised about Greece. In fact, if you look at Greece’s programme, Greece has already recovered a considerable part of its loss of competitiveness prior to the crisis and, while implementing structural reforms, it keeps recovering those losses. Actually the whole point of structural reforms is to strengthen the competitiveness of the country, and that is exactly what Greece has been doing to deal with its economic problems within the euro area. Let me conclude by repeating the three main pillars of the EU’s economic and social policy in 2015. First, a coordinated boost to investment; second, a renewed commitment to structural reform; and third, responsible fiscal policies. Simultaneous action in all three areas is critical to restore confidence and to reduce the uncertainty that is holding back investment. The impact of the crisis has not only been cyclical, as highlighted by the weakness in aggregate demand. It also has a significant structural component, which has lowered the potential growth of EU economies. We therefore need to use the opportunities that monetary policy and low energy prices are creating to move forward with adequate fiscal and structural reforms and policies, both on the demand and supply sides of the economies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 223, "date": "2015-02-25.json", "name": "Pablo Zalba Bidegain", "mepid": "96763", "text": "  Rapporteur. - Mr President, let me first regret Mr Draghi's absence, but it must also be said in his defence that this debate was scheduled at 5:30pm and has begun more than an hour late.

It's not enough to suggest the wrong course. We need to indicate the right direction. The US entered this economic crisis long before the EU, but it is in much better shape than we are.

In the EU for years some people have seen ghosts, such as inflation, to get to talk about the opposite today, about the risk of deflation.

In other words, unemployment has indeed decreased, however, there have been significant differences in unemployment rates between Member States. Croatia registered a high unemployment rate of 17.3% when joining the European Union in 2013.  I am deeply concerned about the very small decline in the youth unemployment rate.

A major problem is also the lack of credit for SMEs in some Member States. SMEs are the backbone of the European economy and its rapid recovery, so it is imperative that the ECB considers the possibility of launching a specific programme to support their access to loans.

I welcome the European Central Bank's willingness to take the necessary steps to save the euro, although economic activity has still slowed with negative GDP growth in the euro area in 2013, where there is also a high unemployment rate, especially for young people.

After five years of waiting, the ECB fired the last cartridge in a desperate attempt to revive the eurozone economy, but quantitative easing comes too late to effectively counter the deflationary spiral.  As with previous LTOs, the most likely outcome is that the wave of liquidity injected will become trapped in the whirlwind of speculative finance and not reach the real economy. This is because the main issues that continue to block credit and productive investment in Europe have not been resolved, primarily the fight against speculation and the need for fiscal harmonisation, and everything has been focused on structural reforms and austerity.  For monetary policy to be effective, in reality, the eurozone urgently needs real structural reform of the banking system, based on the separation of credit and financial assets, in order to get banks back to raising savings with the sole purpose of securing credit to the real economy. Furthermore, the European version of QE, an unconventional monetary policy measure par excellence, has already become the symbol of a failed monetary union and an 'unconventional central bank' which, as demonstrated by the need to limit risk-sharing on the ECB to a measly 8%, fails even to express a single monetary policy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 237, "date": "2015-02-25.json", "name": "Milan Zver (PPE)", "mepid": "96933", "text": "  Writing. – The World Bank recently warned euro area countries that they are at risk of a renewed recession or permanent stagnation that could lead to a new debt crisis in the EU.

Recent events in Venezuela – the arrest and detention of the Caracas Mayor and veteran opposition leader Antonio Ledezma last week and reports of the alleged intimidation and mistreatment of Leopoldo López and other imprisoned opposition leaders and students who participated in last year’s protest – are unacceptable. 2015 is an electoral year in Venezuela, with legislative elections due in the second semester. It is important for the European Union and the international community to be as supportive as possible of the country’s democratic process and institutions.  But at the same time, we would expect, in an electoral year, every effort to be made by the government in power to show that upholding the principles of democracy is a priority in the run-up to elections. The government should have confidence in the wisdom of the electorate to assess their performance and vote accordingly. Likewise, the people of Venezuela should be able to have confidence that the forthcoming elections will take place in a fair and transparent manner. In this context, the imprisonment of political figures and opposition leaders, as well as the restrictive environment for the media, are truly regrettable. We have already conveyed our concern about the multiplication of violent incidents in the country. We have called for the government, opposition leaders, students and Venezuela’s civil society to work together to engage in peaceful dialogue and reject violence and overcome the situation. It is worrying that much-needed conciliation has made no progress. It is fully in the power of the government to take the first steps to de-escalate the current political polarisation by reaching out and enabling dialogue to take place. We will continue to monitor closely the cases of the opposition politicians as well as the students indicted at the same time, and we renew our appeal for full respect of the principle of the presumption of innocence and due legal process. If there is no evidence for accusations, those detained should be released without delay. We are well aware that Venezuela is confronted not only by political challenges but also by very serious economic, social and security problems. These include spiralling inflation – according to the Central Bank of Venezuela, general inflation had reached 68.5% by December last year, and inflation in food products is over 100%. There are increasing shortages of basic goods, rising social tensions and record levels of crime and insecurity. The severe drop in global oil prices will produce further difficulties and will challenge the ability of the state to meet its 2015 targets. Against this backdrop, we warmly welcome the recent renewed offers by Venezuela’s regional partners, such as UNASUR, to facilitate talks. We appreciate the important role Venezuela has played in contributing to regional integration. It has the potential to contribute to regional growth and prosperity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 240, "date": "2015-02-25.json", "name": "Luis de Grandes Pascual", "mepid": "28393", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, your words have been courageous and I am left with the expression you have used to describe what is happening in Venezuela: 'unacceptable'. I certainly subscribe. Mr President, again, and sadly, the European Parliament has a duty to take care of Venezuela, when the one-year stand of Leopoldo López's confinement in the Bolivarian dungeons alongside more than sixty people between opponents and students in equal circumstances. When, manu militari, the mayor of Caracas, Antonio Ledezma, is arrested, beaten and locked up, can this Parliament remain silent? Neither can nor should he, in my judgment.  We must raise our voices again, from respect, of course, to the Venezuelan people, but condemning without mitigation President Maduro's conduct.  At the moment it is preparing to withdraw the immunity of Mr Julio Borges, who has already been assaulted in the House in the face of the passivity of its President, Diosdado Cabello. The next step could be the imprisonment of María Corina Machado. Today we get the invasion of the headquarters of the Copei. Today too, the media around the world echoes the news of the death of a 14-year-old. He's shot dead. And even without attributable to anyone in particular authorship, this could happen, it was foreseeable that it would happen. Why was the use of real fire authorized to suppress demonstrations? Does this death also want to be charged to the opposition's account, as was done with Leopoldo López? Ladies and gentlemen, there are more than indications that President Maduro, with his imaginary accusations that attempts at a coup, will suspend the freedoms and the forthcoming parliamentary elections. I call on the friendly countries, as the Vice-President has done, and venezuela's neighbours, to boost sanity and prevent this accelerated process of involution. The European External Action Service must deploy its good offices, and the resounding denunciation of so many undemocratic dismantling must be accompanied by as many movements as necessary to preserve individual and collective freedoms at clear risk in that beloved and great country that is Venezuela. In the Strasbourg plenary session we will have time to analyse the content and scope of the Resolution. It'll be suited to what's going on from now until then. In any case, I ask with the solemnity and firmness that the case deserves the immediate release of Leopoldo López and the release of Antonio Ledezma. I make an alert call for respect for the parliamentary immunity of Julio Borges of First Justice.  President Maduro, the whole world is aware of your behaviors.

We do regret the death of a 14-year-old in the city of San Cristobal on Tuesday, in circumstances not yet fully clarified, but, it seems, the victim of a shooting of a police officer, meanwhile arrested. The extreme of antagonisms between the government and the opposition points dangerously to a point of no return. We, as European parliamentarians, must seek to make a calm and constructive assessment of this situation that distresses Venezuelans and is a hotbed of dangerous instability in Latin America. We must, moreover, begin by calling on both sides to respect the Venezuelan constitutional order scrupulously. That the democratically elected government hold the electoral calendar firmly and legislative elections are called, as expected, by the end of this year and that the opposition continue to defend its alternative project, within the framework of constitutionality and absolute respect for democratic rules. We know how complex the situation is in Venezuela. We recall that, following the demonstrations in February 2013, of which 43 were killed, talks were initiated between the government and the opposition and that it was the opposition, with significant internal tensions between a moderate faction and a more radical faction, which at that time decided to abandon the talks. But at the moment, we must vehemently disprove the methods of political combat used by the Venezuelan government, contrary to the good rules of democratic coexistence and respect for the right to opposition and ideological divergence. These methods have set up serious violations of the legality of human rights, and have been widely condemned by the UN, Human Rights Watch and, more recently, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Venezuela has obligations in this area, even as a member of Mercosur, which it cannot fail to respect. We must also regret the excesses committed by the security forces in the repression of the demonstrators. Although, as a result, several police and military personnel are under investigation, the government approved on January 28 a resolution allowing the army to use firearms to suppress demonstrations. We also have to condemn the arrests of opposition leaders or figures, based on suspected coup preparations against President Maduro's government: after Leopoldo Lopez, we are now witnessing the arrest of the metropolitan mayor of Caracas, for having signed a national transition agreement that, according to government-linked sources, calls for a takeover by non-democratic means. The reading of this document does not authorise this type of conclusion because it also does not contribute to anything to be constantly feeding and propagating conspiracy theories, always based on a background narrative of an alleged imperialist interference of the United States. This does not contribute to the resolution of the problem. The situation is serious and, for its resolution, in addition to the contribution of the whole of society and all Venezuelan political actors, it is important to participate in UNASUR, the organization of the American States and Mercosur, but it is also very important to participate in the European Union and this Parliament, in particular, and therefore the final appeal I make here is precisely so that the European Parliament does not fully take over its responsibilities , finding as much consensus as possible the most appropriate ways to compete for the resolution of such a serious problem that affects a country particularly friendly to Europeans, such as Venezuela.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 242, "date": "2015-02-25.json", "name": "Charles Tannock", "mepid": "4521", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, two days ago Kluiver Roa was just a young, fourteen-year-old Venezuelan boy from the city of San Cristobal.

Perhaps because this Resolution, however harsh and demanding, contains only words. And words are carried away by the wind, as we say in Spain. Words against aggression by a regime against its people; aggressions that will undoubtedly have, unfortunately, continuity, because Venezuela cannot manage the misconduct of politics and the economy, which is political intolerance and economic incapacity. At a time when he no longer has the money to buy wills, to buy from the critical media, to please his allies and his own leaders, all he has left is repression. And repression, economic crisis, crime, crime, paramilitary commandos... All these factors tell us that in Venezuela all the conditions are being given for a civil conflict, and Europe must raise its voice and realize the effectiveness of its policy in adopting sanctions that force the Government of that country to change its attitude.

Moreover, it is no secret that Over the last 15 years Venezuela and Russia have signed 200 economic cooperation agreements, 57 of which are already operational, nor that China is investing EUR 17 billion in projects in the country. In this sense, the blow resulting from the vertical collapse of oil, of crude oil to 50 dollars per barrel certainly also becomes a coup de grace, although it is still unclear whether the producing countries that pushed it support one of the main players on the field or have a role as autonomous players.  Instead of seriously reflecting on our role as the European Union and as a global player in this potential escalation of titanic proportions, I would say that, unfortunately, I see a climate of football fans in this House, all too often to the point of assuming the role of wise mediators and defenders of peace.

Of course, the usual way of this kind of socialism is to develop conspiracy theories – that is then the evil gringo in the north, these are conspiracies of mayors. It is the classic way: to distract with conspiracy theories and propaganda, while at the same time jailing the opposition, to occupy the mass media, to make long speeches on television – which the opposition must not do – and then to say that we want to wait for free elections and the judges that were then also set up by this regime, and gradually remove free judges from office.

It is an intolerable dictatorial regime that puts on a social mask, but in reality, if one's own objectives are not achieved, it is the case that, because these objectives are so glorious, one can use violence and override democracy.  Democracy is a value in itself.

Not only the latest news of the death of a 14-year-old boy in demonstrations, but also the arrest of the mayor of Caracas, who I believe has crossed the boundaries of what respect for the exercise of an elected office has to be. The coexistence of political authorities chosen of different signs, of different sensitivity, must be normal in democracy and it must also be so that these authorities are protected by the rule of law. To be a democracy, it is not enough just to hold democratic elections, opposition must also be respected and those citizens who share what the opposition stands for must be protected. Political parties, political organizations must work freely in a democratic system and political leaders cannot be criminalized as is happening in Venezuela in some cases with opposition leaders.  We also believe that political polarization, crispness, does nothing to solve the real problems that the country has. And in expressing this view, I am not conspiring against Venezuela, on the contrary, from my point of view, I act and speak as an advocate and friend of venezuelans. Nor is it our mission to give recipes to sovereign governments, to sovereign countries, but we do think that all Venezuelan political representatives should build a space for dialogue, democratic, real, because it will be the only way to be able to address the problems they face right now.

That in Venezuela there is no democracy.  It is true that Maduro was elected in democratic elections, but democracy is not only voting for a government, but also respecting the opposition, respecting political and civil liberties. And when a government begins to cut those freedoms, to imprison opposition leaders, that government becomes an authoritarian regime. And that's why I say that the masks have fallen, that Nicolas Maduro's regime has been smoothly and plainly transformed into a dictatorship.  In the homeland of Simon Bolivar, who is rightly considered one of america's liberators, unfortunately today those who call the the ourselves Bolivarians are the ones who violate freedom.

One year after the protests began, Venezuela has returned to very tense times and a 14-year-old boy, as has already been mentioned, was shot dead during a protest in San Cristóbal. The news coming from Venezuela is still very confusing and fragmented and although President Maduro has condemned the murder, it cannot fail to be pointed out that the student killed is the first victim of the measure adopted on 30 January by the Ministry of Defence of the Maduro government, which allowed the army to start using firearms at street demonstrations and public gatherings.
