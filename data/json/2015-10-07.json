The last two weeks have seen a jihadist resurgence in the north and the east of the country, threatening the achievements reached so far in development, governance and rule of law, including the rights of women, fundamental freedoms and access to basic services. Confronted with the Taliban who wage war, we need to recommit in our support to the National Unity Government and in ensuring that Afghanistan is, and will stay, high on the international agenda. Recent developments in and around Kunduz are worrying for all of us: the Taliban attack, the suffering it has caused to innocent civilians in the area, the very serious humanitarian situation. The overall situation remains fragile and unstable.  The attack that severely hit a Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) hospital in Kunduz on 3 October was a tragedy which I profoundly deplore – as Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management but also as a doctor. Hospitals and medical personnel are explicitly protected under international humanitarian law: they can never be the object of attack. The latest reported death toll indicates that 12 MSF staff are confirmed dead, as well as 10 patients, including three children.  Our thoughts are with all the families of the victims, the medical staff and the humanitarian aid workers. Our thoughts are with all those who, in Afghanistan and in the too many conflict areas around the world, dedicate their time, skills and indeed their life to assisting victims of war, saving their lives and improving their living conditions.  MSF has been operating the hospital in Kunduz under extremely trying conditions – and not only there. I have witnessed myself on numerous visits to crisis areas their dedication in their life-saving work in the most acute emergencies. MSF are there when almost everybody else has pulled out. As EU Ebola Coordinator, I particularly want to commend their outstanding work in relation to the Ebola crisis in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Without the amazing courage and dedication of MSF, the world would still be struggling to get Ebola under control. But let me get back to Afghanistan. Afghan children, women and men are suffering the devastating humanitarian consequences of over three decades of war and conflict. Our tribute, not only to MSF but also to other humanitarian organisations for their life-saving work in Afghanistan and elsewhere, will never be strong enough. This Parliament knows very well what it means to pay tribute to humanitarian workers and human rights defenders. We all owe them a lot. And, as in other conflict situations, humanitarian workers have paid with their lives to assist the most vulnerable. But while we commend the courageous and dedicated staff of these organisations, we have to be firm and clear in affirming the absolute need to protect their lives and their work, and the lives and dignity of those they assist. This tragedy demonstrates the disproportionate risk for civilians when violent conflict reaches urban areas. All parties must do everything in their power to distinguish between military and civilian targets, including medical facilities. All parties must respect and protect medical and humanitarian personnel and facilities.  President Ashraf Ghani said that the Afghan forces and NATO’s Support Mission are obliged to ensure the safety of civilians and exercise precision in military operations. He stressed that Afghan and foreign forces alike must put in serious efforts not to target public places during military operations. At the same time, Afghanistan’s Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) has called for a probe into reports of possible war crimes committed in this past week by the Taliban in Kunduz city. The organisation has appealed to security and judicial organisations to identify the perpetrators and see to it that justice is carried out. MSF and the UN have called for a thorough investigation into the attack. President Ghani and US Secretary of Defence Ashton Carter have stressed that a full and transparent investigation will be conducted. We welcome the Afghan and US commitment to that effect, and expect that it will bring clear results very soon.  But, this tragedy is a sad reminder of the fact that Afghanistan still needs to find its way out of decades of conflicts. It needs a comprehensive answer to the many difficult challenges it is facing: this should comprise continued efforts to engage the main actors, and it has to build on a revised Afghan security strategy. But the focus must also be on local governance and on connecting the local population to the Government. The Afghan Government has presented a string of actions it will take. Effective implementation is required, and we are ready to accompany the Afghan authorities and people in this difficult process. In terms of immediate action we must now quickly evaluate the need for additional humanitarian support. In the same vein, we call on the Afghan Government to facilitate better humanitarian access to Kunduz and to the internally displaced. We need improved humanitarian air services, and we have to look into the possibility of opening a humanitarian corridor in Kunduz province. We also need all regional stakeholders to come together and join efforts to create a lasting peace. This is at the centre of our diplomatic work, as we pointed out in discussions with all the relevant international players last week in New York, at the High Level Conference on the fringe of the UN General Assembly. The European Union will continue to work with the National Unity Government during this difficult period. We will stand at its side and, first and foremost, at the side of all Afghan people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2015-10-07.json", "name": "Arnaud Danjean", "mepid": "96747", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Mr President, Commissioner, the EPP Group would first and foremost like to express its condolences to the families of the 22 victims of the Hospital in Kunduz and to condemn these bombings on which all the light must be shed and the appropriate sanctions imposed. This error, now acknowledged by the American command, after days of unbearable hesitation and squint, is all the more fatal because it destroyed the only efficient medical structure in the Kunduz region, despite the unambiguous communications of MSF staff on the coordinates and the nature of their activities. But behind this tragic event is a very worrying strategic reality in Afghanistan. Taliban offensives on Kunduz but also in Faryab province, near Turkmenistan, and in three other provinces in northern Afghanistan reveal an even more difficult transition than when it was envisaged at the time of the withdrawal of Western forces. The fact that these attacks occur in a region, northern Afghanistan, hithert relatively untouched by insurgent movements, attests that the Taliban threat remains strong, far beyond its traditional strongholds. It also shows that the Afghan security forces, despite heavy, massive and extremely expensive training programmes, still have too random capacity to deal with this type of offensive on their own. Without U.S. air support, Kunduz and other towns in northern Afghanistan would likely still be occupied by the Taliban today. We must also realize that, in parallel with the Taliban, other insurgent groups are growing in power. The Islamic State is now present in Afghanistan and is recruiting heavily among jihadist networks, especially those from Central Asia. The rallying of the Uzbek Islamic movement this summer, as well as the movements on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistan border, where several thousand Central Asian jihadists have been spotted, must alert us to the fragility of the ongoing process.  It also demonstrates that increased international involvement is needed. It is obviously not a question of considering massive military deployments that have shown their limits, but increased cooperation must be sought with neighbouring countries in particular, including with China and Russia, whose current contagion cannot leave us indifferent. Our attention is legitimately focused on other crises that are more close that directly affect our security, but we retain a special responsibility in Afghanistan, where many of the problems we face today have historically had their roots and where there has been an unquestionable legal and legitimate basis, under the aegis of the United Nations, since 2001 to enable us to intervene.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2015-10-07.json", "name": "Afzal Khan", "mepid": "124962", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, on behalf of my Group I extend our deepest condolences to the families and friends of all those who have tragically lost their lives in the attack in Kunduz. Our thoughts are with their families. We pay tribute to the Doctors Without Borders staff who bravely and selflessly worked as fighting raged in Kunduz over the past week. We also applaud all other heroic doctors and other medical staff around the world who risk their lives every day trying to save others. The hospital was clearly marked and the exact location of the hospital was communicated to all parties to the conflict. More than 22 civilians were killed in the attack – 12 medical staff and 10 patients, three of them children – and 37 more were injured. We, as a Group, strongly condemn this attack. Under the rules of international humanitarian law, a hospital is a hospital, and the people inside are patients and medical staff. To target a medical facility in this way is a violation of that law, whatever the circumstances. Given the seriousness of the harm and the gravity of the alleged legal violations, it is critical that there is a prompt and full independent investigation to ensure maximum transparency and accountability, and those responsible must be brought to justice. Constantly we see certain measures adopted to counter terrorism violating international laws. We learned earlier this month of David Cameron’s decision to carry out a British drone attack, killing citizens extrajudicially outside the UK. The US routinely violates the airspace of Pakistan and carries out drone attacks resulting in the death of civilians. The objectives are to save human lives and dignity in the face of a terrorist threat. Combating terrorism cannot be used as an excuse for the violation of international laws. There always needs to be a strong response from the EU, and respect for human rights and the rule of law must prevail. We also condemn the Taliban for the violence that they have carried out. The Taliban successes in and around Kunduz are the consequences of corrupt and abusive governance. The Afghan Government needs to be united and needs to focus on legitimate grievances and community consensus building. A political transition which features a genuine inclusive effort is needed, otherwise the security situation is likely to worsen further. The EU and the international community should assist in this through diplomacy and negotiations. Regional cooperation, with the objective of promoting long-term peace, stability and security in the wider region, is essential. The cooperation with Pakistan is especially important: we welcome their assistance in the new conciliation process and encourage continuing progress on the path of improved relations and cooperation between Kabul and Islamabad. Afghanistan must not be forgotten in more pressing crisis. We welcome the help that has been announced this morning for the civilians in the Kunduz area.  Although thousands of kilometres away, we in Europe have been experiencing the effect of the increased instability in Afghanistan. Many Afghans, too, are giving up on their country. Afghans have been devastated by over three decades of conflict. They urgently deserve peace. The US states that this attack was a mistake, but they have now offered four different accounts, hence the need for an independent inquiry. The attack has implications not only in Afghanistan but also for medical NGOs across the world.

I am largely in line with the words of the previous speaker. On behalf of the ECR Group, I would also like to express my condolences to the family and friends of the victims and to the survivors of this terrible bombing. We are all shocked and call for a thorough and independent investigation. How on earth did it happen that aid workers and patients were the victims of an air strike on an NGO hospital?  There is no other way or there have been serious errors of judgment by american and Afghan militaries and even then. The Americans have been operating in Afghanistan for 14 years. Dismissing the bombardment as collateral damage is a cheap and unacceptable excuse. In addition, Médecins Sans Frontières indicates that it has done everything possible to ensure its own safety. Even if there were Taliban fighters in the hospital - which MSF vehemently denies - aid workers had to be warned first.  But the problem goes much further. Due to structural mismanagement by the Afghan government, the Taliban are once again on the rise today. A year after the hailed unity government, there is still no defence minister and the president and prime minister are squabbling over government posts. Meanwhile, the Afghan army is fighting the Taliban with inappropriate equipment and an inept leadership. Because they don't have an Air Force that can make a difference, the Americans enlisted the help. They carried out, against their mandate, bombing. How is it that 7 000 troops have to give up control of a city against a ten-times smaller force?

Clearly, by choosing a hospital as a target, a fatal mistake was made. However, the reasons for this tragedy still remain unclear. I therefore welcome the decision by NATO and the Afghan authorities to launch immediately a thorough and impartial investigation of this tragic event. What happened in Kunduz is a terrible accident, but we cannot view it as an isolated accident. By conquering Kunduz, the Taliban has made the biggest military advance in 14 years. The Taliban’s personnel strength has increased dramatically: by more than six times in the last seven or eight years. The conscripts are mostly from Arab countries and post-Soviet Central Asia, as far as one can read from the reports.  All this is very alarming. The Taliban must be defeated to give Afghanistan a new start. The consequences of our inaction might be unthinkable. I strongly believe that we cannot disregard the overall and unprecedented support which has already been invested in Afghanistan’s security and development. It should be clear from the outset that we cannot repeat the mistakes of Iraq and Syria, where our actions were inadequate. Currently, our efforts in Afghanistan seem far too weak.  It is fundamental to retain the progress made in Afghanistan based on our coordinated strategy, both military and developmental, among the international, regional and local players.

Now is not the time for a black-and-white vision of the world. Innocent people died. People who dedicated their lives to caring for others and carried out their missions in one of the most dangerous countries in the world have died. But instead of recognition and support, they received more than an hour's bombardment that leveled the area's only medical facility. Moreover, it ended the lives of completely defenseless persons and those who cared for them. An attack on medical facilities, staff, or patients cannot be described as anything other than a completely monstrous crime. This is also recognised by international law, but it was brutally trampled on Saturday morning. Instead of apologies, we now hear excuses, and cynicism alternates between lies. It must be guaranteed that, after we offer our deepest condolences to the survivors, we, as the international community, will insist on a thorough and completely independent investigation. This should unstyle what exactly happened and point to the real culprits and not to the scapegoats. This is the only way to make it clear that international law applies equally to everyone. It is not possible to measure by double standards, especially when it comes to such barbaric acts contrary to humanitarian law.  Accepting only an apology is unimaginable, and it does not change the fact that the perpetrator is a state that seeks to act as a protector of democracy and civilization.

People should feel safe in a place of healing, and it is certainly a much needed facility. As we have been told, the coordinates were given, but for whatever reason they were not respected. I think questions are raised yet again about what is really meant by precision bombing, and what the value of such bombing is. We are told that this may constitute a war crime.

Furthermore, as reports emerge suggesting that Russia will consider integrating its troops within battalions loyal to Assad, as rebel Syrian groups announce plans now to jointly fight Russian forces, and as Turkey cites violations of its airspace by the Russian air force, we are just beginning to comprehend the many effects, and the potential for conflagration of further war, that Russia’s latest moves could have.

That is unfortunately true. A quarter of a million people have been killed; 12 million – half of the country’s population – have been displaced. Four million of these have left to Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, and as Europeans we are all aware that many of these refugees are now trying to reach Europe in search of peace and a more human life. Many are predicting new waves of refugees from inside Syria in the months to come. Europe has to handle the humanitarian consequences of this conflict, including the flows of refugees. A high-level conference on the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkans route takes place tomorrow in Luxembourg. We have spent EUR 4 billion so far, making us the biggest international donor and, faced with the additional flows of refugees this year, we are going to spend more. We will spend more on immediate aid for refugees, providing them with shelter and food, and we will also spend more on essential services such as health and education: an additional EUR 1 billion will be mobilised. The first contract opened through the new Trust Fund for Syria deals with schools and education. Syria is losing a whole generation to war and exile: only education can give a future to a whole country. We expect that, by the end of this year, the 500 million that we are putting into the fund will be matched by Member States’ contributions. It is a huge financial effort, reflecting the scale of the crisis. This effort will not in itself halt the refugee flow from Syria: only when there is hope for an end to the war and prospects to return home will the current refugee crisis head towards a conclusion. There is growing consensus in the international community that ending the Syrian war needs a two-track approach. This has been verified during a number of meetings over the past two weeks in New York and in Brussels. On the one hand, we need to successfully fight the terrorist threat of ISIL – or Daesh (a threat, by the way, which is spreading beyond the region) – and in parallel to this, we need to do all we can to support the political process led by the UN special envoy, Staffan de Mistura, to get the Syrians talking to each other again. On the fight against terrorism: the EU is not militarily involved, but we can and do actively support with non-military means the objectives of the global coalition against Daesh. Our engagement goes far, from reducing the threats of radicalisation and the recruitment of new foreign terrorist fighters in European countries to seeing what can be done to stop the flow of revenue to Daesh. But it is in supporting the UN-led peace efforts that the EU has most to contribute. Different regional and international actors have a substantial influence on the Syrian parties. They must assume their responsibilities and finally bring all the players to the table for serious negotiations. The EU is able to engage with all the relevant regional and international powers. We are talking to the Russians, the Iranians, the Saudis and the Turks. I think the Iranians understand that this is going to be their first test to see if they can play a more constructive role after the nuclear deal. The EU also underlines the importance of preserving state structures and functions, in order to ensure security, order and the provision of basic services to the people of Syria during a political transition. We can work on that together with the international community. Similarly, we can also make our contribution to bringing the different strands of the Syrian political and military opposition together behind a common vision and purpose. In July, representatives of the two main umbrella groups of the political opposition, the SOC and the NCC, met in Brussels, having been brought together by the High Representative. During the meeting they agreed a draft roadmap for the future political transition. None of this is going to be easy. The war in Syria is a very complex matter. It has multiple players with many diverging objectives. The latest phase has been marked by military escalation, both by Syrian and by non-Syrian participants. A military escalation in the civil war will lead nowhere: it will only prolong the agony of the conflict. Fighting terrorism is one thing – and in Syria that means fighting the groups defined as terrorists by the United Nations, including Daesh and Jabhat al-Nusra. It does not mean fighting alongside the regime in the civil war. That would only provoke a matching increase in the arms supplies by some regional powers to the opposition. There are measures that would promote de-escalation and peace, an end to the bombing and shelling of civilian areas and an end to the use of barrel bombs. Commitments of this kind could go a long way towards fostering sufficient trust to allow the beginnings of a real dialogue on transition. We can also intensify our humanitarian diplomacy. We can seek ways to provide access and protection, as well as to promote humanitarian principles and consensus on the guideline for the delivery of aid. As recalled by the European Council, the Union is committed to doing its part in supporting the UN-led efforts.

However, as we can see, not enough if we have looked at the food supply in the camps and Syria, and that the cuts by many Member States of the European Union have also led to the current refugee situation. But I don't want to focus on that now. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you made it clear in the second part of your speech that we must bring about the peace process. If this does not succeed, everything else will have only a mitigating effect, but it will not be a solution to the matter. We have to see that we have a web of power-political interests that have made it difficult to bring this together. There is the struggle for regional power, particularly supported by Saudi Arabia and Iran, but also by Turkey's special, not entirely transparent, role in this matter. If it is not possible to bring these countries together and end the proxy war there, which is now threatening them, too, with the advent of Daish – because they must now have their own interest in finding a solution – then that will be nothing. But this also has to do with the great powers. I sometimes have the impression that the second level of proxy wars of the world powers Russia and America still plays a role. How far can Russia stabilize and expand its permanent position of power there? How can America prevent this? That's another level where you don't get together. I believe that the crucial role of the European Union must come into play here. We must work with Russia and America – and this has nothing to do with the Ukraine crisis, that we have to give in – as we have done on the issue of Iran's nuclear weapons. In order to find a solution at this level, to bring together the regional cocks and to find a solution. These two levels must be put together, and I believe it is crucial to achieve this.

But what happened? This is precisely what is being supported by the European people, including Western ones. A 2012 U.S. intelligence report predicted the emergence of the Islamic State. The real scandal, however, is that the report clearly states that this is in the interests of Turkey, Saudi Arabia, but also the Western states, in order to isolate Assad.

With the scale of this tragedy there is little wonder that the humanitarian consequences are quite literally washing up on our shores and I very much echo comments of colleagues on the humanitarian consequences of this tragedy. Our Group has always stressed that the only solution in Syria, the only way in which we can create a safe environment for people to return to, is a political solution. There was a time when concerted intervention by the international community could have helped, but we remain deeply sceptical on current air strikes against the so-called Islamic State. We have seen 7 000 US strikes, and we now see informal US, UK and French engagement, but to little avail. We are tackling the symptoms, rather than the cause.  Adam Garfinkle, a US diplomat turned academic, has criticised US policy on ISIS, and I think his criticism applies to French and British policy also. Tackling ISIS is akin to thinking that you can alter the position of a shadow by doing things to the shadow. We are not tackling the right things. Likewise, we should not be fooled by the actions of Russia in this conflict. Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin’s Chief of Staff, says, and I quote: ‘The military aim of our operations will exclusively be to provide air support to Syrian Government forces in the struggle against ISIS.’ Yet Russian attacks have been in areas with no ISIS presence – against Free Syrian Army positions in Latakia, Homs, Hama and even Aleppo.  The Assad regime has killed eight times more people than ISIS. This Parliament hosted the Caesar exhibition, evidence of brutal torture by this regime. Assad is not a partner in peace.

Before this intervention, we had discussed the possibility of significant diplomatic advances, but they were cut short and Russia acted militarily. Therefore, what we can do now, in my view, is to redouble our efforts from a diplomatic point of view.

The Middle East is in turmoil, with the crisis in Syria – we have just had a lengthy exchange on that – and the presence of Daesh in the region and also in Iraq. The rest of the region is also facing dramatic challenges, from Yemen to Libya. The human tragedies in the Mediterranean, the threats posed by terrorist groups and the multiple conflicts in our neighbourhood are all issues that we can tackle only in cooperation with our partners.  Turkey is indeed a strategic partner for Europe. We need to work in partnership with Turkey if we want to tackle effectively all these crises, and in particular the Syrian one. This cooperation is not only possible, it is absolutely necessary. We share so many interests, the most important one being peace and stability in our common region. For this reason, we have started to increase and deepen further our engagement with Turkey. The visit of President Erdoğan to Brussels and his meetings with President Tusk and President Juncker on Monday are a reminder that dialogue with our Turkish partners at the highest possible level is in the interests of both sides.  The situation in Syria and Iraq has called for the reinforcement of our cooperation on foreign-policy issues and counter-terrorism. The refugee crisis that we are facing in the region shows very clearly that we share a common challenge when managing this dramatic situation. Turkey’s efforts to host more than two million Syrian and Iraqi refugees deserve not only our approval but also our full support and solidarity. The Union is providing financial help; with some EUR 176 million committed by the Commission for direct aid to refugees. The Council’s recent decision to increase the EU’s financial contribution, the Commission’s commitments in this respect and the increased contribution of Member States should help us in putting our forces together.  A couple of weeks ago, the European Union’s Heads of State and Government stressed that there is a pressing need to reinforce our cooperation with Turkey on managing these issues. The challenges we face due to the refugee crisis made it necessary to step up significantly our cooperation on migration and border management. This means too that we have to pursue even further our dialogue towards visa liberalisation. We also need to develop further operational cooperation with a view to preventing illegal migratory flows in the Aegean and Mediterranean and fighting smugglers’ networks which are responsible for the loss of so many lives at our borders.  That is why, on the occasion of President Erdoğan’s visit on Monday, the President of the Commission handed over to him a draft action plan for stepping up cooperation between the EU and Turkey on support for refugees and migration management. The draft plan, which has been made publicly available on the Commission’s website, is now being discussed with the Turkish side to reach agreement on the details.  However, our challenges go beyond that, and our actions should also look further. A reinforced political dialogue between the EU and Turkey, in addition to the accession negotiations, would allow us jointly to address key issues of mutual interest. Turkey is an accession country, but it is also a strategic partner for us in the region. We need to make sure that our work with Turkey develops strongly and consistently on these two dimensions in parallel. As regards the internal political situation, since we last discussed Turkey in this Chamber, there has been some relevant news. All major political parties won representation in parliament in the elections of 7 June 2015, but it was not possible to form a new government. We hope that after the new elections on 1 November 2015, whatever the outcome, a new government can be formed swiftly.  I believe we are all increasingly concerned by the escalation of violence in Turkey and the continuing terrorist attacks. However, measures taken by the Government must be proportionate and targeted, and they should not endanger the democratic political dialogue. A ceasefire is particularly urgent. The interim Government and all political leaders need to come together to guarantee secure and fair elections.  We have to support actively the return to the peace process. In recent years the relaunch of the Kurdish peace process has provided Turkey with the best opportunity in a generation both to resolve a conflict that has claimed far too many lives and to address the needs of all the citizens of the republic. With no peace process in place, this opportunity is at risk of disappearing and there is a risk that instability will continue or even grow.  Honourable Members have expressed on different occasions their views and concerns on this matter. Indeed, as a candidate country negotiating EU membership, Turkey needs to strengthen democracy and the rule of law – and I refer here mainly to the independence of the judiciary and the freedom of the press. These are key areas where Turkey needs to give proof of its strong commitment to the accession process.  We hope to see Turkey re-engaging seriously in reforms, and we are ready and willing to support such reforms with all the instruments at our disposal in order to increase their impact. Opening Chapters 23 and 24 would be in the interests of both Turkey and the EU and would act as a catalyst for reform. Last but not least, the issue of Cyprus: in the last months we have increased consistently the Union’s political engagement in this regard, receiving full support from the work done by the UN Special Adviser – whom the High Representative, Ms Mogherini, met last week in New York – and from the strong political will expressed by the leadership involved in the process. What we see is that the conditions are there for reaching a positive solution and that the time has come for all to put an end to this problem, for the benefit of all. The EU and Turkey need one another. We face the same regional challenges; we share the same need for peace and stability. We need to work as close as possible together, as we have been doing in these past months. We will not have the same views on everything, but this is a reason to intensify even further our exchanges and to develop common lines of action and common frameworks for our crucial partnership on the regional conflicts on counterterrorism, on refugees, on migration, and also on other key issues such as energy. This is the direction we have taken and I am more than convinced that the European Parliament will continue to be a key player, as it has already been over the past years.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 101, "date": "2015-10-07.json", "name": "Cristian Dan Preda", "mepid": "96838", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, as Mr Schmit said earlier, we discussed Turkey in Parliament three months ago, when we were adopting the resolution on the progress report on this country, and – I said then – I now reiterate this: there is a need for a deepening of dialogue and cooperation with Turkey.

Without Turkey we cannot solve this problem, it seems obvious to me. On the other hand, I believe that opening new negotiating chapters is a very important thing.

Secondly, I want to stress the importance of the elections that will soon be held in Turkey. It has been seen that, unfortunately, a compromise could not be reached in Ankara, and I would like to tell our Turkish friends that democracy is not just a one-coloured majority.

Refugees, Syria, energy, our access to the Muslim world in general can be considerably improved if we are aware of the importance of this relationship. I have been a supporter of strengthening this strategic relationship between Turkey and the European Union for many years, but today I am equally concerned. Turkey is going through a political crisis, the result of an economic slowdown, after years of substantial economic progress, but also as a result of President Erdogan's systematic effort to transform Turkey from a parliamentary democracy into an autocratic presidential regime.  But the most dangerous thing today is violence - violence inside Turkey, against the backdrop of terrorist attacks, but also the assault on the Kurdish minority - and violence on Turkey's borders. And this situation demands responsibility from all leaders, calls for prudent action, to avoid any escalation of violence or slippage.  President Erdogan's actions in recent times have been rather contrary. Against the backdrop of a nationalist, an attempt was made to turn the environment and political opinion against the Kurds as an electoral platform. Actions have been taken against businessmen. Brutal action was taken against the freedom of the press, the opposition. All these elements we hope will be calmed down and have a rational outcome after the elections of 1 November.  This said, however, we must stress, once again, the strategic role for the European Union – I speak primarily for the European Union – of relations with Turkey, as a long-term partner, a key partner in finding solutions to the two big problems: refugees, the fight against Daesh and stability in Syria.

As Turkey rumbles towards elections on 1 November 2015, it remains to be seen whether Erdoğan can restore his AK party’s lost majority. In the meantime, clashes with the PKK, whom he considers to be the real terrorists, rather than ISIS, continue. The ceasefire that we thought might be going somewhere – and any lasting peace – is now completely lost. The EU must now engage constructively with Turkey, a strategic country which has sadly not respected its readmission agreements with Greece and has allowed a huge exodus of migrants. Russia’s recent push to support the Assad regime results in a Russia-Syria policy that is now entirely opposed to the stated aims of Erdoğan’s Turkey, whose airspace Russia is now violating. The deterioration of human rights in Turkey, with the arrest of journalists, is also a major concern. So, altogether, the situation is pretty bleak, but I do hope that this year will see at least a solution to the problem in Cyprus under the new leadership of the Turkish community leader, Mustafa Akinci.

The country that lies between this region and us is Turkey – a large, a proud country, a country that deserves to be treated with respect and honesty, a strategic partner. But what we are hearing here from the Council makes you pause in amazement. We must ensure that democratic values are respected in Turkey. Freedom of the press is being trampled underfoot, an unexplained war is being waged against the Kurds, the body of a Kurdish politician is being dragged through the streets by a police car, judges and prosecutors who do their job are punished, and even sometimes even arrested. Is this really an enlargement candidate? No, ladies and gentlemen. The Council is once again trying to create a life lie that we could deal with Turkey as a strategic partner and, at the same time, continue with the enlargement agenda. It is significant that the Commission, at the insistence of the Council, has postponed the progress report because the accession process has come to a standstill for all the reasons I have just mentioned. Nevertheless, let us be honest with this country to be treated with respect! We need help from Turkey, and Turkey needs our help for that. We can offer visa facilitation, we can offer more money, we can offer better infrastructural support in the refugee camps, we can do a lot of pragmatic things to address the real challenges. But let us be honest: Turkey is a strategic partner, it is an important neighbour, but the fact that this enlargement process can be revived is pure rhetoric, it has nothing to do with honesty. We must not remain silent about the violation of fundamental values there. Many Turkish friends are writing to us these days. At the same time, this country needs our cooperation, and we need its cooperation if we are to deal with the situation in Syria and Iraq.

There are indeed, today, more than ever, positive possibilities for resolution. However, in a solution, it is not understood that Cypriots, all Cypriots, do not have the right to reside wherever they want, anywhere in Cyprus, and no solution is understood, without every Cypriot being able to buy what he wants and whenever he wants, anywhere in Cyprus.

Now he is on an election tour in Europe, paid for by the state's funds, it is to be assumed, to get exiled Turks to vote. What other parties in Turkey have the economic opportunity? Yesterday we met in the Group of the Greens, Leyla Zana, which is campaigning for the HDP. She believes that the HDP will be able to repeat the election success from last summer and perhaps also increase. I very much hope that she is right and that democracy prevails in Turkey for everyone's sake – Turks, Kurds and other minorities – because we all know that the situation of freedom of the press and other human rights is under all criticism. In Turkey, hundreds of people have been accused of crimes for insulting those in power, the army or Islam, defending Kurds or talking about the Armenian genocide. That is not acceptable in a democracy. Our problem in this is that the Union is looking between its fingers and, in principle, accepting what is happening in exchange for Turkey possibly taking in the refugees that we send back. However, to support future Turkish membership is not the same as standing behind Erdoğan's undemocratic methods. We need to be clear about that. Extremely serious, however, is what several have raised, namely the broken ceasefire with the PKK and the fact that Turkey is actually devoting more effort to cracking down on the Kurds than cracking down on IS, and despite the fact that it is the Kurds who have successfully resisted IS so far. It is therefore time for the EU to try to force the parties back to the negotiating table. We cannot afford as many open armed conflicts in the Middle East as we have today.

It is important that within the European Union we continue our joint action to strengthen border controls and the fight against organised crime. What is happening on the land border with Bulgaria is a good example of successful cooperation in these two areas and should be welcomed. Second, the proposal for the buffer zone in Syria. The idea makes sense, it's up for discussion. But let's be clear before that: this must be done by granting a broad international mandate, and we need to answer questions such as \"Who provides security?\", \"How is the security of the people guaranteed?\", \"How do we ensure that people stationed in this territory do not become targets of radicalized groups?\". Finally, there is no doubt that the liberalisation of visas for Turkish citizens will be a strong signal for Turkish business, and the positive consequences for the European Union will not be delayed either.

I would like Spain to continue to contribute its passion and ideas to Europe's success in the coming years. In these difficult times, the European Union needs Spain more than ever. I am very pleased, therefore, that His Majesty King Philip honours us today with his presence. Your Majesty, I warmly welcome you to the European Parliament and give you the floor.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 156, "date": "2015-10-07.json", "name": "Felipe VI.", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   – Mr President of the European Parliament, Mr President of the European Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my words before this House by thanking the President of the European Parliament for his kind invitation to address, as King of Spain, legitimate representatives of European citizens. And thank you, President, for your words and for your generous presentation. I do this as a Spaniard who also feels deeply European; I do this by assuming the historical heritage that precedes us and convinced that our future is in the continuation of our great common project of the European Union. (Applause) For the men and women of my generation, Europe has always been present in our intellectual and vital development. This presence, that closeness, has given rise to affections, hopes and illusions; has generated a sense of belonging to the European project whose own being coexists constructively and naturally with our identity as nationals of the Member States of the Union. Also, this conviction in Europe stems from the clear awareness that the Union is the story of an undoubted collective success which, despite its difficulties, has managed, in an outstanding way, to complete its main and highest objectives.  Goals of peace, harmony and coexistence between nations that, only decades ago, starred in one of the most devastating and brutal clashes in universal history. Objectives of prosperity and economic growth, which have made it possible for millions of men and women from families on our continent to have lived and live on unknown material and social welfare rates over time. Objectives, above all, defined by strong universal human principles and values, which are at the basis of this immense work, built with intelligence, generosity and with great effort and work by Europeans of various nationalities and of several generations. That faith in Europe with which I have begun my words is born of the deep European identity of my country. Spain and the Spanish are , and the honourable Members know this well – Europeans by culture and geography; by history and also by political vocation. It is not possible to conceive Spain without Europe or Europe without Spain. And so I'm European, because I'm Spanish. (Applause) Political, economic and social achievements, as well as Spain's extraordinary projection in recent decades and in all fields, could not be understood without the democratic will and progress of the Spanish people and without our firm commitment to European integration. Democratic Spain in recent decades has been solidly based on a firm and sincere will to understand among Spaniards; generous and fraternal will. And it has been based on our Constitution, which is the great covenant that defends, preserves and protects the rights and freedoms of citizens, protects the peoples of Spain in the exercise of their various cultures and traditions, languages and institutions, and enshrines freedom, justice, equality and political pluralism as essential values of our coexistence. Europe has been built on the will to add, not subtract; of un combining and not dividing; to know how to share and be supportive. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, have the security of being able to have a fair and responsible Spain towards the European project; with a united Spain proud of its diversity; with a Spain that is supportive and respectful of the rule of law. This is how I understand our contribution to the prosperity of and to the European Union as one of the most important political works built in the recent history of Humanity. On the other hand, Spain's membership of the European Union has contributed decisively to the greater economic and social development of our country. This year we celebrate the 30th anniversary of Spain's entry into the European Communities. The \"return from Spain to Europe\" – if I may say so – is shown as the culmination of a great collective project that starts with the illustrators of the eighteenth century and which was felt intensely from the end of the nineteenth century. The ideas of regeneration and modernization across Europe — very present in the last century in Ortega y Gasset, and in Madariaga – were linked in the 1960s to the path to the democratization of my country. Thus Europe has been one of the great basic consensuses of Spanish society. It has been the horizon of democracy and also of economic modernization and the social and political regeneration of our country; and it still is today. Europe is where the Spaniards wanted to be, where we deserved to be and where we will always stay. (Applause) During these thirty years Spain has proven to be a constructive partner, in constant commitment to the values and principles of the Union, because they are ours. Ladies and gentlemen, the Spaniards have always maintained an attitude of confidence in the idea of Europe.  My country has received much from the Union, that is undoubted; but it is also important that at the same time it has made a remarkable contribution to the Community project and to the construction of Europe. Spain has always shown its Europeanist vocation, with crucial contributions in areas as diverse as European citizenship, cohesion policy, the promotion of cultural and linguistic diversity; or the deepening of an area of freedom, security and justice, characterized by mutual recognition of judicial decisions and effective police cooperation that preserves our freedoms. In addition to building from within, Spain has provided the Union with its historical links with Ibero-America, its close relationship with the Mediterranean, its clear transatlantic dimension and, in short, its universal vocation.  In this long and positive trajectory, it cannot be hidden — ladies and gentlemen — that in recent years they have not been easy for Spain or for many other countries in Europe. We still suffer from very high unemployment rates, one of the main problems for our economy and for our society. There are many sacrifices that the Spaniards have had to make to return to the path of growth and job creation. But we must understand and value that, in order to achieve all this, for the overcoming of the crisis, the contribution of the European institutions has been decisive. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European project, which was born more than 60 years ago, effectively creates an area of peace, prosperity, freedom, justice and solidarity for which we must be legitimately proud. However, what has been done so far cannot lead us to complacency or conformism. Nothing is won forever. And we cannot lose sight of the future, nor allow ourselves to stall or retreat in the face of difficulties or challenges, which are great and therefore require a new political impetus. It is true that, at the end of the twentieth century, Europe materialized utopia inspired by the ideals of reconciliation, peace and shared prosperity, launched by the founding fathers in the 1950s. But today we Europeans must identify – beyond the preservation of what has been achieved and the overcoming of everyday challenges – new and high objectives, new great goals that bring strength and enthusiasm to the European project; both from within, the result of the convergence between leadership leadership and the thrust and sensitivity of all our fellow citizens; as out, in our common exterior projection. For the European Union to regain its prominence in the world, it is necessary to formulate a new ideal; a new European purpose that mobilizes citizens in favour of integration and the unity project.  In this sense, the consequences of the economic and financial crisis on our societies and the social and political challenges it has created must make us reflect and lead to decisive and effective action to strengthen the European project; an irreplaceable and vital project for all. And, therefore, strengthening the democratic legitimacy of the Community project is a fundamental element and need. The time has come to evolve in Europe towards a truly enhanced political community.  We must work to build a more integrated Europe, which can successfully cope with the management of a fully globalized future and which is capable of providing its citizens with confidence and closeness. Without a strong European Union there will be no effective solution to the problems of our respective nations. As Jean Monnet stressed in 1943: \"The countries of Europe are too small to assure their peoples of the prosperity and social progress that is indispensable.\" In this regard, and from an institutional perspective, it should be stressed that the European Parliament has taken on strong leadership and offers a powerful political impetus towards Community integration. It would not be possible to understand this project of political and democratic integration, as a union of States and citizens, without the European Parliament. But it is the task of strengthening the good governance of the Union, respecting independence and separation of powers, ensing transparency and accountability, and ultimately bringing citizens closer to decision-making. The identification of new objectives necessarily leads us to underline the importance of the principles and values that are the very foundation of Europe: freedom, equality, solidarity, the dignity of men and women, pluralism and the defence of human rights are the foundations that define us as European. We must preserve and make these values effective because our identity depends on it, and because they are our deep convictions. These values are now questioned and Threatened. The fight against this threat is an indispensable imperative for the peoples who believe in democracy, who believe in freedom and justice. Ladies and gentlemen, ensuring the prosperity, growth and employment of citizens is also one of the Union's top priorities.  And in order to ensure the economic sustainability of the Community project, it seems clear that we must deepen the strengthening of economic and monetary union. In this context, the institutional scaffolding that we have provided ourselves with must continue to be completed through mechanisms that strengthen financial solidarity and enable, through control and surveillance, to prevent past excesses.  Thus, in the near future we must continue to promote a rigorous framework for coordination and budgetary supervision; advancing the introduction of own budgetary mechanisms for the euro area; deepening the banking union to overcome the effective fragmentation of financial markets; and, above all, establishing a framework that boosts the competitiveness and convergence of European economies. I am convinced that the debate on the future of the common currency will remain enormously relevant in the coming months and will bear concrete fruits based on responsibility and solidarity, true hallmarks also of the integration process.  For Spain, the single currency is an irreversible achievement. And we are convinced that the euro area is increasingly shaping up as the core of integration that is to lead us to greater political union. But that Union would never be complete without its essential social dimension, which cannot be preteasured. I therefore think it appropriate to reiterate the commitment made in Article 9 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which clearly reflects our willingness to achieve a high level of employment and social protection, education and health protection. (Applause) We must send a clear and unequivocal signal that social problems are at the heart of the integration process and that our task, in this area, must be to help all Member States and their citizens develop their growth and employment potential, improving social cohesion and correcting inequalities, in line with the proposed objectives. Undoubtedly, the social dimension of the Union links directly with the Europe of citizens and gives humanity, sensitivity to those who need it most, to the whole process of Community integration. I think it is right to recall at this point Jacques Delors's words: \"I reject a Europe that is nothing more than a market, an area of free change without soul, without conscience, without political will, without social dimension. If it was there,\" he said, \"where we're going, I'm sounding a cry of alarm.\" (Applause) Ladies and gentlemen, in the field of external relations, the European Union must be set up as a global player, from the strength of its internal cohesion and unity of action. This highlights Europe's commitment to peace and security, to the eradication of poverty and the fight against terrorism, to the protection of human rights, or to respect for the fundamental principles of international law. Our external projection must be based on a more ambitious and generous common security and defence policy, capable of consistently combining its civilian and military capabilities in order to offer a holistic approach to crisis management that we continually face. In this context, The European Neighbourhood Policy takes full sense in the face, for example, of the migration problem, and leads us to reflect on the need to provide us with tools of collaboration with our neighbouring countries to avoid mass displacement, violence or insecurity. Spain has a useful and important experience in the treatment of migration flows. Dialogue and cooperation with the countries of origin and transit of irregular migrants must be at the heart of a real European immigration policy, as they are in Spanish migration policy. Spain therefore offers to share its experience and to support initiatives in the European Union in this area. This policy should be set up as an instrument that allows us to face shared challenges and also take advantage of opportunities in areas such as trade, energy or security. I would like to recall, in this context, the impetus given by Spain to a concrete initiative: the informal inter-ministerial meeting in Barcelona on 13 April with our neighbours in the South. In addition, we must continue to work to build a dense web of relationships that transcends our most immediate environment. Spain, convinced of the added value of a Union capable of tackling the challenges of a global world, has always driven and supported the European Union's relations with those regions with which our country maintains a special link, such as Ibero-America. Nor should we forget that, in a globalized world, the trade agenda becomes particularly important, given the direct impact that creating opportunities, investments and exchanges have on the well-being and prosperity of our societies.  I also recall and stress the importance of promoting environmental preservation and climate change policies. We have the opportunity to move forward in this field, with an eye on the new generations, because it is really our duty to leave them a better world. Ladies and gentlemen, while there are many challenges we face, I cannot fail to refer more explicitly to the drama that is taking place today at our borders.  We are overwhelmed by the heartbreaking suffering of those who come to Europe fleeing violence and fanaticism. Hundreds of thousands of refugees are pursuing a project of hope, who see in the Union a territory of peace, prosperity and justice. We can't let them down. We must respond from generosity, solidarity and responsibility, with a comprehensive and comprehensive approach that helps address the causes of the exodus of these people forced to leave their countries of origin. I am fully convinced that we will succeed; as I am that the only way to do it successfully is to do it among everyone.  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I said, the European Union is a success story which we must recognise, value and admire much more. And thanks to this success, the Union is now at a new stage in its trajectory that must be built and promoted – as the founding fathers did – from the highest values and seeking to achieve, again, the highest goals. We'll make it. And we will achieve it firmly, with determination and with the greatest ambition. No hesitation. With the indispensable participation and with the irreplaceable prominence of all the citizens of our nations. On 19 June 2014, the day of my proclamation as King, I said to the Spanish Parliament that the time had come for \"a renewed monarchy for a new time\". Today I stand before this House, which represents the citizens of Europe, that we all have the exciting challenge of also building a renewed Europe for a new time in a certainly different world. There is no alternative to a united Europe. Let's have confidence in Europe. Let us have confidence in ourselves, the Europeans. Thanks a lot.

It is my sad but heartfelt obligation here to report to the European Parliament, the directly elected political body of the Peoples of Europe, that one of the wise men of Europe who died yesterday, one of the greatest figures of Hungarian democracy: Árpád Göncz, former writer, great figure of the 1956 revolution of freedom, the first man of the Republic of Hungary for 10 years after the regime change, president of the Republic of Hungary. It is a great honour to commemorate in this House one of the wise men of Europe, one of the main shapers of eastern European democracies, and perhaps also symbolic, that today, when events are happening in this House that may have taken us out of everyday political give-and-take. Árpád Göncz was a Hungarian writer, translator and politician, sentenced to life in prison for his role in 1956 and released after six years. He became a member of the first Hungarian Parliament after the change of regime, became its president, and for 10 years thereafter became president of the Republic of Hungary. Since then, there has never been a popular leader of Hungary, beloved to the adoration of Hungarian society, who in 2000 received the \"Vision for Europe\" award for his work to create a united Europe. Later, his daughter Kinga Göncz became your colleague and member of the European Parliament. I just want to say goodbye to him with a quote, in order to leave the thinking of us politicians of today.

It also facilitates enforcement by abolishing interim recognition and enforcement procedures in Member States other than the State in which the judgment was given. The European Small Claims Procedure leads to the issue of a European enforcement title which is enforceable in the Member States without the need for a declaration of enforceability in each individual State of enforcement. After five years of application of the Regulation, the Commission has made proposals to improve the procedure and facilitate the achievement of the objectives of the Regulation. The Commission thus proposes, inter alia, an increase in the ceiling for the value of small claims from EUR 2 000 to EUR 10 000, an extension of the definition of a cross-border case, a further reduction in the costs and duration of the proceedings and the fixing of a maximum amount of court fees (10 % of the value of the claim).

Mr President of the European Parliament, dear Martin Schulz, I thank you for your invitation and for the words you have spoken to the victims of bad weather in the south of France. Mr President of the European Commission, Madam Chancellor, Ladies and Gentlemen of the European Parliament, it is true that a President of the French Republic, the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, speaking together before the European Parliament, is an exceptional fact and, at the same time, it is not unprecedented.  As you recalled, 26 years ago, almost to the day, Helmut Kohl and François Mitterrand were addressing European parliamentarians here.  At the time, a great wind of freedom was blowing on the continent. He knocked down walls, emancipated peoples and gave hope to nations. 26 years ago, François Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl, with the help of Jacques Delors, presented the solidarity actions that had to be taken to welcome people who were not called refugees, but who had convinced themselves that Western Europe could welcome them. And it is the whole of Europe that has thus been built raising considerable hope. The common conviction of François Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl was to build a political union of Europe, thus extending the mandate of the founders, to create a vast single market, with social rules, and to carry the project of a common currency. All of this had to be part of the same process and be conducted with the same determination.  Today, 26 years later, Chancellor Angela Merkel and I are addressing you. Firstly because it is the 25th anniversary of German reunification, but above all because Europe is resonating with new tragedies that pose new challenges to our continent. To tell the truth, Europe has been facing a succession of crises for years: the financial crisis, which was born outside our continent but has spread and has caused an economic crisis from which we are just emerging and a social crisis, with millions of young people out of work. Now it is a humanitarian crisis that we are facing with an influx of refugees, caused by the destabilization of entire regions in the Middle East, Africa, resulting from armed conflicts and with the resurgence of religious hatreds.  And I do not forget the security crisis, with a war that is not so far away, on the borders of Europe, in Ukraine, and then also terrorist attacks that have concerned several countries of our continent, including my own.  With each crisis, fears arise. You have to live with fear, but you must not live dominated by fear. Nevertheless, there is a temptation to withdraw nationally whenever there is an ordeal. Yet nothing is more futile than to seek to save yourself, to evade, to take shelter when major events occur all over the world. We have to talk about experience, it is history that tells us and confirms it. These questions may be sincere, but they cannot condemn Europe to complacency and impotence. On the contrary, they justify an offensive Europe, capable, at the same time, of ensuring the protection due to its citizens and of maintaining its rank, in accordance with its interests and values, values which have justified the unification of our continent. There is therefore no alternative but a strong Europe to guarantee our own sovereignty.  In recent years, in recent months, France and Germany have wanted to react together to the hardships we have been through in the last period.  We responded with simple and clear principles: solidarity, responsibility and firmness.  Solidarity in the face of terrorism, because each of the attacks in one of our countries targets the whole of Europe: its ideals, its culture, its ways of life. That is, the soul of our continent. And I thank the Heads of State or Government, but also many European parliamentarians who met on 11 January in Paris to show their solidarity but also their commitment to freedom, to what we represent, to defend ourselves in the face of terrorism which seeks to destroy the cement that unites us. (Applause) Solidarity with refugees who are victims of the convulsions of the Middle East, the tragedies of Africa. Solidarity with European states, which are under pressure on the front line because they are our borders. Solidarity with countries neighbouring places of conflict, which welcome refugees in large numbers. Solidarity with Africa, which is fighting for its development and to avoid precisely population movements. Let's face it. We are faced with the exceptional arrival of women and men since the beginning of the year. 600, 000, no doubt. Many have fled war and massacres, others seek a better life. All endured appalling conditions, were handed over to unscrupulous traffickers. Too many died in atrocious conditions. We now know a number of their faces. Europe has worked to save lives, first, to combat criminal channels through Frontex operations. But, I readily admit, Europe has been slow to understand that tragedies in the Middle East or Africa cannot be without consequences for it.  Europe has not measured the hope it arouses and will generate for a long time in the face of the dismay of those who, since the night that has opened for them for too long, are waiting for hope, for light.  Europe has not provided sufficient aid to countries that, however, were hosting ever-increasing populations in camps. It is therefore in a hurry that it has had to organize itself to be worthy of its asylum tradition and to organise the return of those who cannot be welcomed here, permanently. Europe, together with the European Commission - and I welcome President Juncker here - has put together a comprehensive plan to support Italy and Greece, which are on the front line and cannot be left alone in responsibility; to help Balkan countries that are also experiencing transits of populations that are particularly difficult to cope with; to engage in closer cooperation with Turkey - and we have discussions here that have begun and which will have to be concluded with clear rules, because it is in Turkey that refugees must, as far as possible, be welcomed. But the flip side is that we can help Turkey if we want it to help us, ourselves, and ensure that these refugees, whether they are in the camps or in the population, can work, feed their children, can have a future. If we don't, then they will come, inexorably, they will come.  We also need to set up reception and identification centres. This is the essential condition for our borders to be respected. Then, finally, we have to distribute asylum seekers among the Member States. That is what we have done, not without difficulty, but we have done it. 160 000. And we will have to make sure that the commitments that have been made are being implemented.  It is each of these components that the plan must now implement as quickly as possible.  These are the principles: solidarity, responsibility. These are the same principles that prevailed in dealing with the situation in Greece. Negotiations have been laborious. We have taken our part, Angela Merkel and myself, with the European Commission, with all the Member States. These discussions could have failed. It would have been much more than a failure, it would have been an abandonment. The abandonment of a country whose culture and civilization still enlighten us. This would have been the first breach in the integrity of the euro area, and other countries would have been under pressure. And then it would have been a resignation in front of our mutual responsibilities, European responsibilities, responsibilities of the Greek government.  The negotiations resulted in a comprehensive reform agenda and new financial support. I hope that this will now translate into a discussion on debt service. This is part of the overall resolution. Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, was courageous and wanted his people to be consulted after there was the agreement. Respect for democracy - and I say this here, also in the place of European democracy - is never at odds with respect for common rules: responsibility, solidarity. Always the same principles. (Applause) We must also demonstrate responsibility against terrorism. Vigilance must be required, but it will not be enough. We must equip ourselves with the necessary instruments for the work of the security services, while respecting freedoms. France has passed a law to be able to better know the activities and follow the terrorists. Europe must also take its share, and I am thinking of the long-delayed dossier of the European NRL. I ask, as far as possible, that the European Parliament should be able to adopt this text, which is essential, if we are to act.  (Applause) Europe also has a duty of firmness. In Ukraine, we had to respond to a brutal violation of international law and prevent a war at the gates of our continent. The Europeans have shown unity, the Twenty-eight, in the implementation of sanctions and there have been legitimate debates, debates on the effectiveness and the length of this sanctions mechanism.  Germany and France are particularly committed to concluding and sustaining the Minsk agreements. Just last week, Angela Merkel and I, together with the Russian President and the Ukrainian President, in what is known as the 'Normandy format', ensured not only that what had been concluded in Minsk was respected, but that other separation processes were avoided.  And in this respect, this format, this method and this pressure, exerted on behalf of Europe as a whole, were particularly effective since the elections that the separatists had planned to hold in mid-October were postponed, and the Minsk process was able to continue and the small arms were soon withdrawn, soon heavy weapons. , and that the war has stopped, without peace yet returned. This is what we are able to do on behalf of Europe, for Europe and I will also say in the interest of the world, because we are ready to show firmness, responsibility and solidarity.  Firmness also with regard to the Syrian tragedy. It concerns us all because Daesh and the jihadists resent what we represent. It concerns Europe because the regime of Bashar al-Assad has created and continues to feed this disaster. Even today, he bombs, he kills, he slaughters. Yes, what is happening in Syria is about Europe because what is being played out there will determine for a long time the balance in the region, throughout the Middle East region.  And if we let the religious clashes, sometimes between Shiites and Sunnis, often, always even, for a few months or a few years increase further, do not think that we will be safe. It will be an all-out war, a war that can also affect our own territories. Then we have to act. France has taken its military responsibilities in the face of the threat.  Europe as a whole must engage on a humanitarian, political and diplomatic level. We must build in Syria, with all those who can contribute to it, a political future that gives the Syrian people an alternative to Bashar or Daesh. It is our duty to the Syrians and it is our interest as Europeans.  I therefore call on the whole of Europe to push for this political transition to take place. And let us know, whatever the positions here, that it will not be possible to bring together the opposition - I am talking about the moderate, democratic opposition - with the executioner of the Syrian people. It will be necessary to act continuously to bring together all the nations that really want a way out, namely Russia, Iran, the Gulf countries, of course, the United States and Europe, and Europe, so that we can achieve this political outcome.  To sum up my thinking, as I said, we will have to show a lot of solidarity with others. That is why cooperation with African countries is essential. We will soon have the Valletta summit in November between Africa and Europe. It is by acting at the root of the difficulties that the candidates at the start, and there are many in Africa, can be convinced to stay in their region. It is up to us to provide them with the conditions to live there.  We have touched on a number of issues that concern Europe and, in fact, it is the same debate that we have. It exists here, it exists in each of our countries. This is the debate between sovereignism and sovereignty. Sovereignism in each country or sovereignty for Europe. It is the debate between renunciation or reinforcement, between division or union. The debate is not between less Europe and more Europe, it is between the affirmation of Europe or the end of Europe. Yes, the end of Europe. That is, the return to national borders, the dismantling of Community policies, the abandonment of the euro. (Protests in some groups) (Lively and prolonged applause)  I can see, Mr President, that the debate exists here as well. François Mitterrand, less than 26 years ago, when he left office, had come before the European Parliament to speak, to deliver what he thought were the lessons of his own experience and the lessons of history. He said that nationalism is war. His warning still applies today. (Applause) But I'll add, a codicille or a supplement. Sovereignism is declineism. And it is also dangerous not to give hope to a population, to build nothing together, in the name of a national retreat, without a future in the face of trials.  I am convinced that if we do not go further, then not only will we stop but we will back down. And that will be the end of the European project. And that is why I propose that the Economic and Monetary Union, and within it the Eurozone, can be consolidated and strengthened. Consolidated and strengthened to coordinate our policies, to promote convergence, to act on tax harmonisation, to combat tax and social dumping, to invest more even beyond what we are doing with the Juncker plan.  Institutional choices will be needed for the eurozone to be governed, for the rules to be respected, so that solidarity can benefit all. These choices will engage voluntary states. The European Parliament will exercise its control and ensure the overall coherence of a Europe that will progress according to differentiated integration.   We also need to strengthen what is called the Schengen area. To call into question the free movement of people by returning to internal borders would be a tragic mistake. (Applause) But to claim that Schengen, in its current operation, will be able to cope with the pressures at its perimeter would be another mistake. Effective control of the Union's external borders requires enhanced assistance to border states, states concerned and the establishment of a border guard corps, European coastguards as the President of the European Commission has proposed. Similarly, we need to define a more coherent asylum policy, which requires a common list of safe countries of origin, the reconciliation of procedures, the convergence of rights and conditions offered to beneficiaries of protection. That is, a genuine common asylum system within the European Union itself.  On all these subjects, we must make the choice, I repeat, of walking forward rather than going backwards, which would bring us back to impotence. We still need to make this courageous choice and we will have to make it at the Paris climate conference in December. I welcome Europe's commitments at this conference because they have been instrumental in taking China, the United States and many others towards the prospect of an agreement.  It's possible! It must be as ambitious as the need will be. Too many countries have not yet submitted their contributions. And we Europeans ourselves must be able to establish a large carbon market to direct investments towards the best technologies. And it will be up to you to make choices accordingly. I want to welcome the role of the European Parliament in the climate negotiations and, as long as you can, support the efforts of the countries, yours, and Europe as a whole so that we can have an agreement. We will also have that ambition in the funding. It is very important that we be able to raise the $100 billion needed for energy transition in the most vulnerable or developing countries. We are not there yet. We have two months to achieve this and, if there were no agreement, let us be aware of the disaster, let us realize what our responsibility would be for future generations. Let us realize that there will not be a new conference to decide. There is a time when you have to make your choice, make your decision, get involved. It is up to the governments, yes, the European governments first, and those who will be at the Paris conference to live up to the responsibility you have entrusted to us.  I wish one day to return to the European Parliament at least with this pride, not simply to have received a conference in Paris, but to have been there on the day when the States of the world, carried by local authorities all over the world, who will also be represented, together with all associations, organisations, companies and trade unions, will have been able, for decades to come. , to address much of the climate issue. This is the appointment for our generation that should not be missed. (Applause) We must also have for our agriculture, for food security, for the quality of our products, the same ambition, the same will. And I ask, in the context of the crisis that we are experiencing in a number of our productions, that, at the Commission level as well as at the state level, as at The level of Parliament, we can free up the necessary support to protect our products and to help the most vulnerable. Since I am talking about a trade treaty, I want to talk about the one that is being debated with the United States. France wants these negotiations to be a step forward and wants guarantees to be made, both for product identification, for appellations of origin, for reciprocity, for transparency and, more broadly, for investment protection mechanisms, in particular, for dispute resolution. We must have those guarantees if we are to have an agreement that can be useful to economies. I want to end with this reflection that concerns us all. I cannot imagine that there are parliamentarians here who are not European, who do not realize that we belong to the same group, that we are bound by so many common values, that Europe has a history to share and a future to engage.  So, 25 years after the continent has reunited, we still face challenges and therefore choices. We have to respond to the emergency. She is there and no one can turn a blind eye to the realities of the world. No one! There are no borders worth, no barbed wire to protect us from threats from outside. It's up to us to make the decisions. We must respond to the urgency and stay the course for the long term: that of a federation of nation-states that must remain our horizon. And, in a way, 25 years later, it is to another unification that must be carried out: that of the projects, that of the peoples, that of the common interests, with this one question: do we want to return to the old order, that of the twentieth century, and what it has carried? Or do we want to live in a coherent and voluntary whole for the coming century?  I made my choice, it's Europe's! I did so with the will, on every issue, to seek, as far as possible, the highest compromises and that was the sense of cooperation that we established with Angela Merkel and Germany to be with our partners up to the challenges of the century.

In November 1989, a French President and a German Chancellor spoke to the European Parliament for the last time. Francois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl spoke here in Strasbourg shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Both felt the looming upheavals in Germany and Europe. And both were deeply moved by these upheavals. Both pledged in these hours, with clear words, to find common European answers. Thus, the coming together of Germany was followed by the integration of Europe. And today, with great gratitude and pride, we can look back on the historic achievement that we Europeans have achieved in the process of our continent growing together. Today, a free and united Europe seems to us to be a matter of course. But this historic achievement required a lot of effort at the time. There were fears and scepticism in the old Member States, for example, about the fact that the number of Member States of the European Union should almost double. Many saw the free movement of millions of new EU citizens as a threat to their own jobs. New decision-making structures had to be developed. European funding had to be redistributed to the new Member States. Today we see that this effort has paid off for all of us. It has not helped us to be less, but has helped us to become more prosperous. It has not helped us to be less, but to more freedom. It has not helped us to be less, but to more diversity. (Applause) In short, it has helped us to have more Europe. Because we Europeans have learned in our history to make the most of our diversity. And the quality that enables us to do so, that enables us to have freedom in our responsibility, that is tolerance. And it is a valuable asset. Overcoming the contrast between East and West has proved to be a gigantic success story. It shows us what we Europeans are capable of, if we want only, if we show courage, and if we stick together. It also shows that there is absolutely no reason to be discouraged by setbacks, which are, of course, repeated. In a word, it shows us what is possible. This is what the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Lisbon Treaty, stands for, but for the experience of the international financial crisis, which we managed together and from which we emerged stronger than we entered it, that is what the European sovereign debt crisis, in which we acted together, stands for. Francois Hollande referred to the difficult negotiations. But by doing it together, we have been able to ensure the cohesion of the eurozone. (Applause) Ladies and gentlemen! Today, The French President, Francois Hollande, and I are allowed to speak to you. Mr President, thank you for this invitation. We are speaking at a time when Europe is once again facing a major challenge. And I say it's a test of historic proportions. These are the many, many people who are going on extremely dangerous routes to Europe to find refuge here. People coming to Greece from Turkey via the Mediterranean to Italy or via the Aegean Sea. People fleeing terrible civil wars, especially the war in Syria, which has already claimed more than 250 000 lives and turned more than ten million people into refugees. Refugees from Iraq, refugees coming to us from Africa via unstable Libya. And they have all seen that our diplomatic and political efforts, and those of our transatlantic allies, have so far failed to bring peace to Syria. The rise of the terrorist organization IS in Iraq and Syria could not be prevented. The power vacuum in Libya is not yet filled. To enable these people to live a decent life in their homeland again, without having to freeze in fear of bombs and terror: creating this is a European and, ultimately, a global task. (Applause) That is the message today. Europe will need a determined contribution to solving these crises, in the fight against wars and displacement, terrorism and political persecution, poverty and lack of prospects. With this determination, Germany and France have resolved the terrible conflict between Russia and Ukraine is trying to solve it. We have seen the annexation of Crimea, we have seen the destabilisation of eastern Ukraine, and I say quite frankly that, fortunately, we have acted together in Europe. We have jointly imposed sanctions and said that this is a violation of our principles, and we will not allow that to happen. (Applause) But now we are working to resolve this normandy-style conflict. And just last Friday, we had talks in France – in Paris – that give us hope that at least the ceasefire could hold. After all, the elections in Donetsk and Lugansk were postponed. But, ladies and gentlemen, this is one of many conflicts. I am convinced that we must focus our foreign and development policy much more on resolving conflicts and combating the causes of flight.  (Applause) We will also have to be much more financially involved than we do today. The necessary decisions must be taken quickly. All this will change Europe again. Just as Europe has changed profoundly after the upheavals in Central and Eastern Europe 25 years ago. Of course, we will continue to work to improve our competitiveness. Of course, we will deal with the digitisation of our societies, with sustainable development, with a common energy policy, with free trade agreements with other countries in accordance with our principles. Right now, an economically strong Europe that takes advantage of the opportunities offered by the internal market is needed more than ever. To this end, we must also improve economic policy coordination in the euro area and, on this basis, correct the founding mistakes of the European Economic and Monetary Union. And Germany and France will play their part. (Applause) But the huge number of refugees is changing Europe's agenda. It is changing it once again, and in a lasting way, because it challenges our values and interests as Europeans and globally in a special way. If it is said that the number of refugees is to be ordered and, as a result, contained, there is no way around where flight and displacement are caused. It goes without saying that this takes time, patience and a long breath. We in Europe , as we are witnessing in these months – are closely linked to global events, whether we like it or not. We can no longer decouple ourselves from global events.  Never since World War II have so many people been on the run as there are today – about sixty million. Only this one number reveals the full dimension of the task. And no one leaves their homeland lightly, not even those who come for economic reasons. (Applause) But we must also tell them that they cannot stay with us so that we can really help those who really need our protection from war and persecution. (Applause) To do this, we need a political process to resolve the crisis in Syria with all regional and international actors, with a stronger role for Europe. We must help the neighbouring countries of Syria to have an appropriate perspective for the millions of refugees. Europe has acted here. The European Commission has made proposals for better funding – I also thank Parliament for supporting this – and the nation states must play their part. And Turkey plays a key role. She is our immediate neighbour. It is the starting point for irregular migration. Turkey is doing extraordinary work for more than two million refugees. However, it needs more and more of our support in the provision of care, in the accommodation of refugees, in border security and in the fight against smugglers. That is precisely why the European Commission has begun the dialogue on migration policy with Turkey is so important. And Germany will support these Commission efforts bilaterally.  Equally important are all efforts in Libya to form a unity government. Europe supports the efforts of the UN envoy, Mr Leon. The whole of the European Union is in need of this task. In the refugee crisis, we must not succumb to the temptation to fall back into national action – quite the contrary! (Applause) Right now, we need more Europe! More than ever, we need the courage and cohesion that Europe has always shown when it mattered. Germany and France are ready to do so. And we agree with the President of the European Commission, who has put many important proposals on the table, which we must now implement consistently. We agree with the President of the European Council, who is working very hard to improve cooperation with countries of origin and transit. And we agree with the European Parliament, which, in its resolution of 10 September, reminded us that national solo action in the refugee crisis is not a solution. Mr President, we also thank you for unconventional, quick decisions. That was important. (Applause) Only together will Europe be able to reduce the worldwide causes of flight and displacement. Only together will we be able to combat criminal smuggling gangs effectively. Only together will we be able to better protect the external borders of the European Union with hotspots operated jointly and not to jeopardise a Europe without internal borders. And I would like to make it clear that the protection of external borders will only be successful if we do something in our neighbourhood to deal with the many crises that are taking place on our doorstep, so to speak. (Applause) Ladies and gentlemen, only together will we be able to agree on EU-wide return agreements in order to actually bring those who have no prospect of staying back to their home countries. Only together will we be able to achieve a fair and appropriate distribution of refugees among all Member States. A first step has been taken, and here too I thank Parliament, or the majority, for its positioning. Let us be honest: the Dublin procedure in its present form is obsolete in practice. It was indeed well-intentioned – without a doubt – but the bottom line is that it has proved unsustainable in the face of the challenge at our external borders. I am therefore committed to agreeing on a new approach to fairness and solidarity in burden-sharing. I welcome the work of the Commission, and I think it is good that Germany and France agree on this. And it is also only together that we will succeed in the enormous task of integration that still needs to be accomplished. It includes the fact that we in Europe can rightly expect people who come to us to integrate into our societies. This requires compliance with the rules in force here, as well as learning the language in each language. But conversely, we also have a duty to treat people who come to us from need with respect, to see people in them and not to see any anonymous mass, regardless of whether they have a prospect of staying or not. (Applause) That is precisely why it is so important that the minimum humanitarian standards that we have agreed on for the accommodation and care of refugees and for the implementation of asylum procedures are respected. We owe it to them, to the refugees, and to ourselves. Because Europe is a community of values, a community of law and responsibility, and that means, to me, that we must be guided by the values that we have enshrined in the European Treaties: human dignity, the rule of law, tolerance, respect for minorities and solidarity. For me, this means that pan-European challenges cannot be solved by a few Member States alone, but by all together. We must realise that even if we tried to completely isolate ourselves, even consciously at the cost of harming people at our borders, it would not benefit anyone. Not to the people concerned anyway, who would nevertheless seek and find ways to reach us, and not even ourselves in Europe. Foreclosure and closure in the age of the Internet are an illusion. No problem would be solved, but additional serious problems would arise, because the attachment to our values and thus our identity would be lost. If we disregard this, we betray ourselves – no more and no less. (Applause) If we bear this into account, we will be able to pass this historic test and, even more so, emerge from this crisis more than we have entered it. Then we will be able to represent our values and interests convincingly on a global and global way. And that, moreover, is what we are expected to do outside Europe. Ladies and gentlemen! We know all too well the motives for which people leave their homeland from our own European history. For centuries, our continent has not been a destination, but above all the starting point of flight and displacement and migration. Jean-Claude Juncker made an impressive reminder of this in his State of the Union address. Today, Europe is an area in which many people from all over the world are directed to their hopes and longings, a space that makes people dream. Just as I and millions of other people in Central and Eastern Europe 25 years ago were able to benefit from a free and united Germany and Europe. We must deal responsibly with Europe's appeal. And that means that we need to pay more care to those who are in need in our neighbourhood today. If we see this challenge as our common European and global challenge, we will also be able to recognise and take advantage of the economic and social opportunities of this test. And then we will see that, by the way, the chances are greater than the risks. We will have to continue to work hard to convince our Europe. I am pleased that, after centuries of war and hatred between our two peoples, Mr Hollande, we are both fighting together today for these same goals. (Applause) I invite you all here in this House to work together to convince our Europe. Every single Member has an important role to play in this. In your home countries, in your constituencies, in the face of the pan-European public. Let us work together on this, as Helmut Kohl proposed here in the European Parliament in 1989 with a view to the upheavals in Central and Eastern Europe – and I quote him: 'with wisdom and with a sense of proportion, with ingenuity and flexibility'. Thank you very much!

Today you have renewed this commitment with your presence. The german-French friendship, the responsibility that your two peoples bear and the statement of the future that France and Germany will see their future in a democratic Europe in the coming decades: I would like to begin by expressing my sincere thanks for this. (Applause) Twenty-five years ago, this continent was about the upheavals after the collapse of communism. Today, the refugee issue is a challenge ahead of us. If we have great tasks, we will find orientation in our Charter of Fundamental Rights. This is the place where the ideas, the experiences we Europeans have had in our history can be read in a concentrated manner. It says: 'The right to asylum is granted in accordance with the Geneva Convention on Refugees'. And it says: \"Collective expulsions are inadmissible.\" Ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about people. That is why this Charter of Fundamental Rights is our orientation. We are talking about individuals. If Turkey, if Jordan, if Lebanon – partly poor countries – is able to offer shelter to millions of people fleeing civil war, then this rich Europe must also be able to make this effort. We need courage, we need encouragement for this task that is ahead of us. I would like to thank Germany in particular and you, Chancellor, for encouraging people on this issue. Thank you for that. (Applause) In terms of content, we have major tasks ahead of us. First of all, it is important to take seriously the fears of citizens, which of course also exist. One of the answers we can give people is: we are already acting. We don't just talk, we act. Who would have thought that German and French soldiers were on duty in the Mediterranean today and were saving lives? Who would have thought a few months ago that we could decide on a quota of 160 000 refugees? Who would have thought that a few days ago the European Council decided to properly protect the external borders and to carry out checks there accordingly? We are already acting! We in the European Parliament – and I must not hide this in the presence of the two leaders – are disappointed by the speed of the European Council and the members of the Council of Ministers of the Interior: we would like to see more speed. The Commission has already put forward proposals in the spring, and we in the European Parliament have already signalled support. And unfortunately, god, we have not been able to overcome the national selfishness, which unfortunately also exists, quickly enough. The deed now counts! We must act together. The ideas you have put forward, President Hollande, on the further development, for example, on the construction of a European border guard, must now be decided by the Heads of State or Government so that the Commission can get support for its work. We are facing enormous challenges. There has been talk of migration, also of the economy, of the fight against terrorism. We have two political realities that we also find in this European Parliament. One is the party dispute, the normal, right party dispute in democracy about the right way forward, and then the vote, which then produces the result. And the second reality is that there are political forces on the continent that scare people, who want to destroy something, who want to destroy something, namely what previous generations of elected politicians have built up over decades. These are forces that describe problems but have no idea how to solve problems. Unfortunately, this political reality is increasing; scepticism is growing in Europe. What is the answer? The answer is: leadership, courageous leadership. Just as previous generations of politicians have done. Without political leadership, we would not have seen eastward enlargement, without political leadership we would not have abolished border controls, if we had not built up a currency, and we would not have the prosperity that the internal market guarantees us. That is why today is the time for political leadership again. The last time your predecessors were here was 26 years ago. And we can say with pride: we are strong, we are great as a continent, what has been achieved in the last 26 years! And we must continue this story. Please show as the two leaders of the two great peoples Europe's ambition! We know that we need a strengthening, a strengthening of the euro area, a deepening of the eurozone, more ability to act in foreign policy. It is not acceptable for a country to be able to veto entire sanctions decisions. We need more military action, as everyone knows. We would spend the citizens' money in this European Union better if we spent it together. I therefore ask you to give you the courage to develop Europe. That is the task of the Heads of State or Government. Last but not least, why is it urgent? Why does it have to happen soon? Because the world is not waiting for us. While we are dealing with Greece, we have seen a major slump in the Chinese stock exchanges. It is there that the prosperity of tomorrow's world will be decided. As we talk about migration, Atlanta is entering into a trans-Pacific free trade agreement that reorganizes 40 percent of world trade. The world is not waiting for our internal debates! That is why Europe must lead by its committed approach. (Applause) Jean-Claude Juncker said here a few days ago that there is not enough Europe and there is too little Union. Ladies and gentlemen, Chancellor, President of the Republic, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his excellent work and for her excellent work. We rely on your courage. Let us bravely stand up to the fear-mongers! Create more Europe! Create more union!", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1127, "date": "2015-10-07.json", "name": "Gianni Pittella", "mepid": "4436", "text": "  On behalf of the Group of the Party of European People's Party (Christian Democratic And Social Party) and European Union, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande, the fall of the Berlin Wall is, in my view, the birth certificate for the new Europe.  The lesson we still carry in us today is that the search for freedom is an unstoppable drive. Freedom is a human condition, before it is political. No wall can stop it. The second lesson concerns the fragility of political projects. Thirty years ago, no one would have thought that the Communist bloc would disappear. In two ways, major political projects die: when they are defeated by an external adversary – this is the case of the so-called real socialism defeated by liberal democracies – or they disappear when they no longer believe in themselves, when they lose their sense of history. That is the risk that Europe is running today and we must tell ourselves frankly, as we saw with the Greek crisis, you have talked about it.  The real tragedy was not the failure to pay an installment, but the fact that for a moment the sense of being together was lost. That is the risk we no longer have to take. Because if Europe is devalued to an aggregation of States held together by logics of pure convenience and power, then it loses its raison d'ion and the Pandora's box opens up, which is made up of selfishness, secession and forms of separatism.  First of all, the Union is a political project and it is history that tells us that in the past the Franco-German drive has served Europe because it has had a vision of Europe, that is, the idea that through reconciliation between peoples divided by centuries of war, the foundations for political integration would be laid.  Today we need a new beginning, a new project, a new vision that will give meaning to the Union and that will see all the Member States as protagonists. This Parliament and this European Commission, led by President Schulz and President Juncker, have shown that they are up to the challenge and if we are gathered in this body today it is also because the 2014 elections and the direct indication of the President of the European Commission have given this Parliament new energy and strong new leadership.  From above, Europe is not being built and – please let me say this, but clearly – the intergovernmental model is outdated.  The Europe of the people will not be made by rhetoric, but by concrete actions that help a facto solidarity. We started with immigration and we need to move forward consistently and firmly.  I very much appreciate what Chancellor Merkel has told us today, which we have been saying for a long time, welcome and security, responsibility, and I very much appreciate that you said very firmly that Dublin is outdated. Yes, Dublin is outdated! The Union must be made more democratic, and this is achieved through a reform of governance and economic and monetary union that strengthens the role of the European Parliament. This institution is already the Parliament of the whole Union and of the eurozone, and the Union must also be given the means to assert itself through a common fiscal capacity that can lead to a European unemployment insurance mechanism.  We must fight for greater tax justice, because it is unacceptable that, while citizens are being asked to make sacrifices, tax evasion and fraud take a trillion euros out of public finances every year. Taxes must be paid where profits are made!  We must ensure greater social justice. This continent, Europe, is being crossed by silent secession, poorer and richer and richer, social dumping must be wiped out!  And finally, compared to twenty-five years ago, we are faced with the challenge of climate change, François Hollande spoke passionately and firmly about it, thank you for this strong binding appeal for everyone to be a great success in Paris!  And then foreign policy, let's be honest about that. In the Middle East, the diversity of approach between Member States in defining who our main adversary, Isis or Assad, is weakening our diplomatic action. We need a common foreign policy of the European Union – ladies and gentlemen, I know that some European citizens, even among those present, think that the decline of the Union is inevitable. We must oppose this fatalism. The words of a great European, François Mitterand, are still valid today, words that he uttered in this Chamber, as you have been reminded: 'Our exhilarating role is to prevent the inevitable, to succeed the improbable and to realize hope'!

But do you not think, President Hollande and Chancellor Merkel, that it is at least a part of the problem that one or two countries decide for the rest? All together we are 28, and 28 is far more than two. Over the years, the EU of course evolved but my feeling is that its leadership has not. Chancellor Merkel, events have placed a burden of leadership on your shoulders. Your critics say, however – and they may have a point – that you sometimes forget about the difference between leadership and dominance. I get the impression that people across the European Union are concerned about that distinction, because it has become more and more a vital question, and that is part of the reason why we face this crisis over Europe’s future. People are concerned that their viewpoint does not matter. Some are ignored, others are bullied, others still are vilified. People are concerned because they hear this deafening federalist rhetoric, not rooted in reality, and through that thin veil of rhetoric they see a ruthless power-play with President Hollande and Chancellor Merkel as major actors, more powerful than those who hold formal positions allegedly higher in the political hierarchy.  Chancellor Merkel, you spent your early years in a communist country. So did I. I remember a saying from the bad old days that communism is a system which courageously solves the problem it itself created. Toute proportion gardée, I think that the same could be said about the European Union. We created the euro system, and since day one we have been wrestling with the problems it generated, and solving those problems has led to more dominance and more disregard for the elementary rules of cooperation.  Turning to the issue of migration and refugees: again a similar story. Of course the EU did not create the problem but it failed to identify it soon enough and, let me add, it has not yet entirely succeeded in identifying it. I am just wondering: why invite the immigrants and then cancel the invitation? Why play a cat and mouse game with the Schengen procedures? Why this absolutely unbearable confusion of humanitarian, moral and political arguments that obscure the gravity of the crisis we are faced with?  This is not the language of dialogue. This is a language to obscure things. We cannot really talk to one another using that kind of language. It is preaching. It is not a dialogue: it is preaching. And there has been a lot of preaching in this Chamber this afternoon – and, as a matter of fact, every day.  So, it was your decision to suspend the Schengen rules and to open the German border, and it was your decision to close the border again. As far as I know, you did not consult any government, or any European institution for that matter. If this is not proof of dominance, what is? If one wants to have more proof, look at what happened last month at the Home Affairs Council. This is not the right way of doing things. President Hollande, Chancellor Merkel, let me finish with the following plea, if you will. I urge you to be more responsive to reality. The more European hubris is riding high, the more people are being left behind, not listened to, and pushed outside a territory of respectability. This has lasted long enough and it cannot go on forever. European politics needs less self-adoration – of which you had an abundant sample of today – but it needs more freshness, clarity and fairness. Otherwise, the EU will increasingly be looked at with reluctance and disdain, if not outright hostility, and we do not want that, do we?

Zuallererst geht mein Dank an Sie, Kanzlerin Merkel. Sie haben Mitgefühl, Verständnis und Führung in der Flüchtlingskrise gezeigt – und das in einer Zeit, in der es in Europa an all diesen drei Dingen mangelt. Danke dafür! (Beifall) Monsieur le Président, c'est toujours un honneur de vous voir ici, au Parlement européen. Vous venez ici plus souvent, je pense, qu'à l'Assemblée nationale. C'est mieux ici, au berceau de la démocratie européenne, et je dois vous dire que je partage pleinement l'analyse que vous avez faite. Chers collègues, nous vivons en fait une crise, profonde, comme le président l'a indiqué, que, moi, j'appelle une polycrise: c'est une crise des réfugiés, de l'économie, de l'euro, de la perte évidente de notre influence géopolitique. This crisis is an existential crisis. Let us face the reality, this multiple crisis – and I know that a number of people in this House will like this – puts the existence of the European project itself in danger. If tomorrow the euro disappears or if Schengen falls apart, then what are we left with in Europe? Only a loose confederation of nation-states? We will be weak economically, and insignificant on the world stage. That will be the result. (Applause)  And let us not be naive. It will be the Americans and the Chinese who will dictate our economic standards here in Europe; and it will be Assad and Putin who will decide on peace and stability in Europe. (As Putin already finances some right-wing parties in Europe, maybe that is the normal turn of events.) What I want to make clear in this debate today with you, Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande, is that the source and origin of every one of these crises is in fact exactly the same: it is a lack of common governance; it is a lack of shared sovereignty. It is the lack of unity in Europe that is the cause of the crisis.  (Applause) And Mr Legutko, you say ‘Yes, Europe is the problem’ and ‘Europe creates and solves the problems’, but when 20 million citizens in the 19th and 20th centuries were slaughtered in Europe it was not because of ‘Europe’, it was because of nationalism and populism. (Applause) We cannot overcome the refugee crisis and we cannot keep Schengen if we do not have a common asylum policy, a common migration policy and common border and coastguard control. We cannot overcome the euro crisis without one government for the euro and one treasury. We cannot overcome our economic weaknesses if we do not liberate ourselves of 28 national regulators in all the markets of the future – digital, energy and capital. And we shall not overcome our geopolitical insignificance if we do not embrace real foreign policy in Europe, a single representation in the international institutions and, at the very least, a defence community in the European Union. (Applause) To achieve this in the final years of this decade, and to make sure that this decade does not become a lost decade for a number of people and for the European project, I think we have to change three bad attitudes: firstly, l’Europe à la carte; secondly, the step-by-step approach that we embrace; and, thirdly, our clouded and outdated view of the world. First of all, l’Europe à la carte. There is not one Union. What are you talking about? There are at least 10 unions. There is ‘the 28’, there is Schengen, there is the euro, there is the patent, there are the opt-ins and the opt-outs, the enhanced cooperation, the derogations – it is chaos at the moment – and Europe needs one strong heart to survive in the future. Secondly, the step-by-step approach: maybe it worked in the good times in the past, but not in the modern world. It is always too little too late. From time to time, in every society, you have to take a big leap forward, to adapt yourself and to resolve all the resistance to necessary change – as France did, for example, after the Revolution when it kicked out an old autocratic regime and created the rule of law, and what Germany did when it created the Zollverein and became a modern economy, the powerhouse of Europe in the economic field. That is also what we need at the European level.  I have only one appeal to you, Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande, which might not be in the name of the whole Parliament but in the name of a big majority here: I call upon you to meet this challenge together with us, the European Parliament. It is your historic responsibility to do that, exactly like your predecessors did 25 years ago. Look a bit more closely into this historic task, even if you are facing some less important electoral challenges in the near future.

Mr President, Chancellor, Mr President, I would like to thank the Rapporteur on the work she has Twenty-five years ago, your predecessors – Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand – took joint initiatives to advance the process of European integration, against the background of the Eastern European democratic movement. These were concrete proposals. We saw them on the table, I read them for myself. But times have changed. For many, in your function, you represent the old Europe that has failed. And, Mrs Merkel: I cannot take away from you the fact that you bear a significant responsibility for the fact that, for example, the Community method has been replaced by the Union method. This has contributed to a split within the European Union, a split into strong – economically strong, politically strong – and weak – politically weak and economically weak – countries. They both say that the EU has brought more prosperity. No! Most recently, the EU has brought more poverty to the south and the division of the EU. People reject an EU in which Eurogroup finance ministers dictate how solidarity and living conditions are to be defined. Such a union does not even give the appearance of Habermas's facade democracy. Have you ever wondered why, despite the hard-hitting blackmail by the Eurogroup, do the people of Greece once again trust Syriza and Tsipras, and not those who are part of the old system and thus part of the old Europe? The memoranda were about bailing out German, French and Dutch banks. The winners of the so-called euro rescue packages are these countries. That is why we are asking you to take initiatives to reduce the debt. And the crisis gains should go to a poverty reduction fund in the crisis countries. I could also envisage debt relief for investments in renewable energy and action on climate change. It is a moral and legal duty to accept refugees in a humane manner. This is not the practice in the EU. It is high time to put Dublin aside and develop a common European asylum/migration policy that really deserves the name. You said: tell those who cannot stay: return to safe countries of origin. So that includes Kosovo, Turkey. Will Eritrea also be part of this in the future? I would like to know that in concrete terms. It is logical and reasonable to determine the second intake by population and economic power in the countries. These proposals are on the table. But the way we deal with Greece and also with the refugees has brought this very failure of the European Union to our mind. Unfortunately, there can be no question of a community of equal sequalities in solidarity. European values cannot be defended under the sword of the dictates of cuts. That must be clear. So the policy of austerity must stop, this austerity policy must be at the expense of certain groups of the population. As a result, we are dealing with a retreat into the national, nationalist and xenophobic forces are on the rise, not only in France and Germany. In Germany, 200 refugee shelters have already burned this year. That is why it is so encouraging when, on the other hand, many people are standing there and being helpful, wanting to help, wanting to do something. But they must be encouraged by us – by the EU and by politics – and we must not leave them alone. That's how the community is broken! I would like to ask you: yes, perhaps you both wanted to summon the old axis again, but the german-French engine stutters. What now, Mrs Merkel and Monsieur Hollande? Your speeches should be encouraging. You have raised many important issues. But your speech also lacked any prospect of more democracy and for a social union within the European Union. This is a huge shortcoming.

Guy Verhofstadt spoke of the political crisis. I would just say, German, that we have a whole series of crises that we are constantly talking about. And we will not make any progress if we leave behind what we had before and did not finish, whenever a new, major escalation takes place, such as now the one around the refugees, when we then leave behind what we had before on the wrap and did not finish. I believe that if you want to build confidence within the European Union, in its ability to act – and I really hope that this will succeed – then you must return to what has been left behind in terms of the stability of the single currency. If you follow the debates in the European Parliament seriously, you will see that we have long believed, by a large majority, that a common currency without a common fiscal and economic policy, without a government in this area, cannot function sustainably and permanently. And I think that both of you – Mrs Merkel and Mr Hollande – are sitting here exactly the right one to get us out of this gandging on this issue, because the French have recently re-launched this. The French had to move long on the matter of sovereignty. But the Germans also have to move in their fixation solely on the debt problem and the monetary stability. There are two worlds that need to be brought together, and if we do not succeed in doing so, we will not be able to achieve internal stability, and then we will never be able to tackle the major crises that are growing around us in the way that is actually to be expected of the still strong Europe. (Applause) Mrs Merkel, I was at the railway station in Budapest – Keleti – when you decided in Germany that Dublin was no longer working. I thought it was as great as the people who had been put in an insane situation at Viktor Orban's train station. I think it is right that you have come forward in this situation and then – supported by Austria, but also Sweden and a few others – have said that we need to redefine our refugee policy. I have now heard that you and Francois Hollande believe that what our President Juncker said in his State of the European Union address are the lines that you now share for a new refugee policy and immigration policy in the European Union. If we assume that European values and human rights should count, it is questionable to me that it now boils down to the fact that we do not control our external borders better, but that we are once again relying on isolation and, as it were, on militarisation at our external borders. That doesn't work. So we will not get out of these refugee dramas. I would also like to say to you that I think it is right to talk to President Erdogan, because I know that we cannot solve all the problems of refugees from Africa and Asia here with us. I think it is right to talk to him about the need for Turkey to play its part. But I think it is wrong not to say that its escalation with the Kurds exacerbates the region's problems and does not solve them. A better situation in Turkey can only be achieved if the internal escalation ceases and if you also persuade President Erdogan to return to the path of democracy in Turkey. Let me make one more point: uncertainty has brought you here, Mrs Merkel, Mr Hollande – uncertainty among citizens. At the moment, hundreds of thousands of workers in the European Union fear for their future. This does not only apply to employees directly at VW. This also applies to all those who work in the subcontracting industry, and they work not only in Germany, but in many European countries, including outside the European Union. This is the result of an incredible industrial scandal and a criminal energy at VW that has been scourged often enough. But I would like to use your presence here to tell you that a supposedly well-intentioned protection of the interests of the car industry, which you in particular, as the well-known auto chancellor, Mrs Merkel, has ensured – but on this matter Mr Sarkozy, most recently Mr Hollande, has repeatedly you – that this supposed lyre is a thing of the last. Extending industry's interests into European legislation when it comes to climate and the environment was wrong, and that it is precisely this protection that has fostered hubris in companies such as VW. The climate summit, Mr Hollande, which we Europeans are going to do with a sham anyway, because our 2030 targets are not enough to achieve the 2-degree target, must not be further burdened by the fact that we continue to stand by this old protection of the car industry. A new era must also be ushered in in the car industry.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1132, "date": "2015-10-07.json", "name": "Nigel Farage", "mepid": "4525", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, nobody in their right mind would not agree that it was a sensible thing to do, back in the 1950s, to get France and Germany together round the table to break bread with each other, to have a trade deal and to work as sovereign democratic nations together for peace. All of that was absolutely right and high-minded. Sadly, the whole thing has become corrupted. Tony Blair said that the EU today is no longer about peace, it is about power. How right he was, and how that power has shifted. When Kohl and Mitterrand came here representing their countries 25 years ago, it was a partnership of equals. But no longer. France is now severely diminished, trapped inside a currency from which, frankly, it cannot recover and the French voice in this relationship and in Europe is little more now, frankly, than a pipsqueak. It is an irony, is it not, that a project that was designed to contain German power has now given us a totally German-dominated Europe. Just look at the euro. Germany has a currency that is undervalued by 20% with a growing and massive trade surplus. Most growth in the German economy since the collapse of 2008 has indeed been in exports to other eurozone countries, such as your very big arms sales to countries like Greece, Chancellor Merkel. And when we have a general election that says a country like Greece wants to change direction, well I am sorry, but that now must be brushed aside because the Germans do not want it.  In what must count as perhaps the worst piece of public policy seen in modern Europe for half a century, when you compounded the already failing and flawed EU common asylum policy by saying to the whole world ‘please come to Europe’ – and we saw, frankly, virtually a stampede, and we learn that 80% of those that are coming are not Syrian refugees – in fact what you have done is to open the door to young, male, economic migrants, many of whom, I have to say, behave in a rather aggressive manner, quite the opposite to what you would ever expect to see from any refugee. Yet when that failure is met by objections from countries like Hungary their opinions are crushed.  This is not a Europe of peace. It is a Europe of division. It is a Europe of disharmony. It is a Europe that is a recipe for resentment. And yet, faced with all this failure, both of you, President Hollande and Chancellor Merkel, said the same thing today. You said Europe is not working so we must have more Europe: more of the same failing. Well, there is, I think, a bright star on the horizon. It is called the British referendum and, given that none of you want to concede Britain the ability to take back control of our own borders, a Brexit now looks more likely than at any point in modern time. I hope and pray that Britain voting to leave the European Union will be the beginning of the end of a project which, however noble its original intentions, has gone rotten.

Thank you Mrs Merkel for making us happy to come today with your Vice-Chancellor, Administrator of the province france.  Mr Vice-Chancellor, I would have liked to have been able to call you Mr President of the Republic out of respect for your office, but, no more than your predecessor, you do not hold this presidency. A President of the Republic could not say: \"Sovereignism is declineism\", as you have just done, because the President of the Republic is the guarantor of the French Constitution and the title I of the French Constitution is: \"Sovereignty.\" A President of the Republic cannot consistently ignore France's interests. France's interest is not to blindly submit to a policy decided in Berlin, Brussels or Washington. Its interest and your duty is to defend its sovereignty. France's interest is not to give this distressing spectacle of a France to the back of Germany on the migration issue. When, in a perfectly irresponsible gesture, Chancellor Merkel says that 800,000 migrants should be welcomed with open arms, you applaud. When, a few days later, it suspends Schengen and wants to control its borders, you applaud again, giving France the desolate image of a country adrift, staggering on an issue yet so essential to security, prosperity and the defence of France's identity. France's interest is also not to abdicate in the face of Dr Schaeble when the economic policy of the continent is decided, even though this policy is synonymous with massive unemployment, precariousness and the collapse of our social protection system. On the contrary, it is to resist and prevent Greece, the other countries of southern Europe, and then France from getting stuck in an endless austere spiral, with the sole aim of saving the euro and the German economic model of low wages. You are both coming here for a catch-up session because your European Union is collapsing, exacerbating migration assaults such as economic onslaughts, and forced to continue through blackmail, threat and intimidation. Your model is vassalization in the United States, austerity, unfair competition, massive surveillance of citizens, social dumping, migration submersion. I carry another model that brings together the peoples of Europe today, that of independence, of the Europe of nations in a multipolar world, of intelligent protectionism - yes -, of individual freedoms, of the defence of our security and our identities by the total cessation of mass immigration. Some will sum up by saying that I am the anti-Merkel, I accept the augury.  I do not recognise, in fact, Madam, the right to dispose of us in an absurd attempt at German domination of Europe. The defence of German interests does not justify the vassalisation of the other peoples of Europe.  I am, in this Chamber, the voice of free Europeans, of our sovereign peoples who are turning away from the European Union, because they crave the nation. I am the representative of the French people who are turning away from you, Mr Hollande, as he turned away yesterday from Mr Sarkozy, because he is thirsty for France.

You assume the overwhelming, theoretical at least, responsibility of the leadership of two major founding states of the Union. However, this Western Europe, and in particular France and Germany, are, alas, countries in decline. Demographic, economic, social, cultural, political, spiritual and, Mr Hollande, this is not the work of sovereignists.  Seeing, this noon, His Majesty the King of Spain, I thought, through to me, that the first of the great European civil wars to have pitted our nations against us was, precisely, in 1870 the candidacy of Prince Hohenzollern to the throne of Spain. It is good, as has been said to be, to be sat down, that these conflicts have subsided.  But what would have been the use of so much suffering, sacrifice, toil, hope, if it were to integrate into a space open to unfair competition of products manufactured, under conditions of slavery, by the labour of states without social laws, without minimum wage, without protection of workers and without freedom of association? What is the point of boasting of a hard-won independence, if it is to submit to the will of today's superpower?  You told us about guarantees, Mr Hollande. Have you forgotten, then, that this year the United States of America stole 9 billion euros from the French bank BNP Paribas, without a word of protest from you?  I heard President Schulz say before the King of Spain that the challenge of our time was immigration. When Jean-Marie Le Pen announced that this would be the case several decades ago, he was already accused of agitating unfounded fears.  You say you are satisfied that you have distributed 160,000 political or assumed refugees as such. However, this Europe, which has only human rights in its mouth, has closed the door to two indisputable refugees, who were wrong to inform us about the spying practices of the Washington government. They are Julian Assange and Edward Snowden, who are still being held outside our borders.  Never since the theoretical abolition of borders have so many walls, fences and barbed wire been built. Inconsistency is everywhere, as it is internationally. As for the U.S.-European policies, they are the ones that contributed to the destruction of Iraq and Syria.  In a word as in a hundred, we would like more respect for national identities, the will of peoples, more protection of our interests, more freedom, less bureaucracy and, above all, the restoration of the family, cultural and spiritual values that have made the greatness of our civilization great. Are you ready to hear the roar of the peoples rising? It's late, it's already very late. God wants it not to be too late.

Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has I would like to thank the speakers who encouraged us – courage to accept the challenges. Europe can only function if we have respect for each other's opinions. We are 28 Member States in the European Council. Germany and France can develop a common position. The good thing is that we often have to go some way to get this common position. The essence of the compromise lies in every german-French agreement. But, of course, we will only have an agreement if all 26 others join in. What you are giving in the European Parliament, the speakers who have encouraged us, we are trying to take on board. On the other hand, we are also representatives of our national states, of our national parliaments. That is why, at this point, I am once again advocating – and some of which is already working quite well – to keep seeking this contact with the national parliaments and with the ideas that are being expressed there, because without this bridge- to advance Europe. That is why parliaments are so important. And the Treaty of Lisbon has once again made the European Parliament more important. Secondly, I would like to point out that, as Europe – if you have listened to the last speakers, we must be careful not to become a little depressed – that we in Europe also have successes. (Applause) We have had successes, for example, in the preparation of the climate conference. The European decisions, which are also centrally supported by the European Parliament, give a tailwind to The Promotion of Ambitious Commitments internationally. And this COP 21 conference is being prepared very, very carefully, well and ambitiously, and we have a good chance, if we do this together, to achieve something in Paris that we were not yet able to achieve in Copenhagen. I would ask everyone to cooperate here, because that would be a good message for the international community and, incidentally, something that we are fighting for the causes of flight. Why are many fleeing Africa? Because they have no chance, not only because of war and terrorism, but also because of hunger and hardship. That is why we must do everything we can. And a good climate agreement is a contribution to preventing refugee crises. (Applause) Then I would just like to make two comments. One is that all those who have talked about border closures between Germany and Austria, I invite them to visit the german-Austrian border. Manfred Weber may be able to show certain points of crossing the border. There can be no question of closing a border. Only if this has not yet reached you, I wanted to point it out again. Mrs Harms, I have a request for you. There are many unemployed people in Europe, and you yourself spoke of how many people have jobs, especially through the car industry. And something has happened at VW that needs urgent clarification, where we need transparency and where I have the impression that the company is doing the same. But please do not use this matter to do something that you might like to do out of your political conviction, which is to condemn the car as a whole, so to speak, thereby jeopardising thousands and thousands of jobs in Europe! We should not do that. (Applause) Ms. Harms shakes her head. Then it is good, and then it is reasonable. We have too few jobs in Europe rather than too many. But I take that as i know and I'm happy about it. I would like to thank you for this discussion here and for the fact that you have received us here as guests, and I would also like to say for myself that I would like to continue to work with the European Parliament. Thank you very much!

Mr President, I, in turn, would like to thank all those who have intervened in this debate, which, from this point of view, has been enlightening.  Why are we here, the Chancellor and I? Why the two of us? Because we would be the most populous countries in Europe? That is not even true. Because we would be the main economies? Probably. But because there have been two wars in the last century between Germany and France. And it was Germany and France, in the aftermath of this tragedy, that wanted Europe to be able to be made from what the continent had suffered as horrors.  That is why the leaders of our two countries, French and German, have always wanted to be at the initiative of new European constructions. This was the case for General de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer, and together we reminded the Chancellor and I of what the Elysée Treaty had been. Then it was François Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl - not just them for that matter - who took Europe to take new steps. So that is why we are here, in fidelity to history and also to the responsibilities that must be ours. You wanted to talk about what the future of Europe could be, both of which. This future must be one of strengthening Europe. There are several ways and they have been mentioned here in one way or another. There is the way in between, what we know, namely to leave it at that, with a Europe of twenty-eight which is not easy to lead, in which it is not easy to organise deliberation. From this 28-year-old Europe, I have now experienced it for three years - less than Chancellor Merkel - but the decisions we take in the European Council are unanimous decisions. Even if France and Germany were to agree, but we still have to do so, the other 26 would still have to be convinced. On Greece, on refugees, we decided to twenty-eight and not for two. It is at twenty-eight that we have taken responsibility for asylum, because we are Europeans and we have values and principles, and no one can, moreover, under international conventions that go far beyond Europe, to prohibit those who are on the run, who are obliged to protect themselves, from being welcomed here in Europe. Those who refuse to do so would not simply be honoured to be Europeans but simply to their duty to the international community.  We are acting at twenty-eight, and so there is a second possible way in the face of this Europe, which is struggling to decide: the path of reinforcement. This is the one on which I think Mrs Merkel and I want to work with you. Because nothing will happen without the European Parliament. The way to strengthen the common foreign and security policy was mentioned by several speakers because, if there is not a European policy in the face of what is happening in Ukraine, in the face of what is happening in Syria and the Middle East, in the face of what is happening in Palestine, also in the face of the major continents, the great powers , which nation - even France, for which I not only have respect but whose greatness I also know - could decide for the rest of the world on its own?  Therefore, we need Europe and a Europe that is much stronger than it is today, provided that it too takes on responsibilities.  (Applause)  The first responsibility when it comes to having a foreign policy - and it is not easy and I know that here we can have debates - is the common defence policy and if we want to be an independent power, we must have this common defence policy. For now, it is often France that takes the initiative, sends its armies, sends a number of our soldiers to Africa to avoid the worst. Then, then, Europe joins us and so much the better! Because if there were no Europe in Mali, if there were not Europe in the Central African Republic, there would still be massacres today. Therefore, we need this European security policy and therefore a defence policy.  We need a migration policy, asylum policy, which can be common. This is what we have explained here: a common asylum system with a list of countries that we consider safe; the same policy for Turkey, the same policy to help countries like Jordan, Lebanon - I want to quote them all - who are suffering; because a country like Lebanon hosts half of its population. Here we have this duty to carry this asylum policy, to escort those who come here for economic reasons have no right to stay on our continent. We must do so with dignity and with firmness and together. If we do not do it together, then what does the Schengen area mean? Mrs Merkel was right to go back on the Dublin agreement because we cannot ask the countries that are on the border of Europe to pay for everyone else, because it would be unfair and because it would be unbearable. (Applause) Therefore, if we do not want the in-between, which we have been living for perhaps too many years, and if we do not want to strengthen Europe, then there is only one way. It was quoted, I heard what Mr. Farage said. The only possible way for those who are not convinced of Europe is to leave Europe. Simply! There is no other way! This one is terrible, but it is the one, finally, of logic: to get out of Europe, to leave the euro, to leave Schengen, and even, if you can, to get out even of democracy! Because sometimes, when I hear you, I ask myself this question: do you really want to participate in a common space?  (Great applause) What I call here is not the abandonment of sovereignty, it is sovereignty! And sovereignty has nothing to do with sovereignism. European sovereignty means being able to decide for ourselves and to avoid a return to nationalism, to populism, to the extremists who are forcing us today to go down a path we did not want!

We must move towards the creation of the Digital Single Market that facilitates the sale of products online and streamlines startup activities, and it is essential to end cross-border links in the areas of transport and energy.

As we have said several times before, the Investment Plan has three parts – the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI), the Project Portal and the Single Market – and the Capital Markets Union is part of this third pillar, deepening and widening the internal market. I personally believe that the third pillar of the plan is the most powerful when we are talking about job creation and economic growth in Europe. That is why the Capital Markets Union represents a very important part of the plan when we are trying to get more investment to Europe. A couple of figures to set out the scale of the challenge we have in creating a Capital Markets Union: Europe’s economy is about the same size as that of the USA but our equity market is less than half the size of theirs; in the USA, SMEs get about five times more funding from the capital markets or non-bank financing than they do here in the European Union; if our venture capital markets were as well developed as they are in the United States, companies could have raised an extra EUR 90 billion over the past five years; and, perhaps even more importantly, the differences between the EU Member States are greater than the differences between the EU and the United States. So everybody understands that there is a lot of work to be done here in Europe. Allow me now to draw your attention to the following three important points. First, we have been listening very carefully to the feedback provided to us by stakeholders and the European Parliament. The resolution you passed earlier this summer provided useful input, as did the consultation result from over 700 responses. Personally, I have visited 27 Member States in the context of the Investment Roadshow. I received important feedback as to what to fix in the single market and, more especially, in financial services. Many features of this feedback are addressed in the Action Plan. Second, this Action Plan is very ambitious. The plan will have a big impact, because we have adopted a holistic and inclusive approach, covering also the framework conditions as called for by the Five Presidents’ Report on EMU deepening. In addition to Commissioner Hill, who is the main contributor, other colleagues – Commissioner Jourová, Commissioner Moscovici and Commissioner Moedas – are playing important roles in the implementation of the plan. Next year we will be making concrete legislative proposals on the tax side, via the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB), and on insolvency practices. Moreover, we are fully exploiting the synergies that exist when using the different tools at our disposal. It is therefore important to judge the measures not just in isolation but also as part of the comprehensive package. I will give you a couple of examples. With the EFSI we are financially supporting fresh investments in critical infrastructure projects. In parallel, the amendments to Solvency II that we are putting forward under CMU, to create a well-defined infrastructure asset class with appropriately calibrated capital requirements, should draw in long-term investors such as insurance companies. Risk charges on infrastructure investment will come down by some 30%. We are also acting to re-launch a European securitisation market, both via the activities of the European Fund for Strategic Investment and now through CMU. Last week we made a proposal for a new framework to encourage the take-up of Simple Transparent and Standardised Securitisation (STS). This will define when a securitisation counts as STS, and again it will set lower capital requirements that will apply when it meets those criteria. If we could rebuild the securitisation market to the levels it was at before the crisis that could add up to an extra EUR 100 billion of investment for the whole economy. With this in mind, I urge the Council and Parliament to take forward the proposed legislation without delay. Honourable Members, we managed to push the EFSI Regulation through in only six months. I hope Parliament and the Council can deliver as quickly on these proposals. These proposals are, in places, even more simple than the EFSI Regulation, so let us put private money to work for new jobs. Looking especially at SMEs, here too we are working holistically to devise measures to help SMEs get financing on capital markets. We are looking at the prospectus, which is what businesses have to publish when they want to list on a stock exchange. Unfortunately, they can be lengthy and expensive. So we will be bringing forward a proposal to modernise the Prospectus Directive so that these documents serve their initial purpose. They certainly need to provide clear information for investors, but they also need to be affordable for SMEs to produce. Meanwhile, the European Investment Advisory Hub, created under the umbrella of the EFSI, will explore how to provide advisory help to SMEs when it comes to market experience. Third, while ambitious, the Action Plan is credible and realistic. We are not making promises we cannot keep. We are not intervening or regulating where the case is not clear-cut and where national markets are working well. In areas where, for example, progress in the past has been difficult and where we feel more groundwork is still needed, or where the private sector is developing useful initiatives, we adopt a pragmatic step-by-step approach. This is, for example, the case for covered bond markets for private placements. Personal pensions are another example. Personal pensions have the potential to inject more savings into capital markets and to channel more of that money to productive investments. Yet the EU does not have a single market for voluntary personal pensions, limiting choice and putting up prices. Next year we will start work to determine exactly what is needed to establish a European market for simple personal pensions and we will clarify whether or not EU legislation could help to underpin that market. Finally, let me stress that we will be watchful of emerging risks to financial stability. The Commission is committed to working with the European supervisory authorities to strengthen supervisory convergence and to ensure that the rules of the game are interpreted with consistency across different jurisdictions. To conclude, the Capital Markets Union Action Plan is a major step towards completing the single market in capital. The Commission has delivered a comprehensive package on time. It is our strong desire now to work together with the Council and with Parliament to achieve swift agreements on our proposals for the benefit of the European economy and our citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1153, "date": "2015-10-07.json", "name": "Gunnar Hökmark", "mepid": "28124", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for this statement. As he touched upon EU–USA economic relations, I cannot but underline the fact that the European Union is the bigger economy – even the US Central Intelligence Agency recognises this. But, as the Commissioner has pointed out, we do not have the magnitude and the strength of the capital markets that the United States has, and that is where we need to proceed. That is why it is very good that the Commission has taken these initiatives. However, there are some things worth thinking about. The first is the gap between the liquidity we have in European markets and the lack of investments. In that perspective, something is wrong or missing. We need to look again at the regulations, and review what has been achieved over the last years in the area of regulation. It might be that some things can be done better, and it might be that some things are not as necessary as we thought they were. That is why a review is very important.  I would also like to underline a difference between the USA and Europe, and that is that we are, for historical reasons, more dependent on banks. That is why it is important to look upon European banks as part of the broader capital market. I would also like to say that it is important to look upon the fact that we have a number of well-functioning capital markets in the Union. So an important task is to get rid of the hindrances that are making it more difficult to facilitate all the things we could do.  Finally, we have a number of well-functioning markets that could be used as a template and that we could use as an example. Let us use them as an example and not over-regulate them. Let us see to it that we regulate on the basis of using the strength of the capital markets that we have and will get in the future.

For these reasons, Parliament supports the Commission's action, as already indicated in the resolution we adopted. For us, an efficient Capital Markets Union does not contradict and must not contradict a robust regulatory framework that prevents another financial crisis from happening again, and indeed we believe that a robust system of rules and increasingly integrated supervision are a condition for the success of the Capital Markets Union. At the same time, an analysis of the combined impact of the current regulatory framework and a calibration of capital requirements that incentivises long-term investment and the economy and the real economy are a useful exercise that the ECON Committee has urged and to which we intend to contribute. I welcome the fact that the action plan wisely proposes a pragmatic and gradual approach, but at the same time points to ambitious objectives such as insolvency proceedings, taxation, but also as the fund of funds for venture capital or the European personal pension.

Beyond all the detail which I am sure we will debate at length in the much needed review of the Prospectus Directive and the securitisation legislation we are expecting, are several other measures to ensure a more effective single market for financial services. I would suggest that the real measure of success of the CMU will be whether it becomes relevant to all 28 Member States, whether those countries of the EU that currently do not have an active and well-functioning capital market develop one, and whether all countries can nurture a culture of investment at both personal and institutional level to fuel investment in their businesses. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recognised a long time ago that functioning capital markets are a precondition for a thriving economy, and it recognises this measure in its country-specific assessments on an annual basis. Therefore, including this kind of criterion in the European Semester in a way analogous to that of the IMF, will be really important. But the CMU should not solely be about legislation, nor should it be about spending money on new institutions to achieve single supervisors. It should be about cultural change so that investors can take appropriate risk, and so that companies do not see bank loans as the only way to finance investment and growth. Achieving diversity in retail financial products available cross-border will be important, but more time-dependent will be securing a more diverse array of funding models for our businesses to access capital, both equity and debt, via our broad capital markets. We need to ensure that while emerging companies do not always get bank financing they can access other forms of capital from our capital markets. European companies need to grow to be competitive.

Mr Vice-President of the Commission, dear Mr Katainen, we are always happy to see Lord Hill but we are happy that it is you today for a reason: you are in charge of investment, you have carried the Juncker plan, and the first difficulty I have with the capital markets union is that the title does not say what the objective is. The title is a tool, instead of talking about what we want to do together and I believe that at a time when citizens are questioning the meaning of the European Union so much, it would perhaps be important to offer them something a little sexier than 'capital markets union'. Other than that, I have three questions. Round first, can we really settle for - and I hope not - texts on prospectus and securitization? I remember that the Green Paper begins with the words: we want to support growth and jobs, which is the right goal. Honestly, we have to speed up the other steps, because if, in the end, it is on these two subjects that we have great success, I think that, again, we will have a little trouble with the citizens. Second, and Kay Swinburne just said, it is a real cultural change that we are trying to implement. Europe is not used to financing companies through the market, so we need to tackle the issue of taxation, which is decisive in moving the savings of individuals, in particular, but also of institutions, and then also the whole issue of the bankruptcy of companies which can help some to invest. Last thing I wanted to mention is the consistency of what we do. Are we not undermining the spirit of the capital markets union with the structural reforms in the banking sector? I think there is something important here, complementarity should prevail over the opposition.

The securitisation business – i.e. the packaging of junk loans – is to be revived, instead of using American mortgages now, for example, with European car loans. Volkswagen sends greetings. The investment – which Europe so desperately needs – will not bring this, because there is no lack of liquidity, but of demand. Companies only invest if they also find customers. But there is no such way because of the reduction in public expenditure, wages and pensions in Europe. The Capital Markets Union does not help small businesses in southern Europe that do not receive loans. The financing of investments in Europe depends on the banks. We are not the United States. Our markets are regional, our companies are medium-sized. There are different insolvency regulations. As a result, access to the capital market is too expensive for small and medium-sized enterprises. And even in the US, bank lending has become more dynamic than capital market business since the crisis. Europe needs reputable banks instead of gamblers who are too big to fail, too big to fail.

Within the euro area in particular, we need more cross-border exposures, so that when individual countries are facing problems, we do not also have a unilateral burden on the capital markets. That is why the idea is right. It is also right that you want to create consumer-friendly products throughout Europe. It is also right that small credit unions should be allowed throughout Europe. There are right thoughts in the package. However, the package is linked to two false promises. Firstly, with the false promise that it could make a substantial contribution to re-entering investment in Europe. That is simply not right. Take a look at the situation on the capital markets! The drama is great. Even at the long end of maturities, we have very low interest rates. We have a high savings rate in relevant parts of Europe. And if we want to invest this money, we must make investments profitable, especially in the sectors of the future. There is still no offensive by the Commission for this project. If you want to repair the capital market, we do not need a capital markets union alone, but we need instruments that channel that capital into sustainable investment. I am waiting for an offensive from you. There is a second imbalance in this chapter, and that is the tone, as if we had created too much regulation. On the contrary, we have made many of the rules that we have created too complex and bureaucratic, while other parts of the financial markets are still not properly regulated.

If an SME in the east of England, for instance, is able to make its case for funds to a middle-sized German investment fund, or even if a young couple can make their case to a potential mortgage provider from France, then in both cases the consumer may, in theory, get a better deal. And it is also the case that capital may, in general, end up being more efficiently allocated, improving economic outcomes. But there remain many pitfalls in the Commission’s approach. Why, for instance the grandiose title of Capital Markets Union? There is clearly no realistic prospect of ending all geographic associations between the source of capital and where it is deployed. So to speak of a Capital Markets Union at all is to elevate federalist ideology above practical improvements. In addition, the legal and credit risks run by companies are very different in different EU countries, and disclosing them fully is going to be costly and cumbersome. The head of the German Savings Banks Association has pointed out that corporate bonds are not really worth doing for less than EUR 10 million, while large investors are rarely interested in projects under EUR 25 million. Anecdotal evidence suggests that companies need to be turning over EUR 1 billion before the market become seriously interested, so it is hard to make a case that SMEs will benefit much from a Capital Markets Union. It is the corporates who stand to gain at the margins, and forgive me for not punching the air in wild celebration at that prospect! Of course, any proposed financial transaction tax risks undermining even those incremental gains and certainly could harm Europe’s biggest and most successful capital market – the City of London. The dependency of the Commission’s plans on securitisation will also worry many citizens given that over-securitisation was a key factor in the great financial crash.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the relaunch of securitisation is the first major project of the capital markets union. This priority, which was unanimously wanted by the European Union, the ECB and the Bank of England, is suspect. Is it necessary to recall that the securitisation mechanism is at the root of the subprime crisis? This sounds like a dangerous reopening of the big casino, the main cause of the global financial crisis of 2008. I note, at this stage, a great paradox: the union of capital markets is intended to be a set of measures to de-de-carfise the financing of companies. However, your first step is to relaunch securitization to free up banks' balance sheets and also improve their ratio, all to supposedly allow lending more. Now, we're back to square one. The banking system will receive juicy commissions to comply with solvency rules, but without any guarantee of financing the real economy. I still fear a mega game of dupes, especially since the past of Commissioner Hill, a former City lobbyist, makes him a close relay of financial and banking interests. But, beyond this, we must ask ourselves two questions: the first is whether the STS securitisation rules proposed by the directive are sufficient to avoid the abuses of the past and the second is whether this STS label will be enough to effectively boost the financing of local SMEs. On the first point, I would say that the text shows a seemingly solid framework: we need homogeneous credits, clear modelling of cashflows and a ban on the spread of risk in the investor chain. Two criticisms at this stage, I regret the level of 5% of the total securitized credits that must be retained by the issuer. It's obviously too low. It is necessary to ensure that this issuer is involved in financial risk by setting a much higher threshold and it must also be set with an overall limit so that the majority of a balance sheet is not fully securitized.  Secondly, on sanctions, the news shows that private banks only have billions in fines as long as they remain proportionately low in relation to the tens of billions of euros in profits they generate and realize. The amounts provided will not be a deterrent to the financial windfall that is opening up, especially since they are in fact left to the discretion of each Member State. However, it is not certain that countries accommodating with finance, such as the United Kingdom or Luxembourg, are taking very strict measures. Second question: what impact on the actual financing of the real economy? Easing the balance sheet of banks...    therefore that this STS securitisation label has mechanisms that require banks to lend in return. From the giving. For example, by requiring them to re-take back their claims due to what is not lent to businesses and individuals within a reasonable time. Unfortunately, the draft directive does not provide for this, but beyond securitisation, the real question is whether the economic environment is such that banks will want to finance projects to create value and jobs. This requires confidence, stability and hypervoltile capital markets as they are, mass unemployment, a high-risk geopolitical situation, over-indebtedness of states. The environment arising from the ultraliberal economic model of the European Union is still as negative as ever.

When I think, for example, of making securitisation easier again, which was one of the main causes of the financial market crisis. So we have to be very careful about that. It is also true that, in the context of the financial market crisis, many banks have retreated to their home markets and that financial instruments that were previously there are no longer available. I also think it is right to draw up an impact study of the previous regulations. However, if the purpose of this is to introduce over-regulation or deregulation through the back door, then we will be against it. And as far as the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises is concerned, the most stable factor is a regional banking structure, because in the countries where we have them, small and medium-sized enterprises have few problems. The European Central Bank's attempt to encourage investment with interest-free loans through cheap money has not helped in southern Europe. It is a mistake.

These include insolvency law, shadow banks – as has already been mentioned – company law and tax law. Mr Hill has not made any proposals on this, because it would, of course, be a step too much Europeanisation that he can hardly sell to the City of London. So basic support, but certain reservations.

That has not been the case in recent years, of course. Profit and self-interest were paramount. Regulators, lawmakers and regulators did not make the decision. Joris Luyendijk, a columnist at The Guardian, compared the financial sector to a full plane and an empty cockpit. There was no sending and certainly not in the best interests of the customer.  The Socialists and Democrats see the capital markets union as an opportunity. There's no misunderstanding about that. You have also heard my colleague Roberto Gualtieri. It's an opportunity. And it is certainly possible to achieve more diversity where we see that the European sector is very focused on banks, while capital markets can be better developed. I think the comparison between the US and the EU is flawed. We are a landscape dominated by banks, but there is certainly more diversity possible.  The action plan on the Capital Markets Union is an opportunity. It is also an opportunity to tackle the lingering problems in Europe. That is why it is good that Commissioner Katainen is sitting here, because it is certainly in the European interest that there should be more opportunities for investment, that money be converted into investments. We want there to be a joint mission and that also means that investors and SMEs find each other again. This also means that the paperwork for SMEs is reduced. These are opportunities, but the burden of proof lies with the Commission, because the focus of the customer's interest has not been and will not be taken for granted. The Commission must demonstrate that the proposals are in the service of the real economy, in the service of ordinary people and small businesses. It must show that it contributes to the real economy and does not harm it.  The Commission's burden of proof also includes very clear choices. The Commission must demonstrate that securitisation works and take a stand against synthetic securitisation.  Junk mortgages in the United States have shown that financial products without underlying value do not contribute to the real economy but pose great risks. The Commission must also take a stand against the unfavourable tax regimes which favour debt and penalise equity, because it is also a question of companies having sufficient buffer and building up and the tax is not designed to do so.  Finally, the Commission must also opt for the completion of the banking union. That remains very important in Europe. The deadly embrace between governments and banks must be broken. This means, on the one hand, a fair evaluation of the national security paper and, on the other hand, a European guarantee system. Finally, Mr President, the Commission must choose servitude, because that must be the central word in the capital markets union.

Securitisation is a typical example of the mystification and misleading language in which finance markets abound. Rather than offering security, it has historically been used as a technique for concealing risk. It is also likely to serve the inner circle of financiers and to divert investment from the businesses that make up the real economy. With securitisation, market traders created a dangerous game of ‘pass the parcel’ where nobody could be sure whose parcel contained the toxic assets. This gave value to worthless assets, but at great risk to the financial system. This is securitisation: an attempt to pretend that hiding risk is really reducing risk, when it is nothing of the sort. As Greens, we will insist that safe securitisation means the loans on which it is based are sound, that it does not involve the tranching of assets with varying levels of risk, and that we do not allow the return of credit default swaps.

I am not surprised that lord hill, an expression of the City of London's financial lobby, is pushing for this proposal. The constant references to the US model to be taken as an example are totally inappropriate and misleading, because we know how much difference there is between the entrepreneurial fabric of European SMEs compared to their American counterparts.  It is not by leading small savers to invest in financial products that problems are solved, if we ever start creating new ones, as happened in 2008. On one point, however, we agree, namely that there is a serious problem with access to credit, especially for SMEs.  For us, there is only one solution, which is for banks to return to their traditional role of deposit collection and lending, and this is only feasible through banking separation on the model of American Glass-Steagall.

Small and medium-sized enterprises are of particular importance in Europe. Not only do they employ two-thirds of all workers across the EU, they also generate almost 60% of value added. And 75% of SMEs finance themselves with bank loans. We all know how difficult this is at the moment. The word credit crunch can be read in all media. Small and medium-sized enterprises have difficult access to capital, but start-ups also have this. Alternative forms of financing such as crowd funding are therefore of particular importance. In addition to these SMEs and alternatives, rapidly expanding companies with high growth potential also need attractive conditions for capital. Here, the financing system in Europe is not efficient enough. The market for equity financing and borrowing outside the banking system is underdeveloped. Risk and equity capital is particularly important when it comes to financing growth. However, European venture capital funds are relatively small compared to THEIR US competitors. The average European venture capital fund, with a capitalisation of EUR 60 million, is only half the size of a US fund, and around 90% of the investment in Europe backed by risk capital is made in eight Member States. This shows that venture capital markets appear to be underdeveloped in most Member States. If the venture capital market in Europe were as large as in the US, start-ups and the growth companies mentioned above would have had up to EUR 90 billion more in funding during the crisis years 2008 to 2013 – as the Commissioner has already mentioned today. And compared to US companies, European SMEs receive five times less capital market financing and rely on bank loans.

It is therefore clear that something must be done so that these problems do not occur again in the future. My colleague Gunnar Hukmark said that there is liquidity. There are still funding problems. It is therefore clear that we need to find solutions to this problem, because without funding SMEs will not be able to hire new people; without funding SMEs will not be able to drive new projects, and therefore we will be lasting growth and job creation.

Measures to make it easier for businesses to provide information about themselves and for investors to access that information are also positive, and it does make sense to try and simplify the process for issuing shares. But, as many others have said, there are areas where caution is necessary. First, the vast majority of SMEs will continue to be best served by the banking system to provide financing, even with the Capital Markets Union (CMU), so I was encouraged to see the comment from Commissioner Hill, when he spoke to the Brookings Institution, that CMU is not and must not be explained as solely a set of measures that will benefit SMEs. However, in order to truly and sustainably boost growth, far more attention must be paid by the Commission firstly to those EU-funded mechanisms intended to support SMEs becoming investment-ready and, secondly, to the ability and, above all, the willingness of the banking system to finance SMEs. Second, when it comes to the Commission’s proposals on securitisation, safety, transparency and simplicity are all relative terms, given the carnage caused to our European finance markets by contagion from security-fuelled financial problems in the US. The Commission must err on the side of caution here. Third, given that Member States’ attempts to level the tax playing field for debt and equity have sometimes provided new mechanisms for tax avoidance, I will be scrutinising this proposal very carefully. Above all, the Commission should be very wary of those who are using their action plan as an opportunity to push deregulation.

The truth is that my group and myself welcome the presentation of this action plan to bring forward a single capital market in the European Union. I think it's an ambitious proposal, but it should be more so and we should try to put it on the floor very quickly.  In any case, I had three comments on the initiative. The first is based on the difference within the Union between those countries that are in the euro area and those that are not in the euro area. Within this Capital Markets Union, we are debating the need for a Union-wide insolvency law and are also discussing what we can do to discourage the debt of SMEs and small businesses in order to make there more capital in businesses. But it is true that this debate is directly related to the discussion on the creation of a fiscal pillar in the euro area and, therefore, that game between the euro area and the rest of the Union should be more present in the draft.  The second comment is that it is true that we need to approve the regulation of financial markets in the European Union. We need to standardize the products: the securitisations, the set of goods and services of the capital market. But it is true that this standardization cannot lead to a lax or hyperlax regulation that somehow pushes us back to the problems we face in the financial chaos of 2007 and 2008 when the banking sector was poorly regulated. And this issue leads me to the third comment, which is that, if we make regulation for the capital market that is too lax, we can probably suffer some disintermediation of the financial activity of banks , which are currently regulated – to unregulated or underregulated activities and, therefore, instead of increasing the size, rather than increasing the capital tart in circulation in Europe , we could be shifting investment from one place to another and increasing the risks.  And one last comment, I think this initiative is very good, but we also need to improve the Union for households, for consumers, for example, with regard to credit cards, current accounts, commissions.

These were the financial products that caused the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression. So going that route seems to me to be very unwise. We need a strong economy, not a junk economy.

We need more private capital. We need more risk-taking. Venture capital is less pronounced in Europe than in the USA. That is partly due to regulation, of course.

There are clear timelines in the roadmap for the Commission and for Parliament, and we need to stick to those timelines, because I think the Capital Markets Union (CMU) is a crucial project in terms of the mandate of this Parliament and indeed of this Commission.  Of course Europe will still depend on its banks for funding to businesses big and small, but over a period of time we need to provoke more non-bank lending, and the way you do that is to have a harmonised approach across the European Union in order to encourage more funds to invest, especially in the equity markets. Since the crisis, we face a huge investment gap. In my own country, private investment is down 20%. That is not going to be filled by the banks. It certainly is not going to be filled by governments, who are already stretched for cash. So we need to find new ways to make sure that that funding gap is bridged. Half of all disposable assets in Europe are held in cash. If we can make sure that some of that saving can be used for productive purposes, people will go back to work and we can ensure that the economic cycle is put in place and is helped. We already have an awful lot of expertise within the European Union, as Gunnar Hökmark said. In my own country, in Dublin, we have a very significant securitisation market and the potential of that is crucially important in terms of encouraging a much wider Capital Markets Union. This is not just about SMEs. Of course SMEs are crucial, but it is also about establishing a financial escalator whereby businesses can grow quickly in Europe. We are losing out to the United States of America, especially when it comes to venture capital.

The Capital Markets Union can help provide both if it is correctly handled. The financial crisis which continues to affect Europe has its roots, as we all have to remember, in bad, irresponsible financial products and greed in the financial sector. In many countries it has also led to a real estate bubble, and that is something we have to bear in mind. The answer, in terms of preventing future crises also must be found in identifying responsible financial products and in ensuring the systemic surveillance of the whole financial system. I want you to focus on covered bonds: they are secure; they are a cheap and transparent tool for financing loans, for consumers and SMEs and for long-term investments.

Will the Commission ensure that covered bonds are addressed independently when different types of loans are rated for risks?

The USA does this much better than Europe. It is claimed that opening up new ways of mobilising capital on a European scale will bring us closer to the American levels of getting cash to enterprises. But in parallel with this, capital markets need to be promoted on a national basis. Barriers, regulatory and cultural, need to be removed. Many SMEs and many start-ups would prefer to experiment and innovate with investment and expansion at home before they step outside their borders. If they make a success there, a move towards other European markets will be seen as achievable and attainable. Indeed, the cultural factors that define entrepreneurship cannot be ignored. It is necessary to define exactly what makes capital markets in the USA so much more dynamic. However, it would be unwise to implement a Capital Markets Union (CMU) simply by transposing the US model to Europe. The proposals made by the Commission do not go in this direction. Debt to finance investment is much more prevalent in Europe than elsewhere. Clearly we need to encourage a shift towards equity as contrasted to debt-based instruments in financing even small-scale projects. Again, that is best done by starting from a national level. I would in fact urge that, in this context, special attention is paid to promoting the financial organisation of equities to fund non-speculative investments by services and SMEs in peripheral, isolated and island regions of the Union. The Commission is doing the right thing by emphasising the digital sector. Here, a new generation of European innovators and entrepreneurs is emerging. They might be more willing to attempt new ways of meeting financial risks and challenges than their predecessors. In all this, the proposed step-by-step approach is praiseworthy. Too many new procedures and regulations to follow would, in the end, only increase barriers to entry and increase costs.

In Germany, savings banks and Volksbanken in particular are opposed to this. The reserves are fed up with deposits made by savers. A communitarization of national security systems is therefore a cold expropriation of German savers. The German Federal Government has therefore so far refused to communitarise – but for how long? Anyone who wants to hold together a misconceived monetary union cannot, in the end, escape the immanent logic of communitarisation. At some point, the chancellor will buckle.

I would like to raise three points in this context.  First of all, the launch of the call for evidence on the EU regulatory framework for financial services. I think it is an extremely good approach to look for feedback from the stakeholders not only on the cumulative impact of the financial services legislation and the possible gaps but also on how individual pieces of legislation interact. However, I believe that this impact assessment must be continuous and not a one-off exercise, because the Capital Markets Union (CMU) is a long-term project and its architecture will only be fully in place in 2019. Also, many new issues may arise in Level 2 legislation. The second point is related to the fact that the capital markets are transnational and global and therefore, even more so than in the case of banking regulation, particular attention should be paid to European legislation being consistent with the international and global framework and context. Regulation must be suited to a global business and, while reflecting the European specificities where necessary, it should also be compatible with regulation in other jurisdictions.  The third point concerns the fact that I understand that the CMU should be focused on end-savers and companies whose deposits currently do not find their way to the markets, but it should also encourage investors to commit funding to capital markets. This implies that investors must be protected throughout the process of constructively investing funds. In this context I find that an important element is the regime for Central Counterparty Clearing House (CCP) recovery and resolution, and I look forward to seeing this proposal prepared by the Commission soon.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1196, "date": "2015-10-07.json", "name": "Eva Paunova (PPE).", "mepid": "98341", "text": "   – Mr President, Commissioner, according to Steve Jobs success is about connecting the dots. I hope that you forgive me by starting off with a quote from an American and not a European entrepreneur, but actually this quote comes from a place where SMEs get about five times more funding from the capital markets than European companies do. The success of the European economy really does depend on connecting the dots between the individual markets and on unleashing the free movement of capital. This is how I personally see the Capital Markets Union (CMU), as the tool that connects the dots between the capital markets of 28 individual states. I would also like to emphasise three points, out of the six proposed immediate actions, that are particularly important in my view. The first is connecting the CMU with the Juncker plan. I am happy to see that support for the Juncker plan is priority number one. Only through the combination of both for Europe can we unlock and diversify financing quickly and as soon as possible. My second point is about connecting achievements and aspirations or, to put it differently, what we have done so far and what we aim at in the future. The call for evidence on the impact of existing reforms is, I believe, also a very important step. It will definitely create an overall regulatory environment that strikes the right balance between managing risk and supporting growth. My last point is connecting and analysing success stories.

Simplified prospectus requirements for IPOs, new impulses through securitised loans and solvency, new ideas for venture capital – this will have its positive effects. But securitisation, IPOs, venture capital, that is only one side of the coin of a soundly financed economy. Much depends on the financing via the traditional credit market, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. Are we really doing enough at this point? In Greece, 67% of all bank loans are rejected, and until there are sustainable reforms, that will not change. A Capital Markets Union without reforms will be fizzled out. What about SME loans in Italy, Austria or Germany? Attempts to increase the risk weighting of SME loans in the Basel criteria are now making it almost fatal. Counterproductive is also what the ECB means by the beautiful name Anna-Kredit – Anna is my daughter's name, but what is happening now is not so nice. With each loan of EUR 25 000, credit institutions are to provide 150 new data sets. This is the opposite of cutting red tape.

We all know that we are a very capital-poor region compared with some other regions and very dependent on our innovation and growth and on bank lending. And if we want to grow, and if we want to put our efforts into innovation, we need a common Capital Market Union and much better efforts on raising private assets for investment. There are four points that I would like to raise in this context. Firstly, this is an issue about European fund structure, starting from venture capital to private investors, where we would need better initiatives at European level on the funds and incentives for creating those, plus linking public investments in the longer term, like the European Fund for Strategic Investment and national funds, in terms of fund structure. This is essential because quite often our upper limit of funds is below the lowest level for, for example, major Asian or Chinese investors. The second point that should be further developed from this Capital Markets Union paper is investor protection. If we are not more open – more of a level playing field – on investor protection in Europe, it is difficult to see how we can reach more private equity, especially from private individuals in this field. What that means is understanding and transparency – for example, through information leaflets for whatever type of investors in relation to stranded assets such as the ‘carbon bubble’. Then, last but not least, I would like to raise the need to create a kind of highway for our SMEs and small start-ups, to start raising private capital, with regulation requirements that increase gradually and lead to smooth transition to our exchanges, as nowadays the exchange step is too high for quite a number of our companies.

Of course, this Commission started a year ago with the message that one of the key elements for these five years is the integration of capital markets. If I now look at the Commission's action plan, there is not much left of this great promise that we heard here from Jean-Claude Juncker in July 2014. Let me make this very clear: the proposals are very unambitious, they concern only a small area of issues that are addressed within the framework of a capital markets union. On the other hand, important aspects are not addressed at all. Just to address the topic of crowd funding: Maybe something will come sometime next year. How is consumer protection guaranteed here, how are uniform standards being established here? This is already an issue that we should address. Secondly, we are told here that this would be the great instrument for giving small and medium-sized enterprises access to the capital market. We must agree that not every baker around the corner will become a public limited company tomorrow – and he does not have to. But we should be honest with each other. Access to the capital market is an option, but it is not the only one. Instead, we must now use the time to stabilise structures, reduce risks and not pool risks. That is why I say very clearly that all the considerations that now go beyond the action plan, as I have also read in the five-presidents' report, worry me very much, because this is not about reducing risks and thereby bringing stability to the financial markets, but suddenly it is about pooling the risks, anonymising them, raising them to the European level without being able to guarantee them at all. , and thus perpetuate the errors.

Even though free movement of capital was one of the principles on which the EU was built, its capital markets infrastructure is characterised by fragmentation, caused mainly by factors with their origin in national laws, such as insolvency, tax and security laws. As its purpose is to overcome these obstacles, I believe the Capital Markets Union (CMU) has real potential in terms of jobs, growth and financial resilience. Stronger capital markets will unlock more investment from the EU and the rest of the world, and better connect financing to investment projects across the Union. I support the proposed innovative forms of business financing and the harmonisation of accounting standards for small and medium-sized enterprises. European small and medium-sized enterprises’ equal access to finance and thus to capital markets should be one of the leading principles of CMU.

I must say that I was positively surprised by the widespread support that the Capital Markets Union (CMU) initiative has received from the various parts of this House. I also recognise and acknowledge that we have to look at the proposals very carefully in order not to create new risks which may destabilise the financial sector in Europe. But I am also quite confident that we have learned a lot from the previous financial crisis, not only here in Europe but also in the USA and elsewhere. For instance, when it comes to securitisation, there were good points made to the effect that we have to be cautious. But I must say that we have been working very closely on this issue with the European Central Bank, with the European banking authorities and with the other central banks in Europe, so I am quite confident that we have managed to find a good balance between making it possible to take more risk while at the same time keeping a close eye on the stability side of things. So the basic idea of securitisation is, as many Members said, is to offer new sources of financing for SMEs and diversify the financial sector in Europe. Banks will play a central role in the CMU in the future. They will remain the main source of funding for small firms and entrepreneurs needing working capital or low-level funding. We are also exploring the possibility for all Member States to authorise credit unions which operate outside the EU framework on capital requirements for banks, in order to alleviate the regulatory burden on small banks. I would like to thank Kay Swinburne for her comment when she said that now we are dealing with the issues which are supposed to change the mind-set in Europe: let the people become the investor. In some of our Member States we have a political culture in which the capital market is seen as the exclusive domain of those who own a lot of capital. But there are other Member States in which the culture is more pragmatic, believing that the capital market is part of the market economy, and that we need a well-functioning capital market in order to finance the real economy with real private and public investment, and thus create new jobs. I was very happy to hear this pragmatic approach so strongly represented in this House today. Ms Hübner raised the issue of impact assessment. This is another example of the very pragmatic approach we have. Looking back, we have created around 40 new regulations for the financial sector in the last few years. It is only human and understandable that there may be some unintended side-effects which do not serve anybody’s interest, and therefore it makes sense to collect evidence from the market and from different stakeholders and look to see if there is something which we did not intend when we created new regulations – and if that is the case, we have to change those things. This is not a general policy to deregulate, not at all, but we just want to make sure that our regulations function as we wanted them to function. The SME side is very strong in our action plan. For instance, the proposals for a pan-European venture capital fund of funds and multi-country funds, and also our aim to revise the European Venture Capital Funds (EuVECA) and Social Entrepreneurship Funds (EuSEF) legislation are very important, because if you compare the average size of venture capital funds in Europe with those in the USA there is a big difference, and this is an unfortunate thing because it tells us directly that the venture capital market is not as well-functioning and developed in Europe as it is in the United States. The average size of a European venture capital fund is 60 million whereas the American peer is 280 million. This basically shows the difference and is the reason why – apart from what we are doing with the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI), i.e. raising the amount of money which is channelled through the EIF to SMEs and start-ups – we want to look at this regulatory side in order to encourage venture capital funds to grow in Europe. Focus will also be put on long-term infrastructure investment, and there one of the first proposals is to adjust Solvency II calibrations for insurance investment in infrastructure and long-term investment funds. This, again, can be one of the quick wins which will release a large amount of capital for productive, concrete infrastructure projects that are desperately needed in Europe. Madam President, many colleagues mentioned something about the level of ambition. I would like to measure our joint level of ambition by how quickly we deliver. As I mentioned before, we managed to decide on the EFSI Regulation in only six months.

I know that it does not depend only on this House but also on the political will of the European Council.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Vice-President of the Commission, tomorrow we will approve the compromise text on the new directive on payment services in the internal market.  This directive is in addition to the regulation on interchange fees for which Mrs Zalba was rapporteur and complements the package of legislative proposals on the European payments market presented by Commissioner Barnier during the last parliamentary term, a package that I also shared and supported in my previous capacity as Vice-President of the European Commission. The final compromise received the support of all the political groups and was adopted unanimously in the ECON Committee. I would therefore like to thank the European Parliament's negotiating team which, under the leadership of President Ferber, achieved excellent results during the difficult negotiations with the Council. I would also like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who have actively contributed to the drafting of a good legislative text.  In Europe, the retail payments market is dynamic and has been much revamped compared to recent years. 34% of European citizens now make almost exclusively online purchases and more than 50% own a smartphone that guarantees them access to the world of mobile payments. For some sectors of the economy, such as the travel industry, most sales now take place only via the Internet.  The measure we are about to approve will rule on payment services via the Internet, that is, those services that I intervene in the relationship between merchant and buyer's bank, allowing payments to be made without a credit card. The new rules will also govern the activities of current account information services. These services provide you with aggregated online information about one or more accounts used to make payments. It is a service that allows small businesses and craftsmen in particular to have an overview of their financial situation at any time.  The final agreement will also make it possible to reduce the risk of fraud. All payment service providers will be obliged to adopt secure, authenticated or encrypted communications technologies, which will be regularly evaluated and updated by the European Banking Authority. The main beneficiaries of the new directive, however, will be consumers, who will be able to benefit from reduced costs and greater legal protection.  Furthermore, thanks to the amendments proposed by the European Parliament and adopted, consumers will have a number of advantages: firstly, they will receive free information on transactions carried out; second will be entitled to an unconditional refund in the case of fraud and unauthorized payments. In addition, with this directive we are solving the problems that citizens and businesses encounter every day when making payments online or via mobile device.  Let us also open up the market to new operators and reduce the costs of an overly fragmented and expensive system, the total cost of which today amounts to around EUR 130 billion per year. The new directive that Parliament will finally approve tomorrow will strengthen the competitiveness of the European payments market, encouraging innovation and security in a sector that is constantly changing. Given the exponential growth of e-commerce, the new rules will give a decisive boost to the development of a single market that is ever closer to the needs of consumers and businesses.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1221, "date": "2015-10-07.json", "name": "Jyrki Katainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to acknowledge the effort and hard work of Vice-President Tajani in achieving a balanced, fair and forward-looking text that will allow for innovation and greater choice for consumers. I also wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their diligent and dedicated work: Olle Ludvigsson, Sophia in ’t Veld, Ashley Fox, Eva Joly, Matt Carthy and Marco Valli. Payments, particularly cross-border internet payments, are essential for our single market. What is happening in the field of payments is a striking illustration of digital revolution. The original Payments Service Directive (PSD I) was adopted in 2007 and has proved to be an enormous success. It has brought real benefits to all stakeholders, especially consumers, with faster payments and clear refund rights, and it provided the legal basis for the Single European Payments Area.  However, financial services have evolved since 2007. When the first PSD was adopted it created an opportunity for banks to provide payment services. These new players developed significantly to the extent that they are often the main innovators on the market. Now our mobile phone, our banking applications or a third-party provider may well be our favourite way of making payments. Digitisation, new players and new processes have brought real benefits to European citizens, but also new risks, notably in terms of security issues that have to be addressed. This is why the revision of the original Payment Services Directive is particularly timely.  What does the second Payment Services Directive (PSD II) bring to the European payments market? Firstly, it allows for further technological developments and new market entrants while increasing security of payments to prevent fraud. Secondly, it introduces enhanced consumer protection, for example in the case of loss or theft of a payment card. Thirdly, taken together with the regulation on interchange fees adopted in May 2015, it reduces costs for both retailers and consumers and contributes to the creation of genuine EU-wide payment markets. New, safer and cheaper services have emerged in the area of internet payments. These services have developed massively in some Member States, overtaking cards for internet payments, and I trust this will rapidly happen elsewhere. Other services known as account information services allow consumers to have a global view of their financial situation and thus help budgeting and financial planning.  The creation of a level playing field for newcomers and incumbents alike will ensure that all actors operate to the same standards under the same authorisation and licensing procedures. This directive represents a major step forward for the payments market in Europe. High security standards will need to be implemented by all payment services providers for electronic payment transactions. At the same time, security should not unnecessarily impair convenience. Some flexibility will be possible, in particular for low-value and low-risk payment situations. It will be the task of the European Banking Authority (EBA) task to prepare draft regulatory technical standards on security and the authentication of customers. The Directorate-General for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union (DG FISMA) will work with Member States to ensure consistent transposition across the European Union and will hold transposition workshops starting early next year, 2016. I am very satisfied that the main objectives – competition, innovation and the development of the internal market in payments – are fully met in this text.

Secondly, for European citizens to pay fewer commissions when paying with their credit cards. Third, seeking to increase card payments, which would help fight tax fraud. A fourth objective, without a doubt, was to strengthen the single market. And finally, as Antonio has rightly said, to encourage and promote innovation in a field such as the means of payment, where we are continually seeing innovative new payment formulas. Today we can say that, once this Directive is implemented, supplemented by the Exchange Fees Regulation, these objectives will undoubtedly be met.

Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Theresa May for I welcome the agreement on the payment services directive that we are going to vote on tomorrow. The negotiations have been tough. I would have preferred a stronger internal market perspective and an even stronger consumer perspective. In terms of the whole, however, the final compromise is really good. I would like to point out three improvements brought about by the new rules. Firstly, competition will be intensified. Different types of bank-independent operators will be able to compete with banks in a fairer and more equitable way.  The so-called third-party operators, which offer payment initiation or account information, shall be included in the regulatory framework under virtually the same conditions as everyone else. It creates security and security for consumers. At the same time, it gives these actors the access they need for the business model to function. Banks should not be able to prevent them from delivering their services.  In addition, bank-independent payment systems should also be given more fair conditions. New information requirements shall ensure that such systems operate more efficiently.  All this will provide a healthier competitive situation in the payment market. This, in turn, will benefit both the consumer and society as a whole.  Secondly, legislation will promote innovation in both technological progress and business models. This will be an important effect of opening up the doors to new entrants.  We are now seeing the digital revolution sweeping the payment market as well. All the evidence suggests that much will happen in the next few years. The updated directive will serve as a solid basis for this development. Lots of consumers will be able to benefit from better payment services. In fact, I think that is excellent. Thirdly, the new rules will also strengthen the role of consumers in other respects. These include, for example, much tighter rules on surcharges, stricter requirements for undertakings in respect of transactions where the final amount is not first known, and reducing the liability of honest consumers in unauthorised transactions. Overall, the conclusion is clear. In a more competitive and innovative market, it will be simpler, cheaper, safer for the consumer to pay. It is clearly a step in the right direction.

Perhaps some in this Chamber have experienced it. I recently wanted to make a purchase with a Dutch credit card on a website from another Member State and that payment was refused because I did not use a credit card from the country of that website. Not only when purchasing products, but also with online paid services this still happens far too often and that is of course terribly irritating. So I am hopeful that, partly on the basis of Article 64 of this payment services directive, these infuriating things will become a thing of the past.  The Payment Services Directive should improve access to payment services and reduce costs and risks for consumers. This fits perfectly with the objectives of the digital internal market for which the Commission will shortly come forward with proposals. I am therefore surprised that, within the whole story of the digital single market, there is not one reference in the initiative report to the payment services.

This Payment Services Directive creates, in my view, some positive prospects, particularly for small and medium and budding start-up enterprises, by opening up the bank industry to third-party providers. Not only does this opening create possibly more employment and business opportunities but, very importantly, it allows for more consumer choice. Unsurprisingly, the European Banking Federation has vigorously opposed this directive, and their concerns have been couched under data protection or security fears. But in fact, to me, these issues are for the most part not only unfounded but are actually a ruse to deflect attention from the fact that vested financial interests do not wish to see their current dominant position put in jeopardy. The impact of the Payment Services Directive (PSD 2) when it becomes law will inevitably lead to increased competition for existing banks: the chance of collaboration for third-party providers on the creation of app stores, for example, leading to increased loyalty between collaborators and consumers and also, in some cases, to banks being cut out of the payment loop.

However, we welcomed the text voted on by Parliament and its content and followed closely the trialogues that were made under the Latvian Presidency.  On the one hand, a number of steps have certainly been taken, both through the inclusion of additional payment service providers such as credit cards in the directive and in the area of access to information, providing for fraud and abuse. On the other hand, the negotiating team, in order to close, had to accept a few small watered-down compromises on certain points: an exemption for the telecommunications sector requested by the Council provided that the value of each individual operation does not exceed EUR 50, more than EUR 100 per month; the right of withdrawal for the consumer is free of charge and guaranteed only after six months, whereas Parliament would have liked it free of charge all the time; an increase in the threshold from EUR 1 million to EUR 3 million in annual transactions, such as the clause necessary to derogate from the provisions of the directive, thus increasing the number of suppliers eligible for exemption.

We wanted to find a balance in the negotiations that I thankfully led in the trialogue, that the new technological possibilities can be introduced, that we have a secure legal framework, that we guarantee optimal consumer protection, optimal data protection, but also that we also allow Internet providers to develop in the market and that banks are no longer able to develop in the market. to block such payment services and payment triggers. If I may summarise this with this heading, we have achieved great success together in ensuring that we have a single legal framework in Europe that makes these technical possibilities possible, but at the same time ensures consumer protection and data protection. And we have ensured that the supervisory authorities also have appropriate access to ensure that the rules of the game are respected. I think that is part of it and that it must be mentioned. Banks – and rightly so – are no longer allowed to automatically block payment requests, as they have done in the past, because the old Payment Services Directive dates back to a time when smartphones did not yet exist and at that time there was no need to work with this challenge at all. The consumer is only liable in the event of gross negligence. I think it is an important step forward for consumer protection to really be transferred to the levels that are responsible for it. Here, too, we had a gap in the old Payment Services Directive, which was not covered cleanly until now. In other words, we have created an incentive, on the one hand, for start-ups in Europe to be able to deal with the issue of payment services in the broadest sense, but at the same time a legal framework for ensuring that this does not take place on the backs of consumers or at the expense of security. This means that access to account data does not take place. That is why this is a very good compromise that has been reached here. Many thanks to Antonio Tajani! We will vote in favour tomorrow.

I think we are all collectively pleased that Europe sees the emergence of players in this FinTech sector. But this satisfaction should not lead us to a somewhat blind form of enthusiasm. There are a number of policy objectives that we set ourselves: the security of purchases, equality between payment institutions and, of course, data protection, because we are regulators. It is important, as we discuss this directive, to remember that we say yes to innovation, but no to deregulation. That is what should guide our action.  From this point of view, even if it is a draft directive that has been discussed at length, at length, on this specific issue of data protection, the guarantees are not necessarily always sufficient.  We talked about the banks earlier, and I am not going to defend them, but we have legitimately put them on high demands. Payments through banks are more secure and when we do surveys, we notice that consumers, who make an online payment, have more confidence in their bank themselves.  There is another debate. We fought for data security and protection and, moreover, the European Court of Justice itself has finally agreed with us, with its ruling on the Safe Harbor agreement. What I mean, very simply and quickly, is that yes, we have to create definitions and statutes for these new uses but we have to be patient in the face of such transformations. Guarantees should not be erased to accelerate an evolution that still needs to be confirmed.  Therefore, I really think we need to create common rules and stick to them. Innovation, yes!

I very much welcome this because I believe that we have achieved important successes in two places. Firstly, we have created a real level playing field for the new digital payment methods. Nevertheless, this will mean that the universal banking model that has been in place in Europe will continue to come under pressure at this point. And there will be more segmented sectoral bank offers, all of which, of course, will have to work under the same guidelines in the end, under the same security requirements, under the same competitive requirements as the existing providers, so that we can actually maintain a uniform level playing field. Secondly, it is important that we get the right balance between the directive on the Internet, IT security, cyber security, on the one hand, presented by the Commission in 2013, on the one hand, and the directive on payment services, because, of course, in the digital age, we must take special precautions at the interface between payment services and traditional critical infrastructures, including banks and insurance companies. As I myself am rapporteur for the IT Security Directive, I think I can say that the proposals that the requirements of this directive are absolutely exemplary. Finally, of course, I am pleased that consumers will end up with a significant advantage from this Payment Services Directive by protecting their data and, secondly, by being able to trust – as has already been mentioned before – that the services should protect them with a high level of protection and that they will only be liable for gross negligence.

All this to prevent the most expensive way to make payments, namely the use of cash, from being slowly reduced to a minimum. The Commission – we have also discussed this several times in our working groups – has estimated that an electronic transaction costs a few cents, whereas a transaction made through cash payment can cost up to 55 cents a unit.

It is important that the single market for payment services is modernised and strengthened, and this will bring significant added benefits in encouraging innovation, increasing competition and improving security. By improving cross-border payments in terms of harmonising a fragmented market for card, online and mobile payments, we can significantly increase the opportunities for SMEs and new entrepreneurial start-up companies to succeed and compete in the single market. This is vital. The proposal will widen consumer choice by ensuring that a payer using an online account has the right to use payment software devices provided by an authorised third party and have transactions executed on their behalf by the provider.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Cañete, red sludge is waste from industrial aluminium production, and the red sludge accident in Hungary five years ago is the basis of the oral question in this debate, because it was an environmental disaster of European dimensions and significance.  On 4 October 2010, the rupture of a catchment area in Hungary caused the spillage of about one million cubic meters of high-alkaline red sludge that flooded several villages, killed ten people and injured about 150 others, as well as polluting vast expanses of land, including four sites in the Natura 2000 area.  The accident highlighted the problems of waste disposal in the extractive industry, the shortcomings in inspections and also showed that these problems can lead to sometimes tragic consequences. There are also technical and economic difficulties which local authorities and civil society had to encounter during the clean-up phase.  I believe that many things need to be changed if we really want to prevent such disasters from happening again in the future. Of course, there will always be a risk, but our aim is to improve the efficiency of the extractive industry and significantly lower the possibility that events similar to what happened five years ago in Hungary could happen again.  As far as prevention is concerned, the Member States are called upon to review their authorisations for such industrial sites, in view of the correct classification of waste. Therefore, the directive on waste management and extractive industries must be fully implemented and we call on the Commission to ensure that it is fully implemented.  The Member States also need to strengthen their environmental inspections and monitoring systems, we have already asked the European Commission in 2008 to present a legislative proposal on environmental controls, and so we can only reiterate the same request on this occasion and more strongly, given also what happened since 2008.  Great importance must also be attached to research and development in the field of the prevention and treatment of hazardous waste in order to achieve a complete transition in a short time to new disposal technologies. We also need support from the Commission for some stress tests for mines with large decanting basins. We do not want problems similar to those of the disaster five years ago to arise from these decanting basins.  With regard to disaster mitigation and clean-up, we are still awaiting the publication of the European Commission's report on the implementation of the Environmental Liability Directive due in April 2014. We also believe that the financial instruments are of crucial importance and we therefore call for all possible aspects to be explored, both as regards the ceilings of the financial guarantee instruments already established, as well as for the instruments of compulsory financial guarantee, as well as for the greater concept of European sharing of risks from environmental disasters.  Finally, we must emphasise the role and financial transparency, the importance of civil society and access to justice, all of which deserve attention from the European institutions. In conclusion, Commissioner, only if we all step up our efforts will we have the right to say that we have finally learned our lesson from the red sludge disaster five years after the accident, by putting in place concrete measures to prevent such disasters and eliminate pollution from mining.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1253, "date": "2015-10-07.json", "name": "Nicolas Schmit", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  President-in-Office of the Council. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, indeed, five years ago, you just said, a few days after the disaster, Hungary informed the Council of the red mudslides in the west of the country, their effects, the measures taken by the Hungarian authorities to deal with the consequences for man and for the environment.  Shortly after the accident, on 20 December 2010, the Council, in its conclusions on improving environmental policy instruments, called on Member States and the Commission to strengthen the implementation of EU environmental legislation. A considerable body of EU legislation to prevent accidents such as the one in Hungary is in place. It includes legislation on integrated pollution prevention and reduction and waste management in the extractive industry, I think you referred to it. Industrial accidents fall under the Environmental Responsibility Directive. The management and disposal of waste in a Member State is the responsibility of that Member State, and each Member State is responsible for the transposition and implementation of EU legislation, under the control, of course, of the Commission. Specifically, Member States must ensure that the relevant authorities monitor the operation of waste management facilities in the extractive industry. They must also ensure that the necessary measures to prevent contamination of water and soil have been taken and that regular checks are carried out to verify compliance with these measures. It is up to the Commission to ensure that Member States fulfil these obligations to implement EU legislation. It has the power to take legal action against a Member State that is in breach of its obligations. In addition, the Commission has the right of initiative to present new proposals to the Council and the European Parliament, if it believes that further measures at EU level are needed. It goes without saying that the Council will deal with any proposals with the necessary attention. I am sure the Commissioner will have an opportunity to speak on that. In particular, it is important to fully implement the existing environmental inspection rules, in close collaboration with the relevant stakeholders. Cooperation projects in the area of environmental inspections, including at the regional level, facilitate the full implementation of EU environmental legislation, particularly on waste. Ladies and gentlemen, the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle, as well as the obligation to repair the damage done to the environment, are now part of the fundamental principles of international environmental law, on the one hand, and the acquis of the European Union on the other. Indeed, they were enshrined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In the specific case of the 2010 disaster in Hungary, I draw your attention to the fact that, in according the polluter-pay principle, the company responsible for the disaster has been subject to heavy penalties.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1254, "date": "2015-10-07.json", "name": "Miguel Arias Cañete", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, as Mr La Via has stated, the red mud accident which happened on 4 October 2010 in Ajka had a very serious impact: 10 people died and more than 150 were injured; 400 houses were flooded, 40 square kilometres of land were affected. About one million cubic metres of red mud flowed downstream, causing the greatest environmental disaster in the history of Hungary. Relief and rehabilitation expenditure amounted to 35 billion Hungarian forints – that is to say about EUR 115 million. Today, five years later, the main lesson to be drawn is that, in order to prevent this kind of disaster, two conditions have to be met. First, we need to have good legislation in place. Secondly, the legislation then has to be fully and effectively implemented. And, of course, it is also important to keep legislation under review, to update it and to make sure it is fit to address new challenges. Although nobody can guarantee that other accidents will never happen, we are today in a better situation than five years ago, thanks to the improvements in our legislation. There is, indeed, a large and solid body of EU legislation applying to extractive activities, which includes measuring industrial emissions, preventing major accidents and managing extractive waste, as well as protecting water and natural resources. The Commission keeps the implementation of the legislation under close scrutiny and has proposed measures to update and enhance it. Since the red mud accident took place a number of legal changes have been adopted to reinforce the mechanisms available to address hazards and accidents in extractive industries. Today, the Industrial Emissions Directive and the Directive on control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances set out requirements on industrial inspections that are more stringent than those applicable at the time of the accident. They also include more detailed obligations to inform the public and to enable it to participate in relevant planning procedures. This will result in safer installations and will increase awareness and make for better preparedness. The Commission has been working with Member States to ensure the effective implementation of these new inspection requirements. The Commission is also cooperating with IMPEL, the network of European Environmental Inspectorates, to promote best practice in the conduct of inspections. The Commission has recently also considered the feasibility of an industrial risk-reducing facility or fund in the framework of the Environmental Liability Directive to deal with the environmental consequences of major accidents. An assessment of this option has been carried out with a high level of participation by stakeholders. In the opinion of the Commission, the results do not provide sufficient grounds to propose a new financial mechanism. However, the Commission wishes to underline that, although the Environmental Liability Directive in its current form does not impose mandatory financial security schemes at European Union level to cover for damage due to industrial accidents, it allows Member States to do so and obliges them to develop financial security instruments and markets. Extractive waste is one of the larger waste streams in the European Union. The transition towards a circular economy should therefore bring about significant improvements. Increasing the efficiency of extraction processes will help reduce waste generation and associated pollution. More efficient techniques will allow the remining and processing of quarrying waste. More efficient waste-recovery systems will reduce the pressures on our natural capital. We can reduce our dependence on extractive materials through urban mining – recovering valuable materials from the products we no longer need, for example by getting the gold from used mobile phones. Hungary was also devastated by the Baia Mare disaster of 2000 when cyanide used in gold mining in Romania leaked into the Danube River. If we can get more gold from used electronic equipment, we can use less cyanide. The revised Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment will ensure that Member States collect 85% of such waste, increasing the potential supply of gold from recycling. Finally, the Commission is using Horizon 2020 funding to boost research and innovation, to develop clean and sustainable production of primary and secondary raw materials, to reduce waste generation and to develop environmentally-friendly technologies that prevent hazardous waste generation. In our 2014-2015 work programme we specifically allocated more than EUR 150 million to a focus area on waste: a resource to recycle, reduce and recover raw materials.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1255, "date": "2015-10-07.json", "name": "György Hölvényi", "mepid": "124715", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, I thank the Commissioner, President La Via, for his thoughts and commemorations, and as a former resident of the area, I would like to recall very briefly the red sludge disaster that spilled from mal zrt.'s reservoir near Ajka exactly five years ago, on 4 October 2010, which flooded three municipalities: Kolontár, Devecser and Somlóvásárhely. As a result of the disaster, as mentioned here, it is fitting to remember that ten people have died, more than 200 have been injured and hundreds of houses have become uninhabitable. The unprecedented devastation has forced exemplary spite. In an extraordinary situation, Hungary simply stood up as a human being. The strong and professional action of the authorities has earned widespread international recognition. The standing of civilians has become a symbol of deep-seated solidarity in Hungarian society to this day. Kolontár, Devecser and Somlóvásárhely are symbols of cooperation. It is of the utmost importance to me that the decision on the lessons learnt from the disaster mentions all this.  Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that, with multiparty agreement in the Committee on the Environment, we have succeeded in adopting a draft that, in addition to sober consideration of the causes of industrial accidents, will also set out future tasks. For me, the real lesson of Kolontár is the failure of the polluter pays principle. Even if EU law provides for liability, without mandatory financial guarantees, the polluter will not be able to compensate for the damage caused by it. It is therefore essential that the European Commission continue to work on the creation of an EU disaster insurance system capable of applying the polluter pays principle even in the event of large industrial disasters.

There is no doubt that this disaster has wreaked incredible havoc on one of the most beautiful areas of Hungary, defining the fate of this whole region for a very long time, including that of the surviving families. What we have done, and there have been many contributors to this report, I believe that everyone has done their job with sufficient self-control, and in that sense we have indeed managed to put our eyes on a slightly wider focus than just a single disaster, and perhaps it is true that we have managed to learn some lessons from what has happened. For me, there are two very important lessons: one, as Mr Hölöli said, is the application of the polluter pays principle. Indeed, this is yet another long-term task before we are able to develop at European level a safeguards system that can cope with any disaster on the territory of the Union. However, let us not forget that in this case, too, the Hungarian authorities saw this facility as perfectly fine a few days before the accident, and released the relevant documents. In other language, when there is control, it comes with responsibility, and that is a very, very important part of it.  The other very important lesson that I think is worth talking about here is that, yes, the whole country is moving at this time of year. That was a very nice example. Private people, institutions, corporations, companies, everyone was trying to help people in trouble somewhere. At the same time, the assistance that had otherwise been collected on the roads cared for by the State was no longer so clear in the matter of accounting, and it was not possible to see where the contribution of whom would go.

Of course, we must reflect on the disaster of five years ago and its major consequences. I hope that we will learn from it, even after five years.  When I look at paragraph 4 of our resolution, in which we highlight the causes of this disaster, I would like to draw two things from it. That is, first of all, the poor implementation, especially at Member State level, of European legislation and, secondly, very poor inspection or even the lack of proper inspection. I have to say that, a day after the debate on the Volkswagen fraud, this is a very cynical observation, because here too we come to the same conclusion: extremely poor implementation of legislation by the Member States and the lack of inspection.  Since the previous speakers have already put so much emphasis on the 'polluter pays' principle, I would like to emphasise paragraph 17 in which we are talking about a European Commission bill to achieve environmental inspections at EU level, something we have already agreed on in the seventh environmental action programme. So I would like to call on the Commission to make a real move on this. It cannot be very difficult because there is a proposal on the shelf. Commissioner Potočnik has worked this in the past.

So it seems that little has been learned from what happened five years ago. It is therefore appropriate to ask both the Council and the Commission what has been and will be done, for example, for the safe treatment of waste water from mines in the coming years.

Thus, on the five-year anniversary, the most important and first thing to do is to commemorate the 10 victims and the hundreds of injured who suffered this disaster. On the other hand, obviously, our job as politicians is to do everything we can to ensure that such a disaster does not happen again. The lessons learned from the colonial accident are diverse. We have found that eu legislation has been poorly transposed in Hungary, and the incorrect transposition of the Mining Waste Directive has also played a role in the disaster.  There were also serious problems with the implementation of the legislation, as well as the disaster due to the inadequate application of the hazardous waste legislation. And as mentioned, the poor performance of the authorities also played a very important role. The previous Commission prepared a substance for official environmental controls, which has not been found in the maze of the new Commission since. I think that on the five-year anniversary, we rightly expect the Commission to come up with a proposal on environmental controls. At the same time, as many others have said, a very important experience of the colonial catastrophe is that the 'polluter pays' principle cannot be applied effectively in Europe today.  There could be various instruments for this: a system of compulsory environmental liability insurance, the setting up of a common European industrial disaster fund. These need to be examined and the right means must be found to ensure that what happened in Hungary five years ago did not occur, that a damage of 40 billion forints, some 120 million euros, had to be covered by the Hungarian taxpayers, the Hungarian budget, and not a penny was contributed by those who caused the damage.

However, due to unclear ownership structures and the lack of accountable persons, there are still cases where disposal simply cannot be solved.  It is time to create an autonomous instrument within the EU framework that also finances the disposal of old environmental burdens and can serve as a kind of immediate immersion mechanism for the response to ecological disasters.

I am proud of it because, as in recent months the civilian world has moved and done its job for the government in relation to refugees, it is incredible how many fundraisers, forint donations and other donations have been raised in Hungary. When red sludge swept away lives in and around Kolontár, solidarity, strength and humaneness were revealed. In a country where almost one in six people live in income poverty, more than EUR 2 billion, more than EUR 6.5 million, has been raised from public interest in this country.  It's a nice experience, but there's a negative one too. And this is about how, if you look at exactly how the government has spent the resources that society has put together. Some of it was given to the victims, but a large part of it was rested in a bank account, according to the communication at the time, to take advantage of bank interest. It was then used for so-called Community purposes. I do not deny, and I trust, that many municipalities could indeed benefit from the money put together by members of society in the Community institutions. Well, there are examples where they built a football field with artificial grass for 11 million forints. I'm not sure that we, the members of society who gave, wanted to spend the money on this.

It was a disaster in which 10 people were killed, 150 people were injured, 300 houses became uninhabitable and immeasurable residential and environmental damage was caused in Hungary. However, this catastrophe was followed by a series of scandals and corruption cases in the years that followed. The scandalous rescue operation, the injustice of damage assessments, and the missing compensation money further underslested the terrible human tragedies that a series of people had to live in Kolontár and the surrounding area. Even this terrible human tragedy has been used by Viktor Orban's government to carry out corruption cases.  According to a Hungarian investigative portal specialising in the investigation of corruption cases, more than HUF 10 billion of the 38 billion HUF taxpayers' money intended for total damage has been found to have been put in the pockets of pro-government oligarchs and businesses. Most of the money was won by a company, a then oligarch, a pro-government oligarch, which is still the subject of many OLAF investigations today. On the other hand, my fellow Member has already referred to this, with fantastic national cooperation, 2 billion HUF has been raised by the Hungarian population to help with the rescue. Unfortunately, some of this HUF 2 billion has disappeared, and some of it has not been used to repair the damage and not to help the injured, but to invest in visuals. A FIFA-compatible football field was built, a memorial park was built, a nature trail was built and a housing complex was built, but half of its houses were unusable and the victims could not use it.  In other words, in addition to the environmental lessons and the industrial lessons, there is another lesson: unscrupulous politicians can use the terrible tragedies of other people to enrich their own political economic lunar yard.

After any tragedy, the media attention and public outcry places a certain pressure on politicians to be seen to do something, and new regulation is the way that politicians traditionally respond. But introducing new regulation, whilst often the popular short-term solution, is often the most damaging thing that politicians can do for the long-term stability of an industry and the society that it serves. We remain committed to ensuring that every industry is as safe as it can be, but also recognising that risk requires an assessment, and any regulations imposed on an industry need to be measured, and the impact on that industry – indeed, whether it can actually survive the introduction of new regulation – needs to be carefully considered. The Hungarian people were the ones affected by this disaster, and it should be for their elected representatives in their parliament to determine how best to avoid a similar disaster in the future, and not for the unelected Commission to impose its will on an entire industry and an entire people, potentially at the cost of that entire industry and the jobs that it sustains.

First of all, I will refer to a question from Mr Gerbrandy, Mr Jávor and Mr Frunzulică, which is the question of implementation of directives. The Commission is monitoring the implementation of the Directive on the Management of Extractive Waste – mainly on the basis of reported information submitted by Member States referring almost exclusively to legal adaptation processes, but the Commission services are exploring additional ways to obtain a more integrated and broader picture of the implementation of the directive on the ground. And, when needed, the Commission has launched legal proceedings to address identified shortcomings in the transposition or implementation of this legislation. Legal proceedings on extractive waste have been opened for Hungary, for instance, as well as for Denmark, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Spain, inter alia. The Commission is also in the process of identifying the main areas where further action may be required. As a first step, based on reporting from Member States, the Commission plans to submit a report on implementation of the directive to the European Parliament and the Council at the beginning of 2016. As a further step, the Commission will carry out a more in-depth assessment of the level of implementation of relevant provisions of the directive. All this information will allow the Commission to identify implementation gaps and best practices and take additional action to promote compliance with the objectives of the directive. As regards inspection issues, while acknowledging that enforcement and inspections remain key issues in the hands of the Member States, the Commission is currently considering the follow-up to be given in this respect and in the wider context of compliance assurance, as set out by the Seventh Environmental Action Programme. Specifically in answer to Ms Kyllönen on the question of legislation on hazardous waste, the European Waste List has recently been modified to ensure, inter alia, that red mud is assessed for hazardous properties. When classified by the Member States as hazardous waste it would be subject to strict control requirements, provided for in the Waste Framework Directive, for its management, labelling and transport.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1278, "date": "2015-10-07.json", "name": "Presidente. –", "mepid": "2187", "text": "   I have received one motion for a resolution1 pursuant to Rule 128(5) of the Rules of Procedure.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issues of security of energy supply and the need for closer cooperation in this area, both internally and with our partners, have emerged at the top of the Union's political agenda. Energy is, in fact, a geostrategic sector and security of supply is a major issue for the European Union. In this regard, many measures have already been taken in the past. I would like, among other things, to mention the implementation of the third package on the internal market, the renewable energy and energy efficiency directives, which strengthen our independence, the Commission's communication to the European Parliament and the Council on the European Energy Security Strategy, cooperation with neighbouring countries within the energy community. At the end of 2014, the Energy Union was launched. The Presidency considers this to be a major step, a qualitative leap in the development of European energy policy and in strengthening security of supply. This Union has five dimensions of equal importance: security of supply, a fully integrated internal energy market, energy efficiency, emissions reduction and, finally, research and innovation.  On this last point, I would like to recall that the Presidency recently organised Energy Technology Week in Luxembourg, which brought together more than 500 experts from the sector, energy ministers and business leaders, including entrepreneurs in the field of renewable energy.  The Energy Union also highlights the strengthening of regional energy cooperation, which will strengthen market integration while achieving savings and creating energy in terms of investment. Furthermore, in the context of the implementation of the Energy Union and, in particular, the strengthening of the security of gas supply, the Council expects the European Commission to present a set of proposals on natural gas supply in 2016.  The Presidency is monitoring the preparatory work, including public consultations on these issues.  With regard to the Nord Stream pipeline extension project more specifically, the Commission has not yet adopted an official position. This is a commercial project between Russian and Western companies. The Presidency is fully aware that this project involves energy, economic, geopolitical and environmental issues. It raises questions, particularly with regard to the project's contribution to the diversification of the EU's roads and energy sources and its impact on other countries. For its part, the Commission, the guardian of the treaties and compliance with EU legislation, is tasked with examining this project in view of the established legal framework and, in particular, the rules relating to the internal market.  The Presidency would like to assure you that this matter is being followed up in the Council. It also continues to advance the implementation of the Energy Union and, in particular, the strengthening of the European Union's security of supply and energy independence, which also includes the development and promotion of renewable energies. Energy and climate - today we have heard a lot of messages about climate - are, in this respect, intimately linked.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1281, "date": "2015-10-07.json", "name": "Miguel Arias Cañete", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members allow me to start by reinforcing a key message: ensuring secure and resilient energy supplies to European citizens and companies is a top priority for the Commission. In the coming months alone we will put forward a review of the Gas Security of Supply Regulation, publish a new comprehensive liquefied natural gas (LNG) and gas storage strategy and propose changes to the intergovernmental agreements (IDAs) in order to make sure that they are in line with European security-of-supply objectives. That is also why we have committed to diversifying our energy sources, suppliers and routes. The goal is simple: putting an end to overdependence on a single supplier or route and giving Member States potential sources of gas, be it pipeline gas from different sources or energy storage. In this regard, we will tap into a rapidly growing energy market which will allow us to more than double our imports from around 40 million m3 to up to 90 million m3 by 2020.  We will invest in doubling our storage and accelerate the work on better interconnections between Member States. We are making good progress in this area. In fact, in the last few months alone we managed to have the first tangible results in regions that are still insufficiently linked within the internal market. Let me give you a few examples. The new High Level Group on Gas Connectivity in Central, Eastern and South-East Europe will increase interconnectors in that region in the post-South-Stream situation. The political agreement in July between Spain, Portugal and France on the development of the MidCat pipeline will increase gas interconnection capacity within the Iberian peninsula and the rest of Europe. We are hopeful that MidCat will be operational by 2020.  Work is also on track for our first delivery of 10 billion m3 per year of gas from Azerbaijan to Europe in 2020 through the Trans-Anatolian and the Trans-Adriatic pipelines. The restructured Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan (BEMIP) will be our key instrument for integrating the Baltic countries fully into Europe. We will see that come to fruition this week when the agreement on the gas interconnector between Poland and Lithuania (GIPL) will be signed. That project includes a planned contribution of almost EUR 300 million. I cannot stress how important that work is, because, as it stands, the European Union is still importing most of its gas from Russia, about half of which currently crosses Ukraine –and that brings me on to Nord Stream II. The Commission has taken note of the shareholder’s agreement to build further stretches of the Nord Stream pipeline. The first thing to say is that Nord Stream II remains a commercial project and of course it will be for the commercial party to decide which infrastructure is valuable for them. But let me be clear, as with any other pipeline in the European Union, this pipeline will have to comply fully with European Union law, in particular the Third Energy Package but also environmental, competition and public procurement rules. The Commission will assess it rigorously against the European regulatory framework, and that assessment will be done on its own merits. Transport capacity from Russia is currently at a rate of around only 50%, and that already well exceeds the likely future needs of the European Union in terms of supply. If constructed, according to our estimation, Nord Stream II will further increase the excess transmission capacity from Russia. I want to stress that the Commission actively supports efforts to ensure that Ukraine is and will remain a stable and reliable transit route.  Let finish by underlining the fact that the European Union remains open for Russian gas, and we would like to see Russia as a reliable supplier of natural gas in the future, but we would also like to see that the transport of Russian gas feeds into our diversification strategy and that the Russian supplier, like any other supplier in the European Union, plays to our competition and energy market rules.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1282, "date": "2015-10-07.json", "name": "Jerzy Buzek", "mepid": "28269", "text": "  On behalf of the PPE Group. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by I respect economic freedom, in which companies are guided firstly by the desire for profit and, secondly, by the applicable law. In the case of Nord Stream II, however, I have doubts about both. Firstly, it is difficult to talk about profits, since the already existing infrastructure for the transmission of gas from the east is used only in half, and the location of pipes on the seabed is much more expensive than on land and can also have adverse environmental effects. Secondly, Nord Stream II is contrary to the energy security obligations adopted by all Member States and is part of the abuse of a dominant market position by a single supplier, which is currently being investigated in antitrust proceedings by the European Commission against Gazprom.  In conclusion, this project cannot be regarded as purely commercial, since it brings political tensions known from the construction of Nord Stream I, differentiates EU countries from the point of view of energy security, threatens our neighbourhood partners, divides us, does not unite us, and, in addition, is economically difficult to justify. We expect the European Commission to take all possible steps to stop the creation of Nord Stream II in the event of non-compliance, just as it managed to stop the creation of South Stream.

Today there are three: Nord Stream not doubled, Yamal via Belarus, the Ukrainian transit network, and they would become two.  So there is a first problem with the diversification of transit routes. Reducing routes means questioning the already weak balance between Member States in energy supplies. This is a major problem, especially for those who are currently engaged in the construction of europe's most ambitious energy policy governance project, of which security of supply is a key component.  It is also a further serious problem for the Eu ropean Union as a whole, regardless of the exclusive dimension of energy policy, because cutting Ukraine off the gas routes means weakening ukraine's consolidation path and exposing Eastern Europe to heavy Russian influence. The Russian supplier has announced that supplies for the Ukrainian GTS will end in 2020, thus foreshadowing for Kiev the loss of many billions of euros that are paid to it each year in the form of transit tariffs; It is a threat to the economic and social stability of that country, but also to the energy and production resilience of much of Eastern Europe.

The Commissioner pointed out that, in the light of the regulations at the time, he would never again choose to support this investment. When I asked Commissioner Oettinger again a year ago why Germany had transferred the right to use the OPAL gas pipeline, which is an extension of the Nord Stream gas pipeline, to Gazprom, I received a disarming answer that this is a private initiative and that the German Government has no influence on its implementation. A few weeks ago, I asked you, Commissioner, about the Commission's attitude towards the construction of Nord Stream II in the context of the implementation of the 3rd Energy Package and the Energy Union that I am rapporteur for. The answer was similar to the previous ones, and today you also reiterated that this is a private initiative over which the Commission has no influence.  Nord Stream will supply 110 billion cubic metres of gas per year, which is more than 50% of its imports into the European Union. This completely esched the idea of diversification and security of supply in the light of the requirements of the European Energy Union. It particularly affects the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which are left alone in the face of the dominance of supplies from the eastern direction.

What really needs to worry the Union, however, is why there are still members who are isolated in the South. Also, that there are Member States in the South that have serious problems with energy efficiency. What should also be of concern is that these developments marginalise the Southern Pipeline and the Commission must realise that it must make more use of domestic energy sources. However, it continues to overlook the role of the recently discovered deposits in Cyprus, as well as the deposits that exist in the Eastern Mediterranean and more broadly in the Mediterranean and North Africa region.  We expect the Union to support energy investment in the Eastern Mediterranean, to promote the creation of a Mediterranean gas hub, with pipelines and the development of LNG production.

Doubling the Nord Stream pipeline capacity between Russia and Germany is a very bad idea. We could even call it a provocation which threatens the unity of the European energy union and the EU’s neighbourhood policy. Russia’s and Gazprom’s strategy is clear: cutting off Ukraine from the energy transport network, with all the geopolitical and economic consequences that implies; hurting the Central and Eastern European countries and their citizens’ economies by making gas deliveries more difficult and more expensive; and creating a more dominant position, thus undermining competition.  This is against the interest of the European energy union, against European solidarity and against our geopolitical interest in Ukraine. I am sure that the majority of this House and the majority of governments wholeheartedly endorse these arguments. But there are important lobbies behind this. Representatives of the French Gaz de France Suez, now called NG, the German BASF Wintershall and the Dutch-British Shell are already hanging around our corridors to lobby us to be soft on it, arguing that it is merely a commercial project. They have very powerful allies: François Hollande and Angela Merkel, who are sitting here this afternoon, and David Cameron. So my question to these three leaders is: where is your coherence on Ukraine policy? Where is your solidarity with our neighbours in Central and Eastern Europe? Do not tell us this is a commercial project. It is a political project. It is a highly explosive, highly divisive, political project. Therefore, not only do I want the Commission to take a strong position – and I believe we have the right man sitting here – I also want Council President Tusk to stop hiding away. I am deeply sorry, but if this project does not make it on to the agenda of a forthcoming European Council then we should forget about the European energy union.

The Eu ropean Union is lagging significantly behind in the energy transition, so it still needs Russian gas, unfortunately. We have pointed this out several times in this institution without being heard. We suffer geopolitical choices that have even stimulated the alteration of very delicate balances, no one would have thought of doubling the Nord Stream if Ukraine had really been helped and if stabilisation had been initiated instead of fomenting colorful revolutions and a new Cold War on our borders.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when you want to kill your dog, you accuse it of having rabies, but in this case you are the one who has not stopped barking and biting your hand. Of course, I want to talk about Russia on which we are dependent.  Far be it from me to rejoice, but the observation is there and unanimous. Let me remind you of the final judgment of Jérôme Ferrier, President of the French Gas Association and the International Gas Union. In an interview with Le Figaro, which I have already quoted in this Chamber, published the day after Russia abandoned the South Stream project, Mr Ferrier said, and I quote: \"Europe cannot get rid of Russian gas.\" Like it or not, it is a fact. This is undeniable evidence confirmed in particular by Fatih Birol, the new Executive Director of the International Energy Agency.  But in this whole matter, it must be recognized that it is the Ukrainians, or at least their current leaders, who have been the most enraged. Encouraged by you, the Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly accused Russia of all evils. But, in addition to failing to ensure the safety of the pipeline that runs through their country, with large gas capacities diverted, it must be remembered that, if Gazprom has often closed or threatened to close the floodgates, it is because the Ukrainian Naftogaz is constantly late for payment and does not pay its arrears. After numerous bilateral and trilateral negotiations between the European Union, Ukraine and Russia, the Commission announced in a statement on 25 September that it would pay Ukraine $500 million to source Russian gas this winter. Yes, $500 million! Because the Commission still prefers the dollar to the euro. Definitely, what a waste.  So much the better if Ukrainian households will be able to heat up this winter but, unfortunately for them, Ukrainians do not yet know your horse remedies. They do not realize all the rewards that will result from their rapprochement with the European Union, as it has been done, that is to say in a rag of hatred against Russia, their historical big brother and, indeed, their natural partner. All this could have been avoided for many countries in South-Eastern Europe that could have benefited from the tremendous economic benefits of the South Stream project, namely Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary but also Italy and Greece.  To make up for this aborted project, the German groups BASF and E.ON, the French ENGIE, the Austrian OMV and the Anglo-Dutch Shell finally signed on 4 September a shareholder pact for the construction of Nord Stream 2. Gazprom will own 51% of the project, with E.ON, Shell, OMV and BASF each taking 10%. The French ENGIE will be associated with 9% of the project. This announcement was made at the Vladivostok Economic Forum and we welcome this project which will double current capacity. So let the Commission not yet come and ruin everything and not seek to defeat this project after forcing Russia to give up the ambitious South Stream. These are long-term contracts, guaranteeing stability. This is what we need more than ever if we are to regain a sustainable climate of peace in Europe, rather than this new cold war that you have initiated.

What situation are now being put to the most vulnerable Member States from Russia, which, with their own funds, like Lithuania, have built a liquefied gas terminal in addition to the European Union's financial assistance, with the aim of having at least one energy alternative and reducing the price paid for energy resources? If private companies can make decisions that may even harm the interests of individual Member States, our partners, such as Ukraine, and, consequently, the European Union as a whole, then the question arises as to what all our efforts to strengthen our energy independence, to distance ourselves more from Russia, to invest billions in missing infrastructure, etc. It is scandalous that, so far, we have not been able to ensure that the Commission is compulsorily informed of all energy agreements and to assess their impact.

Let me repeat that, in the context of energy security, diversification is the key, and this is the policy that the Commission is developing.  We are supporting all diversification projects. We will launch an energy, gas and storage strategy early next year. It will be of the utmost importance in view of the future evolution of liquid natural gas. We are supporting the developments in the Southern Corridor, because it is fundamental that the Trans-Anatolian and the Trans-Adriatic pipelines are put into production. Initially the capacity will be only 10 billion cubic metres (Bcms), but in the future we will have lines not only to Azerbaijan but also to Turkmenistan, and, when the conditions are right, we will begin importing Iranian gas. There are new developments in the Mediterranean: we are speaking about substantial amounts of gas: almost 3 000 Bcms in proven, discovered gas. Other possibilities are additional. We also want to connect the Iberian Peninsula with Central Europe; this will permit the flow of Algerian gas. So there are many diversification projects at the moment. Our strategy is diversification of sources and routes. Nord Stream II does not follow this core policy objective. On the contrary, if constructed, it would not only increase Europe’s dependence on one supplier, it would also increase Europe’s dependence on one route. More precisely, the project would dry out the transit through Ukraine, concentrate 80% of Russian gas imports on one route and would lead to a dominant position of Gazprom on the German market by increasing its share from 40% to over 60%.  Therefore the alignment of this project with our European energy strategy on security of supply raises serious doubts. In this spirit, it is crucial to preserve safe transit through Ukraine, which today represents about half of the Russian gas coming to the European Union. As I said before, there is overcapacity for transport of gas from Russia. For these reasons the Nord Stream II project cannot ever become a project of common interest. It cannot ever benefit from European Union financing or European Union support. I reassure you that we will continue our rigorous assessment of the Nord Stream II project, in particular to ensure full compliance with internal energy market legislation.

I therefore believe that there are areas of energy policy where the EU's responsibility is decisive. Winter is approaching again, the \"gas crisis period\" is coming.

From a geopolitical point of view, this pipeline expansion opened up a good opportunity to re-engage in in-depth talks with Russia, normalize relations and revive the European-Russian partnership, in which Russia has always been a reliable supplier of gas on energy issues and Europe has always been a reliable customer.

This project, apart from Ukraine as a route for gas transmission from the east, will negatively affect the already difficult economic situation of the country. It will also significantly weaken its negotiating position and indirectly weaken transit countries such as Slovakia. Moreover, this investment interferes with the energy union idea supported by all Heads of State at the March 2015 European Council on the basis of solidarity and reducing the EU's excessive dependence on energy supplies from the east.

Russia continues to deepen tensions in relations with the West. Although the European Commission successfully suspended the Southstream project, we hoped that Russia's energy tentacles would not be able to lock up the whole of Europe, moscow agreed with Turkey on the implementation of the Bluestream project. However, we are now seeing that partners can also seriously clash with the gas pipe because of the difference in treatment for the solution to the Middle East crisis. In this context, the project of the second branch of Nordstream is therefore painted in new colours. I would like to draw attention to two points. Firstly, the implementation of the project would enable Russia to achieve its long-standing strategic objective of bypassing Ukraine, which is a transit state, by supplying gas to Europe. This would not only lose EUR 2 billion in Ukraine. the us dollars of annual revenue, but also the possibility of resisting Russia's \"gas policy\". Secondly, it is strategically convenient for Russia to have only its own corridors for transporting gas to Western Europe, without paying anyone for transport costs.

The unilateral termination of the South Stream project and the serious difficulties encountered in the negotiation of Turkish Stream, not least because of the different positions of Russia and Turkey with regard to Syria, the missing gas links between the countries in this region and the weak progress in the realization of the Southern Gas Corridor make the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine the only alternative currently available.

We wanted this debate tonight because we want to see a real commitment from the Commission and the Member States to a step change on gender equality and women’s empowerment in development. We want to see agenda action taken seriously, not just paid lip service to by our institutions. We know we need a step change because the Commission’s own evaluation of the last programme says, and I quote, ‘the results were very patchy and poorly documented’, and ‘the results are the accomplishments of committed individuals, rather than an organisational response’. So we do need to see change, but I am afraid I have got to start tonight’s comments on a negative note. Our draft resolution called on the Commission to produce a new gender action plan (GAP) as a communication to give a strong political signal about that need for that step change; a message that gender matters and women’s empowerment should be higher on the agenda of development policy.  We also made that call about the need for communication because we heard rumours, which unfortunately turned out to be true, that the Commission wanted to publish the new GAP as a staff working document, not as a communication, as had previously been intended. Indeed, the day after our committee vote the Commission published a staff working document on gender.  Now I have spoken to people in the Commission and I have heard their arguments. They do not want to be seen to be churning out communications one after another, and some think that talking about the status of the document amount to quibbling. But when you turn to the evaluation of the last programme, I think you will see why we need to make sure the document is taken seriously: the evaluation says that incentives to motivate staff in the Commission and the External Action Service, both in Brussels and in the delegations, and to take gender and women’s empowerment seriously, were missing. There was a failure to do that.  If we had had a communication, it would have been adopted by the entire College of Commissioners: it would have sent a strong message to ambassadors in our delegations that this is a policy of the European Commission, not a staff working document. So downgrading the gender action plan, Commissioner, was not the wisest way in which to start a discussion within the Commission on streamlining your work. I suppose we are where we are tonight – and Commissioner Timmermans has assured us that he is a feminist and is fully committed to the new framework. I know that Commissioner Mimica, Commissioner Stylianides and the Presidency of the Council, indeed the Council as a whole, are very committed on this. So on the details of our resolution, what we want now are concrete policies, coupled with financial resources. We want gender equality to be a core business of the delegations, with more emphasis on reporting, monitoring and evaluation. We want it to be part of the human rights dialogue with third countries and we want action on programing on education, on violence against women and girls, on ending discriminatory practices, on equal pay and decent work. We want action on maternal health, access to health care and – I would personally add – a clear affirmation of sexual and reproductive health and rights. So Commissioner, what I want to hear from you is about how the plans for funding are going to be put in place and how we are going to do the concrete follow-up on this action plan, or framework as you are now calling it. Finally, we have got to see this discussion in the context of the wider work on the Sustainable Development Goals signed up to two weeks ago in New York. Goal 5 is about how to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls, and there are nine targets. We need to translate those targets into actions here, and we need to add indicators in order to do that.  People are saying we need a data revolution and we need dis-aggregated data. If we do not count women and girls, if we do not know what is happening to them, we will not be able to change their lives. The real test of whether our policies work will be whether women and girls in developing countries feel the change. In New York we all pledged ourselves to leaving nobody behind, and now we have got an opportunity to put that into practice.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam, I am making a confession to you, I too am a feminist because I have had the opportunity to deal with development cooperation in a previous life. I have earned the absolute conviction that development is through women, through the education of women and through the integration of women into economic life. I truly believe that the future of development is women. Equality, moreover, between men and women is at the heart of European values. It is an integral part of the legal and political framework of the European Union. The Union and its Member States are among the main actors in the protection and implementation of women's rights, which they also defend in their external relations. 2015 is an important year as it marks both the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda, the fifteenth anniversary of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security, and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Agenda.  It is in this context that the Union and its Member States are continuing and intensifying their efforts on an issue which, for them, is a priority. During the second half of the year, the Luxembourg Presidency continues the work carried out in recent years in the Council on gender and development. It builds in particular on the conclusions adopted by the Council last May on gender equality in development. The Presidency will ensure that gender issues remain at the heart of the priorities of the Union and its Member States, both within the Union and in its foreign policy. In the Council bodies, we are currently working with the Member States, the Commission and the European External Action Service on the implementation of the new action plan for gender equality and women's empowerment.  Globally, significant progress has been made in gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls. Access to primary education for girls has improved significantly in recent years. Women's economic empowerment is on the rise. An increasing number of women now have access to modern health care and contraceptive methods, and maternal mortality has declined dramatically. However, it must be noted that progress is not as rapid as we want and that it is happening very unevenly across regions, in different countries, and sometimes within the same country. Every day, women's and girls' rights continue to be violated around the world: barriers to access to education, discrimination in employment, lower wages for equal work, discriminatory or vexatious laws, domestic violence, trafficking and sexual exploitation, genital mutilation. These are all examples that remind us of the importance of the European Union not slackening its efforts, if not to intensify them resolutely.  In this regard, we want the new action plan recently presented by the Commission to be an effective tool for promoting the rights of women and girls. It must make it possible to significantly improve the situation of women and girls, who are still victims of discrimination. We welcome the fact that the reports on the implementation of the new action plan are mandatory and planned as a joint exercise between the various actors of the European Union.  Another innovative approach is the Institutional Cultural Shift provided by the document which calls on European Union delegations, both at headquarters and on the ground, to integrate gender automatically and cross-cuttingly in all sectors.  In the coming days and weeks, we will continue to work actively within the Council on this issue. A \"gender and development\" item will also be on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council meeting, which will be attended by development ministers on 26 October. The Council will adopt conclusions and the new action plan for gender equality. Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union and the Member States must remain at the forefront of the fight for equality between men and women. Rest assured that the Presidency will make every effort in this direction.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1330, "date": "2015-10-07.json", "name": "Christos Stylianides", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I am here on behalf of my colleague Neven Mimica. I hope to meet Ms McAvan’s concerns by addressing her questions with the Commission’s position. Addressing the delay in the achievement of gender equality worldwide, the European Union wants to provide concrete, high-impact actions and measures, supported by more targeted funding, gender expertise and strong political leadership in all its external policies, including in international cooperation and development. We confirmed this intention in the recent global process of adoption of the new Sustainable Development Goals. This is exactly what the Commission’s services and the European External Action Service had in mind when putting forward the new framework for action on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment through EU external relations from 2016 to 2020.  Looking at its scope and substance, it is a more ambitious, robust and results-oriented successor to the current EU Gender Action Plan in Development, which will soon expire. Its ambition is clearly seen in its thematic and geographical coverage: it will apply in all EU external policies, including trade and, where relevant, humanitarian assistance. It will apply in all our partner countries, including in fragile and emergency situations. It will focus on transformative areas for girls and women, so as to eliminate all forms of violence or discrimination, to give them equal access to natural and economic resources and to empower them socially and politically.  Let me stress this: the level of ambition and commitment of this new framework have not been affected by its format as a joint staff working document. It is a positive step change that will ensure that the Commission’s services and the European External Action Service work together effectively, coherently and strategically, making sure that the fulfilment of girls’ and women’s rights are a tangible reality.  We expect the Member States to endorse our new approach soon through relevant Council conclusions, by making a widely applicable and coordinated effort at EU level. I would like to invite the European Parliament to join this collective endeavour, so we can maximise our impact and results on the ground.  I am convinced that the change has to start from home: shifting the institutional culture – including through dedicated leadership in all European Union institutions and Member States – is key to ensuring a more effective delivery of gender-sensitive outcomes.  Rest assured that adequate financial and human resources and gender expertise to implement the new framework will be provided. For instance, specific support will be provided to our staff in EU delegations and headquarters, through helpdesks and targeted training.  The Commission’s commitment is also quantifiable: the Development Cooperation Instrument has already earmarked around EUR 100 million for measures targeting gender equality. Much more is going to be spent by programmes tackling other sectors and priorities – like agriculture, energy, justice and migration – that consistently take women’s and girls’ perspectives into account. A strong monitoring and reporting structure is also being put into place to make all actors, at all levels, accountable for the results of implementation. In conclusion, let me reiterate our full commitment to the effective implementation of this new gender framework and to making the necessary changes happen.

Now just some figures on why this issue matters and why it really deserves communication from the European Commission. Every year, 14 million girls are forced into marriage, 62 million do not attend school, many states still have discriminatory laws and practices denying women their rights, access to resources and jobs, participation in political and economic life.  In some countries, girls are selectively abacted simply because they are girls. Such harmful practices prevent development not only for women, but also for their nations and countries, as investing in women carries multiple returns invested. On average, women reinvest 90% of their income in family and community compared to 30-40%, invested by men. When only 10% more girls attend school, GDP grows by an average of 3% in developing countries. So we must point out here that when it comes to sustainable development, it pays to strengthen the position of women. That is why, in the resolution on the new global development framework adopted last year, we made it very clear that women not only need to achieve equality, but must play a central role in the new development plan.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1332, "date": "2015-10-07.json", "name": "Doru-Claudian Frunzulică", "mepid": "124790", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, considering the importance of empowering women, not only as a self-standing human rights issue, but also as a precondition for achieving the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals, I believe that the 2017 mid-term review of the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) presents a good opportunity to assess the impact of DCI-financed programmes on women and girls and make reallocations if necessary. Two of the Millennium Development Goals explicitly address women’s rights – namely promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women, and the improvement of maternal health – and they remain, unfortunately, largely unachieved. Moreover, progress towards gender equality and women’s empowerment has been slow and uneven in many countries. The conclusions of the evaluation of the 2010-2015 Gender Action Plan show the clear need for a change in EU action on gender equality and women’s empowerment, and that we need a renewed political commitment by the European External Action Service and the Commission to improve performance in this area. I therefore strongly support the call to put in place measures that will strengthen the leadership and participation of women and women’s rights organisations in both the public and private spheres. Combating violence against women, tackling pay gaps and ensuring that women can reach equal positions in the working world should be our priorities for the immediate future. We must make a greater effort towards preventing discrimination against women on the grounds of marriage or maternity, and ensuring their effective right to work, to be educated and to be free from any kind of oppression. The renewed gender action plan should focus on all aspects of EU external policy – development cooperation, humanitarian aid, trade, human rights and foreign affairs, migration and asylum – in line with the Policy Coherence for Development principle, and should apply to developing, neighbourhood and enlargement countries alike. It is fundamental that we cooperate with third-country governments and with all stakeholders indicated in regions where rape is used as a weapon of war and oppression to bring this practice to an end, to bring the perpetrators to justice and work with survivors, affected women and communities to help them heal and recover.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Gender Equality and Empowering All Women and Girls: That Is Goal Five. Women account for at least half, almost always a little more, of our world: most, therefore. They are more vulnerable to poverty, food insecurity, climate change or lack of medical services. Gender equality is not only a fundamental right, but the basis for achieving the world we want: an egalitarian, prosperous and sustainable world. This is the objective to which the 193 signatory countries have subscribed, with a comprehensive and operational approach in the long term. See if it is important that we correctly update this Action Plan: it is called nothing less than to become the framework and support at European level to achieve the objectives we set ourselves just two weeks ago. The full elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls is undoubtedly one of the key aspects. Even today, one in three women in the world (and, yes, European women too) will experience sexual, physical or psychological violence at some point in their lives just because they are women. In addition to the hundred million who have already been earmarked to improve the rights of women and girls, I encourage the Commission to sign and ratify the Istanbul Convention. But, for me, the backbone is education. Achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls is inescapably about education. This has a radical significance, because it means, de facto, putting women and, above all, girls where they need to be: at the heart of global sustainable development. To this end, I consider it essential to create and adequately provide a Global Fund for Education, which is available to a large global education agenda and objective number four: to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education, and to promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here is again a catch-all legislative report. Parliament, with this motion for a resolution, is once again ruining the essential fight for women for the benefit of special and ideological interests.  In this report, you mainly denounce violence against women, while pointing out the shortcomings of the 2010-2015 action plan, particularly in priority areas such as ensuring the physical and psychological integrity of women and girls in developing countries. Only, you forget the essentials. Our peoples would be happy if you named the countries and regions of the world that are the main scene of all kinds of violence against women. Who do you want the Commission to send this message to? You may lack courage, but most of this violence originates in cultures dominated by Islamic fundamentalism that is spreading across every continent, and even here in Europe. I will quote the imam of the Brest mosque at the Salon of the Muslim woman of Pontoise, therefore in France, reported in various newspapers: \"If the woman goes out without honor - that is, without the Islamic veil - she is not surprised that men abuse this woman\". It is difficult to get any clearer. Our utopian desire for gender equality is light years away from what women are experiencing in these countries where forced marriage and sterilization, domestic violence, the sale of women in slave markets, and so on, have become their terrible daily life. We cannot talk about these horrors without mentioning these terrorist organizations, such as the Islamic State or Boko Haram, so powerful that they threaten the existence of many legitimate states, terrorist organizations whose power is largely the responsibility of the foreign policies of the European Union, the United States and the Gulf monarchies themselves, so actively opposed to the values you defend in this report. I myself have just returned from St. Petersburg, where the Eurasian Women's Forum was taking place. Seven hundred women from eighty nations, national MPs, representatives of executives, NGOs, businesses and universities, came to testify about the daily lives of women in their countries, both professionally and politically, as well as at the personal or physical level. Women in countries where Islamist terrorists reign in terror have witnessed atrocities that strike them, such as rape or physical torture, including the removal of their genitals, so that they can never give life again. What these women want is to come and help them in their country or to help their government fight these terrorists. As I said in the preamble, this is a legislative catch-all.

So it is essential that we keep this is a central point of our strategies in developing countries, particularly this year as we come forward with the Sustainable Development Goals. Women must be free of the threat of violence, and we must plan for that in our strategies. We know of the sexual violence inflicted on women in conflict areas: in Nigeria by Boko Haram; in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; the rape and worse, in Syria, of women in refugee camps fleeing war. The list goes on. But it is a sad biological fact that many pregnancies result from this violence. The Commission has now confirmed to MEPs that international humanitarian law and/or human rights law may justify offering a safe abortion, rather than perpetuating what amounts to inhumane treatment. Women’s health and their ability to access support and protection include their ability to exercise their sexual and reproductive rights. This is essential to female freedom and empowerment. We must ensure that women retain access to sexual and reproductive rights and, if necessary, safe and legal abortions.

Thanks to the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE), we have at our disposal an indicator of gender equality, the data of which, which can also be slow disaggregated, indicate the points where immediate action is urgently needed. I suggest we start there. I also suggest that all Member States, in particular the States of Southern Europe, draw up a gender equality indicator that can also read the situation at regional level, monitor and enable effective action to be taken.

The plan that will be in place between 2015 and 2020 should be ambitious and coherent. It is intended to call for cultural change at the level of institutions. It must welcome the social and political objectives of the European Union, aligning them with what is our role in the world.

Moreover, women's unemployment levels far exceed those of men, which shows even more strongly discrimination in terms of the recruitment criteria for workers. In impoverished Greece, women are the biggest victims of the crisis. Thus, the unemployment rate for women in the first quarter of 2015 is 30.6% compared to 23.5% for men.

Honourable Members, allow me to sincerely thank you for this fruitful debate in these circumstances and at this very difficult time, which shows how close to each other our positions and ambitions are when it comes to improving the lives of women and girls in our partner countries. I hope that your main concerns have been addressed in the new gender framework for action and that we can continue our dialogue on its implementation. I also want to thank you all for your overall dedication on gender issues, especially this year when we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Beijing Platform for Action and the 15th anniversary of the UN Resolution on Women, Peace and Security, and the year in which we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that should leave no one behind, women and girls in particular – if I may add.  The 2030 Agenda is a universal framework with ambitious goals and targets. It also reaffirms the role of gender equality and empowerment of women as keys to, and drivers of, sustainable development. As the European Union strongly conveyed in New York two weeks ago, we want to live in a world where the rights of girls and women are claimed, valued and respected by all, and where everyone is able to fulfil their potential and contribute to a more fair and just society for all. The Commission and the European External Action Service are eager and fully committed to make this pledge a reality, through effective implementation of the new gender framework, and in partnership with all the EU institutions, the Member States, partner countries, civil society organisations, international organisations, entrepreneurs and all other interested stakeholders.

Some 222 million women in developing countries do not have access to safe and modern methods of family planning. Worldwide, 62 million girls do not have a school education. This affects their participation in the labour market. The action plan also neglects the role of men and boys. They are important players in gender equality policy. Particular importance must also be attached to coherence between eu policies and external policies. The EU's trade policy and its instruments also play an important role in this.
