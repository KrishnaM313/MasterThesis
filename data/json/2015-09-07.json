These days, Europe is facing a historic test. Hundreds of thousands of people are seeking protection from war and persecution. In desperation, families and their children cross the Mediterranean in rubber dinghies. People camp in train stations, force their way through barbed wire, and deliver themselves to merciless smugglers. Many lose their lives – men, women, children who suffocate in trucks or drown in the Mediterranean. As more and more people make their way to Europe and more and more people lose their lives, we must realise that we are not tackling the challenges with walls, with isolation or deterrence. I would like to remind you of something: a few days ago, the so-called Islamic State irretrievably destroyed cultural assets in Palmyra. However, we have almost forgotten that the director of this museum in Palmyra was publicly beheaded by this terrorist gang a few weeks ago. The people who come to us are fleeing these criminals, and they are not deterred by seas and walls in their desperation. We will not respond to this global challenge with national measures or national selfishness. We need a common asylum and refugee policy in response to this global challenge. President Juncker will present a series of measures, including a proposal for a permanent emergency mechanism, for the distribution of refugees here in plenary in Strasbourg on Wednesday. And then, ladies and gentlemen, the question for all of us – not only here, but in all the institutions of the Union – is the question of which Union we actually want. A Union of all against all or a Union of solidarity. The task we face is great. It is perhaps the greatest challenge we face here as a current generation of politicians. In all the debates – on quotas, Dublin III or Schengen – I ask all of us not to forget that we are talking about people and very bitter fates. The people who come to us come because they believe in us and in our values. But the dramatic events of recent weeks have also unsettled many people in the EU Member States. I would also like to say to people who put a lot of questions to us: not everyone who asks a critical question is against refugees. We must take seriously the concerns and needs of the citizens of our Union, because the problems are visibly great. I would like to thank all the people in our Union, the countless citizens who provide water and food to exhausted refugees everywhere at railway stations, on holiday beaches, in many other places, to give them clothes, to toys for their children, and who come forward to volunteer in refugee shelters. This humanity must be our guiding principle so that the terrible image of little Aylan Kurdi, which I believe has burned into all of us, never repeats itself in Europe.

The persecution of opposition figures, especially opposition journalists, is now going a long way. Yesterday we could all see tanks driving through Kurdish towns.

Without all the good work and support received, we would not have reached an agreement in June under the Latvian Presidency, bringing the EU basic regulation into line with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) ruling. In 2009, within the basic regulation, the EU opted for a ban in trade in seal products, with two main exceptions: products from hunts conducted by Inuit and other indigenous communities (the IC exception) and products from hunts conducted for the sole purpose of the sustainable management of marine resources on a small scale and non-profit basis (the MRM exception). The aim of this Regulation is to ensure that products derived from seals hunted for commercial purposes are no longer found on the EU market. The Seal Regulation and its implementing act were challenged by Canada and Norway in the WTO. The final rulings of the WTO panel and the WTO Appellate Body were adopted on 18 June 2014 by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body on 18 June 2014, disapproving of one of the two exceptions, namely the MRM exception. Canada and the European Union had agreed that the reasonable period of time to implement the recommendations and rulings should be 16 months from the date of adoption. That period expires on 18 October 2015. The European Commission did not adopt its proposal for amending the current Regulation on trade in seal products until 6 February 2015, bringing the current legislation into line with the WTO rulings by renouncing the MRM exception and keeping the reinforced Inuit exception. Although I very much appreciate that not all MEPs and Member States agree with the deletion of the MRM exception, I am very pleased to announce that the final agreement reached is in line with the WTO rulings. As regards the Inuit exception, the consolidated text encompasses a new set of criteria under which seal products resulting from hunts conducted by Inuit and other indigenous communities could be placed on the market – a clear reference to the needs of such communities to provide food and income to support their life and a sustainable livelihood. We amended the Commission’s proposal, taking into consideration in particular the right to self-determination of the Inuit and other indigenous communities. The proposal was amended so as to reiterate that seal hunting is an integral part of the culture and identity of the Inuit communities, making a major contribution to their subsistence, providing food and income to support their families and small communities, and preserving and continuing the traditional existence of the community and the cultural heritage of bartering.  In the report I have proposed a new article, namely 5a, referring to the need for citizens to be properly informed about seal products placed on the EU market which originate in Inuit and other indigenous communities, and that those seal products are lawful in origin. Last, but not least, as regards Article 7 on reporting, the agreed text asks the Commission to report by the end of 2019 on the implementation of the new rules, paying particular attention to the impact of those rules on the Inuit community. I look forward to hearing what the Commission, the Council and, of course, my colleagues have to say.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 18, "date": "2015-09-07.json", "name": "Karmenu Vella", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, first and foremost, let me thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Buşoi, and his colleagues for their commitment and thorough and also speedy work on the Commission proposal to amend the basic regulation on trade in seal products.  The amendment had become necessary after the WTO ruling in June last year. While the ruling upheld the EU ban on marketing of seal products, the WTO concluded that the exceptions provided by the EU for Inuit and other indigenous communities and for maritime resource management had some discriminatory effects. We believe that the constructive cooperation between the institutions has led to a very good result. It will enable the EU to comply with its international obligations under the WTO by the very challenging deadline which we were given for implementation and which will expire next month (on 18 October, to be precise). This is a very important step for the credibility of the EU, as one of the main users of the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism, in implementing its WTO obligations.  We are very pleased to have come to the end of this process of amending our seal regime and making it compliant with WTO rules. It is a politically sensitive issue for many involved, and we are satisfied that a balanced compromise has been reached.  Throughout the process, the Commission has engaged with all the relevant stakeholders and also those Member States particularly concerned with the proposal. We believe that this dialogue has been very constructive and that its results are reflected in the outcome of this process. The final result upholds the ban with a meaningful indigenous-communities exception and addresses all the shortcomings identified by the WTO, such as the need for removal of the marine resource management exception. It provides for a balanced approach between fulfilling the EU’s international trade obligations and addressing the legitimate concerns of Inuit communities and Member States affected by the changes. Furthermore, some specific requests by the European Parliament were taken on board in the compromise text, such as the provisions requiring the Commission to regularly evaluate the regulation, as well as to inform the public about the ban and its exception.  The Commission has made it clear that we fully support the outcome as far as the substance is concerned. On some procedural issues, changes made to the Commission’s proposal in the course of the negotiations require us to make two statements relating to horizontal institutional issues, which we have forwarded to the European Parliament services for recording in the minutes. Firstly, on the use of the no-opinion clause for the adoption of implementing acts, and, secondly, on the use of the comitology procedure for issuing technical guidance notes. Commission’s Statements on: 1)  The use of the no-opinion clause for the adoption of implementing acts  ‘The Commission underlines that it is contrary to the letter and to the spirit of Regulation 182/2011 (OJ L 55 of 28.2.2011, p. 13) to invoke Article 5 § 4, subparagraph 2, point b) in a systematic manner. Recourse to this provision must respond to a specific need to depart from the rule of principle which is that the Commission may adopt a draft implementing act when no opinion is delivered. Given that it is an exception to the general rule established by Article 5 § 4 recourse to subparagraph 2, point b), cannot be simply seen as a ‘discretionary power’ of the Legislator, but must be interpreted in a restrictive manner and thus must be justified.’ 2) The use of comitology procedure for issuance of technical guidance notes  ‘The Commission notes that the co-legislators have included in the final compromise text a provision according to which the non-binding guidance notes under Article 3(6) will be adopted by examination procedure. The Commission is of the view that the adoption of non-binding guidelines by the Commission should not be subject to the control mechanism under Regulation 182/2011 since the Commission has its own autonomous right under the Treaty to issue such guidance. Considering the urgent need to meet the WTO requirements and deadlines the Commission does not oppose the solution favoured by the co-legislators in this particular file. This is without prejudice to the negotiations of the inter-institutional agreement on better law-making, as well as the position the Commission will take on similar matters in the future.’", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 19, "date": "2015-09-07.json", "name": "Bendt Bendtsen", "mepid": "96705", "text": "   rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade.

Nevertheless, the text will now be tightened. It's sloppy!  All the figures have shown that the 2009 legislation had a huge damage to the Inuit and that a profession has been smashed as they could not dispose of their skins. Stocks in Greenland have been left with up to 135 000 skins, which are in surplus stocks, which means that indigenous people have been removed from their profession as hunters and turned them into social clients.

This is vitally important for the survival of Inuit communities, particularly in Greenland, where there is no other source of income. We have also upheld the original seal ban and the EU’s commitment to strong animal welfare legislation from the original ban a few years ago. From the ECR point of view that is also very important.

The proposed Maritime Resource Management exception, which was in line with the WTO ruling, was not about reopening the ban on the trade in seal products, but the ban will remain and I, of course, support it. The reality is that, in Nordic and Baltic countries, there are still licenses issued for hunting seals. There are some cultural traditions: in Estonia, for instance, there are 50 licenses granted for this type of hunting and this number is not likely to increase. The fact that they cannot make any use of what they hunt does not contribute to making people aware of it and value it, as they just end up disregarding it. So I stress that this is not about animal welfare, but about the sustainable use of resources. I hope that the Commission will look at current practices and see what is the best way to ensure that, while respecting the ban, we still allow traditions to carry on in the smartest way, since legislation that allows hunting but either leads to a waste of resources or creates a grey economy is not good legislation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 25, "date": "2015-09-07.json", "name": "Anja Hazekamp", "mepid": "125023", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. – It's a historic moment.

Because every year hundreds of thousands of seals are bludgeoned to death in a bloody way. These are often very young animals, less than three months old. Babies who are often skinned in full consciousness. And why? Just to make money off their fur. Seal fur is an unnecessary fashion product for which newborn animals are slaughtered in a horrible way. And there's no excuse for that.  That is precisely why Europe decided in 2009 to restrict imports and trade. And of the two exceptions, unfortunately, one remains: the hunt by the Inuit.

Of course, this regulation was also necessary because of the requirements of the World Trade Organisation.

I am pleased that these attempts have been unsuccessful in some way, and we have already rejected these attempts on the IMCO Committee itself, which has also been supported in the negotiations with the Council.  I believe that the so-called MRM exception was the most problematic in the existing regulation, which is why we have worked to erase it, which we have succeeded in. Above all, it will be important that this regulation also comes to life in practice. The Commission will, of course, play an important role here, which will also have to carry out the evaluation of these rules and, above all, whether or not there are still infringements despite this regulation and if it occurs, of course, to take appropriate action.

Notably, my concerns lie with the lack of impact assessments carried out prior to tomorrow’s vote. In 2009, when the exemption for Inuit communities was first established, a key priority of Parliament was to ensure that negative impacts would not occur for the Inuit communities, who for hundreds of years have relied on seal hunting as a means of providing food, warmth and economic prosperity. However, like many things that come from this Parliament, this was not the end result. Recent figures from Greenland have shown that the ban has had an overwhelmingly negative effect on those communities.  To ensure that continued or additional negative impacts from future changes do not take place, we must ensure that the livelihoods of the Inuit are held in the same high regard as the welfare of the seals. With this in mind, it is therefore imperative that the welfare of the group is not sacrificed one for the other.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 30, "date": "2015-09-07.json", "name": "Franz Obermayr", "mepid": "96981", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to take a iendled with the ENF Group. Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her Sustainability and responsible use of natural resources are our guiding values, but as far as the previous ban on trade in seal products was concerned, we did not follow these guide values. As an example, I would like to mention the situation in Greenland: twelve million seals populate the waters of the island, and the indigenous peoplethere hunt around 150 000 animals a year.  Biologists estimate that the annual hunt would be sustainable even for 500,000 animals. However, it is not the increase in catches that is important, but the sensible use of the products from this hunt. For indigenous peoples of this region, only seals remain as vitamin C and protein suppliers. Seals have been hunted by the local population since time it was, and there is no substitute for their nutritional value! And without the European Union's markets, thousands of skins from this hunt have been burned or otherwise disposed of, and this, ladies and gentlemen, has nothing to do with the responsible use of natural resources.  However, we must take care that a purely commercial hunt for these animals does not take place again. And we should also take a closer look at the Baltic Sea, which also limits exceptions.

I would like to state in general that if a legal prohibition has an exception, it often causes problems in practice, often such a ban is circumvented or interpreted in various ways.

It must be said that the Inuit are not given scope for commercial trade in these goods. It is clearly written that it is supposed to be hunting, which is rather for non-commercial purposes. That the hunt should be carried out humanely, etc. It will therefore be for the Commission to monitor this so that the exception to the legal prohibition is respected and that the interest of animals, on the one hand, and the interest of the traditional Inuit community, on the other, is really balanced.  So I ask the Commission not to end the whole thing with the adoption of this legislation, but to monitor whether what has been provided for as an exception is being closely respected.

One could have banned the trade in unethically hunted seals. Or it could have been decided that the ban should not apply to seals that have been hunted for purposes other than commercial purposes.

The county administrative boards in Sweden, which are responsible for making decisions and ensuring that we hunt down the seal that needs to be hunted, already have difficulty in finding serious hunters.

The 2008 EU regulation banning trade in seal products had a dramatic effect on Greenland. The so-called \"Inuit exception\" could not only protect the market for Greenland seal products. The economy in this area has suffered heavy losses and, more importantly, the EU's reputation has suffered a serious blow among the area's residents. The appreciation by the Greenlanders of their close cooperation with the EU, which concerns many areas, is overshadowed by the regulation.  It is close to impossible to understand Greenlandic culture and identity without the traditional and sustainable seal hunting. It damages our chances of succeeding in the EU's Arctic policy of banning trade in seal products. This is happening at a time when the region is becoming increasingly important on the international political agenda. The 2014 WTO decision states that the two opt-outs included in the EU Regulation do not comply with the WTO's regulatory framework.

You see colleagues, if the vision of images like Aylan's had effects that go beyond outrage, anger, pain, perhaps today we would see in that body a sacrificial victim, a martyr, at least worth protecting and saving so many other innocents. But history teaches us that this has never been the case, and so, alas, it will not be this time either, because after the emotional wave has passed, Europe will once again deal with these rights with the indolence and short-sightedness that has characterised it so far. Immigration is just one example. Every day we witness stories of denied rights, and we must not go beyond European borders to trace them: – children born sick with cancer due to the presence of toxic waste and illegal landfills, – 122 million poor people, many of them without citizenship income and therefore without means to survive, – austerity measures that impose cuts in health and welfare , leading to the suspension of the supply of medicines in public pharmacies or, indeed, to the closure of hospitals. We are talking about predictable stories, avoidable stories, if only that anger and indignation that one feels in the face of these examples translates into a reaction, a driving force to change this Europe, so as to prevent further and further violations of fundamental rights. Another Europe is possible inso far as an alternative is wanted. And you don't have to indulge in the imagination to look for ideal examples.  There is, in fact, another true face of a Europe made up of solidarity, fraternal acceptance, commitment to protect the best interests of the child, social inclusion of minorities, the daily struggle to guarantee formal and substantial equality, the protection of working mothers, respect for others' thoughts and tolerance for all beliefs. A Europe that denounces injustices and refuses to hide in the hypocrisy of a protection of human rights recognised only on the Charter or in the Treaties.  It is to this Europe that we must look again, these are the examples that must drive the work of those who, like us today, are debating the degree of protection accorded to fundamental rights in Europe, if it is to be improved. We ourselves are the controllers and guarantors of those rights and values which under undersea this Community and which legitimise the existence of the European Union itself. Every day we see blatant violations of fundamental rights throughout Europe, yet nothing is done to stop or prevent them. So, let us be hypocritical, omertous and finally complicit.

Allow me to start by addressing some of the substantive questions raised in your report, before turning to more institutional aspects pertaining to the mechanisms at our disposal for the protection of fundamental rights. Equality is a central issue in your report, and indeed this principle is at the heart of the European project. Yet discrimination all too often continues to occur in every single Member State. Take the recent case concerning a town district inhabited primarily by Roma citizens, in which the electricity meters were placed on poles six metres high, whereas in all other parts of town they were placed at a height where they could easily be monitored. I am glad that the European Court of Justice clarified that such practices are not acceptable under EU law. Much remains to be done to secure equal treatment everywhere, regardless of religion or belief, race or ethnic origin, gender, age, disability or sexual orientation – and EU law has a crucial role to play in this respect. I therefore welcome the call in your report for the rapid adoption of the Equal Treatment Directive, which remains a priority for this Commission. It is highly regrettable that it has not yet been agreed. Another issue that worries me is the rise of intolerance and hatred in our societies: you can see it on a day-to-day basis now, certainly linked with the refugee crisis. We are going through a period of crisis right now which is not just social and economic. It is political and moral. In times such as these, we see again the old tendencies of trying to identify scapegoats – of always looking for somebody else to blame – and minorities are always at the receiving end of the blame. Therefore, combating prejudice, racism and xenophobia has to be a focus of action. This is also the reason why the Commission will devote its first annual fundamental rights colloquium at the start of October to issues related to hate crime and discrimination, and in particular the fight against anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, which are distinct but related phenomena. Another important set of challenges raised in your report concerns the protection of personal data, the right to privacy, and the maintenance of security. In this respect, let me first of all stress that getting the data protection reform agreed by the end of the year remains a top priority for the Commission. Both the Data Protection Regulation and the proposed directive for criminal-law enforcement authorities are crucial pieces of legislation to ensure that citizens across the EU continue to benefit from solid, up-to-date rules safeguarding their right to the protection of personal data. I am confident that we will succeed in adopting a meaningful and strong reform package by the end of this year, and I count on your continued support in this respect. We will also continue to insist on the full observance of data protection standards in our relations with third countries, including the United States of America. I am pleased to note that we are on the point of finalising negotiations for an umbrella agreement with the United States, setting out ambitious and comprehensive standards for the protection of personal data when such data are exchanged between law enforcement authorities in the United States and in the European Union. Let me also stress that there should be no doubt that personal-data processing – for any purpose, including the enforcement of criminal law – must comply with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and in particular be necessary and proportionate. This being said, we also need to take into account the fact that there can be duly justified situations requiring – for legitimate reasons of criminal-law enforcement and in order to ensure public security – that the personal data of persons not immediately suspected of criminal activity also be processed. Let me now turn to the more institutional questions in your report, in particular the question of whether we need new mechanisms for the protection of fundamental rights, including a new strategy for fundamental rights. At this stage, today, I am not convinced that we do. Mainstreaming the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be a reflex for all EU institutions throughout the policy cycle. We have the existing 2010 Strategy on the application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and, before considering new mechanisms, we should continue to implement it. This means a systematic screening of all relevant legislative and policy measures to ensure their compatibility with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The adoption of the Better Regulation package is a further step in this direction: it provides for fundamental rights to be taken into account systematically in the assessment of all significant policy initiatives. Of course, this also is a shared responsibility of all the EU institutions. Therefore, as outlined in the Commission’s proposal for an interinstitutional agreement on better law-making, a similar assessment should also occur when significant amendments are made to Commission proposals during the legislative process. The Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, is also committed to ensuring that the Member States respect the Charter – including, if need be, by means of infringement proceedings. In 2014, the Commission launched 11 infringement procedures against Member States specifically to ensure that Charter rights are respected. The main areas of concern are asylum and immigration, in conjunction with the lack of free legal assistance, the right to an effective remedy, detention conditions and the situation of children. Your report also calls for a strengthening of the framework for the protection of the rule of law in the European Union. I fully agree that ensuring full respect for the rule of law is crucial to the protection of fundamental rights throughout the Union. Without the protection afforded by independent courts, and without effective judicial redress mechanisms, fundamental rights will remain on paper only. That is why the Commission, two years ago, adopted a Rule of Law Framework setting out a structured process according to which the Commission will react when there are specific indications that there is a systemic threat to the rule of law. I can assure you that we remain vigilant as regards any threats to the rule of law, wherever they may occur, and that we will not hesitate to activate the Framework when necessary. I can also assure you that the Commission’s approach will remain objective and impartial, and based on the law and the facts on the ground and not on political speeches. Let me also stress that the Commission remains fully committed to EU accession to the European Convention on Human Rights. Accession to the Convention will serve to strengthen our fundamental values. It will improve the effectiveness of EU law and the coherence of fundamental rights protection across Europe. I strongly believe that the European Union should accede to the Convention, and I am confident that we will find solutions to the legal issues raised by the European Court of Justice in its opinion of December last year. Let me conclude as you did, Ms Ferrara, in your opening statement, with a few words about migration. I fully agree that our reaction to this crisis must also be about protecting fundamental rights: the fundamental right to asylum for those in need of refuge; their right to be protected from risking their lives in the hands of ruthless traffickers; and also their right to be treated with dignity wherever they are and under whatever conditions they have to live. This is why we have put respect for, and the promotion of, the EU values of human dignity, the rule of law, human rights, solidarity and equality at the centre of the EU Agenda on Migration. Our reaction to the current crisis must be about saving lives. It must also be about processing asylum applications faster and effectively, in full accordance with fundamental rights. We must never forget that asylum is a right to be protected. At the same time, our priority has to be the correct and full application of EU asylum and migration law, in accordance with the twin principles of responsibility and solidarity. This must include an effective return policy, fully respecting the fundamental rights of the migrants concerned. Only if we ensure correct application of the system will we be able to offer protection and humane reception to all those who deserve it, and we will reduce incentives for those who have no right to stay to undertake the perilous journey. Here, you see our societies often greatly divided on the issue: humanity and the humane treatment of migrants in conflict with a feeling of being overrun or flooded. We need to get out of that contradiction. There is no need to fear being flooded, and certainly not if we can apply asylum policy as it was intended. And there is certainly no need to take leave of our fundamental values. That means that people who flee from war and persecution have a place in our society. Let me conclude by stressing that it is a joint responsibility of the European Parliament, the Commission and other institutions to ensure respect for, and the promotion of, our common values. Democracy, fundamental rights and the rule of law must be, and continue to be, a reality for every single citizen and anybody else who is in Europe. All institutions and bodies, including the Commission and the European Parliament, need to work closely together to make it happen.

Since the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, we have highlighted three ideas that I would like to highlight. Firstly, the importance of the European Union being able to monitor itself. Many times we want to be a reference, we want to be exemplary, we look at everyone to see how it behaves in relation to human rights. There is a growing need - Mrs Ferrara stressed this - for us to look at ourselves, because today in Europe, in many countries, in many Member States, human rights are not being respected. Secondly, this issue is particularly important in the area of the protection of economic and social rights. The crisis has shown that there has been a progressive devaluation in the protection of economic and social rights, and this deserves to be highlighted.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank my colleague Laura Ferrara for the splendid and truly commendable work she has done in the LIBE Committee on this report. In the area of respect for fundamental human rights, however, the protection of women's rights certainly plays a major role.  In the FEMM Committee, I was the rapporteur for the draft opinion on the report that we are going to vote on tomorrow, and in our report we have focused in particular on the many violations and forms of discrimination that, unfortunately, women still suffer today in Europe and throughout the world. I am referring to all the physical and sexual and psychological violence to which women are subjected, to child abuse, to harassment, to persecutory acts that often also occur through the distorted and incorrect use of new technologies and the Internet.  There is an urgent need for greater commitment on the part of the States of the European Union, we cannot continue to witness helpfully the continuous feminicides, honour killings, cases of homophobia, and all other forms of discrimination, both in the daily private experience and in the work, political and decision-making contexts.

It has served as an excuse to attack public services, cut freedoms, such as expression, or limit free movement between Member States, as well as solidarity with third-country nationals of our Member States, denying them, for example, access to health care.  We have seen 'hot returns' on migrants and how the recognition of minority rights in the Member States of the European Union has been delayed. Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is recognised in the world, and it must continue to be, as it is the largest guarantee of citizenship, wherever it comes from.

Mr President, all European citizens and all the people of Europe are undoubtedly entitled to enjoy fundamental rights. I believe that fundamental rights should not be a field of confrontation between the political groups because this may lead to the wrong conclusion, namely that there are multi-speed sensitivities in the European Union. There are, however, elements of controversy, which stem from different perspectives and from different positions and which may be implanted in the reports, so that they appear to serve specific purposes. Mrs May's report on the Ferrara lends itself to fruitful and constructive dialogue but can undoubtedly also be evaluated from different perspectives. The European People's Party has an alternative motion for a resolution but we believe that, despite our divergences, we are pursuing the same objective. We argue that no new mechanisms are needed. Existing ones are adequate and can ensure the supervision of those Member States where fundamental rights violations occur. We also support what the Vice-President, Mr Timmermans, has repeatedly said, that in cases of violations a mechanism of constructive dialogue between the Commission and the Member States must be activated immediately and these issues addressed. We also argue in our report that there is a need to strengthen public security but under conditions of protection of fundamental rights because otherwise, there is a risk that one will be subject to criminal offences at a time when there is a real need to protect and protect against terrorism and other phenomena that may harm the European Union.

This report was adopted in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) where the majority of the committee decided in favour of the report. I hope that the outcome of that vote will also be respected in this Chamber. This report also has other important implications for the fundamental rights of minorities: Roma children, women and LGBTI people and for those seeking asylum. The European Union was founded on the principles of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights. These values stem from the common constitutional traditions of all Member States. Upholding these values is of crucial importance for the proper functioning of the European Union, because they guarantee that Member States fulfil their international law obligations and that they can trust each other and the institutions of the European Union. Upholding these values cannot be a matter of current political needs or inactions. The already—existing tools and mechanisms are insufficient for dealing with breaches of democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights. This has been proved in the last couple of years and must be rectified. That is why in this report we call for a new mechanism that is automatically triggered in cases of breaches of fundamental values and rights, to remedy the breaches, to avoid the materialisation of systematic threats in Member States. Our common European fundamental values are being threatened first and foremost from within, right before our eyes. Democratic parties of Europe have to unite to protect these values. Failing to do so may have severe consequences, including the possibility of the European Union falling apart. Almost 60 years have passed since its foundation.

Last week, on behalf of the EP, I was present in Geneva at the exchange of views between the UN Monitoring Committee and the European Commission on the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Their concluding comments were just published. The committee was more than clear: the rights of people with disabilities are fundamental human rights. That is why we must play a leading role at European level, not only in terms of social policy, but also in the areas of work, infrastructure, mobility, foreign policy, EU funds and so on. After all, the handicap works in all policy areas. All policy-makers must take into account the handicap dimension in their policies and also sweep on their own doorstep. This means that people with disabilities should also be able to have equal access to EU funds and EU projects. For example, there should be a separate budget that covers the additional costs of, for example, sign language and real-time subtitles for deaf people at conferences and workshops and personal assistance for the blind and less mobile.

Mr President, Commissioner, I too, and in a very sincere way, and in a very sincere way, do not give the rapporteur an oratory formula for her work and perseverance, which enabled her to present us with an ambitious and quality report. It once again assesses respect or non-compliance with fundamental rights within member states.  Today, it must be admitted that fundamental rights are applied too often according to different interpretations, sometimes comfortable for the authorities in place.  I obviously agree with everything that has been said in favour of the report, but I would still like to address in particular the dear colleagues of the EPP Group. I am stunned today. The resolution that is being proposed as a replacement for the report is a real slap in the face to what we are defending in this House. How can we support a resolution that completely obscures the situation of our homeless people? Where are the democratic values when we refuse to condemn the CIA's detention and torture programmes on European territory? Why are you removing all the paragraphs on freedom of expression and the media? Don't your humanist values make you want to criminally prosecute the barbaric perpetrators of genital mutilation on little girls?  Everything else in your report is obviously in the same line. You go through everything, including the gender equality and violence against women, LGBTI rights, children's rights, migrant protection, and the protection of people with disabilities. I don't quite understand that way of looking at it.  So, ladies and gentlemen, before blindly pursuing a group line that reflects unease— because some of your eminent members are clearly in violation, in their country, with the spirit and letter of the treaties - it would be good to measure the moral price.

Mr President, first of all, I also want to thank Laura Ferrara for the work she has done and all those who contributed to this report. Many agree at home and abroad that the European Union is experiencing a crisis of values. The issue of refugees, and more broadly that of migrants, is an unfortunate symbol of this. What are so-called universal values if their application is variable in geometry by state and population categories? No, the tools do not exist. Sanctions do not exist for violations in this area. If we need testimony, look at the UN reports, look at the Council of Europe reports: they are all damning about the setbacks of the European Union and its Member States in this area. For a long time, European states have been able to appear models thanks to the struggles that have advanced universal respect for these rights. But for a number of years, the direction of walking has been reversed. There are more and more setbacks. Civil liberties are attacked in the name of security, the widespread registration of whole sections of the population is put in place, hatreds are stoked and scapegoats, including migrants and Arab-Muslims, are thrown to the vindictiveness. Fears are being surred to push through increasingly regressive legislation as social inequalities and poverty take on dramatic proportions.  So, certainly, respect for others, whatever their differences and socio-cultural choices - a term I prefer to that of ethnic, at least ambiguous - religious, philosophical, sexual and political, and living it together are fundamental principles without which nothing is possible.

Let me repeat what they said, that another Europe is possible, especially when it comes to rights for refugees. This continent has to be one that welcomes refugees – especially when they come from war—ridden areas like Syria – and that does not throw them out or hinder them from having their rights respected.  I also appreciate the approach adopted, which focuses on the institutional structure that we need to change but also on certain specific areas of human rights and of fundamental rights – on media pluralism, anti—discrimination, ethnic minorities, sexual minorities, people with disabilities and race. As rapporteur of this Parliament for the Equal Treatment Directive, I very much appreciate what Vice—President Timmermans said and I am optimistic that the Commission and Parliament will make the Council go ahead and have this Equal Treatment Directive finally become law, to make sure that the fundamental rights of all minorities are respected on this continent, and that the fight against racism, xenophobia, homophobia, lesbophobia and transphobia and all the other forms of discrimination will succeed.  With that, I also have to say that the institutional structures need to change. The Copenhagen dilemma is that when countries accede to the European Union they have to fulfil everything, but when they are in well, big nothing! I would say to the EPP that Article 7(2) simply does not work. We need new mechanisms, and this report asks for new mechanisms that are automatically triggered, and for country—by—country reporting. This is not about controlling everyone: it is about safeguarding our common values to make sure that in no country of this European Union are fundamental rights violated.

Our rights were further established under such things as Habeas Corpus, the English common law and the Bill of Rights of 1689, to name just three.

The EU is creating its own system of criminal law, a process which it euphemistically and laughably calls creating an area of freedom, security and justice.

Under a European arrest warrant, for example, any British citizen can now be arrested and imprisoned on the basis of vague accusations, with no prima facie evidence against them, and a British court is powerless to prevent this happening. Under the common recognition of fines and confiscation orders, an EU state may confiscate the assets of a British citizen without a British court having any power to prevent it.

And not those of the European people whose freedom is at stake because of imported terror and the Islamisation of our continent, under the guise of freedom of religion. Not those of writers, politicians, cartoonists and critics whose freedom of expression is increasingly restricted by accusing them of hate speech, Islamophobia and racism.  This abstract morality is particularly evident in the debate on mass immigration. Europe's elite is mainly concerned with putting away critics. The elite is now taking the measure of critical Member States and is blaming the original inhabitants. The danger to democracy therefore comes not from Eurosceptics, but from the European elite who are at the button. The danger to the rule of law does not come from the citizens who demand a say through referendums, but from the political elite who see referendums and participation as ballast. The danger of fundamental rights does not come from the Member States, but from cultural relativists who limit and deprive our free-spirited values, norms, freedoms one by one.  We do not need the European Union to protect fundamental rights. In fact, the greatest danger to all the values that the European Union claims to stand for is the European Union itself.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 72, "date": "2015-09-07.json", "name": "Krisztina Morvai (NI).", "mepid": "96661", "text": "   – I miss two fundamental and generally recognised human rights in this report.

It's a daily struggle to maintain and preserve our rights. Let's take two situations - I was thinking about freedom of speech and freedom of demonstration.

We have journalists harassed, kicked out, banished, staying at home, having nowhere to work, because they didn't want to break their principles, because they didn't want to listen to their bosses, and they stuck with the principles and they have nothing to live on.

They are often seen as a cosmetic accessory, and there is a competition for displacement through many other issues, which repeatedly leads to fundamental rights remaining a secondary matter somewhere. I am very grateful for Mrs Ferrara's report, because I believe that it really is a very important element, that it really points in the right direction. Firstly, because it is very systematic, secondly, because it highlights current references, such as mass surveillance and its impact on individual freedom, because it addresses the refugee situation – this must be done in times like these – and because it also raises the issue of the impact of the economic crisis on human rights. This is very important. It is also important that he also has an implementing aspect, namely that he also asks how this can be enforced. The weakness is that we do not have good instruments for actually enforcing human rights. I think it is very important that the establishment of the Fundamental Rights Agency is mentioned positively, that it is wanted to strengthen it, that we need an observation mechanism that, irrespective of day-to-day political assessments, determines where human rights and fundamental rights are being violated.

Individual human rights include all citizens, including those citizens whose rights are undermined by their own governments, as is happening in some parts of our Union. When these freedoms and rights are threatened in our countries, then the European institutions must be able to intervene. When a country wants to join our Union, it promises loud and clear that it will live up to an independent rule of law and that it will safeguard human rights, but if you are in, then you are almost free to do anything. Unfortunately, the Member States have taken the habit in the Council of holding each other's backs rather than standing up and defending fundamental rights. It is absolutely crucial for our credibility in europe now to have a binding, independent and objective review of each Member State and how to live up to fundamental rights – an ongoing review that applies to everyone.

There is also no debate between the factions about the need for effective implementation of international conventions drawn up within the framework of the Council of Europe and the OSCE, and the fight against discrimination based on language use and the removal of administrative barriers to linguistic diversity are already our common goals. I think that these are very serious advances, and representatives of national minorities have been calling for the European Union to approach their situation in this spirit for years, even decades.

The EU is a community of values, and it must therefore be a matter of course that fundamental rights are fully guaranteed even after a country's accession, but unfortunately this is often not the case.  Why should the EU be able to monitor compliance with European values effectively only before a country's accession, but no longer after that? Of course, Article 7 of the EU Treaty exists, but it is a blunt sword because of the high hurdles to its application. The Commission and the Council have taken the first steps to remedy this situation. That is certainly to be welcomed, but it is not enough! What is needed is a genuine fundamental rights mechanism, with continuous monitoring of the situation of fundamental rights in each country, and country-specific reports that are published regularly.

First, human rights are the deepest basis of the ideals and values on which the European Union is based. It is for the defence of these rights that every day we must work to promote their respect throughout our continent. Second, as the Ferrara Report well identifies, in 2012 and 2013 there were still many, perhaps too many, violations of fundamental rights. This job is never finished. In order for us to do this, we must be able to scrutinise in an exempt manner. This report is only useful if it provides us with a picture of reality that allows us to identify our focuses of action. And third, the fundamental rights in this house must unite and not divide. The Ferrara Report goes too far. It extends into debatable censorship considerations and goes beyond the scope of the Union's competences. And it proposes a mechanism that should certainly not be discussed here. Changing the nature of the European Union and distinguishing between what is European and what is national is a matter for the Treaties. A broader compromise should have been reached in this area. Mr President, there is no doubt that we must continue to work to promote and ensure respect for the fundamental rights of the European Union. But in to achieve this, this Parliament cannot use fundamental rights as a political weapon of combat. On the contrary, we must look at fundamental rights as the core of European construction as a unifying element of all European peoples. That's the only way we're going to make a difference.

Crimes that may have less emotional impact, but which precisely for this reason in a cowardly and sneaky way kill those fundamental rights and that welfare state that we are talking about today, corroding it from within and draining its resources, abandoning the marginalised, refugees and the weakest to their fate.  I am sorry, Commissioner, but unfortunately the efforts and instruments on the ground have not been enough even remotely. Any form of tolerance – involuntary or voluntary – blindness and indifference, is intolerable, indeed it is complicit! With this report, with this vote, I would like our Parliament to send a clear message for once: true European values are those that cannot be deposited in a current account, because they have no price and no political colour.

The first is that of the rule of law which, of course, is the basis upon which we develop our fundamental rights. Socrates, when he was convicted on dubious grounds, was approached by friends who said ‘We will help you flee’, and he said ‘I will not’, because if you accept the premise of the rule of law in a consensual society you do not get to pick and choose which laws are applied to you and which are not. That would be my first point. If you accept the premise of the rule of law you cannot, here in Parliament, debate by saying ‘Well I want this to be applied to me but not to them’, and ‘We have more rights than others’, etcetera. The rule of law applies to every single individual citizen in Europe, regardless of their citizenship, when they live in your country – some people are applauding: I think they misunderstood me, but we will see in a moment – so why would you then accept the premise that you could have the rule of law organised also on a level higher than the national one? The answer is part of our European history. We saw in the 20th century, and especially in the 1930s, that you can use democracy as a pretext to undermine the rule of law by saying ‘We have the majority so we decide what the rule of law is.’ Of course, that is impossible. If you can change the principles of the rule of law with majority votes, you endanger, especially, individual rights or minority rights, if you are not very careful. That is why one of the greatest politicians of the 20th century thought of the idea that you could have an organisation of fundamental rights and the rule of law going beyond the nation state – an organisation at European level, capable of imposing its rulings on nation states if they did not observe the rights enshrined in the rule of law – and that European nations would subscribe to that principle willingly and democratically by signing conventions. Now some of you will be surprised that the politician who thought up this idea was Winston Churchill, and Winston Churchill had a high regard for the British system. He had such high regard for the British system, and so much self-confidence, that he did not mind a court in Strasbourg having oversight over what the British system produced. He had enough self-confidence to say ‘We are good enough to accept that oversight.’ And this is the basis upon which we work. In effect he said ‘Tie me to the mast so I do not succumb to the sirens when they call me.’ And that is the basis upon which our rule-of-law system in the European Union, and in the Council of Europe, was constructed – by Member States saying ‘We will be tied to the mast, so that we do not make mistakes, and if we make mistakes our peers will check and correct us.’ (Heckling) Honourable Member, perhaps you should read a bit more, instead of shouting, and you will know that Odysseus made a very wise choice. My point is this: any nation with enough self-confidence will accept its peers’ checking on its observance of human rights and the rule of law. We have nothing to fear if we are sufficiently self-confident. Do we? My second point concerns diversity. Europe is by nature a diverse community, a diverse continent. Our societies are by nature diverse, and throughout our history we have been strong when we celebrate our diversity: we are strong when we are welcoming to minorities; we are strong when we are welcoming to those who seek protection because they flee persecution and war. And we are weak when we try and confine ourselves to our own culture; when we see anybody who comes from elsewhere as a threat to our culture; when we believe that we can be overrun – 500 million of us – by a few hundred thousand. That is a testimony of weakness, of a lack of self-confidence, of a lack of trust in the strength of our European culture and our history. I strongly believe that if we claim diversity when we are elsewhere, and if we claim respect for our rights when we are elsewhere, we should also be able to give the same rights to those who come to us. What would Europe have looked like if, in 1956, other Europeans had said ‘I do not mind where those Hungarians go, so long as they do not come to us’? What would have happened then, or in 1968 if people from Czechoslovakia fleeing communist oppression had not been allowed, as refugees, into other European nations? (Applause) I celebrate the fact that so many hundreds of millions of Europeans today are saying to those genuinely fleeing from persecution, ‘You are welcome in my country, you will find protection on these shores, we will not send you back.’ Here again I want to come back to the rule of law. It works both ways. The rule of law deserves respect. Those who have the right to asylum should get it. Those are our values. Those are our international treaties. Those are our national obligations. But those who claim asylum without having the right to asylum should be refused asylum and should be returned to where they come from. That is also the rule of law. I strongly believe this is the basis upon which we should discuss fundamental rights. Fundamental rights apply to everyone on this continent – in this European Union – and disregarding respect for the fundamental rights of one individual hurts us all. Europe is nothing if it does not protect its minorities. Europe is nothing if it does not have an eye for that which is weak. Europe is nothing if we close our doors to people who flee persecution and war elsewhere. We will hurt not only the interests of those people: we will hurt our own values, we will do harm to ourselves and we will harm our souls, if that is our attitude. That is the background against which we should be discussing the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 123, "date": "2015-09-07.json", "name": "Laura Ferrara", "mepid": "124833", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Timmermans, thank you to all my fellow Members who have spoken in this debate. Despite the diversity of certain positions, I believe that it has become clear that, for all Members, over and above the political colour, fundamental rights are of great importance.  I would like to focus on just a few speeches, in response to some of the speeches made by some Members of the Conservatives and The People's Party, about the fact that little space has been devoted to individual rights and instead much more space to minority rights. Well, perhaps, if we look at the report a little more, we can see that there has been a great deal of room for freedom of expression and information, women's rights, gender equality rights, children's rights, the rights of LGBTI people, the rights of people with disabilities, the rights of the homeless, solidarity in the economic crisis, calling for all legislative proposals to be taken into account. , the European Union's policies and actions, including in the economic field, have been examined ex ante and ex post on fundamental rights.  It examines how fundamental rights are violated by organised crime and corruption, and ample scope is given to the protection of victims of crime. Well, I ask myself: are not all rights that place the person at the centre of interests? Are we not talking about the rights of individuals? I would also like to focus on the new mechanism, on which many still have doubts. Well, Commissioner Timmermans, as you will have seen, paragraph 9 already takes account of existing instruments, refers to infringement procedures and refers to the automatic initiation of Article 7.  Nevertheless, I believe that we in Europe can be much more ambitious. Today we have enumerated several stories of violations of fundamental rights, and I believe that this is a mirror of how the instruments that today's Europe equips themselves with are probably not enough. We need to be more ambitious and the ambition is to prevent and not to intervene ex post, when the violations have already been committed.  The new mechanism: briefly in paragraph 10 – please give me a few more minutes – we are talking about common indicators and objectives on the basis of which the Commission can assess the state of protection of fundamental rights. Well, some members have already referred to this, we are talking about the Copenhagen criteria for the accession countries. Why not continue to apply, to refer to the same indicators for the countries that continue to be part of the European Union, we refer to monitoring, country by country. You yourself, Mr Timmermans – and I will end here – paraphrase what you yourself said – Mr Timmermans – any state that has confidence in itself must not be afraid of control by others, on the basis of human rights.  Well, if that confirms to me, what is the fear of calling for an annual report on the state of protection of fundamental rights country by country? Then there is talk of a formal appeal, of an institutional dialogue, very often we are frightened by the terminology used, a new mechanism, that is probably what frightens us, but it is simply common sense.

Just imagine how it would be if, when a government takes office in a national parliament, each minister, before taking office, had to go for a three-hour public grilling, with incisive questioning. I think it would be revealing. We do it here, and it is to our credit, but what we do can always be improved, and my report has been about looking at how we operate this system and making a number of suggestions for improvement. Let me highlight just three. The first is about the questioning – the incisive nature of the questions. We had at the last hearings, I think, 42 questions by individual Members to Commissioners and 42 answers. I propose that we cut that number to about 25, but allow each questioner to come back with a follow-up question. That would be more incisive: it would permit a real to and fro. The purpose of the hearings is not to give the floor to a maximum number of Members: the purpose is to get precise information and answers out of the candidate Commissioners. The second proposal to improve things is to look at how we evaluate the Commissioners after the hearings. At the moment, the coordinators from each Group have a meeting, but our rules are not very clear on this. Indeed, our rules as they currently read could require a vote in every single committee, on every single Commissioner, at the request of just one Political Group. I do not think that is wise because formally, legally, the only vote that matters is the vote by Parliament as a whole on the Commission as a whole. The vote by individual committees on individual Commissioners has no legal consequence. Therefore, we have to make sure it has political consequences and carries weight. In other words, a vote should be taken on a Commissioner only in a case of genuine doubt, and not as a matter of routine. Then, if as we have seen in the past there is a negative verdict, it will have consequences. That is how I think we should proceed, and my report proposes to clarify the procedures in that regard. A final point I would mention is the question of gender balance in the Commission. This Parliament has always attached importance to improving the gender imbalance that has existed up to now, but of course we are tied by the nominations that come from national governments if they all nominate just one candidate. Last time, however, there was at least one country which nominated two and allowed the President of the Commission to choose. Why do we not institutionalise that and propose – as a parliament we can only propose in this case – that each country’s government nominates two candidate Commissioners at least, one of each gender, two people in whom the national government has full confidence? The Commission President would then be in a better position to get gender balance in the team as a whole, and that would go some way to improving the balance. There are some other suggestions in this report, but those are three worth highlighting.

The current way, if I may focus only on the nomination, on the recruitment of Commissioners from the Member States, is not good. I agree with you, Rapporteur, that it would be right for the Member States to nominate at least two candidates, a man and a woman.

I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Corbett, for his excellent and well—reflected report on a topic that Members will understand is of great relevance for the Commission. The Commission welcomes and fully supports the pursued objective of making the hearings a more flexible and dynamic exchange. The hearings not only allow for Parliament’s scrutiny of the Commission, in line with the Treaty, but also provide an important window for citizens on the workings of the Union. Incidentally, I was a Minister in a national government, then I became a Commissioner and all of a sudden, in the media, I went from being in some quarters a politician to an anonymous bureaucrat, whereas the scrutiny I went through in this Parliament was much tougher than the scrutiny I had to face in the national parliament in the Netherlands before becoming a Minister. By the way, in quite a number of Member States – because the second objection you always get is ‘unelected’ – how many governments do you suppose there are (I do not know the exact number, but there are quite a number of governments) where Ministers are not elected? Parliaments are all elected like this Parliament. So it is very often simply a matter of perception.  For the Commission, it is of foremost importance that the hearings are conducted in an open, fair and consistent manner. In particular, hearings for all Commissioners-designate should follow the same approach for questions and answers, both in the written and in the oral phase, and for the evaluation of each Commissioner-designate. For Vice-Presidents-designate, who have a horizontal responsibility spanning the competences of a larger number of EP committees, it is indeed appropriate to foresee that hearings are carried out in an adapted format, such as an open Conference of Presidents.  More generally, the confirmation period should be enough time to ensure that the new Commission can take up office immediately on the normal expiry of the previous Commission’s mandate. In this context, the Commission supports the call on Member States to make timely and gender-balanced nominations for candidate Commissioners.  As to the conduct of the hearings, the Commission supports the envisaged increase of written questions from five to seven, on condition that sub—questions are abandoned. The Commission also welcomes the limitation of questions in the oral phase to 25, with the possibility of immediate follow—up questions.  In principle, the Commission supports Parliament’s objective to ensure that the hearing process is accessible and transparent for EU citizens. Hearings are, however, for the elected Members of Parliament to exercise their scrutiny on Commissioners-designate. Therefore, it is the right of Members of the European Parliament to directly put questions to Commissioners—designate.  The Commission is open to considering how best to facilitate Parliament’s examination of potential conflicts of interest of Commissioners-designate. Should the Commission consider it appropriate to come forward with an amendment to its Code of Conduct, it will seek Parliament’s opinion, as foreseen by the Framework Agreement.  To ensure that Commissioners-designate are evaluated exclusively with regard to their personal competencies and knowledge of the envisaged portfolio, the Commission maintains that the results of the evaluation of each Commissioner-designate should be published individually within 24 hours after completion of her/his evaluation.  As for horizontal issues affecting the composition and structure of the Commission as a whole, the Commission recalls the need to fully respect each Institution’s competences and prerogatives. The Commission looks forward to examining the concrete proposals for amendments to Parliament’s Rules of Procedure regarding the hearings of Commissioners—designate.

In addition, I would like to thank the people from all over the world who have shared their input and suggestions. Many did so online and they have made the draft text that we voted on in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and will vote on tomorrow in this House, a lot stronger. I think crowdsourcing works. Technological developments have a major impact on human rights, both to advance them and to restrict them. They can advance access to information, freedom of expression and association, but the documentation and sharing of human rights abuses or uncovering of corruption have benefited too from mobile phones and access to the open Internet for more people. Disaster relief, aid efforts, election monitoring, they increasingly rely on technologies to help emancipate and empower people.  However, technological systems can be and are also misused as tools for human rights violations through censorship, mass surveillance, tracking and tracing of individuals, unauthorised access to devices, jamming, interception and a lot more. So besides technological specifications, the context in which ICTs are used determines to a great extent whether these tools advance or violate human rights: what country, which user or buyer, and what legal safeguards or democratic oversight are in place.  These contextual aspects should be assessed carefully in EU policies. More transparency and accountability in the market of the most intrusive and damaging technologies is key, both for security and for human rights. This is too often presented as a false dichotomy between security and freedom or actually justifying restrictions to peoples’ rights and freedoms in the name of advancing security when in fact they should reinforce each other and, at the very least, EU-made systems should not be sold in an unrestricted market. Without smart policies, proliferation of these systems is inevitable and in fact I am sure that we here in the EU institutions, the European External Action Service, struggle to protect our own people, our own diplomats and our own information from the very same systems that we are discussing here. Intelligence services, criminal networks, hackers with bad intentions, all can buy and use intrusive technologies that are made in Europe.  The credibility of Europe’s foreign policy is undermined directly when an Italian company unjustly gets a licence to sell to Sudan or Russia, or when a French company sells digital keys to open any door, even the ones we may think are protected or locked by passwords, or much stronger measures. But, much worse, human rights defenders in Mexico, Azerbaijan, Colombia, Egypt, Turkey, Iran or Russia should be protected by EU policies and not harmed with the help of EU-made technologies.  In concluding, EU policy should mainstream human rights in the way that technologies are designed and used and mainstream the role of technologies throughout all human rights policies, and this report presents many concrete ideas. One of the strong recommendations is that there should not be a ban on encryption technologies or requirements to hand over the keys. Instead, we, through our EU policy, should train and equip journalists, human rights defenders and others facing repression and violations with the knowledge and the tools to protect themselves and their communications. Europe has the opportunity and should have the ambition to be a global leader in ensuring technologies benefit human rights and this is only possible if we lead by example.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 172, "date": "2015-09-07.json", "name": "Stanislav Polčák (PPE).", "mepid": "124704", "text": "   – Madam President, I would like to thank you for presenting this report, because, in my opinion, it is indeed very important and is heading for the substance of the matter.

Reading it, you sometimes get a bit of flavour of Dave Erus and his writings about the downsides of modern technology and the ICT world. The report contains a number of very timely, pertinent and often challenging ideas and recommendations for action. The Commission appreciates the strong call to the EU to step up its efforts and strengthen the link between human rights, digital freedom, development, Internet governance, trade and security. This same message can also be found in the Digital Single Market Strategy recently adopted by the Commission. The EU is committed to promoting human rights in all areas of its external action. Nowadays, given the increasing importance of ICT in our daily lives and the expansion of Internet access and access to mobile telephony, the promotion of human rights online and offline and the linkage between new technologies and human rights are key to our endeavours towards promoting human rights and democracy worldwide. We therefore share the European Parliament’s view that ICTs are key in safeguarding and fostering human rights and fundamental freedoms. We also share the concern voiced in the report that certain fundamental rights, notably the right to freedom of expression and information, the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, may be violated as a result of unlawful or arbitrary surveillance, censorship, the unlawful interception of communications, or the collection of personal data, in particular when carried out on a mass scale and not for legitimate purposes. This requires us all to unite in our efforts to protect fundamental rights. We need to promote the development of democratic oversight capabilities in order to monitor activities by intelligence and law enforcement services, lest these are used to suppress dissent and free speech. This is firmly anchored in the EU guidelines for freedom of expression online and offline, and we are highly committed to promoting these guidelines in our relations with third countries. That is also why the Commission is very supportive of, and welcomes, the appointment of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Privacy. It is very important to ensure that our response to terrorist attacks does not impact negatively on fundamental rights, notably freedom of expression and information and the right to privacy. The European Security Agenda adopted by the Commission this year has made clear, therefore, that the Commission will strictly test any security measures for compliance with fundamental rights, while ensuring their effectiveness. The EU is committed to assisting human rights defenders, civil society activists, and independent journalists to use ICTs to fight for freedom. The EU is also active in defending media freedom and pluralism, and has launched two new independent projects within the framework of the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom, with the support of this Parliament. The projects will address media freedom violations in the EU and neighbouring countries and promote action to support threatened journalists, complemented by digital training. The European Union has also adopted sanctions to prevent authoritarian regimes using technologies to crack down on human rights defenders, for example in the case of Syria. In addition to country-specific sanctions, the EU is reviewing its export controls to prevent exports of sensitive technologies that could be misused in violation of human rights. In December 2014 we introduced new controls on exports of intrusion software and of internet monitoring technologies, and we are further exploring options to extend export controls to rapidly evolving cyber-surveillance technologies that might be used for Internet monitoring and/or telecommunication surveillance in violation of human rights. As Ms Schaake writes in the report, there is indeed a need to mainstream the impact of technologies on the improvement of human rights in all the EU’s external action. The Commission and the External Action Service are working together towards this goal. ICTs have helped to promote freedom on a global scale, and preserving the benefits of freedom is a shared responsibility for all of us – the private sector, civil society, governments, international organisations and individuals. The European Union stands, therefore, ready to reiterate its commitment to promote unhindered, uncensored and non-discriminatory access to ICTs.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 178, "date": "2015-09-07.json", "name": "President. –", "mepid": "28115", "text": "   The debate is closed.

Checking 40 million transactions and other common agricultural policy controls costs around EUR 4 billion a year. As the rules and regulations governing the CAP have only got more diverse and complex it is expected that monitoring costs of the almost EUR 58 billion CAP budget will only grow if nothing is done.  So as I said, the cost is currently estimated at EUR 4 billion at Member State level. The farmers face a never-ending mountain of paperwork which has to be submitted to national officials, with increasingly complex regulations and control measures.  A Finnish farmer illustrated the absurdity perfectly by displaying next to each other all of the official forms demanded annually by the national authorities. The documents ended up stretching over 33 metres in length. That is approximately the length of two full rows of EPP Members in this Chamber and that is a long, long line.  If we do not manage to streamline the CAP and ease the burden of controls on farmers, we cannot hope to attract new entrants to agriculture. It will be a struggle to even retain the current beneficiaries.  But this is not just a matter of agriculture. Complex rules and controls of those rules inevitably mean that taxpayers’ money is not spent efficiently. Even worse, with inefficiency comes uncertainty about correct and responsible use of EU funds. The promotion of performance-based controls can be an answer to some of those questions. The report at hand insists that the definition of performance in respect of controls should primarily entail the quality of the Member States’ checks and administrative systems: that is, the efficiency, consistency and reliability of the managing and certifying authorities.  In order to ease the burden on the beneficiaries, the authorities should aim to organise on-site checks in a way that would not subject the farmer to multiple annual on-site checks by the national authorities, the Commission or the Court of Auditors. This should be done by advancing and implementing the famous single audit scheme that we have been waiting for too long.  Furthermore, the report advocates identifying the best and worst performing Member States in its policy area, with the best performing States being rewarded with a reduction in controls. Now in some quarters this is being suspected of not being in accordance with the basic ideas of the Union, but let me underline that this fear is in vain: it is indeed in accordance with those ideas. And a key part of this approach is the sharing of experience and best practices with the worst performing States.  The key factor behind the thinking of the report is this: simplification is inevitable. The Commission is on this path and so should this Parliament be.  Your rapporteur has been driven by the ultimate desire to release farmers from behind their desks into the fields and simultaneously provide better control for taxpayers’ money.

If I can summarize my hundreds of meetings with beneficiaries of European funds in several things, then they will be as follows: We need to dramatically shorten the time from submission of documents to real repayment of funds; we need to base risk control – those who do well should be checked less, those who perform poorly should be checked more.

Proposals should be drawn up to penalise paying agencies.  (The President asked to speak more slowly) Proposals should be drawn up to penalise paying agencies, in the event of false declarations, to the point where the Commission can revoke the recognition of paying agencies in the event of serious inaccuracies. It is necessary to develop criteria to define which Member States perform best and which are the worst performing, so as to implement a programme for the dissemination of best practices.

Simpler rules mean that it is going to be easier to implement them, easier for farmers to work with them and easier for authorities to check up on them. As some of you have said, Phil Hogan has already started with this simplification exercise and it is well advanced. We have received many contributions from all stakeholders. Some changes have already been implemented and the Commission will present more proposals in the coming months. However, we do not have to wait for new rules to impact on the number of controls farmers face. The current legislation allows Member States with reliable management and control systems to reduce the level of the spot checks. Some Member States have expressed interest in taking advantage of this possibility. The Commission services are working closely with them to ensure all conditions for this reduction are met. Of course we want simple rules and better application, but we also have a great responsibility in ensuring that taxpayers’ money is not misappropriated and does not end up where it should not. Member States are also encouraged, in the current legislation, to organise their controls in a way that reduces the burden for farmers. Let us not forget either that only 5% of farmers are subject to on-the-spot checks for compliance with CAP rules. Most of the controls they are faced with result from national laws and from cross-compliance requirements, which do not originate from CAP legislation. Obviously, to most farmers it does not make any difference whether a rule comes from Brussels or from their own country: they are faced with rules and they want fewer of them. They are absolutely right. They should be farming and not involved in constant bureaucracy. But we believe that Member States could, in so far as possible, try to group their own controls with those resulting from CAP obligations, and perhaps they could also learn more from each other than they do today. As I said, controls are, and will remain, necessary. If the EU legislator or the Member States has specified a conditional requirement to be respected before aid can be paid, then there needs to be a check that this condition or requirement has been met. The more numerous or complex the requirements, the more numerous or complex the controls. Taxpayers have the right to know whether subsidies from the EU budget are being spent according to the rules, and we will therefore not accept any proposal that might compromise the sound financial management of the EU budget. Finally, we should ask ourselves whether an error rate of 2% is, per se, the appropriate benchmark for a complex policy such as the CAP and, more concretely, rural development. In that context, we should also raise the issue of the acceptable relation between the cost and the benefits of controls. Any reflection that does not attempt to tackle this question would really be a missed opportunity. The common agricultural policy is, and will remain, a cornerstone of EU policies. It is in our common interest that this policy be as effective as possible and that it retain the support of farmers and citizens. Taxpayers will want to be sure that their money is well spent.

A CAP that can be clearly implemented and interpreted is needed in order to reduce the error rate. It is necessary to develop tools to demonstrate errors in cases of fraud, while ensuring that farmers can continue delivering food production.

Madam President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. First of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks to all my fellow Members – not only in my own group, but also in the other groups – for their support in drawing up the report on family businesses in Europe. It was really a beautiful and very interest-oriented collaboration. You probably all know the well-known company names, the De Longhi, Lego, Heineken, Oetker, Clarins and as they are all called – manufacturers of high-quality products that are known not only in their home country, but beyond european borders. These whole companies have one thing in common, ladies and gentlemen: these are family businesses that have existed for decades and are good at business. However, there are not only the large, successful family businesses, but in the European Union we have a total of around 14 million family businesses. All family businesses have some similarities: they think and act sustainably, they inherit their business from generation to generation, they have a close bond, a high social responsibility towards their workforce, their workforce, and usually they are very faithful to their location. In other words, they do not move from one place to another when the tax legislation is perhaps a little cheaper in one country or another. No, they also have a responsibility in their region, they remain in the region and are therefore just as important for the local city or community as they are for competitiveness in Europe. Everything – stability, renewal and growth – in the area of family businesses ultimately also favours our European economy and the growth that we so desperately need in the European Union. Many of the family businesses are small and medium-sized enterprises, but not all. There are many family businesses which have around 500 to 1 000 employees and are therefore unfortunately not covered by the definition of SMEs. And yet these larger family businesses also have the same problems as SMEs: they suffer from too much bureaucracy, from complicated tax systems, from too little support. At the same time, however, they do not benefit from special Support for SMEs. That is why I think it is right to ask ourselves the question here in Parliament too: should we perhaps move away from purely quantitative criteria when defining SMEs, should we not also take greater account of qualitative criteria, such as the interdependence of property, control and management, the risk of liability? In any case, we finally need an EU-wide definition of family business, which is also suitable for statistical offices in the Member States and with which work can be carried out. Family businesses all have the same problems almost all over Europe. One is the search for a suitable successor, which is very often difficult for many family businesses. Statistics say that every year there are about 150 000 companies that have problems that have to close because they cannot find suitable successors. If we convert this into jobs, we are talking about 600 000 jobs that are lost every year. And, of course, family businesses usually also have a significantly higher equity ratio than non-family companies. This leads to economic stability for businesses and for the economy as a whole. That is why this must be taken into account when investing. It is no wonder that companies in all Member States are complaining about excessive taxation. Equity that remains in the region invested to maintain operations should be spared tax burdens as much as possible. I urge the Commission to return to family businesses. Six years ago, there was a working group in the Commission which devoted itself to this chapter. Nothing has happened since then. I think that if we want growth, prosperity and employment in the European Union, as is our aim, then we must take into account the specificities of family businesses and simply ask ourselves: how can we give even more support to these family-run businesses – our backbone, also industry and the economy in the European Community – how can we better support them in their problems? There will be a lot of damage at national level. But I think that the best practices comparison and a clear commitment also at European level to promote and support these strong family businesses is an honourable thing. And that is why I would like to ask tomorrow for support for my report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 192, "date": "2015-09-07.json", "name": "Anna Záborská (PPE).", "mepid": "23894", "text": "   – I would like to thank my colleague Angelika Niebler for her excellent text.

It is therefore important to promote their value integrity and to guarantee them, as legal persons, the freedoms enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the practice of values in business. Family businesses have specific needs. I believe that the adopted report will lead to an improvement in their position, because strengthening family entrepreneurship will help to increase employment, especially in economically weaker regions.

In doing so, I believe that removing the administrative burden that increases production and trade is the most important step in the process of opening small family businesses to the Common European Market.

The top 10 companies in this sector generate about one hundred billion euros of European GDP and employ 2.5 million people. Overall, family businesses in Europe account for 13 percent of gross domestic product and 3.2 percent of total employment, while companies are 90 years old on average. Family businesses are much more competitive than other companies, they are geared towards long-term success, and the takeover – as has already been mentioned today – plays a very special role.  The report also highlighted the fact that some 480 000 companies were taken over each year in Europe. We have heard that there is probably no suitable successor for 150. It's a big issue.

Europe’s family businesses are important economic actors and deserve attention. Across Europe, about 70% of enterprises are family businesses and they account for between 40% and 50% of employment.  The most effective way to help family businesses is to address their problems in existing SMEs or industry-related policies such as the creation of a supportive business environment or participation in the various European Union funding programmes.  Family businesses need a level playing field when the implementation of national or EU policies has an impact on them. A number of points mentioned in the report have, to a large extent, already been addressed by the Commission, for example the contact points, the collection of statistical data and the need for vocational training for younger family members. However, we are ready to look at these issues with you again and, if needed, to take further steps to improve the situation.  There are also a number of important problems that are family-business specific and need special attention, like the smooth transfer of business to the next generation and its fiscal consequences. As you know, taxation is a sole competence of Member States, so we have pointed out the issue of the family business to them, asking them for more growth—friendly tax policies at national level.  To make governments more sensitive to the issue of family businesses, we took action to make more visible the economic importance of the sector. In many Member States, unfortunately, there is no statistical information. For this reason, we are financing a number of national statistical offices to collect data on family businesses in order to get a clearer picture on them. The results will be known in about two years’ time. We are also running a project on identifying good practices and useful tools in preparing on-time transfer of businesses because, as I said, the transfer of businesses is a problem for many families. In your report, you also referred to the need to offer young family members entrepreneurship education and training. I would like to mention that there are various programmes, like Erasmus for young entrepreneurs, from which all younger members of the family business can benefit if they envision entrepreneurship as an attractive and realistic career option.  Concerning the role of women in family businesses, we promote and support women entrepreneurship in Europe with concrete actions, providing encouragement, advice and support to women entrepreneurs. Such measures include the European Network of Female Entrepreneurship Ambassadors, the European Network of Mentors for Women Entrepreneurs and, as from 2016 onwards, the online e-platform for women entrepreneurs.

Madam President, the rapporteur for the report, Mr João Ferreira, has unfortunately not been able to be with us today, and that is why I will present on his behalf the main objectives pursued by this report. We note, first of all, that the report takes into account the Commission's report entitled 'Innovation in the Blue Economy: Exploiting the Potential of Our Seas and Oceans in order to promote employment and growth', a document which has a great deal of room for improvement, since it has a limited scope and does not cover all sectors. The following new elements are therefore added: - there is dissatisfaction with the short- and long-term impact on national research programmes of cuts in public investment in research, development and innovation; 2020\" on research and innovation proposed by the Commission.  The proper development of the blue economy requires decent occupations linked to it and the creation of quality jobs with rights. The report therefore urges the Commission and the Member States to integrate the gender dimension at all stages of the development of the blue economy, as well as to encourage and enhance the effective participation of women in it. The Commission is called upon to identify all European funds allocated to finance the activities of the blue economy and to concentrate them on a single platform, to which all citizens will have access. It is also stressed that the Commission should provide funds for innovation and blue growth to finance basic research, vocational training, job creation, start-ups, small and medium-sized enterprises, social economy enterprises, cooperatives, education, poverty reduction of coastal areas, the development of biotechnology, transport links, energy interconnection, coastal access to broadband services , the protection of the environment and the commercial exploitation of innovative products, services and partnerships.  Ladies and gentlemen, investment in the blue economy should focus, inter alia, on eco-innovation, resource efficiency, the circular economy, nature conservation, the protection of the marine and coastal environment, climate change mitigation and adaptation to and sustainable use of resources. The report therefore calls on the Commission to incorporate these principles into existing and future support programmes. It is equally important to establish an appropriate financial framework to boost innovation, sustainable development of the blue economy and job creation. This framework will combine, coordinate and facilitate access to available financial instruments, structural and investment funds, public institutions, local authorities and businesses, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, and non-governmental organisations, in order to provide broad information on existing opportunities.  It is important to stress that public investment plays a key role in promoting growth and making full use of the potential of the blue economy. They must therefore be strengthened, without this meaning that we will overlook the role of private investment. Public companies or majority-owned companies in sectors such as commercial shipping, port management, shipbuilding and maritime and coastal protection projects also play a very important role. We therefore reject the emphasis only on the private sector. All these points are included in the report and we call on colleagues to vote in favour of it in order to strengthen European policy on the blue economy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 202, "date": "2015-09-07.json", "name": "Νότης Μαριάς (ECR).", "mepid": "125069", "text": "   Madam President, the report is indeed interesting and raises very important points.

The ship is a unique European product. A unique European product because it can be made up of various parts coming from different countries.

It is best to get the research and cost correct first and then introduce a new technology, not the other way around.

I will just pick up one other point that I have time for: the suggestion to move to liquefied natural gas as a transitional fuel to help the environment.

The blue economy generates three to five percent of European GDP; employs 5.6 million people and contributes to European esteem with a value added volume of EUR 495 million.  The report clearly deals with the interaction between sea and land, noting that data from land and sea must be seen as a single entity and that sustainable management is of essential interest, essential, and the role of new technologies, and here we are addressing innovation and research in particular.  The fourth point I would like to mention is investment: the report criticises the fact that Horizon 2020 is intended to save money.

It is an important contribution to the EU’s Blue Growth agenda. It recognises the significant potential of the Blue Economy to create jobs and growth, and stresses the importance of action by the EU and its Member States to unlock this potential. The report stresses that the sustainability dimension must be fully embedded in our approach, and I can confirm that the Commission is wholeheartedly in agreement with this approach. We must indeed protect, restore and maintain coastal and oceanic ecosystems, biodiversity, resilience and productivity, keep the oceans free from pollutants and litter and apply the precautionary principle. Cross-sectoral and inter-disciplinary research and rolling-out of innovation will be essential to achieve these goals, along with support from Member States. We are also looking at promoting innovation in both emerging and more traditional maritime sectors.  The focus on marine knowledge and seabed mapping, the creation of the marine research information platform and the work on developing skills will boost innovation and job creation over the whole varied range of interacting sectors, including existing industries. For instance, there are two specific articles in the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Regulation which focus on innovation and sustainable development of fisheries and aquaculture; and Horizon 2020, the Framework Programme for Research Innovation, supports a considerable amount of research in the traditional sectors. The European Fund for Strategic Investments also offers possibilities for projects with a higher risk profile. I was very happy to read that the report asks for a proper assessment of the size of the Blue Economy and appraisal of its financial needs. We are already working on this. We have now made some first estimates of the size of the Blue Economy and will be comparing notes with statisticians and economists from Member States later this month. Solid figures will no doubt also help us to measure progress in driving the Blue Industry forward.  We are also working on delivering some other key points of your report. For example, we are considering how to close the skills gap in the Blue Economy, and calls for proposals will be issued in 2016 to tackle this. We are also making progress on developing an information platform to make the results of marine and maritime research more easily available.  Finally, I could not agree more that a global level playing field is needed to further strengthen the EU’s position as a global leader in a sustainable Blue Economy. I have launched an international public consultation on what the EU needs to do to improve the governance of the oceans, including ensuring a sustainable use of ocean resources and guaranteeing a level playing field. I encourage you to contribute to this consultation.

The preparation of this report has focused on a lot of knowledge from education systems and the business environment and leads to a clear conclusion: \"Entrepreneurial skills need to be required, they can be taught and they can be learned. It is useful for individuals and for society.\" 225 amendments were tabled to the original report, so the report has attracted a lot of interest and is the result of very good cooperation with the rapporteurs of all the groups, to whom I also thank. With this report, the European Parliament is responding to high youth unemployment, which in some regions is up to 50%. While the Institutions of the European Union have repeatedly paid attention to promoting youth entrepreneurship. However, this report is the only one that deals with this issue on its own. We agreed, among other things, that young people need a sense of initiative and entrepreneurship. We emphasize the social dimension of entrepreneurship. Our report highlights the role of non-formal and informal education, which is the domain of the non-profit sector in particular, exceptionally also companies, and needs to be recognised and supported. The report details the definition of entrepreneurial skills and their teaching opportunities. The European Parliament confirms that a 'sense of initiative and entrepreneurship' is one of the key competences for lifelong learning. It includes, but is not limited to, creativity, the ability to introduce news, bear risks, financial and media literacy, plan and manage projects. The report places the main emphasis on the role of the European Commission and the Council and calls for better use of the instruments they have. This resolution is a major challenge for the European Commission. Due to the proactive approach of DG EAC to date, we would like to set specific dates and tasks. For example, for the Commission to strengthen support for entrepreneurship education as one of the objectives of erasmus+ for the next financial period after 2020 and to include these skills in the mandatory content of training programmes. From 2016, the European Commission should include education-related measures in this area in the indicators for the evaluation of the European Semester. It should then submit a report on best practices in this area by the end of 2017. We are aware that the Member States are not waiting for this resolution, but are already working to develop entrepreneurial skills themselves, albeit very diversely and insufficiently systematically. That is why the European Parliament also mentions measures for them that can help, for example in the form of start-ups, advice, facilitating access to loans, using crowdfunding or partnerships between businesses and universities, supporting business incubators and, above all, linking teaching to practice. The european social fund, the Youth Employment Initiative, the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation, Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs and others will be the source for financing these activities. As teachers have a key role to play, we call on the Member States to initiate improvements in their training already in the framework of pedagogical study programmes. The European Parliament sees support for youth entrepreneurship through education as very promising, so we ask the Commission to present an evaluation report on the progress made in this area by the end of this parliamentary term. Once again, I thank my colleagues for their cooperation, and I believe that the measures we are proposing will help to improve the quality of education and improve employment.

Such companies not only generate revenue and drive the European economy, but also support the development of a civil society that is committed and sensitive to the needs of others. Many young people want work to be not only their passion, but also socially useful.  I therefore believe that building European social capital – from volunteering based on young people's knowledge and skills to valuable traineeships to international exchange programmes for students and young entrepreneurs – should be an important element in promoting entrepreneurship. These actions will certainly ensure the forward-looking development of the European Community.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 216, "date": "2015-09-07.json", "name": "Silvia Costa (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "96917", "text": "   Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that the Commissioner is also here, and I believe that this is a commitment that we also entrust to the Commission, in cooperation with Parliament.

I believe that to say, as we say all the time, that Europe needs more entrepreneurs, more innovation, creativity and more growth for small and medium-sized enterprises, is also achieved through the orientation of school curricula and opportunities for partnerships at school, university sites, with the business system, but also in education for the development of the entrepreneurial mindset and the central role that teacher training has in this field.  I think it is also a great instrument, as has been said, in favour of new employment: one in two young people in Europe, between the age of 15 and 25, says that they would prefer self-employment, but often there are no conditions for creating these skills. These are transversal competences, which serve not only to set up a company, but also serve to address the skills we call 'citizenship' skills, but I believe that it is very necessary to qualify teachers and to have a stronger alliance on this issue, including with European employers' associations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 217, "date": "2015-09-07.json", "name": "Krzysztof Hetman (PPE).", "mepid": "124895", "text": "   – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent work.

As a result of this discussion with young people, I have made sure that the factor holding back them from developing this business is not the lack of good ideas or entrepreneurial spirit: they really have a lot of cool ideas. Rather, the question of the lack of financial barriers or unawareness of how to overcome these barriers is a bigger problem. I am therefore of the opinion that we need to put more emphasis on the information campaign on the tools available in this respect – such as the European Social Fund, the microfinance instrument and many other EU programmes, such as 'Business Angels'.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 218, "date": "2015-09-07.json", "name": "Jonathan Arnott (EFDD).", "mepid": "124958", "text": "   – Madam President, some of the challenges in this report are common to all Member States in Europe, while other vary from one Member State to another.

We need to be doing more of this kind of thing: we need to be promoting entrepreneurship, we need to be promoting the kind of skills, the kind of training, that are going to develop young people in the right direction.

The second word is digitization, because digital skills are necessary for the realization of every entrepreneur and young person. They improve their access to sustainable jobs, help them to be self-employed and teach them to better understand the needs of their future employers. And the third word is business, because large corporations can support small companies and new projects through know-how and experience, and we here, our job is to create the most suitable environment for entrepreneurship development.

I wish first to thank the rapporteur, Ms Šojdrová, for her very successful report, for the valuable points and concrete proposals she makes on a topic of increasing relevance. It is not the first time that you, the Parliament, and the Commission have discussed this topic, and my impression is that the discussion has reached a level of maturity that will enable substantial progress. We are no longer wondering whether entrepreneurship can be taught or not: whether a classroom is a proper place to do it. No, those questions are now obsolete, and we should focus on how to improve and increase the teaching of entrepreneurship in educational institutions, including schools, and how to reach a critical mass of pupils. One crucial point captured in the report is that learning entrepreneurship is not only about setting up a business: far from it. It is about bringing education and work closer, acquiring crucial skills, and most importantly acquiring values – a sense of initiative, creativity, teamwork, resilience, the ability to learn from mistakes, and self-confidence, among others. With still unacceptably high levels of youth unemployment in the EU, teaching and spreading entrepreneurship is definitely part of the solution to reduce the skills mismatch. Let me also mention the social dimension of entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship is not only for the few highly qualified students. On the contrary, it is a powerful tool that can help address social exclusion.  As I said, this is not the first time we have spoken about entrepreneurship, and we must acknowledge that substantial progress has been accomplished in the last few years. This is well reflected in the Council conclusions of 12 December 2014 on entrepreneurship in education. The Commission has also put in place several policies to support and develop entrepreneurial skills in schools, as well as in further education and lifelong learning. Let me name a few.  First of all, the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIIT) has pioneered the integration of entrepreneurship education in the higher education curriculum. Students of the EIIT’s knowledge and innovation communities follow entrepreneurship and innovation-related courses in addition to their scientific education. Secondly, in line with the recommendation of the report, the Commission will continue to successfully upscale and support the HEInnovate initiative, which the Commission and the OECD launched together in 2013 to support higher education institutions in developing to become more entrepreneurial and innovative. As of today, we have some 500 European higher education institutions that have used the initiative voluntarily, and the number keeps growing. Do you know that, thanks to Erasmus placements, 55 000 students, one in five, benefitted from traineeships in enterprises in 2013; that the Commission supports knowledge alliances which are cooperation projects between businesses and higher education institutions; or that the Commission launched a project on creating companies in 20 different schools across five Member States? I will stop here because the list is long and I am not here to describe what the Commission has done, but rather to think about the way forward: supporting Member States in improving and extending the teaching of entrepreneurship throughout the EU. The first challenge to be met, and this is well reflected in the report, concerns ICT skills, a crucial sector in today’s economies, especially for youngsters. We must find ways to exploit the possibilities as effectively as possible for the benefit of young Europeans. The second challenge is the recognition of entrepreneurship skills. Assessing and certifying them at European level in order to allow mobility is of the essence. Pilot projects exist but, once again, we must reach a critical mass and make sure that entrepreneurial skills are increasingly recognised in curricula and throughout Member States. Honourable Members, I think we are on a good track. The Commission already supports Member States’ expanding and improving the teaching of entrepreneurship in schools and universities, but still more can and should be done. I hope, together with my colleagues Commissioners Bieńkovska and Thyssen, to improve on these encouraging results in the coming years. Allow me to finish by acknowledging the key role of the several NGOs and enterprises – vibrant civil-society operators – who are playing a crucial role and enabling remarkable progress to be made in this field.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 221, "date": "2015-09-07.json", "name": "President. –", "mepid": "28115", "text": "   The debate is closed.

The European Parliament's motion for a resolution on the promotion of entrepreneurship in young people through education and training deals with an issue of great interest to the growth policies that we have been pursuing in recent years. In fact, the economic and financial crisis has left the European continent with major imbalances within it, one of the most significant of which is youth unemployment.  For this reason, a joint effort is needed between European and national policies to support the education and university education of young people in order to increase their social inclusion. More than four and a half million young unemployed people are unacceptable, and therefore an entrepreneurial fabric of motivated young people, who pay particular attention to innovation and research, is a key to returning to growth, reducing unemployment. In this motion for a resolution, particular emphasis is made on the fundamental characteristics of entrepreneurship to be developed, such as creativity, innovation, the identification of opportunities and autonomy of thought, as key factors in building an active network of young enterprises, especially in the field of social entrepreneurship. Finally, the importance of promoting female entrepreneurship in order to enhance fundamental talents and skills to stimulate growth in Europe is underlined.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 225, "date": "2015-09-07.json", "name": "Damian Drăghici (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "124786", "text": "  in writing. – As shadow rapporteur, I believe that this report is an important one, which must be an integral part of the European Union's strategy to support the younger generation for growth, employment, education and social integration.

The report makes it clear that disadvantaged groups need special attention and support throughout education, through the involvement of parents and communities in the educational process, as well as help to start, run or develop a business or enterprise. I supported the idea that non-formal and informal learning activities are of particular relevance to young people with fewer opportunities, giving them additional learning opportunities for their integration into the formal education and training system. I believe that The Member States must continue to develop systems for the recognition and validation of skills acquired in non-formal and informal learning in order to give young people the opportunity for reorientation and a second chance, but also to encourage self-recognition and further learning.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 226, "date": "2015-09-07.json", "name": "Ilhan Kyuchyuk (ALDE)", "mepid": "124866", "text": "  in writing. – I would like to express my support for the report on ‘Promoting youth entrepreneurship through education and training’.

Being entrepreneurial also helps us achieve sustainable employment and reveal our full potential. Entrepreneurial education develops a sense of initiative which will help young people with their own initiatives and their everyday life – NOT only for their companies and associations.  I do realise that youth entrepreneurship cannot completely solve the youth unemployment problem, but it is definitely one of the solutions, especially acknowledging that having an entrepreneurial mind-set is highly beneficial for the development of the creative sector, something that Europe very much needs in order to get back to growth and strengthen Europe’s competitiveness.

As a former entrepreneur, I believe that education and training are central to a young person's ability to develop a business. Often, young people with very good ideas fail to implement their wishes, given the lack of information or managerial capabilities. The education system across Europe must be adapted to the new economic context and develop entrepreneurship among young people. This requires training for teachers, but also an adaptation of the curriculum so that entrepreneurship activities are developed.

If you want to fly a plane, you can't do it in the classroom by reading a textbook – it requires many hours of hard work and practical training. Similarly, in order to become an entrepreneur and go the way from idea to successful product, you need to rely on practical experience and learn from the best entrepreneurs. And because young people value concrete proposals, not just words, I have two ideas: First of all, why not turn Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs into a global programme opening up opportunities beyond the EU's borders. Let our young entrepreneurs learn from the best and bring this model here in Europe. Second, put an end to unpaid internships in Europe. Traineeships, practices and trainings are a shortcut to gaining experience, but around 50% of traineeships offered in the EU are unpaid. It's discrimination - if you can't afford it, you don't have an internship. Often unpaid or low-paid trainees have responsibilities on an equal footing with employees, and every job must be paid for.

This importance stems from the very title - \"An integrated approach\", says the title of this report. \"Integrated\" means that practically the cultural component exists in almost any subject that we can develop in everyday life in any public debate. Here are some points i would like to highlight for starters. We call for the early designation of a European year dedicated to cultural heritage with a budget to match. We then ask the European Commission to better organise information on the financing of cultural heritage, to establish a single portal at European Union level dedicated to cultural heritage. Let us stop hiding, please, behind the fact that all information is available on the Internet. The cruel reality is that the cultural field has an acute need for funding in all Member States and we must help cultural operators to use all the European funds to which they are entitled. Another important step we need to take is to remove from the FDR Regulation the threshold of five million euros set for cultural heritage projects. We have been fighting for the removal of this threshold, which has been set totally artificially, and our report is very clear on this subject. I therefore ask the European Commission not to ignore the voice of the citizens who have asked us for help in removing this threshold. Another crack identified by our report is the lack of an adequate quality control system for heritage projects. A project to restore a heritage site is not just a simple invoice listing. The moment we pour concrete over a medieval fresco, it doesn't matter that the financial audit was perfectly fine, covered with bills. That is why our report calls for mandatory mentions of the quality of restoration work to be included in the Rules of European Programmes. We can destroy with European funds what they have not destroyed for thousands of years of weather or war.  Because I arrived here with regret, I must remember only for a moment about the monstrous attack on the ancient city of Palmyra. There is only an ancient city in the wilderness; is an ancient city, a world heritage wonder, and a spring with both thermal water. There can be no other interests: there is no oil, there is no population, there is nothing. It's nothing, it's just deserted... And yet, some criminals have so cruelly attacked this exact place. Simple: because it's about global cultural memory. And I say this because it was recently voted on the proposal of the Chairman of the Committee on Culture, Mrs Silvia Costa, who is present in the plenary of Parliament, a resolution which considers this type of acts of destruction of the world cultural heritage as crimes against humanity. It's about murder.  Now, finally, I regret to say to you that, at least in my opinion, recent assessments of risk areas in the vicinity of the European Union have created an aberrant, dangerous, explosive situation. These assessments took into account political, geopolitical, military, probably economic, etc. criteria and no cultural criteria. I mean by that there is a risk that today's so-called refugee crisis, of huge, unexpected, explosive migration on the European Union, will hide in it another possible crisis, which may be a cultural crisis, of clashing cultures.

The Commission shares the report’s view that supporting, enhancing and promoting cultural heritage through an integrated approach is of paramount importance.  In addition to its intrinsic value, cultural heritage contributes significantly to economic and social development and it touches the lives of all Europeans, nurturing their sense of belonging and strengthening their European identity.  As we speak, heritage is unfortunately the target of acts of vandalism, defacement and even destruction, as we can see in the terrible images of destruction in Iraq and Syria. But there are also other, less violent, threats to heritage. We are so used to our surrounding historic environment that we may forget that such a fragile beauty needs a lot of care to survive. The report will help the Commission to fine-tune the existing instruments and to make further progress on putting into practice tools, policies and mechanisms in an integrated way to address the challenges the heritage sector is facing today.  The Commission has already taken action on many of the spheres of action mentioned in the report. The Commission has started to work with the Member States on participatory governance. In 2016-2017 this work will be continued on heritage skills, training and knowledge transfer. The Commission is also promoting peer learning among cities and regions to support the exchange and transfer of the wealth of experience and good cultural practices, including heritage. The Commission will also continue to enhance internal cooperation and availability of information on financing opportunities within the existing European funding programmes.

Parliament's adoption of my report on European film in the digital age is a good example of the fact that European cinematography and the need to digitise our film heritage is an important aspect of protecting European identity and common cultural heritage.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 240, "date": "2015-09-07.json", "name": "President. –", "mepid": "28115", "text": "   The next item is the report by Lynn Boylan, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the follow-up to the European Citizens’ Initiative Right2Water (2014/2239(INI)) (A8-0228/2015).", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 241, "date": "2015-09-07.json", "name": "Lynn Boylan", "mepid": "124984", "text": "   rapporteur. – Madam President. The Right2Water European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) was the first successful example of this democratic mechanism and it reached almost double the minimum requirements with a staggering 1.8 million signatures. It is clear that the human right to water is an issue of great importance for citizens across Europe. Ownership and management of water services are clearly key concerns for citizens and cannot be ignored.  In my home country, Ireland, which you will be familiar with yourself, Madam President, the introduction of flat-rate regressive charges has resulted in some of the largest protests the country has ever seen. Given that Ireland previously had what was considered one of the most progressive forms of paying for water, through general taxation, this anger is understandable. Irish people should not have to submit to an unjust double taxation, which will also affect the poor the hardest. In spite of the unparalleled success of this ECI, the official response of the Commission was vague, disappointing and did not properly address the demands of the Right2Water campaign. The response lacked ambition and ignored the key demands of Right2Water. In this report I have tried to better answer the citizens who are still waiting for proper action from the EU. It is pitiful that the Commission had not come forward with legislative proposals enshrining water as a human right and a legal requirement across the European Union. This was a key demand of the Right2Water ECI and it has been roundly ignored by the Commission so far.  I have called on it in this report to rectify the situation. I have recognised that the provision of water services is a natural monopoly, where competition amongst private operators has not worked, does not work and will never work. Water is a public good and should never be commodified. Profits should not be made on public goods such as water. All revenues must be reinvested into improving infrastructure of water service and not go to shareholders or executives’ pay. It is critical that the Commission respect the Member States’ right to organise their water services as they see fit.  Indeed, across the world, we have experienced a growing rise in the re—municipalisation of water services. In other words, water services previously run by private companies are being brought back under public management due to the abject failures of privatisation in the water sector.  I would like to express my thanks for the support from the Right2Water campaign itself and the support of MEPs in the more progressive Groups, but I am extremely disappointed with the EPP Group, which along with the ECR has produced an alternative resolution which strips the strong and progressive aspects from my report.  I can see that they have worked very hard to disguise their sham, but if anyone reads the two reports it is clear where their ambitions lie. They have worked wormholes through the report to weaken it beyond any recognition. Gone is any criticism of the Commission’s failure to respond to the campaign. Gone is the call for the human right to water to be enshrined in legislation, and gone is any criticism of the privatisation of water services. They have removed the call for the Commission to remain neutral on the question of ownership and not to promote privatisation of water services. Indeed the whole motion is very private-sector-friendly, so much so that the original call for water services to be removed from TTIP is completely missing. They have deleted so many positive aspects of the report that it has gone from 37 pages to a 9-page document which reads more like an EPP position paper supported by the Tories than an honest response to the almost 2 million citizens who signed this ECI. It is a dishonest attempt to gag the voices of those who campaigned for the human right to water. Given that this was meant to be Parliament’s opportunity to respond to the Right2Water ECI it will reflect incredibly poorly on us as the supposed voice of European citizens if this alternative motion is passed, which is not supported by the Right2Water campaign. The ECI was meant to show citizens that the EU is willing to re-engage with them on matters which are important to them. If this alternative motion passes, then the ECI is dead in the water.

As the Commission has made clear in its response to the initiative, water is not a commercial product like any other, but rather a heritage which must be protected, defended and treated as such. Access to it cannot be taken for granted, although many people in Europe do so. The Commission has always underlined that an important condition for providing access to water is the preservation and protection of water resources. This is a cornerstone of EU environment policy. The EU directives on drinking water and urban wastewater treatment, as well as the Water Framework Directive, set the standards for water and sanitation and provide the basis for integrated water resource management. As your report states, globally, access to water and sanitation is a global issue of huge importance. Fifteen years on from the UN Millennium Declaration, the statistics are still challenging: 748 million people still do not have access to safe drinking water and 2.5 billion people lack access to basic levels of sanitation. Therefore I welcome Sustainable Development Goal 6, which aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. The SDGs are at the core of the post-2015 agenda. The EU stands ready to play its full part in its implementation, both through its external action as well as its internal policies and actions, and I hope that we will be able to gather momentum with all partners to achieve universal access in the not too distant future. I wish to reaffirm the Commission’s position on the importance of the human rights dimension of access to safe drinking water and sanitation, including within the EU itself. Firstly, the Commission recognises the importance of water as a public good. The provision of water services is in general the responsibility of the local authorities, as they are closest to the citizens. Secondly, the Commission has clarified the principle of neutrality. Treaty rules require the EU to remain neutral in relation to national decisions governing the ownership regime for water undertakings, be it public or private. Moreover, EU rules on concessions acknowledge the specificity of water. Works and services concerning drinking water and sanitation have been excluded from the scope of the Concessions Directive, and the subsidiarity principle regarding the choice of method of water management has been fully recognised. This also applies to trade deals. No EU trade deal has ever restricted EU Member States’ freedom to organise their public services – including water – the way they choose. TTIP – the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership – will be no different. Thirdly, I re-confirm the Commission’s commitment to a number of actions which will ensure that these principles remain at the heart of its policies, and I welcome the emphasis placed in the committee’s report on the importance of Member States implementing EU legislation. The Commission will build on existing legislation and policies to continue to increase and improve access to safe drinking water and sanitation for the whole population through environmental policies and infrastructure funding. Let me now emphasise again the positive impact the Citizens’ Initiative has had on putting water issues high on the political agenda. We welcome your numerous calls on the Commission for action. The Commission is carefully considering them in the context of a number of actions, for example in the evaluation of the Drinking Water Directive, the preparation of the Water Re-use Initiative and the upcoming review of the Water Framework Directive, and the ongoing dialogue with the stakeholders – including the initiators of the Citizens’ Initiative – on benchmarking water quality and services. To conclude, I would like to add an important element. EU water policies and activities over the past decades have allowed access to adequate sanitation and drinking water services for the large majority of EU citizens. Challenges remain. Member States play a big role in the implementation of EU legislation, while further targeted action by the Commission is under way. We all have to play together in ensuring full compliance with EU water legislation, thus helping to ensure access to clean water and sanitation for all citizens throughout the EU. We welcome the strong support and additional calls from this House for more ambitious action, in particular to involve citizens and to provide more transparency. Also, the call for access to safe drinking water and sanitation is much welcomed and will be taken into account in future Commission work. As regards the European Citizens’ Initiative tool itself, I am pleased to note that this major innovation introduced by the Lisbon Treaty is now up and running and involving citizens more closely in EU agenda-setting. However, there is still clearly room for improvement. In the report on the application of Regulation No 211/2011 on the Citizens’ Initiative published on 31 March 2015, the Commission took stock of this situation after three years of application. The report identified a number of issues in the current functioning of the instrument as a basis for further discussion and reflection on how to improve it. The Commission is now awaiting input from stakeholders, in particular the own initiative report of the European Parliament on ECI. This report will feed into the Commission’s analysis on how to improve the functioning of the European Citizens’ Initiative and make the tool as effective as possible. The Commission is looking forward to further cooperation with Parliament on both these important issues: the follow-up of the Right2Water initiative and the evolution of the tool.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 248, "date": "2015-09-07.json", "name": "President. –", "mepid": "28115", "text": "   The debate is closed.
