[{"id": 0, "date": "2016-06-22.json", "name": "Reuven Rivlin", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the State of Israel. – Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission/ High Representative of the Union, honourable Members, my wife Nechama, ladies and gentlemen, with your permission I will speak my words in Hebrew. (Official translation of President Rivlin’s speech, which was delivered in Hebrew) A mere four hours: that is the flight time from Tel-Aviv to Brussels. I could say that four hours, and light years, separate Brussels and Tel-Aviv, but in truth there is not much difference between them, be it in awareness or in essence: two cosmopolitan cities, practically neighbours, not far from each other, both recently struck by a wave of terrorism. Seated here are many delegates from numerous European countries. Some share the Mediterranean Sea with us, all share a rich and painful history with the Jewish People. About a month ago, the leaders of Europe marked 100 years since the Battle of Verdun, the longest battle of World War I, with 900 000 casualties, including 300 000 fatalities. Some half a million Jewish soldiers served in the armies of the countries at war, often poised against each other, firing upon each other. But this ‘patriotic bloodletting’ did not bestow any privilege on the Jewish People. Quite the contrary: Jews in every country were accused of spying and treason. Germany started a ‘head-count’ of Jewish soldiers. In Eastern Europe, Jews were accused of Bolshevism and of Anti-Bolshevism. It is estimated that more than 170 000 Jewish soldiers were killed in World War I, and around 100 000 more were murdered in post-war pogroms. That horrible war, World War I, was the herald of the ‘Exodus’ of the Jewish People from Europe. Many Jews saw in the United States of America their new home. Others, Zionist leaders, shaken and shocked from having had to face their own Jewish brothers as foes on the battlefield, took action to fulfil the dream of a national home for the Jewish People, in its ancient and eternal homeland, the Land of Israel. From where we stand today, the Great War was but a promo to a much more horrendous war that followed suit: World War II. In World War II, the annihilation of the Jewish People was a defined target of the Axis powers headed by Nazi Germany. The second ‘European Exodus’ of the Jewish People occurred upon the defeat of the Third Reich. This was a traumatic emigration: one of refugees and agony, of a culture destroyed, of a people which lost one third of its sons and daughters. Distinguished audience, even the wildest of imaginations could not have foreseen a course of events in which an ancient people returned from years of exile and rebuilt its historic homeland. A wild imagination could neither have foreseen such a convoluted historic course of events in which an utterly torn and bleeding continent, awash with the blood of war and strife, would have paved the way to a joint European parliament. And yes, no less important are the solid, steadfast ties created between us: ties embodied today in a wide array of joint ventures and cooperation, in research and innovation, in health and the environment, education and culture and many more areas. Regardless of the perspective from which we look at this – our past, our present or the future we are awaiting – we intrinsically linked, Israel and Europe, in an unbreakable bond. Just as humanity could not be what it is without Europe, so Europe could not be what it is without the Jewish People. It would be difficult to imagine what humanity would have been like without Plato, Thomas Aquinas, Galileo Galilei, Martin Luther or Marie Curie, just as it would be difficult to imagine what Europe would be without Maimonides, Spinoza, Freud or Einstein. Our common interests – and, moreover, our common values – dictate our present and shape our future. Liberty, equality, justice, pluralism and religious tolerance, democracy: these are the basic tenets inscribed in Israel’s Declaration of Independence. These are the constitutive values of the European Union. The European Union, and within it this distinguished Parliament, is an audacious endeavour of politics and statehood. Tomorrow this endeavour will be put to a complex test in the United Kingdom, while, day in day out, it stands the test of refugees and migration on a historic scale. The State of Israel too is an audacious endeavour of statehood, of a people returning to its land after two thousand years of exile. And, just like you, Israel faces difficult and complex challenges. But unlike Europe, which embarked upon a process of removing partitions between nations and states, Israel wishes, and indeed must, remain first and foremost a national homeland, a safe haven for the Jewish People. The State of Israel is by no means a compensation for the Holocaust, but the Holocaust has posited as a basic tenet the necessity and vitality of the return of the Jewish People to history, as a nation taking its fate in its own hands. I feel that the massive criticism aimed at Israel in Europe stems from, inter alia, a misunderstanding and an impatience toward this existential need of the Jewish nation and the State of Israel. On the other hand, and much to my regret, Israel has a growing sense of impatience when it comes to Europe. There are those who feel anger and frustration toward certain European actions, vis-à-vis what they perceive as sometimes unfair criticism, sometimes even contaminated by elements of condescension and, some would say, double standards. My European friends, we cannot agree on everything, but, as friends and as true allies, I call upon you and ask you: let us be patient. Please respect the Israeli considerations, even when different from your own. Respect Israel’s sovereignty and the democratic process of its decision-making. Respect Israel’s staunch commitment, indeed its very duty, to protect its citizens. For us it is the most sacred commandment of all. A few years ago, a French friend turned to me and said: ‘If we and the Germans have made peace and put an end to conflict once and for all – and, believe me, what happened between us and them overshadows any other conflict I can think of – then there is no reason for you not to succeed.’ He continued: ‘How long have you and the Arabs been fighting, all in all? One hundred years? Fifty years? We have been fighting for a thousand years, and now it is over, forever.’ This is what he said to me. I am standing here today and saying in no uncertain manner: from 1993, the year in which the Oslo Accords were signed, the elected Israeli leadership has been – as it still is – in support of the solution of ‘two-states for two peoples’. Furthermore, being well versed in the Israeli Parliament, I know that any political agreement brought before the Israeli Knesset by an elected government will be approved. Nevertheless, and with all the difficulty and pain involved, we must look reality straight in the eye and tell the truth. Currently the practical conditions, the political and regional circumstances, which would enable us to reach a permanent agreement between us – the Israelis and the Palestinians – are failing to materialise. First, in order to achieve a comprehensive permanent agreement, an effective leadership is required. However, the Palestinian leadership today is divided in (at least) two: the Palestinian Authority ruling over Judea and Samaria and, on the other hand, Hamas, which rules Gaza and is ideologically committed – in both its political and its military leadership – to the annihilation of Israel. Second, in order to achieve a stable and viable agreement, a reasonable regional and economic infrastructure is required. But we are living in a reality where the plague of murderous Jihadi fundamentalism, religious fanaticism and incitement – embodied in the Islamic State and Hezbollah – are at our very borders and have not missed out Gaza and the West Bank either. We live in a reality of a chaos-stricken Middle East in which uncertainty is the only certainty. To this worrisome picture, add the dire economic straits, poverty and lack of infrastructure in Gaza and Judea and Samaria, which in turn will continue the destabilisation and nurture violence. In this respect, Israel is making, and will continue to make, vast efforts: more than any other actor in the region, and even at the price of complex security risk-taking. But Israeli intervention alone will not suffice. Finally, one should bear in mind the most fundamental trait of Israeli-Palestinian relations today, which is, to my deep regret, a total lack of trust between the parties on all levels; between the leaderships and the peoples. I am afraid that, for years, the international community has been acting as a mediator between the parties based on one inflexible paradigm, that of striving to renew negotiations toward a permanent agreement. This paradigm leads to a dichotomy: ‘Two states or a bi-national state’, ‘All or nothing’, ‘Here and now or nevermore’. It is, by the way, by virtue of that same paradigm that various European states opposed the peace agreement between Israel and Egypt, claiming that it does not provide a solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Had that concept been accepted then, imagine where we would be today. This paradigm relies on the assumption that the problem which is the crux of the matter in this bloody and painful conflict is simply the lack of good faith on both sides, and that, if only pressure is exerted on ‘them’ and on ‘us’, they will adhere to a permanent agreement and to a state of peace. However, as years go by and rounds of negotiations fail one by one, bringing in their wake waves of murderous violence and terror, it seems that this assumption of a ‘lack of good will’ is proving not only to be fundamentally erroneous but also to ignore the circumstances, the capabilities, and the present situation on the ground. And that, by definition, would lead to the failure of any attempt to negotiate a permanent agreement. Ladies and gentlemen, I speak before you today in the name of the citizens of Israel, grandfathers and grandmothers, fathers and mothers, sick and tired of this bloody vicious cycle which soaks up the blood of our loved ones, the blood of our sons and daughters. I speak before you in the name of these young men and women who wish to live in their country, and not die in their homeland. I speak to you today in the name of a nation that abhors war and desires life and peace. And, I must say, one cannot hope to achieve better results while resorting to the same outlooks and tools that have previously failed time after time. The French initiative, adopted by the EU institutions only a few days ago, suffers from those very fundamental faults. The attempt to return to negotiations for negotiations’ sake not only does not bring us near the long-awaited solution, but rather drags us further away from it. This striving for a permanent agreement ‘now’, is the chronicle of a predictable failure, which will only push the two peoples deeper into despair. This despair is the hottest bed for extremism, and undermines the endeavours of moderates. And this despair, ladies and gentlemen, today seizes not just members of my generation but also boys and girls growing up in this part of the world, whose worldview and awareness are shaped by the violent present. This despair is the gravest danger looming over us, Israelis and Palestinians alike. If the international community really wishes and truly aspires to be a constructive player, it must divert its efforts away from the renewal of negotiations for negotiations’ sake, and toward building trust between the parties and creating the necessary terms for the success of negotiations in the future. In the current circumstances, we must all ask ourselves ‘What can be done today?’ rather than ‘What cannot be done?’ And things can be done. This mission of creating the terms for a future agreement, creating an infrastructure for trust, and for a life of dignity for both peoples, demands of us today – the international community and Israel alike – that we invest tremendous efforts in four main avenues. The first is harnessing the moderate powers in the region. The cooperation with Jordan and Egypt is a supreme common interest of Israel and the international community as well, with the aim of preventing military build-ups beyond our borders, and in order to eradicate extremism and preserve the stability of the region. Similarly, the involvement and effective guaranties of friendly states in the region may also reduce the violent friction and serve as a warranty for future action. The second avenue is developing Palestinian economy and infrastructures for quality of life. One cannot speak about a future agreement when people live with a basic existential feeling of having no future, no opportunities, no hope and no horizon. With the backdrop of economic difficulties in Judea and Samaria, and the situation in Gaza, a broad economic course of action is called for. Infrastructures must be developed – gas, electricity, water, sewerage and housing – in Gaza and Judea and Samaria. At the same time, a solution must be found to the human tragedy in Gaza – whereby around 1.5 million Palestinians are held hostage by a Jihadist terrorist organisation, Hamas – just as solutions must be found to the movement of residents, the transfer of trade and the enabling the appropriate security. On this issue, the State of Israel has repeatedly stated its willingness to join hands with the international community in a joint endeavour. Israel considers the rehabilitation of Gaza and the economic development and equalising of standards of life on both the Palestinian and Israeli sides to be both an ethical and a security interest. Sources of livelihood and employment must be developed too, as Israeli and international companies that identify the potential of investing in the human capital between the Jordan and the sea, have already begun to do. The development of a stable Palestinian economy must be carried out, laying the emphasis on developing a real, independent and vital private sector as a stabilising factor free of political interests. Furthermore, developing the economy must take into account the need for developing infrastructures for quality of life, for a life of dignity and wellbeing. Rawabi, the first planned Palestinian city ever built in the Palestinian Authority, is a model of the power and significance of basic wellbeing in creating a breathing space and a feeling of movement and progress.  The third avenue is investing in joint ventures aimed at creating joint interests. Whether we wish it or not, we – Israelis and Palestinians – share a small and common area, with common regional resources and assets, and common regional challenges. Together, we live on what is equal to one third of Austria. In such small and crowded space, creating common interests is a crucial factor in strengthening stability, and in creating the terms needed to replace the next war with programmes benefiting both parties. We should foster and promote joint Israeli-Palestinian development ventures in the fields of renewable energy, infrastructure and the environment, joint industrial and tourism ventures and cultural and social ventures: between Israeli and Palestinian local authorities, and between private corporations and business people on both sides. For instance, the ecological park being developed through cooperation between the regional council of Gilboa and the Palestinian city of Jenin, with the support of the international community, in which the shared Kishon River is undergoing cleaning and purification processes, with the aim of providing a solution to one of the most complex issues of the conflict – the water problem. You, ladies and gentlemen, know better than I do how joint ventures create a horizon for another reality. Fourthly and ultimately there is the avenue of education. Increasing stability, developing infrastructures and strategic terms are essential conditions, but are not enough. Creating the conditions for any future agreement requires conditioning hearts on both sides for the possibility of living with mutual respect. Peace is made between leaders but peace is also made between peoples. Changing present trends requires addressing deep-rooted hatred and fear. Otherwise fear will have the upper hand, if only because it is, to our regret, much more tangible than hope. Building trust demands an investment in the creation of wide channels of communication, not only in security contexts but also in academic, cultural, and governance contexts – and, at the same time, educating future generations to become acquainted with our neighbours, their culture and language. Distinguished audience, the State of Israel values the efforts invested by the international community in general, and by the European Union in particular, in seeking a peaceful future between the parties. The responsibility for building trust between us and our neighbours rests, first and foremost, on the shoulders of the two parties. But if Europe is interested in serving as a constructive factor in striving for a future agreement it will be incumbent upon you, its leaders, to focus efforts at this time in a patient and methodical building of trust: not through divestments, but through investment; not by boycotts, but by cooperation. It is no easy task for me to stand here before you today and say that, at this time, a permanent agreement for peace between us and the Palestinians cannot be achieved – because, first and foremost, I stand before the Israeli people, before my children and grandchildren, before the Israeli and Palestinian children wherever they are. It is to them that I and we, and all of us, are to be held accountable: to ask ourselves what we have actually done to promise them, someday, another future? I believe in the capability of both these peoples to live with each other, for the simple reason that we have no other choice. If we desire life, we must, today, invest our utmost efforts in what can be achieved, not in that which cannot – for the sake of our future, and that of our children. I would like to thank my friend, the President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, for the invitation to come here, in the same week as the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. There can be no substitute for direct and joint conversation. In this act you have taken a step, albeit small, to bolster trust between the parties. Distinguished audience, 100 years ago the thought of a joint European Parliament was inconceivable. Cooperation in the fields of electricity, gas and coal started this miracle of a Europe living in peace with itself. Small steps created a great reality. Help us step forward, step together with us, for the sake of the possibility that one day, an Israeli President will tell another world leader: ‘If we and the Palestinians have made peace and put an end to conflict once and for all, there is really no reason whatsoever that you cannot succeed. We fought for many dozens of years and now it is over, forever.’ On behalf of the people in Israel, I wish all Europe’s Muslims, and the Muslim believers throughout the entire world, Ramadan Karim, Kul Am Wa Antum Bikhair. Ladies and gentlemen, ‘Pray for the peace of Jerusalem, may all who love her prosper. Peace be within thy walls and prosperity within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions’ sake, I will now say, Peace be within thee.’ (Psalm 122, 6-8). God bless you all.

That is why what was already announced here in the European Parliament in 1988 was in a way announced by Pope John Paul II, who said at the time: \"May Europe breathe again with two lungs.\"  And one more thing.

It is an honour and a pleasure to remind you that Slovenia celebrates this week 25 years of its independence. 25 years ago, on the basis of a plebiscite and democratically expressed will, we realised the dream of the Slovenian people of our own and democratic state. Let me also remind you of the tragic fact that the proclamation of independence in June 1991 was followed by an attack by the Yugoslav People's Army on Slovenia, even though the Yugoslav Constitution guaranteed us the right to self-decision and secession. Because we were ready, we won the war for Slovenia and brought down our part of the Iron Curtain with a united Europe. At that time, the European and global democratic public sided with Slovenia and supported the process of international recognition of the new country. A key seal for this process was given by the European Community by the recognition of Slovenia on 15 January 1992. I would like to express my special thanks to those who understood and supported us at the time, thus supporting the European perspective of Slovenia.

We are all aware of the shocking violence which has been reported since last autumn, especially in North Kivu. Some localities have been especially badly affected. The number of dead in Beni territory alone is estimated by civil society sources at over 550 since September 2014. In addition, tens of thousands of people have been displaced. Naturally, the EU’s immediate priority is humanitarian access, and we call once again for a stop to the targeting and kidnapping of humanitarian workers. I recall, of course, that when serving the needs of afflicted populations, the European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) acts in accordance with the principles laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/96, notably those of impartiality and non-discrimination.  The recent violence has been made possible by an ongoing absence of state control. Institutions and services to deal with the prevention and elimination of violence, and legal action against those responsible, are missing. Regrettably, state-building activities in DRC are also held back by the current uncertainty over the organisation of elections, which are due this year under the constitution. Another aspect which continues to be relevant is the exploitation by armed groups of both wildlife and mineral natural resources. The recent report by the United Nations group of experts on the DRC underlines the ongoing involvement of the Lord’s Resistance Army in poaching, and also draws particular attention to the laundering by armed groups of gold into the supply chain and onto the international market. It is of some consolation that armed groups have had fewer opportunities to benefit from illegal involvement in tin, tungsten and tantalum, thanks to due diligence and traceability systems.  The EU will continue its effort to address the natural resources dimension of the Great Lake region stabilisation effort. While understanding the root causes of violence and instability is important, it does not excuse perpetrators, who must submit to the rule of law. This applies equally to incitement of violence and hate speech. It is individuals, not entire communities or ethnic groups, who must account for their actions. As has been stated many times before in this House, the activities of armed groups in eastern DRC are an affront to citizens, undermining their human and legal rights, holding back development, destroying peace of mind and, in short, making it difficult to plan ahead or to think of the future. For armed groups to be put out of action, an effective and operational level of cooperation between the Congolese Armed Forces and the UN Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Monusco) is needed, and it is needed quickly. An agreement in principle was realised in February, but it needs to be put into practice. The justice angle is also important. As a supporter of both civil and military justice reform in DRC, the EU insists that those found to be assisting or conspiring with armed groups must be prosecuted. As regards serious atrocities committed in eastern DRC, we encourage the exploration of all legal options for the investigation and prosecution of those crimes. The primary responsibility for investigating and prosecuting lies with the state where the crime took place or the state where the perpetrator is a national. The EU will continue to offer assistance to the DRC to assure structures are established and backed up with strong legislative frameworks in order to enable this.  I want to turn now to the broader but critical issue of governance. With elections due in only a few months, DRC finds itself at a key moment. UN Security Council Resolution 2277 (2016) is a starting point for all of us. This resolution was adopted unanimously in March. It underlines the primary responsibility of the DRC authorities to prepare and organise elections in respect of their relevant constitutional provisions. Naturally, the EU has noted the decision of the Constitutional Court of the DRC in May this year. The EU also fully respects the sovereignty of the DRC. At the same time, and within the framework not only of the Cotonou Agreement but also the African Union Charter of democracy elections and governance, we underline that a democratic government builds its legitimacy on regular elections within the deadline set out in the constitution. To achieve a consensus leading to elections, a political dialogue is urgently needed, but time is of the essence and the dialogue should be focused. All representative political actors should be involved. Such a dialogue can produce, as its main deliverable, a clear road map, based on a calendar and financing plan, for what needs to be done to deliver elections respecting the constitution. In this context, the EU, together with the UN, the AU and the OIF, again repeated on 6 June 2016 its support for the mission of His Excellency Edem Kodjo, the EU facilitator supported by the United Nations, to implement a successful dialogue. Let me end by saying that successful elections will depend not only on technicalities, but also on their achieving the right climate in terms of respect for rights and freedoms. Freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are the cornerstones of any democratic society. Ensuring and protecting an open political space are essential to allowing the political dialogue I have mentioned earlier to take place.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2016-06-22.json", "name": "Mariya Gabriel", "mepid": "96848", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Mr President, Commissioner, I may try to start with the words 'democratisation' and 'democratic process' when talking about the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), unfortunately the words that come to mind are 'fragility', 'volatility' and this leads to vigilance and responsibility. First, we must condemn the massacres in eastern DRC as such, but also place them in a more general context. I would like to emphasize three things. First, all light must be shed on the massacres committed in eastern DRC, and their perpetrators must be brought to justice. There is an urgent need for renewed cooperation between the DRC's armed forces and Monusco's full use of its expanded mandate. As for the Union, we must not lose sight of the fight against impunity and ensure that security sector reforms finally lead to results. Let us also stand firm on the necessary results in the justice system. Second, with regard to the electoral process, let us ensure that the deterioration of the security environment is not used to further challenge the electoral process, which should be conducted directly and vice versa. In the crisis of legitimacy of power that followed the 2011 elections, any event is essential. In this context, the holding of a genuine dialogue between opposition and the government must also not omit the essential role of civil society, because the political blockade of the country has direct consequences on the citizens. We are waiting for a clear statement from the CENI on the election deadlines, the files that should not exclude young people, and the budget. Finally, the African Union has an important role to play, and I am referring in particular to the role of the Ombudsman Mr Kodjo. The European Union and the rest of the international community have already expressed their support for this mediation. We now need a more active presence in the public space. Every word weighs. In addition, the African Union must remind all stakeholders of their commitments in the Addis Ababa Framework Agreement for Peace and Security in the Great Lakes Region.

If we did a cold calculation, we'd talk about 300,000 deaths a year, 800 deaths a day, and these experts talk about low voltage. I think that instead of saying 'low voltage' we should say 'low attention', that is, little attention from the international community to a tragedy that is of appalling proportions. That is why we are addressing above all the High Representative Federica Mogherini, who I know and know is sensitive to these issues.

Words from British journalist Tim Butcher who knows the country through and through and describes it in his book as the broken heart of Africa. I reread an interview from a few years ago in which he complains that there is so little attention to Congo and in which he describes the political elite there as predators. Unfortunately, the message is still up-to-date. The east of drc is today again a humanitarian battlefield. Villagers are slaughtered with machetes, women are raped, children kidnapped, houses looted. And President Kabila doesn't seem to be awake to that. He's busy securing his power. It has only been three months since we denounced the political and human rights situation in Congo, but not a millimetre of progress has been made in the meantime. On the contrary, the bogus trial of opposition leader and presidential candidate Katumbi shows that DRC is sinking further into a political crisis. We have a duty to use all possible tools to avoid another bloody civil war. We must not lose sight of the fact that the crisis has a regional dimension and is about raw materials, about minerals. The Commissioner said it. \"Congo's greatest curse is its wealth,\" Tim Butcher rightly says in the same interview. It is a step forward that the EU recognises the trade in minerals as one of the causes of the conflict. From now on, companies that import certain raw materials must be able to demonstrate that they do not indirectly contribute to violence. But we need to do more.

Mr President, we support this resolution which aims to put an end to the indifference and drama that regularly occurs in north-eastern Congo. The five groups that signed it call for diplomacy, DRC politicians, and conflicting parties to end the barbarity of civilians and, first and foremost, women and children.  Yesterday's ruling by the International Criminal Court in The Hague in the Bemba case justifies that we also call on all those responsible to gather sufficient evidence to bring to international justice the real perpetrators of the massacres in question. The united Nations Security Council should therefore address recent events in North Kivu, including the extent to which Monusco could help to better restore a situation that respects the rights of the most basic civilian populations.

Military solutions bring more death, more pain and more violence to the population.

We call for the dismantling and withdrawal of Africom. The European Union should also launch an independent investigation into the role of European multinationals in violating social and environmental rights and also their ties to the financing of armed groups in order to continue the exploitation of the Congolese subsoil. The Deputy Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme in 2015 stated that 2% of the annual benefits of exploiting natural resources went to finance these internal armed groups. We also believe that non-interference and sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of the Congo must be ensured. And, Commissioner, respecting this political sovereignty means that people can benefit from their natural resources, for which it is necessary to establish control over the activities of multinationals by reviewing and repealing all mining and forestry contracts, as well as respecting the right to food sovereignty and debt cancellation, which, we understand, are essential measures to meet the most basic and urgent needs of the population.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 10, "date": "2016-06-22.json", "name": "Jordi Sebastià", "mepid": "125053", "text": "  verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, we meet again here in this House to condemn a terrible situation in Congo — in this case, the massacres in the eastern part — and the representative of the Commission will understand that we are feeling a little frustrated, because we have not long ago approved another and yet it seems that this has no impact on the terrible situation in a large part of the people of Congo.  We welcome this Joint Resolution; a resolution that we signed for the sake of consensus, but which we would have liked to make somewhere more forceful, especially when we criticize the role that the Monusco is playing— the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo — a mission that has been accused by independent actors of passivity, of not playing the role it has assigned, which is to defend the civilian population precisely against these massacres.  We hope that this investigation that we are also asking for in this Resolution will be carried out and that it will be clarified exactly whether the mission is not being fulfilled and who is responsible.

And, there, the Commission has a role to play, because European companies have a lot of responsibility for this and it would be important if we went beyond the declarations and took active sanctions, research measures, to know which European multinationals are involved in that trade which, in the end, is the last justification for the terrible situation that this territory is experiencing.

May I recall that, while Laurent-Desiré Kabila invaded the country, a number of companies were signing contracts. They were American companies. May I also recall that when Laurent-Desiré Kabila turned around as a patriot for his country, it was decided here in Brussels - I had the information, I can say of whom because he has since died - of his elimination and we also went to Washington to seek order. And he was eliminated a fortnight later! May I also recall that then we went to get Joseph Kabila and said that we would manipulate this young man because he was a Rwandan national, and that we were going to make him a president.

To top it all off, a yellow fever epidemic has also broken out, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in the country. In the east of the country, however, fighting between government forces and armed so-called rebels has resumed in intensity and cruelty. The main reason for this is and remains the struggle for access to valuable minerals such as gold, tin, cobalt and tantalum, which are extracted in this region. Some people who live there are expelled and murdered or forced into forced labour. The EU, including this Parliament, could have set an important signal with the new regulation on the import and use of these minerals from conflict zones.

Once more, innocent people have become victims of an act of terrorism in a place no one expected. Of course, we have seen this kind of horrendous violence before in our European cities, in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Tunisia, the United States, the Middle East and all over the world. It is a most distressing fact that these attacks were aimed at innocent civilians while they were having a drink in their neighbourhood bar, ready to go on a well-deserved holiday, buying their daily groceries, when they were at home with their family. The attack against a nightclub bringing together homosexuals was the last shocking event that took place in the United States. Another worrying fact is that most of these atrocities were executed by citizens who grew up in our own cities, among us, in our midst, sometimes in a process of self-radicalisation. We are faced with individuals who turned their back on our societies and the universal values of freedom, equality and free speech. It is no use talking only about foreign terrorist fighters. Foreign is now also in our own society, and if we truly want to stop terrorism in its tracks we need to show persons on the brink of radicalisation that their society, our society, offers better alternatives. So we are faced with a tremendous task to step up our efforts to prevent radicalisation, to counter violent extremism, to stop hate speech and fight discrimination. Of course we are fully committed to that cause. The European Union, its Member States, we are engaged in a balancing act between repression and prevention and to ensure that we understand really what is going on. The Heads of State and Government already highlighted the importance of preventing radicalisation and safeguarding our values in their statements of February 2015. Since then the European Union has not been sitting on its hands, how could we? We are currently implementing a range of measures to prevent radicalisation with a specific focus on detecting and removing internet content promoting terrorism, for instance. Let me give you a number of examples. The Europol Internet Referral Unit works together with internet companies to remove terrorist material from the internet, very important. Second, the European Union Internet Forum facilitates a dialogue with the private sector to combat illegal online hate speech. I think we cannot do without this cooperation of all actors, including the private sector. Certainly we work on the development of communication strategies to promote tolerance, non-discrimination, fundamental freedoms and solidarity throughout the Union. Then we have the Radicalisation Awareness Network supporting Member States with expertise and helping them to develop prevention programmes. We have the Syria Strategic Communication Advisory Team which is helping, assisting, working with Member States, to develop counter narratives against Da’esh. Another example that the EU is working on is rehabilitation for foreign fighter returnees and the prevention of radicalisation in prisons. A ministerial conference took place in October 2015 and is now being followed up with the support of funding from the Commission. Next to countering the hateful narratives of extremists, our efforts on prevention are also directed at strengthening the resilience of our communities. Maybe that is even the most important. That requires a much more holistic but at the same time effective approach involving different policy areas and many different actors. Educational citizenship, universal values and mutual respect must start at an early stage. Our young people are the ones most vulnerable and the ones who need to stay on board and it is our responsibility to give them the civic, social and cultural competence they need in our societies. This was also underlined in a joint declaration of the EU Ministers for Education and yourself, Mr Commissioner. Very important, building on this declaration, the Council adopted conclusions on developing media literacy and critical thinking and the role of youth policy in the fight against radicalisation. Following the first fundamental rights colloquium last year the Commission has appointed coordinators on anti-Islam hatred, on anti-Semitism and on tolerance to engage with all the relevant stakeholders. An advisor on religious freedom has also been appointed. Also, this is important in the context of promoting intra- and interfaith dialogue. Honourable Members, terrorism is in nature global and it does not stop at the EU borders. In complementarity with the work we are doing within the European Union, there is of course a continuous need to work together with our international partners to combat and prevent radicalism and terrorism. Let me give you also a few examples of our activities. In the Middle East and North Africa the European Union is supporting several projects on prevention of radicalisation, countering terrorism financing and working on judicial capacity. The European Union has developed on the Slovenian lead a so-called Western Balkans Counterterrorism Initiative and we also work with the Radicalisation Awareness Network in third countries like Tunisia, like Turkey, with first-line practitioners to prevent radicalisation. Also the global Counterterrorism Forum is an excellent example of a multilateral effort of countries around the world coming together and joining their efforts to combat and prevent terrorism in a very concrete plan of action. We have expended the network of our security and CT experts in the European Union delegations to work in the field and with civil society on preventing radicalisation and countering threats of terrorism. So, to summarise, combating and preventing terrorism is at the top of the European agenda. We are and we will remain fully committed to preventing radicalisation, countering violent extremism, stopping hate speech and fighting discrimination. I know there is a very strong will also among you and in this Parliament to make progress on de-radicalisation and countering violent extremism measures. We welcome in particular your Resolution of November 2015 as an important contribution. We share this determination and we look forward to working with you in order to advance as quickly as we can.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 37, "date": "2016-06-22.json", "name": "Tibor Navracsics", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, the recent horrendous attacks in Europe remind us that terrorism is global and yet extremely local, as a majority of recent perpetrators have been our own citizens: born and raised on our territories, educated in our schools, now radicalised and inspired by an ideology of destruction, given into propaganda of hate and turning against their own fellow citizens and our common values. The fact that these Europeans were radicalised into violent extremism on our soil says something about the social fabric of our societies and the need to strengthen its resilience. Our response needs to be holistic. This is the approach you expressed in the reports prepared by your colleagues Julia Ward and Rachida Dati, and we have taken in our most recent communication on supporting the prevention of radicalisation leading to violent extremism. It is part of our larger Commission effort to implement the European agenda on security and it builds on existing capabilities and efforts. We have put forward an ambitious set of initiatives ranging from research and evidence-building to countering terrorist propaganda and hate speech online, addressing prison radicalistion, promoting inclusive education and reaching out to young people in general. And since violent extremism has no borders and several third countries face very similar challenges, we also foresaw measures to support third countries in their endeavour. We have several operational as well as security tools at hand. While prevention has to be our first priority, our security approach needs to be reinforced at the same time. We need to enhance our capability to disrupt terrorist activity, stem the flow of finance, prevent access to weapons and disrupt terrorist travel. Those returning to Europe from conflict areas are a particular concern. That is why we will propose a review of the Schengen Information System and why we have proposed systematic checks at the external borders for everyone entering and exiting the EU whether they are EU or non-EU citizens. Then there is the internet, which certainly appears to be accelerating the radicalisation process and where our young people are exposed to the poisonous and barbaric rhetoric of violent extremists. Recent investigations also demonstrate how the internet is playing a more prominent role in attacks themselves. This is precisely why we launched the EU Internet Forum in December 2015. We brought together ministers, Europol and high-level representatives of major internet companies. We agreed on two key objectives: that we must reduce accessibility to terrorist content online; and that we must empower civil society partners to increase the volume of positive alternative narratives online. In addressing the first objective an Internet Referral Unit has been established at Europol. In addition to providing substantive operational support to Member States, in just under a year it has referred over 8 000 pieces of terrorist content to the companies. In the vast majority of cases the material has been swiftly removed. We are now taking this one step further through a joint referral mechanism which is being developed by the internet companies to improve the speed and volume of referrals and prevent removed material from being re-uploaded elsewhere. In addressing the second objective, namely to create positive alternative narratives to that of the violent and divisive terrorist narrative, we have committed EUR 10 million to help equip civil society partners with the technical skills and training that they require to ensure their voices are seen and heard online. Those efforts start primarily at local level. Police officers, youth counsellors, prison and probation staff, and teachers are the practitioners best placed to identify the early warning signs of radicalisation. But they are also brought together at the European level through the Radicalisation Awareness Network Centre of Excellence. Through this network of networks more than 2 400 local practitioners from all over Europe are working together. We committed a budget of EUR 25 million for the next four years to help the network fulfil its mission, while under our internal security funds over EUR 314 million is available for anti-radicalisation projects for the period 2014-2020. Let me now turn to another key pillar of prevention – education. Education, both inside and outside the classroom, and youth activities in general, are crucial for this comprehensive approach. Education plays a vital role in the socialisation of children, in developing social and emotional skills. Fundamental values can be best internalised from an early age. We need solid foundations which help young people to be resilient against extremist ideologies and violence, and have a common sense of belonging. That is why, in cooperation with France, I called for an extraordinary meeting of the education ministers in Paris in March 2015 and we together adopted the Paris Declaration. On that basis we proposed a series of concrete measures to reach out to teachers, educators, youth workers and, most importantly, young people on the ground. We are working towards a comprehensive policy framework in the form of a Council recommendation to promote inclusion and fundamental values in education. It will offer policymakers and practitioners concrete policy guidance and facilitate mutual learning, building on research evidence of what works. We are mobilising the Erasmus+ programme where we are making available this year EUR 400 million for transnational cooperation projects. Projects aiming at inclusion and fundamental values will be given priority. In addition, with EUR 13 million we will upscale and disseminate successful grassroots initiatives. Horizon 2020 will also be further mobilised to support research into violent radicalisation. Teachers and trainers are key and we will step up our efforts to support them. e-Twinning, the world’s biggest teachers’ network, which is supported by the Erasmus+ programme, enables 300 000 teachers across the EU to run joint projects and link pupils from different countries and backgrounds. We will extend e-Twinning further to selected neighbourhood countries so that pupils and classrooms can better know and understand each other from an early age. We will also set up a network to encourage direct contact between young people and positive role models, for instance, entrepreneurs, artists, sports persons and even formerly radicalised people. They will be selected at local level and invited to visit schools, youth clubs, sports clubs and prisons to share their experiences. Finally, we will set up Erasmus+ virtual exchanges between young people both within and outside the EU. Our aim is to bring 200 000 of them together through structured and moderated online discussions by 2020 to raise empathy and promote intercultural dialogue. Honourable Members, resilience against violent radicalisation will come through a combination of these actions and partners. The Commission is determined to help and support in every way we can in order to find a holistic solution to this urgent challenge we are all faced with. Together with all my fellow Commissioners, I stand ready to work with you in the European Parliament, with Member States and civil society to implement these measures. I trust that I can count on your support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 38, "date": "2016-06-22.json", "name": "Monika Hohlmeier", "mepid": "96780", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. First of all, I would like to thank you for having this debate today, because I believe that the issue of radicalisation and de-radicalisation is one of the important building blocks for reducing terrorism, which is currently occupying the European Union, or perhaps being able to take it away from it altogether. We are currently seeing in the attacks that we are dealing with new forms of radicalisation, in addition to the older forms of radicalisation that are already known. I believe that we need to pay more attention to this. I am thinking of areas that are not discussed so often. For example, in the area of prisons, Member States must take serious measures to prevent radicalisation in prisons, so that those who start with minor crimes do not end up operating as assassins – well recruited by terrorist networks – within the European Union. Secondly, it has also become very clear in recent attacks that we are dealing with new forms of self-radicalisation, that is to say, with people who are given guidance on how to commit the most serious crimes through Internet programmes, which are specifically put online by the ISIS propaganda machine, and accordingly we must both combat this propaganda machine and impose very severe penalties on those who are being punished in a very strict manner. , which are setting this propaganda machine in motion. It is also necessary to offer assistance to those who have already entered the networks and also to delete pages that could encourage young people to participate in such a network, because they are portrayed as heroes there – what we call terrorism in our penal code. Furthermore, it is essential that the new platforms are used for the better. The Internet can be used not only for the negative, but also for the positive. In other words, we must develop a very clear counter-strategy against this kind of propaganda, such as that carried out by ISIS or Al Qaeda. I believe that the Commission has also taken important measures in this regard within the framework of the Internet Referral Unit and within the framework of the EU Internet Forum, and cooperation with private companies in this sector is also extremely important. Furthermore, we must not overlook the fact that IS and other terrorist organisations are also trying to invade the social sphere and to appeal to young people who feel insecure in society, who do not feel accepted or accepted. We must ensure that the Member States offer the better counter-offers or support social organisations in such a way that they can actually offer good opportunities to young people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 39, "date": "2016-06-22.json", "name": "Ana Gomes", "mepid": "28306", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Madam President, in fact, in November, Parliament adopted a report on this subject with concrete measures, alongside cooperation, coordination, information sharing between security and information forces, which pointed precisely to the importance of measures in preventing radicalisation in prisons and in our ghettos, in the Moolenbeeks that go around Europe. But instead, we end up with the European PNR, which has been presented as a magic bullet against terrorism, which is bumpy against charter and private flights, thus illustrating the inconsistency of so-called security policies that do not really provide any security, and I will not even talk about what is going on in terrorist financing.  In addition, we continue to pay the price for Europe's lack of coordination, inaction, contradictions in our foreign policy and contradictions related to our internal security in the face of conflicts: Syria, Iraq, Libya, Turkey, Ukraine and others in our neighbourhood.  Our security depends on ideological and political combat within and outside our borders, but we will not know how to stop it if we continue to leave room for the fascist and Nazi far-right to inflate the winds of xenophobia and hatred against refugees and migrants, and if we continue to deny foreign fighters when they are, in fact, young Europeans, our , born, raised and pushed into small crime and radicalized in our prisons, who have attacked us, as they attack other peoples in the ranks of Daesh, because they fuel resentments against the societies in which they grew up, feeling excluded and discriminated against. It is lacking for our governments, the Council and the Commission to recognise that neoliberal policies have failed miserably and have fostered insecurity and populism in Europe by creating unemployment, ghettos, exclusion, more inequalities and social injustice, creating conditions for Islamic states and groups of fascist Nazi hooligans to recruit our young people and turn them into killer wolves. It is these same policies that have cut back on the capabilities and training of our defence and security forces, which have cut back on the rehabilitation capabilities of our prisons, letting them become centres of radicalisation, and have never, in fact, invested in radicalisation prevention programmes.  Now the Commission is talking about it. Very well! Resources are needed, but also smart social policies, involving municipal structures, schools, clubs, non-governmental organisations, the private sector, and actively involving in this effort families and religious communities, especially European Muslims who suffer the devastating effect of terrorist attack and behaviour.

In the 28 EU Member States, there are estimated to be at least 6 000 radicalised Muslims, according to experts. It is certainly wrong to explain the cause only in the case of social deprivation. The motives are very diverse, including an aversion to the West and wanting to mean something. If such persons resort to violence and want to carry out attacks here, possibly after returning from conflict zones, then the situation becomes critical. We must combat individuals who feel the need to brutally impose a different state model with brute force. And by us, I mean all citizens of goodwill, including right-minded Muslims. Together we must fight for equality between men and women, the rights of gay couples and other values of enlightenment. Moreover, fighting terrorists is not just policing. The RAN anti-radicalisation network, for example, can also provide added value as a European project. This network brings together frontline workers who work every day with radicalised individuals or people with a sensitive profile. Wardens, health professionals and others share their experiences through that network. They have all the crucial information that can help the security services with early detection. For example, an OCMW employee may notice a suspicious home situation during an intake interview. For example, a man who refuses to shake hands with the female employee or teachers who notice that young children are forced to follow Ramadan during weekend classes by imams.

Thank you to the representatives of the Commission and the Council, ladies and gentlemen. I keep Orlando's killer's selfie in the office and they ask me why. I do not want to forget the face of banality and cruelty in these times on the internet. I do not believe that anyone has doubts about the need to impede and stop the capacity for action and expansion of terrorist organizations. However, in order to defeat terrorism and the various violent fanaticisms of these times, prevention is as important as police intelligence or judicial activity. We must be able to effectively challenge a political logic that walks on human suffering and for this the most important thing in the long run is to defuse hatred, dehumanization and the legitimization of cruelty. On the other hand, the ideology that recruits fans also generates other forms of hatred. Therefore, combating crime and achieving prevention is crucial, and it is not easy. Young people need to get ideas that prevent the legitimization of violence against others. They need to prevent the temptation to hate other human groups, whether invented or real; prevent the temptation to see as enemies the neighbors themselves, their own family. In this globalized world, under the domain of communication technologies, our way of perceiving reality has changed. Especially the new generations must develop a vision of their own but coherent of what the dignity and humanity of each person means. That is why we welcome the Commission's new measures, as the European Union strategy adopted in 2005 had become obsolete and European jihadists are statistically overrepresented among those who will train from anywhere in the world.

Even more damaging is to respond with increasingly guarded democracies, islamophobia and wars to violence that is not warlike, but linked to individual or social uprooting that is difficult to decipher. Joe Cox's murder is reminiscent of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914: the shooting of a multi-ethnic empire does not fall from the sky, it is the result of decades of political desertion of the elites.

But also about Mrs Jo Cox, who, before she became an MEP, worked here in this House, was one of us, so to speak, and who was also brutally murdered, also recently, about the police couple in France – all those we thought of today at the beginning of this sitting. How can it be that people develop such hatred and go somewhere and shoot or stab people who simply represent other values that stand up for diversity, for equal rights – whether it is migrants and migrants, no matter what their skin color, no matter what sexual orientation – people who simply rejoice in their lives, their love, as in Orlando in the lesbian and gay bar? This was a clearly homophobic attack under the name of ISIS. Today, it is a question of how we can prevent people who become radicalised from becoming violent extremists. On the one hand, this requires education, employment and inclusion, because quite often the causes are that there is no meaning in life, no work, no job, no hope. To give people opportunities and joy in life again, the feeling that I can do something in my life, that is necessary. And a second thing – and this has already been mentioned in part: working in youth centres, in schools, but also in prisons, where young people often come because of minor or major offences and there is a risk that they will become radicalised and then become violent. I would like to briefly mention two examples that do just that: the 2015 European Citizens' Prize was won for Austria by the Network of Social Cohesion, whose staff go to prisons and work successfully there to de-radicalise young people, young people, but also older people. And another example, very topical: Yesterday in Molenbeek there was a meeting between a martial arts centre from Vienna with martial arts champions and people from Molenbeek. They were invited to show here what they are doing in the centre in Vienna. Martial arts, which very often attracts young people who want to let off steam, so to speak – new things are created in this environment. This must be encouraged, these are positive examples.

But much more urgent is to talk about why the problem has arisen. I would like to begin by criticising the Commission, which in 2014-2015 allowed millions of migrants to enter the EU without, in principle, having any control at all on who climbed European soil. It is no secret that many jihadists came with the refugee boats; We have seen a lot of evidence of this. Thousands of jihadists are already in europe today, as far as we know, and there are certainly many more that we do not know about. We have heard of mobilisation of sleeping cells, which seem to wake up a bit here and there. And given that many of this scum is entering European soil, it is not surprising that they are trying to attract new murderers in our Member States. Moreover, many go from Europe to fight for Islamism; only in the last week we have heard reports of many who have joined the terror network. Soon, the leaders will certainly order the Member States to reopen their borders. What happens then? I think it is a good thing that an EU directive is being drawn up specifically aimed at stopping terrorism, instead of stupid proposals such as banning the possession of weapons for hunters and marksmen.

Despite the so-called high alert levels, it is still possible to fly to Brussels without being checked, as I myself saw last week. The same goes for national border controls that still do not exist. In short, jihadist terrorists can move peacefully in this beautiful Europe.  To overcome the threat, one must first have the courage to name it.

Madam President, one of the most serious problems plaguing European societies is the radicalisation of young people, i.e. their tendency to violently subvert existing data in order to solve problems. However, this problem is being addressed incorrectly. Instead of giving education to young people, teaching them the history, religion, culture, principles and values of their countries, we tolerate economic impoverishment and the destruction of the middle class, which takes us back sixty years, so education was a privilege only for the rich.  The harsh austerity measures imposed in many countries, especially Greece, force many children to leave school and, in a state of unemployment, to try to find any job in order to survive. But in this way young people are isolated, marginalised, unhappy and hate society, which has deprived them of all hope for the future. Thus, they easily become victims of extremist propaganda, especially fanatical Islamism and terrorism. Some countries also violate basic principles of democracy.

One of the hardest lessons learned from the attacks in Europe was that our information-sharing capabilities are still not being fully utilised. Europe cannot afford to play catch-up. Radicalisation, whether online or on land, is one of the toughest challenges our enforcement agencies face. We need Europol to have the resources it needs, and we need to come down harder on those who preach hate and use religion as a disguise for their message of evil. It is not only law enforcement. We also need a new approach to integration in our societies, where we see this as a two-way process of respect for people’s rights but also respect for European values. Work to overcome obstacles to revoking passports of so-called ‘foreign fighters’ – particularly dual nationals who travel to conflict zones before coming back to Europe to radicalise and recruit – must continue. They do not deserve any protection an EU passport may give them. If the horrific attack in Orlando showed anything it is that terrorism knows no borders, no nations. It is a global struggle that requires a global partnership for its defeat. Notwithstanding the horror of the crime in Florida, the worst of times brought out the best in people who stood up, scared but undeterred, and shouted that while today we mourn, in the end, love always wins over hate, and those voices echoed around the world.

This is already partly demonstrated in the attitudes of certain groups towards LGBTI people, immigrants, refugees, individual religious groups, Roma, people with disabilities, etc.  In order to prevent radicalisation, the first focus should be paid to addressing the causes of them and tackling the socio-economic situation and, secondly, dialogue with citizens and the fight against hate speech – especially online.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue we are dealing with today, once again, depends on the strikes, the terrorist attacks that are taking place in Europe and around the world. The latest research in Europe has shown a dramatic increase in crime among adolescents and young people. It should concern us because it is happening; Young people, when they have no hope, they have no jobs, they have no perspective, they pre-print criminals and they feel heroes when they provoke hatred and panic.  We should be concerned about how this phenomenon develops, where young people are radicalised. One way is prisons, detention centres, where, to a large extent, only correction is not done and another route is the Internet, where unfortunately the roads are uncontrolled, so far uncontrolled controls and the ways in which these people evolve en masse, arm themselves with hatred and turn against society.  Friends and friends, the answer to these people, who want to cause the death of their fellow human beings, to those people who are being condemned by hatred and anger, is more humanism, more solidarity, finally taking responsibility from all of us, leading to a better Europe.  I would like to share with you the experience of a rhetoric that needs to change in this Chamber: \"There are no innocent victims.\" All victims of terrorism are innocent. Guilty victims don't exist, and this rhetoric of segregation you realize is arming hands and awakening false morbid consciences that feed the terrorist's hand.

There's a process ahead of that. Radicalisation is taking place in our residential areas. This means that the identification and tackling of it must start at that local level with the local residents, the teachers, the parents, the imams and the youth workers. Not every Muslim who is poor and feels discriminated against becomes a jihadist or a terrorist. The causes of radicalisation are not only socio-economic in nature. Radicalisation is also a religious derailment, and this fact is too often denied in this Parliament. And why is it a European problem and should we in the European Parliament also pay attention to it? In a European Union without internal borders, radicalisation in The Hague, Molenbeek or the banlieues of Paris is a problem for all of us, and with more than 4 000 European jihadists, the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels make it clear that we have a serious problem. It is very important that all Member States dealing with young people who are radicalising actually have and implement a common strategy. It must end with the non-commitment for European governments to tackle radicalisation effectively. At present, European countries are not being economically addressed to this responsibility. The same applies to the exchange of information and intelligence between the national security services. Numerous databases have been set up to ensure that a person who is seen by a country as a danger to society cannot simply travel to another Member State, where he is not in a database. Unfortunately, however, these resources are still under-used and it is proving far too easy for radicalised young people, but also for hate preachers, for example, to travel back and forth between European countries. That is why it is in our common interest that every European country has its deradicalisation programme in order.

Why and how do they get radicalised and, even more important, how can we prevent that radicalisation? However, let us not forget that radicalisation does not come out of the blue, usually it is the result of increasing pressure exerted through siren calls and propaganda instigating hate and praising mass killing as a pressure-release, using in most cases the relative anonymity of the net. Some people, usually from outside our countries, are doing that and we must, apart from countering their narrative and even discrediting it, find those people and deal with them according to our laws. Because letting those people get radicalised and not interfering with that and concentrating our efforts on preventing them from committing the horrible crimes they are determined to commit is not enough. Sooner or later they will find a way. But if we actively engage in dismantling those sources of radicalisation both in mosques and on the net, in cooperation with the Muslim communities themselves, and engage in the active countering of their narratives of hate for a long period to come, then we stand the chance to do away with this phenomenon.

This communication makes it clear that radicalisation is not the result of a single factor. It is a complex phenomenon to which the information society has added even more elements.  We must therefore address this phenomenon in its entirety. That is, looking at prevention, sanctioning and reintegration. But also by developing a set of cross-cutting measures in several areas, and the greater effectiveness of which will be the greater the proximity to citizens: whether by regions, chambers, schools or community centres. In this context, prisons are a central element. We do not want prisons to become either in the universities of crime or in the new centres of radicalisation. We know that these are imminently national competences, but the Union must support measures to prevent the prison system and invest in more successful reintegration. And the Union must also support long-term policies, particularly in the educational field. Of course, radicalisation leading to violent fundamentalism must also be sanctioned, blaming the guilty and deterring potential instigators. The proposed amendment of sis Ii of the Schengen Information System, to be presented at the end of this year, should introduce a set of improvements to enable SIS to contribute to more concerted and effective action by Member States, both at preventive and sanctioning level.

Freedom and the European way of life are threatened by many factors, the so-called hybrid war, the increasingly violent extremists, the precarious security situation with refugees and migrants, radicalisation. Of all of us, terrorism is most at risk – not only imported, but also domestic. Europe is therefore security-vulnerable, living in a security vacuum since the Cold War. It therefore needs a new coherent security strategy, a more efficient use of security and defence potentials, and, above all, more budgetary resources in all Member States. This is not only about investment in security and defence structures, but also in quality education, and other areas that enable better social integration, especially for young people. I congratulate Commissioner Navracsics, who, in the European Commission's statement, has put out concrete measures, also supported by financial resources. It is now the Member States' turn. In the area of security, therefore, the EU will show its effectiveness in breaking up terrorist networks and organisations, 4,000 of them in the European Union, when it more effectively confronts hate propaganda, when it succeeds in protecting its external borders, when it secures peace and security in its neighbourhood, when it broadly set out the concept of deradicalisation in all European societies, not just on the Internet and in prisons.

Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey - countries that profess radical Islam, which pay for Salafist extremist radical organizations. Who's radicalized? Those who have gone to European countries and there have been greeted in the wrong way. They were told: \"Your difference is very valuable. Be different. Stay together, stay where you are.

We cannot give up our way of life, because that would be the same as telling them that they have won this new war which is terrorism.

We must do so without complexes, as the People's Party, which has made the fight against terrorism a priority, contrary to those here in this House seem not to understand that, in terrorism, prevention is very important, but so are security measures, the exchange of information and defending ourselves, by all means permitted by law , of those who only have in mind to take us down.

And it is all these three phenomena that are a great and unpredictable threat to us. In the fight against them, the role of the European Union is important and I am not afraid to say that it is irreplaceable. It's more important than ever. Its task and that of its agencies must be to link the individual Member States, information and components.  Unfortunately, in the past, as we could see in the attacks in Paris or Brussels, it just didn't work. And not only within the European Union itself, but also in cooperation with third countries. Let us connect and cooperate with countries from Africa, work with Turkey, work with other states to combat radicalisation, extremism and violence.  The fight against radicalisation itself is not so simple. In my opinion, this stems mainly from unmanily managed integration and long-term frustration, and from the loss or complete absence of European values. It is therefore extremely important to address these very causes, thus preventing the further spread of radicalism. First of all, we must focus on young people, as my previous leaders from the European People's Party have already said: we have a plan and the European People's Party wants to apply its strategy, which it adopted recently in its meetings.  If the role of the European Union fails here, we will see events in the future, as in previous months, and we will never be able to control radicalisation and the associated terrorism or extremism.

But also give me the opportunity to say this: this is above all an invitation to ourselves and our example that we are setting. I heard a speech earlier from the right about people talking about other people as scum. When such speeches are delivered out of our ranks, this is already the beginning of radicalisation. As politicians, we have to set an example that we want to experience democratic processes and that we accept the opinion of the other in these processes. The freedom of other opinion as a matter of course, without discriminating against the other and attacking them as a personality, is an example that we can give to our society. What is going on these days in political statements, what is going on in the media, is a call for radicalisation in some areas. And I believe that we will only achieve this if we are able to resist it and return to normality in our language. This is a question that we must ask ourselves within Europe, but it is also a question between peoples – and I say this as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. This generalization \"the other people is lazy\", \"they are Muslims, and therefore it is generally a bad thing!\" – this kind of generalization with reproaches transports radicalization into our own society and radicalization between religions, between states and peoples.

Let me just repeat that I am grateful for the Parliament’s and support and for your contribution. I think we share the same objectives in our common fight against radicalisation and violent extremism. We must live up to the expectations of our citizens to improve their safety. Fighting terrorism, preventing radicalisation and increasing the resilience of our societies requires a long-term approach, strong commitment and a sustained effort from the European Union and its Member States. So it is something that we have to do every day. It is work in progress, but we have no time to lose because our enemies are very quickly, if we do not watch out, in front of us.

In the analysis, most of you have mentioned both social as well as religious and criminal sources for this process of a radicalisation, and I think you are right. It is a multi-faceted problem of which you have different characteristics and we have to make sure that we have tailor-made prevention and repressive measures to deal with this very complex issue.

It is, in the end, believing in your values and defending them. What terrorists want is, in the end, to instil fear by violence, and our vulnerability to that fear is the determining factor, and I think that is something that we have to realise every day we are dealing with this issue. With every step we take, every measure we adopt, it is important that we strike the right balance between security on the one hand and protecting our freedoms and the rule of law on the other. That is sometimes a precarious balance, but I think we have kept our values straight, including the rule of law, while being effective in the struggle against radicalisation.

In the college?  I would like to thank the rapporteur, shadow rapporteur and the Committee on Fisheries for all the hard work they have done to enable agreement to be reached for the multiannual plan for the management of the stock of cod, herring and sprout and fisheries in the Baltic Sea. The Baltic plan is the first of its kind; a landmark. It is the first of a new generation of multi-annual plans. These are important tools for the further implementation of our reformed common fisheries policy and for implementing its most ambitious element, the obligation to end wasteful discarding of fish and land all catches.  In addition, these multiannual plans provide an important framework for the development of a more decentralized way of fisheries management, which what we called regionalisation.  With regionalisation in mind, I would also like to take the opportunity to needed to state formally our declaration in relation to regional cooperation. When proposing and adopting delegated acts under their regionalisation provisions of this plan, the Commissioner will comply with the framework set out in the basic regulation, in particular Article 18, and the practice established under the basic regulation implementing the regionalisation process will continue as it has since 2014.  The Baltic plan is the culmination of a process that has involved many players working together to reach consensus across many interests of involved parties. This process has included the Baltic fishing industry and the fishery ministers of concerned countries as well as the legislators of course, and their interests. The outcome is a balanced regulation that has incorporated the key concerns raised throughout the process. The agreement of both legislators has provided the blueprint for this new generation of multi-annual plans. This is very important for other marine regions for which the development of these plans will allow for sustainable long-term management. I will look forward to cooperating with you as we present the next set of proposals for further fisheries management plans for your careful consideration.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 98, "date": "2016-06-22.json", "name": "Jarosław Wałęsa", "mepid": "96774", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, this first fisheries management plan under the new common fisheries policy (CFP) was hard fought and was the result of very difficult, long negotiations, in which Parliament had to make many concessions. We did it in the trust that the provisions included would be enough to uphold sustainable fisheries in the Baltic Sea. This new plan must be put into action as soon as possible for setting total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas for the year 2017. It is crucial that the EU institutions act responsibly and show, now, that commitment to the principles is still alive. Parliament has shown its commitment to sustainable fishing in the EU and to the future of the industry, and I must ask the Commission and the Council to do the same. That is why I have two questions: will the proposals from the Commission for next year’s total allowable catch in the Baltic be based on the scientific advice and the rules established in this new management plan; and is there any scenario where this new management plan and the rules within it to settle catches could not be used? It is crucial to use the new rules immediately, as the scientific advice regarding the western cod stock is very alarming. The stock has been under too much stress for a very long time, and so far the Council has failed to follow the scientific advice. The results of this failure have now led to a piece of advice from the scientists more or less closing this fishery. Luckily, the new Baltic management plan has some new rules in place and safeguards to deal with such situations. After 10 months of difficult negotiations with the Council and the Commission, these negotiations gave us a plan that upholds and respects the objectives of the basic regulations. In the end, this plan will ensure that fishing activities in the Baltic are conducted in a sustainable, reasonable and economically viable way, which will not put unnecessary strain on the environment – and now we will closely monitor the implementation of the plan.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 99, "date": "2016-06-22.json", "name": "Ulrike Rodust", "mepid": "93624", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group.

It took some energy to smooth the waters between the Council and us as a Parliament. Waves that, in my opinion, should not have been so high, would have been adhered to the reform in the same way. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Wasa, for his work and approach. This has led to a sufficient re-enforced of Parliament's position. Parliament, the Commission and the Council did not agree in almost ten months of negotiations, particularly on the determination of fishing mortality. Parliament has entered the negotiations with a clear message: the requirements of the basic regulation must be implemented. The Council rejected this and insisted on flexibility. The result is a compromise. As far as the values for fishing mortality are concerned, we have met the Council. Flexibility now exists under certain conditions. In return, Parliament has insisted on stricter security mechanisms. After a positive vote tomorrow, we believe that this multiannual plan must take effect in determining fishing opportunities in October. This means that the Council will have to carry out formal implementation in the next few days so that this law will appear in the Official Journal by August at the latest. The Baltic Sea Management Plan will immediately have its first baptism of fire. The western cod in the Baltic Sea is doing very badly, and so are the fishermen. Only the new Baltic Sea management plan will be able to help, and it must therefore form the basis for the quota decision in October. In the light of the current situation in the Baltic Sea, I am pleased that we have included in this plan support for a temporary cessation of fishing activities by the EMFF. I see this Baltic Sea plan as a blueprint for sustainable fisheries management. Sustainable in the sense of ecological, economic and social. It is good that, in the current text, we are now setting safe limits, which the fisheries ministers must adhere to. This ensures environmental sustainability.

The main good news is the so-called multi-species management, which takes into account the interactions between different types of fish. That's very good. We all know that there is now an urgent need for the biological restoration of the wealth of the Baltic Sea and that the current system must be effective. Management must be sustainable, based on reliable scientific knowledge. Here are a few of my observations: the need for a regional approach should be taken into account in the formulation of the implementing rules for the plan, that the area closed to fisheries should be maintained in order to protect spawning and fish habitats on the basis of updated scientific knowledge, and that funding sources should be identified in the event of temporary cessation of fishing, if such conservation arrangements apply; fourthly, the so-called feed fishing, i.e. industrial fishing, must be explicitly reduced and fifthly, at least in Poland, if wind farms are to be built in the Baltic Sea, this cannot be done in the places of the best fisheries and spawning grounds and in fish breeding sites.

She was a central figure and a support and a support for me during the crucial negotiations. Vielen Dank!  Why was it so hard? It was difficult for the reason that the Baltic Sea is a difficult inland sea. It is easily soiled, the average depth is smaller than in any other large fishing area, we have a low salinity there and we have many states with different interests along the shores of the Baltic Sea. It was also the first time, and all of us who are reasonably grown up know that the first time is always more difficult than the second time.  So there are different interests, there were technical difficulties and the fish have a strange ability not to always follow our instructions or directives. One of the problems we had was that the sprat and herring now run in the same shoal in parts of the Baltic Sea. This makes it difficult for fishermen to fish for something that is important for their nutrition.

I do not think that anyone can really be pleased with this multi-annual plan for the Baltic Sea because it does not protect fishermen and it does not protect the fish. This plan increases the maximum sustainable yield, the point at which waters are fished maximum. And maximum sustainable yield is therefore nothing but policy-cast greed. Plunder the available stock of fish as much as possible. And we're not talking about irons here, we're talking about living beings that can feel pain and fear. And even the maximum fishing out of the sea is not enough. This plan goes a step further: increasing the maximum sustainable yield, and for that I have only one word: overfishing. And in doing so, this Baltic Sea plan weakens the whole common fisheries policy. And this also opens the door to continue to fish structurally empty other waters, such as the North Sea. A large part of you have joined me in opposing this overfishing plan. And I am therefore surprised that you are defending this plan today. At least I can't. The rapporteur has invited us for a glass of champagne tomorrow and, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you: can you raise the glass tomorrow with your head held high?

The Baltic Sea Plan is the first management plan in which Parliament and the Council of Ministers jointly set a limit on how much we can fish.   The negotiations have been tough and I am disappointed that we did not make it all the way forward in defending Parliament's ambitious position, which would have put an end to overfishing in europe.  An ocean is not an aquarium where all factors can be controlled. Moreover, in our sensitive inland sea, the Baltic Sea, the situation is extremely difficult. This uncertainty requires safety margins when determining a maximum sustainable harvest of fish. In order to achieve the goal of the Baltic Sea being a healthy sea with viable fish stocks, we cannot constantly fish at the maximum limit of what is sustainable - FMSY. We need to be at a lower level so that fish stocks can recover.  Instead of deciding how much during FMSY we should fish, the negotiations came to be about the situations in which you can fish over FMSY and how much over FMSY.  That is why, unfortunately, I cannot recommend that my group vote in favour of this agreement. It does not remain within the objective set out in the basic regulation of the EU's fisheries policy. In any case, we managed to include a number of safeguards in the plan. Now comes a first test: three weeks ago came an alarming report on the state of cod in the western Baltic, which is threatened with collapse due to poor rejuvenation.    The ball is now in Commissioner Vella's. The Commission will now produce a proposal for new fishing quotas based on the Baltic Sea Plan. In order to protect cod in the western stock, I expect the Commission to propose quotas that are in accordance with the safeguard measures described in the plan. We have everything to gain by putting an end to the depletion of European waters, and from a citizens' perspective it is important that the European institutions respect and follow the decisions we take and do not undermine them by enforcing conflicting decisions.

The approach used will now inspire the plans in the other geographical areas. But more than closing the process with this wording, I think we should always check whether it fits the objectives of the new Common Fisheries Policy. Despite this positive step, I must stress that, in addition to the real de-escalation that is taking place in the Mediterranean, many of the other European fisheries are not healthy. The robustness of the exploited populations must also be ensured and the resilience of their habitats and food chains must also be promoted.

And as we will present the next set of proposals for fisheries soon, and as you all know it is a legal obligation of the Commission to draft the proposals on the basis of the existing law, it has to be said that the proposal for fishing opportunities in the Baltic Sea is usually adopted by the Commission at the end of August / beginning of September, in order to prepare in a timely manner the discussion and agreement at the fisheries Council in October. If the new multiannual management plan is in force by then – and it is currently under the co-responsibility of the co-legislators – then our proposal will be based on this plan. So I do hope this will be the case, and strongly encourage Parliament and Council to organise formal signature to make this possible. And the second point, on the safeguards in the plan, I want to assure you know that the Commission will make appropriate use of the provisions in force such as targets and safeguards.

According to scientific research, there are strong biological interactions between them. I therefore support a more flexible approach to resources. Poland has been in favour of a multi-species resource management plan in the Baltic Sea for several years. Since fishing for cod has an impact on flat fish stocks, I believe it is appropriate to include in the plan the possibility of responding to the deterioration of flat fish stocks. The signals coming from the fishing environment are alarming, especially the situation of cod is particularly disastrous. Feed fishing is extremely harmful here. I therefore particularly criticise the provisions of Article 13, which leave too much tolerance for large-scale pelagic fishing, including industrial fishing. It is necessary to increase their transparency and to take such measures to ensure that their impact on the baltic marine environment is as small as possible. The Commission must take into account the joint recommendations of the Baltic Sea Region countries. The Commission's actions must comply with the provisions of Regulation No 1380/2013 on the CFP and the results of the work of the Interinstitutional Working Group on Long-Term Plans.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her Sorry, but I had the information that we are starting the debate 16 to 7. Madam President, Commissioner, indeed, the question concerns the impact of the United States sanctions against Iran on European companies. Fortunately, we have achieved the so-called nuclear deal with Iran and have negotiated the lifting of sanctions. It is good that Iran's nuclear programme is being put on a sensible track and that economic recovery processes are being initiated in return. However, we have the problem that many US sanctions were imposed even before the discussion on Iran's nuclear route, as it was in 1979. These sanctions have not been lifted and, of course, they also have an extraterritorial effect on European companies in a way. In this respect, we need to look again at how European companies should deal with this. There have been demonstrably problems with some companies. Some others have been granted an exemption after heated discussions with the American authorities, but nevertheless the door is being opened to unequal treatment between American and European companies. That is why it is all the more important to bring clarity to the field of extraterritorial sanctions. In particular, this applies to the banking sector for access to finance. It is not acceptable for European companies to be excluded from the sensible financing of their projects. We all know how much the new opportunities with Iran mean, especially for the stabilisation of this region and also for the development of Iranian society, and in this respect, we in the Committee on Trade have formulated the questions accordingly, such as the Commission, Commissioner, how you assess the specific situation and what measures you have taken to ensure that the commitments are really implemented. How do you intend to make it clear once again, particularly to the United States, that this extraterritorial concern must not have any effect on European companies? Another question is whether you have ever spoken to the Americans and what the American response has been, and how you will ultimately ensure the activities of European companies in this context in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 118, "date": "2016-06-22.json", "name": "Elżbieta Bieńkowska", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, five months after the lifting of UN, EU and US economic sanctions in return for the implementation of Iran’s nuclear-related commitment, it is really timely to debate the impact of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on the relations between Iran and EU businesses. This is really important.  Let me first of all stress that the lifting of sanctions was a key element of the nuclear agreement and an effective implementation of the sanctions lifting is a condition for sustainability and success of the plan. It is in our interests, and Iran can reap the economic benefits of it. It is undeniable that we are at a very critical juncture where we need to make sure that all remains on track during the visit of the High Representative and seven other commissioners, including myself, to Tehran in April. We could witness the domestic debate in the country about the merits of the plan, and international engagement is still vital. Successful implementation of the deal is also a key here in the EU. The EU continues to be closely engaged, including through the High Representative’s coordinating role of the Joint Commission overseeing the implementation of the deal.  Let me assure you that we have faithfully met our commitments, as agreed under the plan of action, by lifting the sanctions and publishing guidance on implementation day, providing clarity on the subject. But we have also engaged with the private sector to provide clarity and reassure operators wanting to go back to Iran.  Let us be clear, there are still challenges we need to overcome. The financial and banking issues we are experiencing should not be underestimated, but they should be put into perspective. Iran has been isolated from the world economy for more than 10 years. Iranian banks have been cut off from the international financial system for the same period of time. We have always known that the full reintegration of Iran into the world economy would not happen overnight, but I am confident it will succeed. There are other elements that banks take into consideration in their assessment: the full and correct comprehension of the scope of US sanctions, as well as Iran’s banking regulations and anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls.  We are engaging very actively on both fronts: the EU with the Member States has been holding regular consultation with Washington since 16 January this year; the US has updated twice its guidance, publishing additional frequently asked questions. This has demonstrated ongoing commitment to provide clarity to business operators and to keep the guidance a living document. We also invited the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control to inform our finance ministers and encourage him to further reach out to the private sector. In addition, we are planning to hold a symposium in Brussels on the lifting of sanctions for business operators, with contributions from both EU and US experts.  In the same spirit, the High Representative chaired a ministerial meeting on 19 May 2016 with the Foreign Ministers of Germany, France, the UK and US. The release of the joint statement on post-JCPOA business with Iran was a clear signal to reassure financial operators and to encourage them to engage with Iran.  Let me also take this opportunity to share with you how appreciative we are of the US efforts to provide clarity about the scope of the remaining US primary sanctions and to reach out to the banking sector in Europe. In addition, it is important that Iran takes the necessary steps on the regulatory framework and business environment. Companies are concerned about these issues, in particular on anti-money laundering and countering financing of terrorism and of course, more needs to be done. Cooperation and consultations in the Financial Action Task Force framework should be treated as a priority. Our visit to Iran has served as an opportunity to establish the basis for cooperating and providing assistance in these domains. Despite all the challenges, the results of the plan are already positive, with a 22% growth in trade between the EU and Iran in the first quarter of 2016, compared to the same period last year. Thirty-three Iranian banks have been reconnected to SWIFT so far. More recently, it was reported that 200 small and medium-sized international banks, including European ones, have started correspondent relationship with Iranian banks. Major banks are becoming more comfortable as they start to comprehend the new rules in practice. To enhance the economic dialogue and cooperation, in October we are planning a European economic mission to Iran with representatives of European SMEs and businesses. As an element of the trade promotion role of the Member States, another promising avenue is the use of national credit insurance companies, which could provide cover and additional reassurance to investors. All of these issues together form the complex reality. It will still require, of course, some time as the international business community needs to adjust to the new reality of the post-implementation deal. While we cannot force banks or other businesses to take certain decisions in commercial matters, we will continue to be committed to ensuring that Iran can reap the benefit of the plan of action. With that in mind, we can better continue our consultations with the US in order to get as much clarity as possible, continue reaching out to the European business community and provide assistance to Iran’s banking and financial system. Dialogue and persistence are the way forward.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 119, "date": "2016-06-22.json", "name": "Victor Boştinaru", "mepid": "39711", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Madam President, I would like to tell the Commissioner how glad I was, one year ago, to see a breakthrough on the Iranian nuclear deal after difficult and long negotiations. The EU played a crucial role in this success, and as I said at that time, the deal has to be beneficial to all parties involved. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, adopted in October, can be a significant step forward for the security, stability and development of the entire region. But it remains extremely important that it is implemented thoroughly and in good faith by all partners and all sides as soon as possible. We should not forget that the significance of this deal extends beyond its technical details: it has been celebrated by the Iranian people, following its conclusion, with the hope that it will improve their living standards. It is essential that we deliver on that. Only successful implementation will allow us to show the benefits of diplomacy and negotiation over the politics of obstructionism and confrontation.  In spite of the partial lifting of sanctions, EU companies still face substantial difficulties in accessing the Iranian market, and this is mostly due to the fact that many US financial sanctions are still in place and have an extra-territorial impact. Much as we are aware of some of the remaining US and regional partners’ concerns on issues such as security, in particular, and the use of ballistic weaponry, it is important to use all our channels of cooperation with the USA in order to remove, or at least find a temporary solution to, the difficulties faced by European companies and to ensure in the long term , together with our Iranian partners, the security and legal certainty of European investments in Iran.

There is a shift in society that is not yet reflected in those ruling circles. It is a theocratic dictatorship, it is part of an anti-Western coalition with Russia, with Assad and the Hezbollah movement, for example, in Syria. It is a state that seeks regional hegemony, which would certainly be disadvantageous for Europe if something like this were to happen, and it is a state that has never abandoned its nuclear ambitions.

But ongoing as well as new US-based sanctions for human rights violations or to deter Iran’s missile programme – regardless of the validity of those goals, and I think they are valid – have led to uncertainty for European companies. As a result of the extraterritorial impact, an estimated half of interested companies are holding back. The need for financing, insuring and transporting products going to Iran can lead to a chain reaction where banks do not trust that their services, even if fully legal in Europe, will not be punished in the US or by the US: not only billion-dollar fines, but also new visa requirements that hinder access, or undermine trust in being able to access , the US after doing business with Iran. Since we requested this debate, Secretary Kerry has met with EU-based banks and the question is this: has this sufficiently clarified their concerns, according to the Commission? And what has the Commission or the External Action Service done to address these concerns with US officials to get more predictability and clarity for European companies? And have you engaged in the underlying problem and addressed it with the Iranian authorities – namely the fact that a significant role for the Revolutionary Guard in the Iranian economy hinders the emergence of a truly private sector, and also risks that the benefits after the deal will go to a few and not to the many. Does the current situation of uncertainty jeopardise the deal at all? Key for our group, and key for the EU to be effective and credible is for us to be able to make our own policies – in tandem with the US when needed, as we successfully did to bring Iran back to the negotiating table – but always independently, based on our own assessments and decisions of which foreign policy tools benefit our interests and , most importantly, our values.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 122, "date": "2016-06-22.json", "name": "Javier Couso Permuy", "mepid": "125997", "text": "  GUE/NGL Group. – Madam President, the European Union remains hostage to American interests and is once again contingent on its foreign and economic policies.

As with sanctions against Iraq in 1990, which, according to the United Nations, caused more than half a million children killed. Since the adoption of the joint comprehensive action plan, the European Union has announced that it would lift economic sanctions, including the embargo on crude oil and the ban on trade and transport.

Society in Iran needs the lifting of sanctions, because there is unemployment there, where many people live below the standards that we believe are necessary. This can only change if trade and the lifting of sanctions can improve the economic situation in the country. That is why, also in order to stop the trend towards terrorism within the country, that is to say towards the more radical currents, it is absolutely necessary to improve the standard of living in the country. That is why we have no choice but to strengthen economic cooperation and lift the sanctions now, even from the point of view of the United States from the point of view of historical development.

Since October 2015, the European Commission has progressively lifted sanctions and is again allowing our companies to market with Iran, while the United States has not yet lifted its sanctions and, in addition to banning its companies from doing business in Iran, are heavily fining European companies that do so, under a law that allows the United States extraterritorial application of their sanctions. This is because the US government believes that anyone who uses the dollar in transactions implicitly recognizes its sovereignty. It is obvious that Iran still has a long way to go, especially as regards respect for human rights, but since sanctions no longer block trade, European companies have been quickly filling the gaps left in the Iranian market by years of embargoes, and I find it ridiculous, to say the least, that, having received the authorisation of the various European governments, our businesses are being blocked by the American government. As far as Italy is concerned, for now only one large Italian bank has been hit by American fines, while another large bank is still waiting for the response and an Italian company has been investigated by the USA but without receiving fines. The same cannot be said, however, for other European companies that will have to pay. The procedure for asking Washington for a derogation from these sanctions is long and very complex, not easily accessible, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. I do not therefore wish to deny, I repeat, that Iran's path from the regime to democracy is still a long one, but this road also involves gradual integration into the international trading system and, above all, if Europe has decided to give the green light to our companies' investments in Iran, the last word must certainly not fall to the United States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 127, "date": "2016-06-22.json", "name": "Mario Borghezio", "mepid": "21817", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, we must not Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of tomorrow's Brexit vote, one would have expected a stronger stance on the part of the European Union, at least on these issues, when it comes to defending European businesses, but we do not even know what sanctions against Iran the United States has lifted.

The reason is obvious and of course has nothing to do with alleged concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The main concern for them is the promotion of American trade interests in this country. A typical example is the case of Airbus, which, as you know, has struck an agreement with the state-owned IranAir to supply 118 aircraft since the end of January. However, due to the use of some subsystems of American origin, approval is required from the US government for the sale of the aircraft, which, five months later, has not yet been given. Of course, this obstruction has benefited American Boeing, which a few days ago concluded negotiations with Iran on the supply of 100 of its own aircraft.  With these displays of allied solidarity and trade, as the Americans mean them, they make it clear each time who has the upper hand in this alliance.

However, the US has suspended not terminated its nuclear-related sanctions on Iran while at the same non-nuclear US economic sanctions remain in place, notably the ban on US citizens and companies trading with Iran.

Madam President, I was told six minutes, and I will try to respect your time. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the mobility of the citizens of the European Union is no illusion. It is real and that is why the European Union has sixteen million couples who are multinational or international.  These couples own property - that is, car, house - or have bank accounts in various countries. In the event of a problem, it is, so far, a real journey of the combatant to find a jurisdiction that is effective and accepted and, on the other hand, to achieve a fair sharing of responsibilities.  These two regulations will put an end to the legal uncertainties that these couples face with, of course, the costs that divorce proceedings and separations entail or in the event of death and, above all, will put an end to the conflicting decisions that sometimes arise from these legal difficulties. These texts will apply to both married couples and those who have entered into a registered partnership. It was very difficult for these couples to know which jurisdiction would be competent to settle disputes over their property in another Member State, with the rules varying greatly from one EU country to another. For this reason, when these regulations are adopted, spouses or partners will be able to choose, under certain conditions, the jurisdiction that will be called upon to rule. This may be the right of the country of residence or the country whose couples or partners have nationality. This is a very clear layout at the same time as it is very flexible. The right that has been chosen will be the one that will apply to all the goods, even if they are located in different countries. However, I would stress that these legal rules of each country will be well applied and that the principle of subsidiarity will be well respected. These two regulations do not concern the definition of marriage or the definition of partnership, and the rights and obligations arising from a registered marriage or partnership will continue to be governed by national law. Thus, a Member State that does not recognise the registered partnership will be entirely free not to judge a dispute that would arise on its soil and, in particular, in view of the consequences of a separation or death of registered partners. It will therefore be able to entrust the matter to the courts of another Member State, which recognises their partnership.  The negotiations on these two regulations have been very delicate, as you well know. The agreement between the Member States to be unanimous on family law required the use of the enhanced cooperation procedure to unblock this situation which was causing suffering from many people.  I am announcing to you, or rather, I can confirm that eighteen Member States have agreed to introduce and apply these different provisions between them. Parliament gave its approval at the last plenary in June 2016 to the decision to use enhanced cooperation for these two regulations.  The two regulations, that is, matrimonial regimes and registered partnership, were voted by a large majority last week in the Committee on Legal Affairs. So there were no major difficulties. There is an amendment which is a bit cosmetic, which calls for the initial definition of Member States to be supplemented and to become 'the Member States participating in enhanced cooperation'. This is a clarification that will have no legal effect. In any case, this addition is in my opinion somewhat unnecessary and superfluous but, in any case, it does not influence the substantive decision. Therefore, I inform you that my group and I have agreed to vote against this amendment because we believe it is essential not to question the entire agreement that has been difficult to negotiate by these eighteen Member States who are participating in enhanced cooperation. In conclusion, Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to say that tomorrow's vote in favour of these two regulations is absolutely important, because it will ensure that the timetable is kept, so that the texts can be adopted at Council level by the Member States participating in this collegiality of enhanced cooperation as soon as possible. Madam President, dear friends, ladies and gentlemen, remember that this is a number of couples, i.e. about sixteen million couples, which makes 32 million people; if you have two parents for each of those 32 million people, you see a little bit about the number of families and people involved.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 147, "date": "2016-06-22.json", "name": "Tibor Navracsics", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam Chair, honourable Members, as European cities ask to make use of their right to free movement, the number of international couples increases. Today, as Mr Cavada mentioned, there are an estimated 60 million international couples in the Union. Currently, these couples face difficulties when managing their property or, in cases of divorce or death, when having to divide it. These new rules in relation to the property regimes of international couples, covering both marriages and registered partnerships, aim to remove such difficulties. These rules will provide international families with legal certainty and will reduce the costs associated with proceedings when things go wrong. Couples will know, with clarity, which courts will deal with matters concerning their property and which national law should apply to such matters. These new rules also complete the programme on mutual recognition of decisions in civil and commercial matters adopted by the Council on 30 November 2000, and fill an important gap in the field of Union family law. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Cavada, for his excellent cooperation in pushing forward this difficult file. I also wish to thank the Dutch Presidency for treating enhanced cooperation in this area as a priority. We would all have wished that these important matters could have been addressed with all Member States taking part, but it is important that we move forward now with those who can. And, of course, the enhanced cooperation system always remains open to other Member States to join, if and when they feel ready to participate. In the meantime, the enhanced cooperation rules contain provisions ensuring that agreements on property regime matters concluded between Member States participating in the enhanced cooperation and those not participating will remain unaffected. It is important that these new rules apply for people in both marriages and registered partnerships, but I wish to reassure Parliament that the draft regulations also contain safeguards aimed at respecting the legal traditions of all Member States.

I was the rapporteur during the last parliamentary term, shadow rapporteur in this parliamentary term, and this has been a very long process to ensure that a solution is found for the citizens that will help them to live really sensibly in the internationality in which they live.

That's a good thing. From the outset, it was very important for the European Parliament to ensure that the two legislative proposals before us – firstly for registered partnerships and, on the other, for marriages – both contain, in principle, the same rights, but at the same time – and this has always been very important – respect the different traditions and cultures in the Member States. That is why it is precisely this clause that no state is forced to introduce or recognise, for example, registered partnerships – if they do not exist in their country – that is a correct and important formula. In the context of this law, it has always been important for us, as Social Democrats, to say that we must also ensure that there is no forum shopping. We have all too often seen in these areas that the stronger, richer of the two partners – if there was a problem or a divorce or separation – has prevailed and the weaker one has been left behind. This, too, had to be prevented, and I believe that we have succeeded in doing so with this right. I agree with the previous speakers on this. We have succeeded in creating a right in which both the European Commission and the Council have followed the European Parliament's proposals.

At the end of last year, the Council of Ministers presented a regulation to regulate property issues for spouses – more precisely, for homosexual spouses. Hungary and Poland have blocked this because these marriages do not exist there and they did not want them. But that is the technocrat principle: gay marriage is to be introduced throughout Europe through the mutual recognition of civil status documents through the back door. Eight Member States had stipulated in their constitutions that marriage consists of a man and a woman. Mutual recognition of civil status certificates should undermine national constitutions by the EU. This is precisely the EU principle that more and more people reject and do not want. Here in Europe, values are defined, which should then all accept and recognise. And if states do not want to do so, they are insulted, and the EU comes through the back door. That is precisely why there is now a Europe-wide, European citizens' initiative. It is called 'mother-father-children' and it collects signatures throughout Europe so that the institutions in the EU too are forced to understand marriage only as marriage. The registered civil partnership consists of two men or two women, and the marriage consists of a man and a woman – to be more precise: a man and a woman.

I wanted to congratulate your rapporteur, Mr. Cavada. There have been many practical and legal difficulties, when there has been an international partner and there has been a separation by death or because there has been a separation or divorce, because of the disparity of regulations that currently exist in the Union. In fact, there was an agreement in 2015, and one of the priorities for the Union had to be the treatment of these registered marriage schemes or 'units'. There was no unanimity, and that led to seventeen Member States subsequently asking for enhanced cooperation to essentially facilitate the lives of citizens. And that is what we are discussing today: two Regulations which seek to clarify the issue legally, to establish who has the competence, who is the competent body judicially, what is the applicable law. And then, too, the recognition and execution of all resolutions. If there is an organisation, the free movement of citizens is facilitated, which is one of the Union's priorities. The lives of citizens are also made easier; the procedure is much faster and much safer. The European Union is undoubtedly an area of freedom, security and justice, in respect for human rights and, of course, for the various legal systems of the Member States. Many cases of confusion and many cases of legal difficulties will be put to an end. This enhanced cooperation is voluntary; at any time, any other Member State may accede, and therefore it is a matter of making life easier for all citizens of the Union.

The proposed cooperation, the enhanced cooperation seems to me to be effective.  According to the Commission, for example, in 2007, of the 2.4 million new marriages entered into in the European Union, 13% were international. It is therefore appropriate to ensure clear cross-border rights for these citizens. According to the Commission, this fact-making can also save up to EUR 1.1 billion per year, which is now spent on parallel legal proceedings in different Member States.  I also believe that member states' concerns about the non-disruptiveness of their national arrangements in the area are being treated in two cases.  Firstly, the purpose of the document is not to harmonise the substantive law of the Member States concerning the property conditions of international couples. The proposals do not say that a registered partnership is the same as marriage. The purpose of the proposal is only to ensure uniform rules for the management of the assets of international couples or in the event of division of such assets. The proposal is therefore in line with the principle of subsidiarity.  Secondly, the public policy clause is also part of the adjustment. In any event, it allows the participating State not to apply the proposed arrangements if a specific reason for public policy arises on its part, such as a difference in the concept of registered partnership.

To date, international couples at their most vulnerable moments in their personal lives – that is upon the demise of a spouse or partner, or the dissolution of their marriage or partnership – have been burdened even further by complex legal rules regulating which courts could determine issues relating to their property regimes and which law should apply. Often, after obtaining a decision on divorce, separation or dissolution of a partnership, the couple have needed to institute separate and distinct proceedings in another jurisdiction to have issues related to their property regime determined. These two proposals for Council regulations on enhanced cooperation will ensure clarity and certainty. Couples will enjoy simplified procedures so that if they are involved in divorce, separation or succession proceedings, it will be the same court ruling on these proceedings that will determine issues related to their property regimes. Couples will no longer need to institute proceedings in different states and get embroiled in complex legal issues to obtain justice.

Madam President, I do not know if this will be the last word, but at least for tonight, probably, on this subject. I want to publicly thank the Council, its services and those of the European Commission for ending six years - I would say - of inequality. Why do I use that term? If 18 countries have agreed to sign up to some kind of pact - the same regulation at least - for couples or \"registered partners\" - as they say modestly - that is, either unmarried male-female couples or same-sex couples living together, it is because they have found a demand in their country, and because these citizens cannot be left outlawed and , moreover, in conflict with international systems that no single person, even with a good lawyer, can overcome, because it is extremely complicated to be locked up in this suffering.  The 16 million couples I was talking about earlier represent 32 million married or registered individuals, and in reality 64 million people - because each has two parents - who are projected into the world of Kafka, because it is not possible to overcome or very difficult. I am therefore very grateful for the political will that the two institutions have put in helping us - the shadow rapporteurs and I - to bring about a text that has dragged on too long. Why did he drag him too far? Because it is quite strange , and indeed some have said earlier - that the European Union, by claiming values, as you said, dear colleague, has favoured free movement, free protection, free defence before the courts of capital, goods and services than the situations of individuals. We have dragged on too long and I want to thank those who had the political courage to break down the obstacles to reach this agreement. I'll end by saying two little things. First, does this text call into question subsidiarity? But absolutely not since, on the contrary, it is exclusive: those who do not want to subscribe to this text are not in the eighteen who have accepted it. Better yet, those who have citizens in their country who want to use a court to settle their international situation but live in a country that does not want to change family law will still be protected by going to another country's court. That is why my colleagues, myself and the two institutions have been able to come up with a text which, in reality, is of great human simplicity, because it finally protects a minority that has been ransacked by the will of ignorance of States.

The purpose of this proposal is, in particular, to establish in the Union a clear legal framework governing the conditions for determining the court competent to hear disputes between international couples, the law governing property relations and facilitating the movement of judgments and authentic instruments between Member States.

It is currently very difficult for international couples to understand who the competent courts are and what is the law applicable to their personal situation and property. The rules vary considerably from country to country and sometimes lead to conflict situations. International couples affected by the share of common property face complex issues, in particular as regards applicable law, choice of court, recognition and enforcement of judgments.

Thus, European citizens will not face legal uncertainty and bear the accompanying costs when sharing their property in the event of divorce, separation or death.

We also consulted the ministries of education of several countries. I have also tried to include in this report the results of the evaluations commissioned by the European Commission and the various position papers published by the organisations. Therefore, in order for this report not to be a report on everything, I have decided to focus on three main points. As you will note, this report has three parts. One concerns some proposals on how to organise this framework of cooperation in the field of education. The second part concerns the quality of education and training. Finally, the third concerns a very topical one, but I also do not hide – and I will say a few more words – the controversial subject: migration and education and training.  I would like to emphasise now only a few points that seem to me to be very important in this report, and are worth highlighting. For me, they are especially important. Firstly, we draw attention in this report to the role of the family in education. This seems obvious, but it is obvious, which is often forgotten today, namely that all this data shows the importance of the home environment for the development of the child's basic skills, then communication between school and parents, also relevant in matters such as shaping civic attitudes or preventing radicalisation.  Another aspect that is mentioned here is the community-based approach to education, which emphasizes the importance of all local organisations and actors. Unfortunately, there was no compromise amendment in which we also wanted to include religious organisations, local NGOs. And once again, we have just highlighted the role of parents, their responsibilities and the need to ensure that children's education has an impact. This is so important that there are no members of European organisations representing parents in the working groups that have already been set up.  Finally, another aspect is to appreciate all the successes of European policy in this regard, such as the Bologna Process, such as the student mobility programme or teaching staff. I wanted to draw attention in this report – and this sentence has also been divided by the shadow rapporteurs – to some weaknesses in this process, namely the feeling in academia of ignoring the objections of academics related to the Bologna Process. Therefore, we recommend that the university community be more involved in the ET 2020 work cycle. More flexibility is needed in the use of modules or the ECT points system and, most importantly, mobility results should also be based on qualitative indicators, not only quantitative indicators. Finally, the issue of migrants. I would also like to draw attention to this very briefly. We focus on immigrants from outside Europe, but all the data shows that the children of intra-European migrants also have great difficulties in adapting to society, and here educational systems are of great importance. We also advocate the inclusion of teachers from migration in the education system, of course in the exchange of practices, but also in helping migrants, including those in Europe, to adapt to the requirements and standards of teaching in the host country.

I am waiting for the opinion of colleagues.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 175, "date": "2016-06-22.json", "name": "Tibor Navracsics", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I wish to thank the Culture and Education Committee and especially the rapporteur Mr Krasnodębski for his excellent report which follows up on the Joint Council and Commission report regarding the strategic framework for European cooperation in Education and Training 2020. Education and Training 2020 is important: it is the umbrella under which all EU-level policy exchanges on education and training between Member States take place. It covers learning in all contexts, whether formal or non-formal, and at all levels, from early childhood education and schools through to higher education, vocational education and training, and other learning. Thanks to the joint report which the Commission and Council adopted last November, we defined our new common priorities in the field of education and training, which all contribute to the current top priorities of the EU. We now have a much more focused agenda which concentrates on key issues, namely the provision of relevant and high-quality knowledge, the recognition and transparency of skills, inclusive education including the promotion of civic competences, the promotion of innovative approaches fully embracing the digital era, strong support for our teachers and, last but not least, sustainable investment in education and training. We have made sure that Education and Training 2020 is firmly embedded in the Union’s overall political priorities and actively contributes to the development of skills and employability. The New Skills Agenda, which the Commission adopted on 10 June, underscores this point and announces a series of actions at EU-level in which education cooperation plays a key role. Education and training are not only important for acquiring skills for jobs: education is equally important to ensure social inclusion and to make certain that our human and civic values are safeguarded and passed on to future generations. These elements have been much reinforced in the new priorities under Education and Training 2020. I am proud to announce that one of the working groups is specially dedicated to the follow-up of the Paris Declaration, and we play a key role in exchanging with Member States on how to strengthen inclusive education and our common values – a very relevant development in the light of the recent action plan for the integration of migrants, and the new Commission communication to support the prevention of violent extremism , which were adopted some days ago, both highlighting this dimension. I am very pleased that the European Parliament is strongly supporting this increased attention to social inclusion, civic competences and common values in our work with Member States. Your voice will be important to further develop this dimension. Your report also highlights a number of problematic issues on the European education scene. We have taken good note of your concern about a brain-drain and imbalanced mobility, for example. Of course, there are larger structural issues behind this which go beyond the education dimension, such as varying employment opportunities across Europe. The Bologna Process, which supports the provision of high-quality education in all Member States, makes a positive contribution to addressing these challenges. Also the new Education and Training 2020 working group on the modernisation of higher education will address the issues of internationalisation, recognition and mobility in a balanced perspective. Let me end by once again thanking Parliament and the rapporteur, Mr Krasnodębski, for your very valuable input and your strong support for our joint efforts in this field.

Therefore, the report also stresses that education and training are a value in themselves and should not be oriented solely towards meeting the needs of the labour market. The report respects subsidiarity. The competences we have at EU level are relatively limited, but education is increasingly expected. From the fight against radicalisation to economic growth and poverty reduction. This is because we know that setting educational objectives and tools determines how our children will be prepared and successful in the future and whether we will be able to ensure their satisfaction and economic growth in the EU.  That is why the European Parliament is opposed to the European Commission's proposal, which has narrowed the framework from 13 to six priorities, and member states will choose from them according to their different situations.  Firstly, it is the relevance and quality of skills, secondly, inclusive education, innovative education, strong support for teachers, recognition of non-formal learning outcomes and the effectiveness of education. I consider it important that the report emphasises the need to support teachers, adding that erasmus should be an instrument at EU level.  The report also highlights the role of early childhood and primary education for lifelong learning, the focus on accessibility and quality, as well as the quality of vocational training and the expansion of language learning programmes.  In the context of the evaluation, the report draws attention to the risk of testing. The report also realistically assesses the Bologna Process and calls for its fulfilment.  It is in conjunction with the rise in radicalisation that the European Parliament is calling for a survey of how education systems incorporate ethics and personality and social education into their education programmes as a tool that has proven itself in many schools.

We were talking earlier about the issue not only of radicalisation but also of an education that takes on at least two challenges: social inclusion – we still have too many differences in educational landscapes – and greater attention to the quality of education systems, on the one hand, and, on the other, the ability to create the so-called informal competences of citizenship, transversal key competences that also serve to activate that intercultural dialogue , that ability to be citizens not only of Europe but also of the world that is now absolutely necessary. I would like to thank Mr Krasnodębski very much for this report. We realise that today the strategic issue of education and cultural investment is a matter for the future of Europe. It is important that this communication on the modernisation of higher education has been announced, not least in order to make the system of comparability of qualifications, credits and also the Bologna process more effective, which still has several difficulties. I think it is absolutely right, as the rapporteur said, to support teachers as well. I think that perhaps the problem of support for teachers should be better highlighted and that it is absolutely necessary, for example, to make increasingly use of the EFSI investment plan for European platforms that also help in the field of education and education, for example with regard to the digital adaptation of educational profiles and content. There remains the problem of too many differences that still exist in Europe as regards the difference in access, educational poverty, learning outcomes and the study perspective for immigrants.

The Union's attitude, of course, does not seem to reinforce this strategy. The austerity policies imposed by the troika in some Member States of the Union have led these countries to cut spending in the field of education.  Specifically in Greece, according to the 2017 state budget, expenditure on education will amount to 4.2 billion euros, while since 2009 they have fallen by 35.6%. At the same time, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, dared to talk about supposedly fair growth and decently paid jobs, while in Greece in the first quarter of 2016 the unemployment rate reached 24.9%, the highest in Europe.

We should encourage and further support Member States in order to ensure coherent, transparent and inclusive education providing an appropriate response to the needs of the current diverse groups of learners in both formal and non—formal educational settings. Creating alternative ways of learning and facilitating the recognition of learning are vital means of widening access to educational opportunities. Better cooperation between Member States is needed on the establishment of new, innovative and interactive methods of teaching, training and learning, where individuals are active participants in the educational process. That will increase the attractiveness and effectiveness of the educational process and will enhance the development of students’ creativity. Further efforts are needed with regard to improving early childhood education and fostering its modernisation, and there is also an urgent need for reinforcement of the renewed European agenda for adult learning. Better cooperation between the EU and the national authorities is required in order to find the right approach to swiftly, fully and sustainably integrating refugees, migrants and asylum seekers into education and training systems and ensuring that those who have already obtained qualifications get proper recognition for them.

Madam President, the European Union's strategy in the field of education is essentially cooperation in the dismantling, degradation and fragmentation of education in Europe. It is a collaboration for the commercialisation of knowledge and the privatisation of the education system. It is a mechanism for reproducing the distorted pattern of unpaid, precarious work without rights. Neoliberal perception has altered the very concept of education. Instead of promoting integrated knowledge, it creates sterile pieces of knowledge, ready for assembly, depending on the requirements of the market and the dominant economic interests.  The whole situation is also exacerbated by austerity policies. Especially in countries like Greece, which are in an adjustment programme, education has been dealt a huge blow. Underfunding and public spending cuts on education devalue education systems and, combined with disinvestment, lead to high rates of long-term unemployment of up to 40% among young people, resulting in deregulation of industrial relations and an increase in the phenomenon of brain drain.  If we want a high-level education, as our youth deserve, the strategy of European cooperation in the field of education must change radically. For Europe's young people, the future cannot be semi-learning, unemployment, part-time and precarious work and migration.

This report falls short in content and even more in strategic ambition, below the Commission's initial proposal.

In all of them the report expresses the corresponding wishful thinking, good intentions, but does not identify critical points or offer clear lines of improvement.

Unfortunately, in this report we have not had the courage to denounce the fact that the marked reduction in funding and, more generally, the increase in the problems of the education and training sector are a direct consequence of the austerity policies that the Commission continues to impose on European citizens. Since the beginning of the crisis, it has been found that the choices of models adopted at EU level, rather than converging towards reducing inequalities, have dramatically accentuated disparities and discrimination based on economic ownership. The fact that the strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training is clearly functional to the current economic model of the Union, which also incorporates the Juncker plan, is yet another confirmation of a cynical desire to continue along a path that has already proved to be unsuccessful and damaging.

As long as the state pays for the school, it will continue to do what the bureaucracy and teachers' unions demand, and the needs of the student will be completely unnoticed.

Pedagogical innovation is not commendable by the use of computer tools. Information and communication technologies are mere pedagogical materials, as the typewriter has been in the past.

Its task is to develop responsibility, impartiality, critical thinking, curiosity, but also empathy in people. And these are the skills of so-called emotional intelligence.  Through cooperation between Member States and between educational institutions, young people have the opportunity to broaden their horizons and gain unique experiences abroad. We must say openly here that ERASMUS and ERASMUS+ are great achievements of European integration.  However, ladies and gentlemen, European education systems have a number of shortcomings and we must admit this. And we must try to correct these errors precisely within the strategic framework of European cooperation on education and training. In particular, these are problems caused by increased mobility and the current refugee crisis. These two phenomena often change the structure of national education systems, but at the same time show a lack of flexibility. How do we respond to the refugee crisis within education programmes?  If you agree with me that we don't, we have to change that. I therefore believe that education, in addition to its main functions, is also the key to integration.

That means that even if we can identify common goals and objectives, we have to make coalitions with the Member States. It is not the European Commission that can direct the Member States in those fields. We can generate a critical mass for change, but that is a different dynamic than in other areas. That is why I think it is very important to identify the common problems and define shared responses. That is what we are doing, and in this process the ET2020 monitoring and assessment system is a very important, highly appreciated instrument: highly appreciated by the Member States, because they take part in the working groups, they accept the results of the working groups and they follow the recommendations from the ET2020 mechanism, and that is why I think it is a very important instrument in our hands to generate change in European education and training systems. There is a consensus that European education and training systems have two objectives: to produce employable people and to produce good citizens. Both of them are equally important. We have to change our education systems in order to equip young citizens with better knowledge to make them good citizens and democrats and, at the same time, employable citizens as well. That is why we have to concentrate on all those issues which were raised here, and we have to find a good solution for that. We have tangible and concrete proposals and actions. We are dismantling barriers between countries via the Bologna process, in the framework of Erasmus+, by eTraining systems, by online language courses, by student-mobility programs, by the European qualification framework... these are all instruments that can make the life of the European citizens easier. We also give help to the Member States in handling the refugee crisis, with online courses, with social integration programmes, with funding for NGOs, local communities and teachers and schools.

I also have a request before you make your last decision on how to vote tomorrow. Please read this report carefully again, because it seems to me that some of the reservations that you have raised are not covered by this report. For example, we are talking about social aspects clearly in recital Q, where we are talking about educational impoverishment, poor integration of people in social difficulties. The same is true in recitals D and J and paragraphs 42 and 41. Therefore, please note that this problem is being addressed. We are also talking about the fact that education is also a value in itself. For example, recital B already says that education and training must not be aimed solely at meeting market needs, but should be of value in itself. Finally, the same threads appear in recital C and paragraphs 46, 47 and 48. Please read this report a little more carefully.  There is a third point of criticism here. This is what the Commissioner has already said. Some say that we attribute too much competence to the European Commission. On the other hand, Colleague Maragall, who co-authored this report as shadow rapporteur, says that there are no Added European values here. One of you said that this is not ambitious enough for Europe. Well, that's the legal situation. This is an area of education which is not covered by the European Treaties.

We should point out that teaching conditions and quality are often deteriorating, resulting in the fragmentation of university programmes and an undue emphasis on competence in a narrow area of knowledge.  Employers complain about graduate skills and are critical of the new degree structure and note that the duration of bachelor's degrees is not suitable for the needs of the labour market. At the same time, the problems of employability of professionals are caused by insufficient recognition of bachelor's degree professional qualifications and the enormous application of the rules to the solution.  We must therefore call on the Commission to take all necessary measures and to make proposals that will help the academic community to improve and prepare the specialists that employers need.

Education, as well as training, is the sine qua non for real personal and collective growth. A further point in the report that I would like to highlight is support for educators, identified as one of the new priority areas of ET2020. The quality of teacher preparation and the programmes for permanent professional development are, unfortunately, still lagging behind the sudden increase in the multiplicity and complexity of skills essential to teaching.

They talk about the insufficient level of knowledge and skills of university graduates. They draw attention to significant differences between their needs and training at higher education institutions. The mismatch between education and the requirements of practice has a negative impact on the applicability and ability of young people to compete on the labour market. We must also avoid artificially enforcing higher education. There are a large number of professions where the condition for obtaining a diploma is indeed extra.

With a so-called Transparency Act, the government wants to restrict the work of NGOs – the non-governmental organisations. The clear focus on a part of civil society in the country is critical. For example, human rights organisations are disproportionately affected by this law, but some of the German political foundations would also be hindered by excessive identification and reporting requirements. As a result, plurality in the country would be in jeopardy.  Together with other MEPs, I have already written to the Israeli Government to express my concerns. Another example of the increasing pressure on Israeli civil society is the trial of the NGO \"Breaking the Silence\". This organization publishes anonymous statements by members of the army about their use in the Palestinian territories. If the Israeli prosecutor prevails in demanding that the organization disclose the identity of its sources, this work of \"Breaking the Silence\" would be de facto impossible. In dialogue with Israel, the European Union is committed to ensuring that the civil societies there must act free of unnecessary restrictions, so that Israel continues to play a pioneering role in plurality and democracy in the Middle East.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 222, "date": "2016-06-22.json", "name": "Paloma López Bermejo (GUE/NGL).", "mepid": "125047", "text": "   – Madam President, I would like to bring here the struggle of the workers of the Lauki and Dulciora companies in Valladolid, for this Parliament to recognise those who fight for their rights, for their work and for their dignity in the face of large multinationals. Lauki and Dulciora are two companies owned by the companies Lactalis and Mondelez (formerly Kraft), companies that threaten to relocate their production despite the profitability of their operations for the sole purpose of increasing their profits and their control over the market. With these closures are at risk industries linked to the territory: ships, brands and knowledge accumulated during years of production.  We will not leave the crisis without supporting our industrial fabric. From here I call on the public administrations, starting with the European Union, to facilitate the continuity of lauki and Dulciora's production beyond the interests of their current owners, and to prevent mass layoffs on profitable companies such as those facilitated by the labour reform of the People's Party, especially when a whole regional economy is put at risk.

The setting of equal rules must not mean and consequently lead to the fragmentation of the internal market into twenty-eight different national adjustments, accompanied by a totally disproportionate administrative burden on SMEs in particular.

We must move towards an energy model free of CO2 and pollution, but the transition must be done in an orderly, intelligent and above all, respecting human rights. The European Union intends to end European coal aid, arguing that it is more expensive than that from abroad. It forgets to assess the cost of imported coal on slave labour, child labour, the ecological cost of transport to Europe and the risk of energy dependence, as well as interventionism by countries that subsidize extraction and the socio-economic cost of leaving thousands of families affected by the loss of direct and indirect jobs , without its proper restructuring plan. I call on the European Commission to emphasize CO2 capture and storage research projects and to develop an appropriate labour restructuring plan for the coal sector. We also call on our Government to respect the agreements it has signed until 2018 and to participate in the proposal for future support programmes beyond that date.

The report accompanying the research reports that there are entire areas, in very critical neighbourhoods, where sexual abuse and incest are elevated to normal. All the media have talked about this research, sometimes even out of turn. It is certainly not a phenomenon of custom, but they are stories of poverty, isolation, degradation and social exclusion. These are neighbourhoods desperately abandoned to themselves, where the underworld manages the territory and illegal activities are the only sources of income. I wanted to speak this evening because the institutions all have a duty to turn the spotlight on this horrific and shameful phenomenon, so that it is not only the subject of studies and in-depth studies, but above all the subject of prevention and law enforcement policies. We must do more and act more efficiently and effectively to help the most vulnerable citizens.

But we must understand that a possible decision to leave the European Union no longer offers the possibility of a way back for Britain. I therefore call on British citizens of Romanian to understand the importance of this vote and to support remaining in the European Union, so that their country of adoption remains close to their country of origin in a united Europe. I also ask the more than 150,000 Romanians who live and work legally in the UK to invite their friends and relatives to support Britons who want to stay in the European Union. The vote of those close to them depends on the right to work, the right to reduced tuition fees, the right to credit, the right to social benefits or even the recognition of old age at work in Europe, but also the United Kingdom. By their active participation, tomorrow they can combat extremist messages against labour mobility in the European Union, show that Romanian citizens act civically, in accordance with democratic principles, and, above all, demonstrate once again that Romanians living in the UK care about the fate of this country and want it strongly, in the European Union, alongside Romania.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}]
