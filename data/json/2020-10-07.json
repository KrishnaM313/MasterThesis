The current military confrontation along the line of contact in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict zone is of our utmost concern. It is the largest confrontation since 1993-1994. We have been very engaged on this issue. On the day that fighting erupted, I released a statement as High Representative calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities, de-escalation and a strict observance of the cease-fire. During those days I had several phone calls separately with Armenian and Azerbaijani Foreign Ministers urging both sides to stop hostilities and return to the negotiation table.  Our position is clear: the fighting must stop. Both sides need to re-engage in meaningful negotiation, which, by the way, has not been very fruitful over the last 30 years, without preconditions under the auspices of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs. There cannot be a military solution to the conflict no less an external interference. This position was reinforced by the European Council held on 1 and 2 October.  We have seen extremely worrying reports of a surge in attacks on populated areas which is taking a deadly toll on civilians. We strongly urge the sides to fully observe their international obligations to protect civilian populations, and with the resources we have, we have urgently allocated a small amount of money in humanitarian aid for the affected populations. In fact, we don’t have a lot of information about how the conflict is developing. Detailed information is scarce and there is a lot of fake news.  We see monitoring underground remains suspended, so we don’t have that service. But what we observed is an increasing amount of information which is aimed at mobilising the domestic audiences in both countries and could be used to pull regional actors into the conflict. Media reports need therefore to be examined with great caution because some of the news that has been disseminated, we don’t have confirmation about it.  At this a stage further escalation of the conflict and involvement of regional actors unhappily cannot be excluded. This would seriously threaten the stability of the whole region.  On 30 September I discussed the situation with the Russian Foreign Minister. I also spoke with the Turkish Foreign Minister, the two regional actors which are closer to the conflict. I emphasised the importance of de-escalating, the importance that regional actors refrain from any activity and rhetoric that could inflame things even further. I spoke to the Foreign Ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan during the weekend. I stressed that the increase in civilian casualties is unacceptable. I knew from both sides the actions taken by the other side. Each one of them blames the other for starting and for attacking civilian population from the territory, not from Nagorno-Karabakh itself, the region in dispute, but from Armenia to Azerbaijan and Azerbaijan to Armenia.  The fighting should stop. The Minsk Co-Chairs are going to have meetings this week with the Foreign Affairs Ministers of two countries and the only way of getting out of this situation is that the Minsk Group Co-Chairs pushes for immediate negotiations as soon as possible.  We will continue working with the key partners and try to help stop hostilities because the only solution is to go back to the negotiating table, but this negotiating table has been open for the last 30 years – 30 – without any kind of advance. The war is not an alternative. We have to push both parties to stop fighting and negotiating without preconditioning, but this is for the time being not the case. I’m sorry I cannot inform you more about that because I accept that information is very scarce, and we have to take much care in disseminating news which has not been confirmed. About the situation in Cyprus, I share the concern of the honourable Member who took the floor a moment ago. For sure, this issue of Famagusta was taken into consideration and the European Council also. The opening of this area, which is a closed area according to the cease-fire agreements under the auspices of the United Nations, is a serious violation of this agreement. Yesterday we issued a statement and today the 27 will issue another one asking Turkey to stop doing this activity.  You know that the European Council issued a statement about the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean, and for sure this is not going to help. On the contrary, it is going to increase tension and make it more difficult to reach an agreement on an especially difficult situation for all of us in the Eastern Mediterranean.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2020-10-07.json", "name": "Andrey Kovatchev", "mepid": "97968", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, it is indeed very painful and sad to see killings and people suffering as part of this conflict which has been going on for decades while we, as observers in the international community, do very little, despite the statements we put out.

I would also like to repeat that the violence, the hostilities and the killing of people must stop immediately. The conflict has been surrounded by various claims – as you mentioned, according to Amnesty International even cluster bombs have been used. This needs to be clarified and investigated, as does the involvement of third parties and even Syrian fighters going through Turkey to the conflict area. All violence must stop immediately. The two sides should return to the negotiating table under the umbrella of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group to find a mutually acceptable solution, based on agreed principles, and refrain from the threat of the use of force, which – sadly – has clearly been violated now, territorial integrity and the equal rights of the self-determination of people.

This means negotiations. It means talking to each other. It means diplomacy.  Right now, the only result of the actions of the political leaders is the suffering of ordinary people, killings and people losing their homes. Violence creates violence and this will have long-lasting consequences. If some other interested parties, like Turkey or Russia, really and truly want to invest in ending this conflict, then there is a way, but it’s not by sending fighters to fight in the conflict or by assisting in some other military forum. They can help through diplomacy or by facilitating negotiations.  If you take a look at history, including recent history, the people of South Caucasus, including the people of Armenia and Azerbaijan, have suffered enormously under this political violence. The spiral of violence must be stopped.

As in Syria, Libya and the eastern Mediterranean, it is Erdogan who has just reopened a conflict on the border of Europe. Erdogan's desire to establish himself as the leader of a political Islam, to rebuild the Ottoman Empire, is obvious. It deploys its expansionist policy without any shame. The Erdogan regime must be sanctioned and isolated, but the initiative must also be taken back. At the origin of this nagorno-Karabakh conflict, there is of course the configuration of the internal borders of the former USSR, cleverly organized in such a way as to entangle peoples, to multiply infinitely the references of identity to better establish the overwhelming totalitarianism of communism.  From this situation, the Union, which is concerned in the first place, has not been able to seize on the question of proposing solutions that are realistic, fair and peaceful. Today, Azerbaijan has chosen, by taking the initiative of the offensive to revive this conflict, because its leaders have received strong pledges of support from the Turkish president. Even today, by pushing Azerbaijan to confrontation, Erdogan still chooses to launch a major challenge to European countries by attacking Armenia more directly, with which so many historical and human ties unite us. Erdogan, like a criminal returning to the scene of his crime, shows how little he does about the genocide of the 1.5 million Armenians perpetrated by those who preceded him in power. Words are insufficient, Mr. Borrell. What is the European Union waiting for to put a definitive end to Turkey's accession process to the Eu?

The great failure of the international community is, above all, that, after 28 years of negotiations, it has not been able to resolve this fundamental conflict. Worse still, instead of confidence-building measures, the region has been upgraded. Thus, both warring parties – Armenia and Azerbaijan alike – were armed to the teeth, especially by Russia and Serbia.  In this sense, there are basically only losers in the conflict: firstly, the OSCE Minsk Group as negotiator, secondly, the civilian population in Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh and, of course, Azerbaijan itself. The only group that seems to benefit from the war at the moment is that of the international military observers, as they are currently looking with great interest to Nagorno-Karabakh, where various high-tech weapons are sometimes in use for the first time. This new form of warfare – with the help of armed drones and other precision weapons – is said to be just the beginning of technologically advanced warfare. What can the EU do wisely? Firstly, in the negotiations, it must influence France, Russia and the United States to ensure that they do not continue to side unilaterally with the Armenians. Secondly, it must ensure that NATO partner Turkey does not continue to pour oil on the fire. Thirdly, it must ensure that humanitarian supplies are provided to civilian victims of war.

We should not be surprised by the Azerbaijani approach. For weeks now, increasingly belligerent tones have been heard with constant threats against Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia from Baku. In August, Azerbaijan held joint military exercises with Turkey, during which Turkey pledged its government's support for an Azerbaijani invasion of Nagorno-Karabakh. Cluster bombs are already in use, and credible reports indicate that Ankara has sent Syrian militias to support the Azerbaijani army. This is exactly what Turkey is doing in Libya: it is bringing further instability and even more violence to a region already facing unrest.

The heaviest fighting since the 1990s has also raised concerns about the fate of the Azerbaijani oil and gas pipeline, which is also going to Europe. Although this is a conflict over The Karabakh Plateau, which both Armenia and Azerbaijan want to control, it is dodging that Turkey is also actively involved. As the only NATO Member State and candidate to join the European Union, it is openly supporting one of the warring parties, namely Azerbaijan. And if numerous reports from the region are to be believed, Turkey not only supplies Azerbaijan with weapons and ammunition, but even mediates the arrival of paid mercenaries and jihadists from Syria to fight in Nagorno-Karabakh.

Mr Vice-President, there are cluster bombs in Nagorno Karabakh, there are civilians killed in Nagorno Karabakh, there are fighters funded by Turkey who came from Syria to Nagorno Karabakh, and if we have the first impression that Turkey is opposed to Russia in the region, ultimately Turkey and Russia serve the same objective: to limit the diversification of the European Union's energy sources.

I think your message is clear. It has been repeated 65 times, with different voices, but expressing the same concern and the same request to act. Next Monday, I will bring your voice to the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg, where we will have to follow up on the situation and see what we can decide about it.  But the European Council has made it very clear that they consider that the frame in which to mediate and to act on this conflict is the OSCE Minsk Group Co—Chairs. This was clearly what the European Council said. They asked me to support the work of the OSCE Minsk Group Co—Chairs. That’s what we are doing. But we have to allow this group of people to work because it is the only group that is being recognised by the two sides. I think that Mr Bütikofer is right when he says that there are some new things in this conflict. One is that the Americans are withdrawing and Turkey is taking a stronger, much more assertive, position. The European Council also discussed the relationship with Turkey – and I invite you to listen to the conclusions of the European Council – and said that, in December, we will take stock of the evolution of the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean and all the conflicts in which Turkey is more or less involved in order to take decisions on how we continue our relationship with the country. We are going to continue calling for a ceasefire and I will bring your voice to the Foreign Affairs Council of Ministers. We will remind both sides of the obligation to protect civilians under international humanitarian law and keep working with Turkey in order to build a constructive contribution to the conflict settlement and help the efforts to stop the hostilities.  We have a Special Representative for the South Caucasus, who is there and who is in touch with both sides. Yesterday, the Turkish Minister was in Baku and I was really concerned when I saw that he was expressing full support for Azerbaijan. My last talk with the Azerbaijan Minister was also very worrying because he was clearly saying that the fight will continue until Armenia accepts a concrete schedule for withdrawing from Nagorno—Karabakh, which is a precondition for talks. It is very difficult. The situation is becoming worse and worse. All of you have been asking us to act, but I’ve been hearing very few concrete versions of the verb ‘act’. What do you mean by ‘act’? We can do what we can do, but this is the way that we have to take this situation. We’ll do whatever we can do in order, as I said, to support the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs, which is the frame that the European Council decided to support in order to look for a negotiated solution, pushing both sides to end the fighting, and especially putting pressure on Turkey not to continue intervening.  But by act if you mean take military action, that is completely out of the question. We are going to do what we can do as the European Union with the resources that we have on the diplomatic arena, and wait for December, as decided by the European Council, and see what happens from now until December to review our relationship with Turkey. This is what the European Council decided after a long discussion on Turkey and our relations with Turkey and I have to stick to that. I will obey, and I will try to implement, the mandate of the European Council in order to support the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs that I hope this week will have meetings with the Foreign Affairs Minister of Azerbaijan and I hope also with Armenia.

So, if you don't mind, I will use the Spanish language, which, after all, is the second most spoken language in the world. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this House has already dealt many times with the various crises which hit Venezuela. And the gradual collapse of what was once one of the richest countries in the Western world, in the Western Hemisphere, is today one of the great tragedies of our time, so I can only share your interest and concern about the situation in which the people of Venezuela are located. And not only Venezuela, but the entire region, which is affected by the extraordinary number of people who have left that country. We know the situation in Venezuela: how Venezuelan society is deeply fractured, also politically. Even the opposition itself does not have the necessary unity to deal with this dramatic situation; a situation that has been well described to us by the recent reports of the investigative mission and, above all, by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. And it is obvious to say ⸺ we have said many times⸺ that we condemn the violation of human rights in Venezuela and for this reason it is why we have been working with the civil society of that country for a long time and in particular during this summer.  I am not going to dwell on explaining the political situation in Venezuela — you know it well — but I want to focus my speech on the title of the appeal and explain to you the developments since last July, when we started a task, in coordination with the Member States of the European Union and with the support of the Latin American partners of the International Contact Group, to try to help find a democratic and peaceful solution to the situation that Venezuela is going through. And the first step in trying to ⸺intent, I say right⸺ to try⸺ to get out of the political strimate in which Venezuela is located was to promote the framework for credible legislative elections, if such a thing were possible. But believe me, I haven't thrown myself into the ring like a spontaneous one, armed with my simple little mule. I started doing so because this was requested by the G4, led by President Guaidó, to transfer to the regime the minimum conditions that the opposition deemed necessary to be able to participate in a credible electoral process. So I did and, throughout the month of August, throughout the summer, I have maintained contacts by videoconference, telephones, both with the G4 and with other opposition leaders, such as, of course, with Mr Maduro's Government, and I have made public statements, both in formal for a and at the ministerial meeting of the International Contact Group, which took place on the return of summer on 17 September, and at the Foreign Affairs Council on 21 September. During The month of August, I issued statements explaining that the conditions were not given so that the elections called for 6 December could be regarded as free and participatory, but at the same time I insisted both on the Government and the opposition that they should try to find an approximation of their positions in order to make possible an election in which the European Union could participate as an observer. All this information is public and has always been public. On the return of summer, one of the opposition leaders, Mr. Capriles, He expressed his intention to participate in the elections if the conditions for this were met, at the same time as others, starting with President Guaidó himself, already considered it impossible that this could happen, but they were not against an attempt to extend the electoral deadline in order to be able to continue negotiating and to be able to continue to consider the possibility of an electoral observation on our part, which could only happen, as you know very well, if the conditions for this were previously met.  At the contact group meeting and in the Foreign Affairs Council I had the greatest support to continue contacts with the Government to see if it was possible to agree on an extension of the electoral deadline, as an essential condition for anything else, because, as you know, an election observation mission first goes on to send an election exploration mission, which returns with a report on whether or not the conditions necessary to be able to send an observation mission are met. The decision to send the observation mission is preceded by an exploration mission that analyses the situation on the ground, and that takes a minimum of five or six months and therefore any attempt was inconsistent with the date of December 6. It was therefore necessary to explore the possibility, with which everyone agreed, that these elections should be postponed. And, to speed up contacts, which I ⸺insisto⸺ have been developing by phone and videoconference for three months, I decided to send two officials from our External Action Service to contact all political actors on the ground and see what the state of the situation was. This has created a certain strangeness in some of the honourable Members, as if it were something new. But this is a totally common diplomatic practice. During the past year there were three missions of the International Contact Group with various formats, all led by a senior official of the European Union and with the same objective as the latter. The Norwegian Government, with which we have collaborated, has also sent several missions to try to unlock political stagnation, the latter also over the past summer. This mission, before leaving, informed the Member States of the European Union in writing, so that the thing about calling it clandestine..., come on, that I know the clandestine activities are not communicated in writing to all Member States before they take place. And in Venezuela these two senior officials met with a wide range of representatives from sectors. They spoke and listened to more than seventy people. To be secret, there has been no problem spreading its activity as much as has been necessary. Of course, they met with the President of the National Assembly, Mr. Guaidó, president in charge of the country, who supported efforts to help achieve, to try to achieve, an electoral postponement, being very skeptical about it. They met with all opposition forces, starting with the G4. The representatives of this group insisted on the necessary conditions for democratic and transparent elections, which I was brought forward with and which I myself conveyed to the Government during my contacts in July and August. And they also held talks with Mr. Guaidó's former chief of staff, Mr Roberto Marrero, recently released from prison and who unfortunately has not been allowed to come to Spain, as was his wish. They also met with Don Henrique Capriles and two of his colleagues. They urged the European Union to keep all channels of communication open and to take this opportunity to avoid, try to avoid, for Venezuela to move even further into political and social chaos that plagues it. They had the opportunity to meet with two representatives of the Maduro regime, Minister Rodriguez and Miranda State Governor Hector Rodriguez, in response to the regime's invitation to the European Union to observe the December elections. Yes, we had a specific request; this is the first time the European Union has been asked to observe the elections. First, they called for an election accompanying mission. We explain that such a thing did not exist, that the European Union has a rules of procedure, established, which does not accompany it, which it observes. And that, as I have told you, goes through a very careful process of, first, an exploration and then, where appropriate, observation. We explained that if they wanted to study the possibilities of an election observation mission, we had to go through this process and that this inevitably led to a delay, because otherwise we had nothing to talk about.  The officials posted there were not there to negotiate, but simply to convey this important message to all political sectors and receive their response. Contacts were also maintained with representatives of the so-called National Dialogue Table and henri Falcón. It was the only group against the postponement of the election. They held meetings with the Venezuelan Episcopal Conference, which plays a key role in society, and which they already know has called for the opposition to participate in the electoral process and in providing assistance to the Venezuelan people in the face of the current humanitarian crisis. The representatives of the Episcopal Conference, as they had stated by letter published a few weeks ago, warned that, if the opportunity to run for this election were to pass, the vacant political space and full control of all institutions would be left to the Maduro regime. They met with partners in civil society, academia and the business world. And I believe that in Caracas there was broad support for the work of this mission and the european Union's efforts to help achieve the space needed for dialogue, which remains our objective. Because the European Union is regarded by all or most partners as the only actor who can talk to all factions and who can do it with credibility. And that is what we are trying to do is to defend a Union with a geopolitical dimension. The other clear message we received is that the vast majority of the opposition would support a postponement of elections to allow time to improve the conditions under which elections could be held, which might have allowed us to send an election observation mission. But the predominant view is that while clearly the decision to postpone elections alone is not a solution, it would be a way to keep the door open to political negotiation. However, as you know, the Government, after that mission, has responded in a clear and resounding manner, saying that in no way will the elections be postponed because the Venezuelan Constitution prevents it, as there is a very clear mandate that they must be done on a certain date, before the end of this year, which , obviously, it closes any possibility for the dialogue to continue in the perspective I have explained to you before. We believe that the only way out of the impasse Venezuela is in will be through dialogue and political negotiation between Venezuelan forces. There will not be a single cathartic event that will make the many crises that hit the country disappear. And our role, our will, is to help find a way that responds to the needs and demands of the Venezuelan people. And, after what has happened and I have listened to each other, and in particular, having received, not in response to our letters, which responded to theirs, but as public statements, the message that the elections will not be postponed, the European Union will obviously not even be able to consider, or even consider, the sending of the election observation mission. This would require not only respect for democratic standards, which, as I have stated on several occasions, are not given or continue to be given, since it has not been possible to change them, but also, as I have explained, a realistic timetable. I believe that the press release of the Maduro regime, which refuses to postpone the elections on the grounds that it cannot do so by constitutional mandate, only serves to make the political situation in Venezuela worse. We will continue to support all efforts to make a political, peaceful and democratic exit from the crisis that the Venezuelan people are suffering, so that they can overcome it as they deserve.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 79, "date": "2020-10-07.json", "name": "Dolors Montserrat", "mepid": "197711", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, Mr Borrell, we are concerned to know that you, as Vice-President and High Representative — by the way, both positions cannot be dissociate — on 23 September sent a Semi-Island mission to negotiate with the Maduro dictatorship the postponement of elections. Seven days earlier, the devastating United Nations report accusing Maduro's regime of human rights violations and crimes against humanity was published, which you have hardly mentioned. Six days earlier, you met with the Contact Group, which gives you the mandate to explore the delay of fraudulent elections in Venezuela. Three days earlier, you met with eu foreign ministers, to which you explained this mandate, but in both meetings you avoided mentioning any mission. So I ask you: when did you organize the clandestine mission? Perhaps when the regime conveys concern about this devastating United Nations report? Did the regime ask you for a political gesture? The exchange was: you send them a diplomatic mission and the regime delays elections and you guarantee them an exploratory mission for those future elections? And all this without a single condition; doesn't require a presidential election. Without presidential, we didn't leave the regime. It does not even require them to immediately release all political prisoners, nor the return of forced exiles, nor the cessation of repression.  We are very concerned that you have not informed the clandestine mission or the ministers of the twenty-seven, the Commission, or this Parliament, but even more serious is that you have ignored the Venezuelan Democrats represented by President Juan Guaidó, recognised by this Parliament and 25 Member States.  A chain of lies and half-truths do not make a truth, but confirmation that it hides deeply undemocratic contacts. Don't offer us disguises today, tell us the whole truth. The mission has been the means, the instrument to whiten the regime, weaken and divide those who oppose Maduro, and the end result will be a new hoax by Maduro, which will prolong the suffering of the Venezuelan people with more violence, more poverty and less freedom.

Because it is the only way out and because it is the European position, and for that, of course, diplomacy and dialogue to find a way out with democratic conditions — which, as has been explained today, are not the only way out.  Secondly, I would like to reflect with you on the fact that, very often, in this House, we make crosses and regret the irrelevance we have in the conflicts in our neighbourhood, to find a way out—we say this very often. As it turns out that we have a conflict like Venezuela's, a very serious situation like Venezuela's, where we are given the capacity to dialogue to play a constructive role, and there, where we can act and when we act, we find false prefabricated controversies. That's the reality.  Thirdly, this Parliament cares a lot about Venezuela. We have made six debates as far as we have been in the legislature, thirteen Resolutions in five years; there's been nothing we've debated so much: that indicates he cares.

Because he did not send or ask the opposition to stand before the regime to call an election or postpone them; it was at your request, guaidó and the G4 did not ask for it, you proposed it. And if you start by making an argument missing the truth, we have a problem, because everything else falls.  Everything else falls: it was you who proposed, after having conversations with the regime, that the opposition give you minimum conditions to participate in fraudulent elections, because Mr Maduro's government does not have the capacity to call them, because remember that it is an illegitimate government. The opposition— as you systematically call it, confronting that government — is what this House recognizes as a legitimate government, and the National Assembly as Venezuela's only democratic body.  So, after receiving the umpteenth not from the regime in August, you propose a mission in September — without knowledge, until they are flying, from the opposition — so that it is not known what to offer the regime again. Yes: defer fraudulent elections without having the minimum conditions to be held. What do you get out of that? To send a very bad message to the whole of Venezuela: that it is intended to reach an agreement with the one who has no legitimacy to call an election.  Finally, Mr Borrell, look, as you know, on 5 January the mandate of the House expires. That's what maduro's government expects because it's going to be hands-free. So the question is: will you, since the elections of 6 December will not be democratic and your results will not be recognized, will support the constitutional continuity of the mandate of the present Assembly until true free and democratic elections can be held in Venezuela?

First, that all the processes that have been carried out with the Venezuelan Government, from Mr Zapatero to the Vatican, to everyone else, have served nothing but to prolong the suffering and maintenance of the Maduro regime. That Maduro's last slam, which has given his legitimate efforts and which I support and understand, and which I do not understand as condemned, has meant that he remains in the same very difficult situation.

However, even knowing the conclusions of the united Nations independent mission, which accuse Maduro's regime of crimes against humanity, you organized a mission to negotiate with these human rights violators the postponement of fraudulent elections. And I said \"regime\" and not \"Government\", because this House and twenty-five member countries of the European Union only recognize as a legitimate government the National Assembly, chaired by Juan Guaidó. As a high representative, one of its responsibilities is to ensure the coherence of the European Union's external action. Would you send a mission to Belarus to negotiate with that regime the future elections organized by Lukashenko himself? Are there guarantees that allow transparent, democratic and credible elections to be held in Venezuela? The ultimate goal of Maduro's dictatorship is to stay in power at all costs.

You said it: a chain of lies and half-truths does not make a truth, apply the story. What you and others have done is just that: a chain of lies and half-truths. You have organized an un baseless scandal, simply to agitate and, I fear, fight the Spanish Government. But this is not the Race of Saint Jerome, this is not the Spanish Parliament. If you want to discuss Spanish politics, do it in Madrid. Nor am I already the foreign minister of Mr Sanchez's government.  (Various reactions) And you have been President of the European Parliament and you should keep your composure. (Various reactions) Mr. President, may I continue? Can I continue without having to suffer Mr. Tajani's interruptions? Thanks a lot.  And everything you've said now about semiclandestine. Look, clandestineness, like some attributes of the physiology of the human body, is or isn't: it's clandestine or not clandestine. You cannot say that it is a secret or clandestine mission in half, when I have explained to you that we have passed through the International Contact Group, where we have clearly said that we would continue to contact all political actors at the necessary levels, and everyone agreed. And I have informed the Council of Foreign Ministers that we would continue to contact all political actors by all necessary and appropriate means.  What's with the sacrament? What's with the turmoil of secrets and plots because you wanted to make a gesture for the Spanish government to cut it? But, Mrs. Montserrat, that's all ridiculous, frankly. What are you guys complaining about? What do they find critical in doing the diplomatic mission that we have to do and that we have been doing for months simply because, instead of doing it on the phone, we do it in person?  Let us see: elections in Belarus have been neither free nor transparent nor participatory. Aren't you? And yet the opposition in Belarus has participated in them. Do you think the opposition's involvement in Belarus has bleached Mr Lukashenko's regime? Do you think that such participation has served to legitimize Mr Lukashenko's regime? Of course not, at all, on the contrary. Precisely this participation has served as a lever to highlight the falsity of these elections and combat it.  But how is Mr Maduro's regime bleached by sending an official to speak to everyone in Venezuela? Please, a little seriousness. What's he bleaching about? What is it legitimized in? When we've been saying and we keep saying what we think about Mr Maduro's regime. We're doing what's right for us to do. That I have not informed the European Parliament before? Of course not. I have no obligation or need to do so. My constitution is the Foreign Affairs Council, it is the International Contact Group.  And, well, what I was missing is for someone to tell me that I had no contact with the opposition to move Mr Maduro's regime to its conditions. Oh, isn't it? Well, all right, look: a document with five specific points was provided to me by the opposition to get it to Mr Maduro's regime and wait for his answer. Yes, I have tried to see whether there was any chance, certainly little, of whether it was certainly unlikely that the positions of the Government, Mr Maduro's regime and the opposition could approach. And you tell me: would you send someone to Belarus to try to approach positions? Yes, of course I do. Of course. If we could send someone to Belarus tomorrow to try to create a national political dialogue, of course we would; We've offered it. But what world do they live in? But what world do they live in?  The President of the European Council has called or tried to call Mr Lukashenko. He didn't make it, but if he'd been on the phone, I'd have talked to him. Is that bleaching him? Is that legitimizing him? What are you really worried about? Are you concerned about the fate of the Venezuelan people? I am not saying no, to me too, and I do not accept lessons on how I have to conduct the task of the high representative in this particular case. I did what I had to do and I'd do it again.  We haven't been successful. But I think it was necessary. I think it was necessary to try to find a way of approximation, which is the only way out of the situation in Venezuela, and to encourage and foster political dialogue, and political dialogue, because there have been representatives of the opposition who have been talking to the regime: Mr Capriles, without going any further, who has made public demonstrations saying 'if the conditions were met, I would participate'. If the conditions were to occur, but the conditions will not fall from the sky, they will not arise by spontaneous generation, we must work them, we must discuss them.  What do you think the Norwegian Government has been doing, that it has been perfectly aware of what we have done and which has supported us? What do you think the Norwegian government has been doing? Well, to encourage this dialogue, not succeed either, but deep down what we have tried to do is the same thing that the Norwegian Government has done, and it will continue to try and we will continue to try, because we do not support military solutions, because we do not support military interventions abroad to solve that problem, because the only solution is precisely dialogue and the pact between Venezuela's political forces. And that, if we can encourage it, we will. And that's what I've been doing, and I've been doing it with full knowledge of the G4 group, with whom I've had several video conferences this summer. Now it's going to turn out I haven't been talking to them? And I have done so with full awareness that this was going to be exploited by those who are more interested in stirring political waters than in seeking a solution to Venezuela's problem, and also knowing that it would also receive criticism from those who say that we did not want to participate, once again, in the electoral process. No, we haven't been able to participate. No, Mrs. Pereira, we haven't been able to participate. Because, to participate,\" I insist, \"there is a rule process, which goes through an election exploration mission, which comes back with a report and says whether or not the conditions are met, and, if it happens—and it would be up to me to judge it—a process is put in place that those who work in the field of electoral observations know to be long and complex , which cannot be done with less than four or five months. And that is what I told the Government of Venezuela by letter before sending that mission: to know that we must first see if conditions are met, that they are not given today, and that then we would need five months to participate.  The answer has been what it is, and unfortunately I am afraid that this will continue to push Venezuela towards an even more difficult situation, to a situation of deinstitutionalization. The National Assembly is now a democratically elected assembly. It's the only institution that is. You say presidential election. Yes, well, but we are now talking about the legislative ones, which are fixed date, because that House reaches the end of its mandate and we must choose a new one. Do you think it's wrong for us to try to discuss how this election can be held? What have we committed ourselves to? What have we given in to? How did we bleach? What have we legitimized? Absolutely nothing.  Mr López, I understand that if I were in your shoes and had a child housed in the Embassy of Spain, you would have an emotional burden that would surely make me say the same thing you said, but please don't say it's a secret mission. Secret missions are not communicated by letter to all Member States. Don't say we've gone to whiten Mr. Maduro's regime. You know what my opinion is about that regime.  You know that your son was welcomed to the Embassy of Spain when I was Minister of Foreign Affairs and that I am very proud to have managed to contribute to something to that.  My commitment to democracy in Venezuela does not have to be validated by you; is proven by the facts, and what we have done now does not denies it. It's a risky effort. It's a criticized effort. You are criticising it much more than it deserves, and on the other side too, to try to find a solution and help the opposition to feel stronger and more supported by the international community and the European Union when talking to the Government.  Unfortunately, we have not succeeded, if the Government of Venezuela, Mr Maduro's regime, had told me, before he sent the mission, 'it is not worth coming because I am not going to change the electoral date, because the Constitution forbids me', as they are saying now, then yes, we certainly would not have gone. For what? But that wasn't so clear, that wasn't so clear, in all the discussions we've had directly, through the opposition, that wasn't so clear. There was a little light of hope. There was a small possibility, and I felt compelled to explore it, to try to see if there was anything that could be done to advance this political dialogue which, at the end of the day, will one day be the only solution for the people of Venezuela.

Iran is in the middle of a difficult period. COVID-19 is affecting the country severely with more than 3 000 new infections every day, half a million to-date, and at least 27 000 deaths. The COVID crisis is further deepening Iran’s existing economic difficulties.  Following the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the so-called JCPOA, Iran had the legitimate expectation that this nuclear deal will result in more concrete economic benefits. Yet, after the regrettable US departure from the agreement and the reinstatement of severe sanctions, the overall economic figures speak for themselves.  The International Monetary Fund is predicting a 10% drop in GDP this year; 8.5% last year. Unemployment is at 16%. The Iranian Rial has lost almost half its value towards the US dollar. Trade with the European Union has decreased.  In addition, Iran is experiencing shortages of important humanitarian items, like personal protective equipment and medicine that could help in fighting COVID. There is a severe shortage of all capacities to fight COVID. As the European Union, we were quick to provide humanitarian support with an air bridge and we keep strongly advocating, together with the UN Secretary-General, that sanctions must not impede humanitarian trade.  Together with European Union Member States, we also keep looking at ways to encourage more legitimate trade between the EU and Iran – including through the EU-Iran trading mechanism (INSTEX) – but we need to do more. These difficulties have also had a political impact in Iran. Not least at the parliamentary election earlier this year. We have seen a strengthening of those opposed to the nuclear deal, who are distrustful of the West and who do not support diplomacy and engagement.  Together with our European and international partners, we are working hard to make sure that diplomacy with Iran continues to be possible. We have also witnessed several deeply concerning human—rights developments recently.  This includes the treatment of Nasrin Sotoudeh and the many other political prisoners who remain in prison, whose health is at risk and should be released on humanitarian grounds, but at the very least have prompt access to medical assistance if they require it. We also condemn publicly the execution of the Iranian wrestler, Navid Afkari, and call on the Iranian authorities to investigate allegations that he was tortured in detention.  We underline to all our partners and not just Iran, that the perpetrators of such acts must be held accountable. We continue to engage the Iranian authorities on their distressing practice of arbitrarily detaining European Union—Iranian dual nationals. We acknowledge the temporary release of French citizen Fariba Adelkhah. No individual should be used as a pawn, and I want once again urge the Iranian authorities to cease this policy. Mr President, honourable members, let me finish with some remarks on the nuclear agreement.  I want to be clear, as coordinator – because the High Representative acts as coordinator of the JCPOA – I will continue to do everything possible to ensure the preservation and full implementation of the nuclear deal by all parties.  Why is this so important? Because it is in our very own European security interest, and because the agreement continues to deliver. Without the nuclear deal, Iran could have developed a nuclear weapon by now, with all the security implications for the region and beyond.  Of course, I am very concerned about Iran’s reduced implementation of its JCPOA nuclear commitments, following the US withdrawal from the agreement two years ago. I do believe that full implementation of the nuclear deal by Iran and other parties remain crucial to our efforts to preserve it.  However, we should not forget that even though the amount of nuclear material Iran possesses today is more than it had two years ago, it is still far less than the 10 tonnes of enriched uranium that Iran possessed before the agreement.  We know that this is thanks to the JCPOA. Iran is the most monitored country in the world by the International Atomic Energy Agency, with now almost 400 inspections per year. If we were to lose the agreement, we would lose such critical information about their nuclear programme. During recent weeks, a great amount of attention has been devoted to attempts by United States to bring back the United Nations Iran sanctions, and here I want to be very clear also. Once more: bringing back these sanctions would have meant the end of the JCPOA.  Thirteen members of the Security Council – thirteen, including all European members – rejected this approach and underlined the importance of keeping the agreement in place. In this way supporting my understanding that the US are no longer part of the JCPOA because they freely decided to withdraw from it.  They were also very clear that after leaving the agreement in 2018, the United States was not in a position to initiate the so—called ‘snapback process’ of bringing back United Nations sanctions under the UN Security Council resolution 2231.  As JCPOA coordinator, I just want to reiterate that all sanctions-lifting commitments under the agreement remain in place. I want to reiterate that all sanctions-lifting commitments under the agreement, remain in place.  I will personally continue to remain engaged on all of these issues, knowing that you are being criticized both parts when you take this stance, and I count on the strong backing of this Parliament and the Council to promote a holistic approach to Iran, that takes into account different facets of our bilateral relationship.  Engagement with Iran on all these issues remains in the European Union’s vital and strategic interest and that’s why we are approaching the issue the way we do.

I would like to echo your justified words on the urgent need to ensure the preservation and the implementation of the JCPOA by all parties. This multilateral agreement, as we have underlined many times in this European Parliament, is a crucial achievement of European diplomacy. It remains a key pillar of the global non—proliferation architecture, contributing to regional security and stability and it addresses Iran’s nuclear programme in a comprehensive manner. Colleagues, in 2018 the Foreign Affairs Committee visited Iran and Saudi Arabia. We had very interesting talks in Riyadh and Tehran and our key message was consistently a de—escalation in the region is a must. Today, more than two years later, this is more needed than ever before and that’s why, dear High Representative, I would like to underline what you announced as regards the snapback mechanism. All parties involved should do their utmost to preserve the JCPOA and to refrain from any action that could be perceived as an escalation in this current situation.

The European Union has committed itself to its survival and full implementation. As some would add, the deal is still alive but could be in a better health condition. Hopefully, the United States will soon enough return to deal and towards the restoration of multilateralism in general, and Iran will also uphold its commitments as stated in the Treaty. Our support to the nuclear deal, however, does not mean that we should be shy calling out Iran for its role in conflicts in Syria and Yemen, its action in the Strait of Hormuz and attacks on US troops in Iraq. We are most definitely not indifferent towards the situation of human rights in Iran, which is appalling. A Sakharov Prize awardee Nasrin Sotoudeh recently was on hunger strike, and the latest case of execution of Navid Afkari deserves our strongest condemnation. A number of dual EU-Iranian citizens are still unjustly detained in Iran. We support the EEAS Iran task force and its balanced comprehensive approach, but today we have to make it clear that if Iran wants continued European Union engagement, it needs to dramatically improve its human rights record.

I admit, most rivals are dependent on who makes the decisions in the beginning of next year in Washington, but right now in the next couple of months, we have an expiring weapons embargo and there is no movement from the USA to be expected, which creates a daunting challenge, I must say, to try to restrain and limit arms sales to Iran, and here lies a task for Europe. And I was very pleased to learn that a while ago that European efforts to restrain, to limit, or at least to delay arms sales to Iran within the P5+1 framework were underway. Any alternative means to find a solution is welcome because Beijing will sell its arms. But it’s been quiet ever since, and therefore I ask for some assurance. Are we still on the same page? Are talks with Europe, with Beijing and Moscow ongoing? Can you assure me that we are doing everything that we can to restrain? Is there still hope to limit arms sales?

Tehran sometimes worries for very objective reasons and sometimes for causes that have nothing to do with international law. Unfortunately, the voice of the European Union is not being heard.

Second, because we make the eyes soft to the Arab powers without almost never reminding that they sometimes do worse than Iran. Finally, because we are not free in Iran because of the unacceptable extraterritoriality of American law. The European Union has no interest in accepting Iran's ambition to form a Shiite crescent from Tehran to Beirut, but it will only be credible when it acts with the same vigour against Ottoman imperialism or against the manipulation of Sunni populations by Gulf money. European nations know the Middle East better than the United States, it is time that we free ourselves from the straitjacket of NATO and Atlanticism to regain credibility and independence on issues in this region.  Yes, we must establish a dialogue with Iran, a dialogue that does not exclude any of the hot topics such as the disarmament of Iraqi militias or the maintenance of the death penalty for apostasy.

These women do not have the privilege of the media reporting on them on a daily basis. These women have no lawyers; we must protect these women through our attention.

The protests that broke out on 25 November last year were brutally suppressed by the authorities, who used unnecessary or excessive force and arbitrarily detained peaceful demonstrators. Since then, the judiciary and security forces have continued to use rough provisions of the penal code to arrest and prosecute activists, against freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.

Ladies and gentlemen, we also need sanctions against those responsible for any violation of human rights, wherever they may be!

We have been here for four hours, and we are reaching the end of this intense debate about three very important issues. Many things have been said, and I agree with many of them. I could say exactly what Mr Gahler said at the end: the worst thing would be if Iran were to become nuclear. Thanks to this deal, it’s not nuclear. Others Members have said the same thing; I cannot mention all of them. So to try to keep the JCPOA alive – although, as Mr Bütikofer has said, it is very weak because the withdrawal of the US is certainly something that jeopardises its existence and the continuity – to keep it working, even at a lower regime, is not contradictory with the importance that we have to give to the situation of human rights in Iran. I know that this is something that all Parliament is very concerned about and I can assure you that we will continue working in order to put our concerns, our rejection of the executions and detentions that have been mentioned here today before the Iranian authorities. We will do that in collaboration with the German Embassy in Tehran, which is currently acting as our local representation since we don’t have a European delegation on the ground. And Mr Bütikofer is also right: we have to look further at whatever is going to happen in the US after the next elections. It is not sure that the JCPOA will survive. We have to look for a new agreement. Is it possible? Remember how difficult it was to reach this agreement, how many years of tough work were required to rebuild the agreement in order to adapt it to the new circumstances, and even enlarging it could be good, if possible. It will depend very much on the political landscape in January next year. In the meantime, about the arms embargo: I want to stress that we Europeans will continue to put our arms embargo in place. Our arms embargo, the comprehensive arms embargo of the European Union – not the JCPOA arms embargo – will continue into 2023. But we cannot say that we fight to keep the JCPOA alive and, at the same time, to impose an arms embargo on the JCPOA itself – what is considered part of it – and ban. On that, we cannot share the position of the US as they didn’t share 13 Members of the Security Council. All I know is we are trying to do our best in order to increase trade with Iran. It is very difficult because the American sanctions are very powerful, but the Iran deal is not just a nuclear deal. It is a dual task. It is a nuclear deal on the one side and an economic deal on the other, and one thing goes with the other. We cannot pretend that Iran fulfils all its nuclear obligations and at the same time not get any kind of reward on the economic side. This is a delicate balance. Let’s try to work on two things at the same time: the nuclear agreement and human rights. We will continue fighting to keep the nuclear agreement alive and working and at the same time we will continue working in order to make the Iranian authorities aware that respect for human rights is a sine qua non for us to engage with them. And on both points I need the support of the European Parliament and a realistic approach to one of the most important problems for our security, because without the JCPOA today Iran would be a nuclear power and then we would be in a completely different scenario, in a completely different situation. I think that this achievement for European diplomacy, which took a lot of effort from Javier Solana until Ms Mogherini – a lot of people have been working on that – deserves to be preserved, deserves to be continued, deserves to be facilitating a non-nuclear Iran, and it also gives us leverage to engage with Iran on these other very important issues, such as human rights, which I know the Members of this Parliament are very attached to, as I am. You can count on the External Action Service to engage on this issue. The two of them can go in parallel; one things doesn’t prevent the other.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. You know that I represent the Council here and I speak for the Council; nevertheless, I would also like to make a few comments from the point of view of the German Federal Government. I would like to reassure you that my government takes this fraud scandal very seriously. That is why we have now launched an investigation into this. We are working on concrete reform proposals aimed at strengthening accounting enforcement and the effectiveness of our supervisors. In the meantime, we have also been carrying out parliamentary investigations in Germany, which we support equally unreservedly and with commitment. It is precisely these parliamentary investigations that will be able to help to identify the necessary reforms in the areas of accounting, auditing and supervision, but then also to implement them. That is our common interest. Let us be honest: the events surrounding the serious Wirecard fraud scandal have cast a very poor light on our capital markets, the role of auditors, corporate governance and enforcement systems. It is therefore now up to us to restore much-needed confidence in our markets.  We therefore also share the concerns expressed by the European Parliament. That is why the Finance Ministers have also begun to hold a debate on the adequacy of audit rules and the European Union's enforcement system, as well as on whether we need a stronger supervisory body at EU level to ensure the stability of our capital markets. We must learn the right lessons from this fraud scandal, and I am sure that we can best do this together in the context of the common market. The Council, and I will assure you once again, ladies and gentlemen, will treat the Wirecard issue as a priority. We intend to present ambitious Council conclusions on strengthening the Capital Markets Union before the end of our Presidency, and this will also give us the opportunity to discuss this matter in the context of a wider debate on the Capital Markets Union and to find a politically coordinated response to this serious fraud scandal. However, the answer to this fraud scandal cannot be simply to point the finger at the supervisory authorities or to give European agencies more powers, more powers. There are also, honourable Members, other areas that need to be addressed urgently and which must ensure that such a situation never happens again. We need to look at the rules in the field of auditing and the role of auditors on the capital markets. Similarly, we need to discuss conflicts of interest between business sectors, advice and auditing, and we also need to think about how we regulate the supervisory framework for certain service providers, and we must ask ourselves whether the rules in force to date have also been balanced responsibly and responsibly enough. This is all the more true because the financing of the EU economy from a variety of sources must remain a central policy objective. Markets in the European Union must be able to retain their attractiveness for investment and financing, and EU businesses must retain access to a wide range of sources of finance. After one of the most serious crises we have ever experienced, our companies now, at this difficult time, need good financing conditions in order to restore their own resources and capital at a reasonable cost. This can only be achieved if we regain confidence – confidence in European capital markets. That must be our common interest.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 147, "date": "2020-10-07.json", "name": "Valdis Dombrovskis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Executive Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, the Commission welcomes today’s debate. It is essential to investigate fully whether EU investors were fully protected in the Wirecard case, as provided for by European legislation. We must draw all lessons that are necessary to ensure that cases like Wirecard are detected and addressed immediately. We simply cannot allow again that a company that is part of a major stock market index, that is regulated and overseen by national supervisors, and whose auditor is one of the so—called ‘Big Four’, could collapse in such a way, wiping off EUR 22 billion of market capitalisation. Every aspect needs to be looked at – from reporting requirements to auditors and supervision. This is why the Commission has been following this case very closely. As soon as Wirecard announced that it would file for insolvency, we asked the European Securities and Markets Authority to carry out a preliminary investigation on what happened.  The Commission welcomed the preliminary considerations that ESMA published on 15 July. We expect further results by the end of this month from the fast-track Peer Review of enforcement activities that ESMA has announced, and from the ongoing investigations by the various national authorities. It is too early to draw definitive conclusions about the causes of Wirecard’s collapse before those investigations have been completed. Having said that, it seems that the principal cause of the collapse is financial reporting fraud, potentially perpetrated over several years. We can and should already start reflecting on how to better protect investors in the EU from such failures in the future. EU rules and the way they are applied aim to eliminate risk of financial reporting fraud as much as possible. They set out three lines of defence to ensure that financial reports issued by listed companies present a true and fair view of a company’s financial position. This is very important to ensure that investors in those companies have all the information they need and are protected. The first line of defence is at the level of the company. EU law requires that EU companies with securities listed on an EU regulated market establish an audit committee. A majority of members of this committee must be independent of the audited entity. The audit committee has a broad range of responsibilities. For example, it must oversee the work of the statutory auditor. It must ensure the effectiveness of the company’s internal quality control and risk management systems and, where applicable, its internal audit. The EU law also requires disclosure of information about the company’s internal control and risk management systems in relation to the financial reporting process.  The second line of defence is at the level of the auditors themselves. EU rules require independent external audits. They aim to ensure high quality audits based on professional skills, independence and professional scepticism. Auditors must signal any issue that could materially affect the judgement of investors and other users of financial information provided by companies. The auditor of listed companies must also report suspected irregularities, including fraud, to the authorities. The third line of defence is at the level of supervision. National authorities must carry out the daily supervision of financial reporting by companies listed on regulated markets. Competent authorities must ensure that financial statements are drawn up in accordance with the relevant reporting framework and that they take appropriate measures when this is not the case. EU legislation on audits also requires national authorities to supervise the activities of statutory auditors. If appropriate, national authorities should also take enforcement actions, including by imposing sanctions. Supervision is a crucial element of EU policy, at a time when European financial markets are rapidly evolving. New types of business models and players bring innovation and benefits to citizens and companies, both in terms of cost and greater competition. But they need to be supervised in accordance with the regulatory framework. The Wirecard case raises serious questions about the effectiveness of all the three lines of defence. We need to take necessary actions on all fronts, including amending EU law where needed. The Commission has already identified certain areas that are worth exploring. On corporate governance, these may include reinforcing a listed company’s management responsibility for the design and proper functioning of internal controls of financial reporting. We could also propose to require compliance with corporate governance requirements like establishing an audit committee as a condition for listing on a regulated market. On external audit, changes could include reinforcing the role of auditors as regards the risks of fraud and the effectiveness of internal controls on financial reporting. On supervision, we could consider strengthening the alertness and response by supervisory authorities to early warning signals. ESMA could be given more powers towards national competent authorities on enforcement activities. National supervisory activities could be made more transparent, both towards the European Authorities, but also possibly towards the public. And we could reflect on reinforcing audit oversight and enforcement at national and European level. Again, as I said earlier, we will have more knowledge of what action is needed once the investigations have been completed. But in any case it is clear that we will need to react to this.  Thank you very much. I look forward to hearing your views on this important issue.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 148, "date": "2020-10-07.json", "name": "Markus Ferber", "mepid": "1917", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his excellent work and for his excellent work. The Wirecard case shows one thing above all: concentrated criminal energy, which must be met primarily by means of the Public Prosecutor's Office and not by means of financial supervision, is a particular challenge. When we read again today that a bank in Austria has been leading the supervisory authorities by the nose for more than 30 years – with criminal energy – it shows that we do not have a problem of supervision, but a problem of how we can detect criminal activities through supervisory rules. Of course, the first question, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is what role national supervision has played in the country concerned. After all, one could tell from the international press that something might not be right, and yet the BaFin has turned everything away. The question of whether a small bank with a huge business area is properly controlled if the small bank is supervised by BaFin and the rest by the local labour inspectorate is also to be answered. These are the structural problems that we are dealing with here first of all. Secondly, I would also like to say quite openly when it is now being demanded – including by the Federal Finance Minister – that the European authorities must be strengthened as a matter of urgency: he was already in office when we negotiated the review of the European supervisory authorities. He was not at the forefront of the movement to give the European supervisory authority more powers of enforcement, but he was in the brakehouse. That is why this is clearly something that has been mentioned here too. That is why I do not think I am one of those who already know where the solutions are, because we need to take a closer look at the problems. Again, wherever criminal energy is used, we will not be able to deal with this problem with tick boxes – with forms where you tick if anything is fulfilled. That is why I believe that it also makes sense to think at European level about a special public prosecutor's office, as we have with regard to financial interests.

It’s a case of economic nationalism because, when the Financial Times discovers this scandal, the reaction of the regulators is first to investigate the journalists; second, forbid shorting, forbid trading against the stock, something that has never been done for individual stock in Germany; third, continue allowing staff to trade, basically closing your eyes and defending the suspect illicit activity. The problem with economic nationalism is that the supervisor doesn’t have the incentive to act against the companies of their own country. They do it out of national pride. They do it out of economic interest. These are the national champions. Wirecard was the leading fintech.  There have been many instances before of such economic nationalism. Very recently, we had the Danske Bank scandal where the supervisors in Denmark and in Estonia of this Danish subsidiary see hundreds of billions of euro money laundering and do nothing. We had it during the banking crisis. During the banking crisis, we systematically saw regulators in their home country pretending that the banks were much better than they were. The truth of the matter is that the banks were not good, the supervisors pretended that they were good.  What’s the cure against economic nationalism? We know it. We’ve done it in banking. We know the national banking authorities don’t have the incentive to look carefully at their own banks. That’s why we have a single banking supervisor. Mr Roth, when you say that the solution is not European supervision, I think that this is denying the reality of what we see. The reality of what we see is that, as long as we have national regulators overseeing their national champions, they are going to have the incentive to turn a blind eye.

German and EU authorities did not act, and ESMA even attested to the DPR 2017 very good work. Wirecard rose to the top of the DAX company. In September 2019, During her trip to China, Chancellor Merkel campaigned for Wirecard– despite warnings from the German Embassy in Beijing, which was concerned only by newspaper reports. The authorities in Singapore were already investigating the company. Meanwhile, the Munich Public Prosecutor's Office is also investigating on suspicion of money laundering. Apparently, no authority held itself responsible at all until the company's insolvency. The financial regulator BaFin classified Wirecard as a technology group, while the district government of Lower Bavaria assigned Wirecard to the financial sector. The EU authorities deny any responsibility, as they only dream of the green economy.  Wirecard was the first DAX group to have to file for bankruptcy, as 1.9 billion euros are simply missing from the balance sheet. Two board members have been arrested, one is a fugitive.

Paradoxically, Germany, which in the eyes of the world is represented as a model of efficiency and rigour, too often turns out to be the centre of huge scandals, from Siemens to Volkswagen, from dividend tax credits collected twice to Libor manipulation and opaque derivatives, the latter thanks to Deutsche Bank. This time, however, with the scandal that has engulfed Wirecard, the confidence of the entire payment card sector is deeply undermined, including the prepaid cards, which are known to be used by the youngest and the weakest – economically speaking – at a time when we are increasingly trying to impose the non-use of cash. In Italy, for example, but also in many other countries of the European Union, some popular credit card circuits that relied as servers on Wirecard did not work for days, creating many problems in the midst of a full COVID emergency, with the result that many users could not even shop. Given that the ECB itself advised against abolishing the use of cash in January 2020, the problem becomes even greater if those authorised to manage such alternative instruments to cash are not also regularly monitored in their work. It is read in the international media that there have been macroscopic conflicts of interest between Bafin employees and trading on the same Wirecard stock, generating despondency and the more than legitimate suspicion that those who had to control had both eyes closed. What role have the auditors and rating agencies that certify the balance sheets of listed companies played? Distracted them too? Let us also not forget that Wirecard also has a banking licence and is therefore further subject to the strict supervision provided for credit institutions: has it happened on time as it has been for other banks?

European, national and regional supervisors must work efficiently with a sufficient number of experts to see through these complex business models.  This must also be said: Wirecard's headquarters are in Bavaria. That is why I have to spell this out quite clearly here: consciously looking away and being overwhelmed in the case of economic and financial crime, as the Bavarian state government has done with Wirecard, is explicitly damaging to Germany and Europe as a financial and economic location.

This is particularly true when it comes to supervision. The recent review of European supervisory authorities has improved the supervisory convergence powers of these authorities. ESMA’s fast—track peer review of the enforcement of financial information in Germany will be the first review to be conducted according to the new rules.  Thanks to the more independent and strengthened process, ESMA can where necessary issue individual recommendations towards national supervisors, following a ‘comply or explain’ mechanism. This mechanism allows a close follow—up on the recommendation and better understanding of the approach of the national supervisor. ESMA can also submit an opinion to the Commission if it considers that further harmonisation of EU rules would be needed. In a single market, the impact of national supervisory failure extends far beyond the borders of the single Member State. National as well as European supervisors need to have the right tools, skills and powers to oversee complex value chains and group structures, as well as to investigate possible cases of fraud or abuse, in particular when it comes to publicly—listed companies and auditors’ responsibilities.  This is why the Commission plans to work towards an enhanced single rulebook for capital markets by assessing the need for further harmonisation of EU rules and monitoring progress towards supervisory convergence. It will take stock of what has been achieved by the end of the next year and propose measures for stronger supervisory coordination or direct supervision by European supervisory authorities where needed. Wirecard was also offering payment processing services and other non—regulated technical services. This shows that supervision and oversight of the actors in the payment chains has become increasingly complex, taking into account the emergence of many new business models and group structures. Activities performed by unregulated entities can have an impact on many other companies in the system. This is why, as part of the review of the Payment Services Directive, the Commission will evaluate any new risks stemming from unregulated activities, especially technical services ancillary to payment or e—money services. We will assess how to best to mitigate those risks and whether some of these activities should be brought under supervision. More broadly, we need to ensure appropriate regulation and supervision of the more complex ecosystem and fragmented value chains that may emerge from the increased involvement of technology companies in the provision of financial services.  As regards auditors, the Commission will publish a report on the functioning of the EU audit market. Separately, the Commission also launched an assessment on how current EU audit market rules work. These were planned before Wirecard’s collapse, but both reports will highlight issues of relevance in this case – for instance, the performance of all the committees, given the different approaches in the Member States.

Thank you very much, Madam President. I can only agree with the Commissioner's thanks. As the Presidency of the Council, we also see this debate as an encouragement of our efforts to make our contribution to learning from our mistakes. Thank you for that! I can also understand, Mr Ferber, that it seems tempting for you to address the problems in a single person. These are more domestic considerations – I do not know whether they belong here. But please do not contradict yourself, because I fully agree with you. You said that before we come to any decisive proposals for concrete measures, we must first analyse the current situation in detail. The Presidency of the Council is ready to do just that, and we will also be putting forward proposals, with your support, by the end of our Presidency. So, once again, before we draw any conclusions, we need to analyse carefully – that is your view, and that is also our view. Mr Giegold, please do not build up a conflict where there is none at all. Once again, the Wirecard fraud scandal has once again made it clear – as there have been many scandals – that we need to deal with regulation and enforcement of accounting rules.

If we can do that in the next few weeks, we would all be very pleased, because once again: it is about trust. This confidence has been shaken, and capital markets need a minimum of confidence.

During the global pandemic this year, there has been a more urgent need to move our normal activities online. Take the example of opening a bank account, transferring money or requesting a loan. Many banks had to rapidly adapt to provide these services online when most of Europe went into lockdown.  The infrastructure behind this depends on a model based on providing security for businesses, investors and customers. This is a key part of what the report on digital finance is about. Consider your favourite microbrewery, which is a business operating fully offline, relying on clients coming inside to make purchases. With the pandemic and the fight to sink or swim, many moved online to offer their specialty craft beers via online platforms. From one day to the next, they tapped into e-commerce and could explore new possibilities for funding or reach out to new promising markets.  Digital finance, and particularly online banking, shopping and payments, can simplify the financial life of our citizens and of our businesses, from small to large. It’s clear that the pandemic has accelerated a trend we had already been seeing in digital finance. This report addresses a number of these trends and suggests appropriate measures to ensure that the EU framework is fit for a digital age in the area of financial services. The report on digital finance is a legislative initiative report, which is a relatively underused tool in Parliament, but, in our case, we were already working closely with the Commission. I welcome the two concrete frameworks proposed on 24 September by the College on cryptosets, digital operational resilience and other digital finance-related issues. On crypto-assets, the report calls for a framework which is future facing and adaptable to changes that are steadily coming in the near future. The report foresees an open-ended taxonomy to categorise different crypto-assets. The report also calls for a proposal for a legislative framework for stablecoins, whether they be public or private stablecoins, to ensure they meet at least the standards set out in the E-Money Directive. Furthermore, we must ensure that in any legislation there is a stable conversion rate between stablecoin and fiat currencies and the respective stablecoin is reconvertible into fiat currency at par value at any time. For all crypto-assets, the overarching aim is for more transparency, integrity and accountability, and also their full compliance with the existing and future AML framework. On operational resilience, the report asks for a legislative framework that applies consistency and strengthens the ICT and cybersecurity in a harmonised manner across the EU. EU businesses are currently very reliant on third countries’ ICT providers, particularly cloud services. Without access to those providers, the capacity for EU businesses to grow would be diminished. I believe we must work closely with the big tech companies providing these services, ensuring that, when providing services to EU clients, they do apply EU legislation in good faith.  Finally, the report also calls for a framework on digital onboarding, which would lead to harmonisation across the single market of key aspects of digital finance, such as digital financial identities and data sharing fully in line with data protection provisions. There are other aspects of the report, which include a strong call to improve AML provisions, central bank digital currencies, the issue of supervision and the single EU supervision in different aspects of digital finance and, crucially, the question of financial redress. Together with a team of shadows, which I would like to thank here, we are able to present the Parliament today with a report that offers a holistic, thorough and sensible approach to questions that the EU will have to answer on digital finances in the coming years.

Five years later he just presented us with a new action plan. For this reason, in Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we have worked to draw up a report in which we give our vision, our perspective, of how this union of capital markets is being raised, how it should be implemented, and above all we point out the urgency and need for it to take place as soon as possible. This is the great outstanding subject of the Process of European Integration, but today, with the serious social and economic crisis resulting from COVID-19, it becomes an even greater need for European citizens. Why is the union of capital markets important within the Union? It is important because it allows small and medium-sized enterprises to have a greater option to access capital markets and not have to rely so much on debt. It is also important because it allows small savers, who are no other than small families, domestic economies, to have greater investment options. It is important that there is a union of capital markets so that there are no obstacles, so that there are no obstacles, to reduce the taxation that exists for these capital movements. , not only can European companies find financing options within the market, but those looking for financing in the global world, in other markets, consider us as a competitive market, an attractive market. And it's even more important considering Brexit. In all these circumstances, we have worked on a report which, through seven blocks, gives suggestions to the Commission on the most important, most urgent tasks, to make this union of capital markets a reality. We have worked, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and all the teams who have worked on this time trial report deeply, so that we can at least approve it in the ECON Commission before the Commission published its action plan. And we did it. Today we can make an assessment of that action plan, which was not in the original report, and, in that assessment, my personal assessment is that much remains to be done and we cannot waste any more time yet. The Commission relies on the recommendations of the High-Level Forum and is able to identify the steps to be taken, but no objectives are set, no deadlines are set, nor is it able to provide solutions to the most complicated issues, to issues where there is a lack of consensus. The union of capital markets is a much-needed and very important tool in the face of the great economic crisis and the economic recession that European citizens will suffer. I hope that the Commission will be able to work with the Member States and also with the main players in the financial markets to implement this reality.  We need to be able to have a Europe where SMEs find financing in capital markets, where small savers have more and more investment options and in a safer way. We need a Europe that attracts foreign capital and attracts foreign companies to seek capital in our markets. And we need a Europe where we work to provide financial education to our citizens, a Europe that allows citizens to have sufficient tools to have the right decisions in relation to their investments. Therefore, this is a very important project. We welcome the Commission's proposal, but we call for specific deadlines, concrete measures and a reality as soon as possible. Let us not forget that there is freedom of movement of capital in Europe. What is this freedom going to be like if there is no single capital market?", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 172, "date": "2020-10-07.json", "name": "Valdis Dombrovskis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Executive Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, today’s debate is very timely and important to make progress on key EU priorities: the recovery, strengthening the resilience of our economy, supporting the transition to a green and digital economy. The Commission recently adopted two major initiatives to promote those objectives: a Digital Finance package and a new Action plan on the Capital Markets Union.  First, I would like to thank Mr Kovařík for his report. The Commission’s digital finance strategy is fully in line with its principles. But it is not only about principles. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen committed to responding with a legislative act, in full respect of the proportionality, subsidiarity and better law making principles, when Parliament adopts a resolution requesting that the Commission submit legislative proposals, based on Article 225 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Indeed, with the digital finance strategy, the Commission committed to take specific action to follow up on the report’s recommendations. For example, we will propose in 2021 to harmonise rules on customer onboarding, and we will build on the upcoming review of the rules on electronic identification to implement an interoperable cross-border framework for digital identities. Time is of the essence in the fast-moving world of digital finance. This is why the Commission has already acted in line with the recommendations of the report. The proposal on crypto-assets brings clarity on the rules governing transparency, prudential standards and market integrity. It aims to allow companies to draw on the possibilities offered by these assets, and more generally by new technologies such as blockchain, and to do it in such a way as to mitigate risks for investors and preserve financial stability. The Commission moved not only to close the regulatory gap for those crypto-assets that are not covered by the existing rules. In line with your report, we are also proposing amendments to make sure that certain crypto-assets fit into the current regulatory framework. We also proposed a pilot regime for market operators to test innovations in a safe and controlled environment. The report rightly addresses the risk of tax evasion linked to crypto-assets. Our July action plan for fair and simple taxation envisages expanding the scope of the directive on administrative cooperation to cover all crypto-assets. We will come with a proposal in 2021. I also share the concerns expressed in the report about the money-laundering risks that may be associated with crypto-assets. Crypto-assets are already covered by the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive. Our proposal covers all the crypto-asset service providers listed in the Financial Action Task Force standards. It puts considerable requirements on service providers to protect consumers, market integrity and financial stability. Additional requirements will follow from future proposals to overhaul the EU anti-money laundering framework in 2021. The Commission also agrees on the need for a common approach to resilience of our ICT infrastructures. This is why we put forward a legislative proposal on digital operational resilience. It aims to ensure that all financial market participants have put safeguards in place to cope with cyber-attacks and other ICT risks. It also introduces an EU oversight framework for ICT providers to financial entities, such as cloud computing service providers. So I count on Parliament to make swift progress on these proposals. Let me now turn to the Capital Markets Union. I would like to thank Ms Benjumea for her draft report. The Commission shares its priorities, and welcomes its ambition. Developing our capital markets now, at a time of crisis, matters more than ever. As your report underlines, we need to stimulate financing around Europe. We need more financing opportunities to help start-ups and to help larger companies to thrive. We now have 27 national capital markets that are neither fully developed nor fully integrated. This is particularly important in light of Brexit. Europeans do not get the most out of their savings because they lack the confidence to invest in capital markets, so we need to create more opportunities for Europeans to invest safely for their future. We also need to get more funding for the green and digital transitions and, last but not least, to strengthen the international role of the euro. With our action plan, we have 16 initiatives to achieve these objectives. Let me just name a few: helping large investors to invest more in EU businesses, including for the long term; making information on EU companies more easily accessible – digitally – for EU and non-EU investors by using a single access point; helping Europeans to save safely for their future, for them to buy the best and cheapest financial products and so that their pensions are adequate and sustainable. The Commission will propose legislation as of next year to achieve these objectives, and, with your support, we can really make progress towards completing the Capital Markets Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 173, "date": "2020-10-07.json", "name": "Stefan Berger", "mepid": "197410", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, digitalisation is changing the world. We see the digital revolution of our payment systems starting with the credit card going to bitcoins.

Admittedly, the fact that Libra money could be sent cheaply across borders as quickly as text messages is very tempting, and nevertheless there are serious concerns – data protection, terrorist financing, money laundering – and therefore we need a set of rules. The digital finance report is a good basis. It provides a framework for crypto-assets.  And on the other hand, now the European Central Bank must take responsibility. As a consumer, of course, I rather trust the Central Bank more than Zuckerberg, and if we let Facebook open a Pandora’s box, or in this case a Pandora’s wallet in Europe, then it’s too late.

At the same time, we can’t be naive, and we need to look at it in a very accurate way. Indeed, the previous debate on Wirecard clearly demonstrates we have to draw the right lessons. Half of the crypto—assets transactions is linked to illegal activities, like the buying or selling of illegal goods or services, money laundering, and payments in ransomware attacks. Recent findings suggest that 76 billion dollars of illegal activity per year involves Bitcoins. Therefore we can’t leave any regulatory loophole open. I will come to recent legislative proposals of the Commission, but let there be no misunderstanding: for my group, only a strict regulatory framework, which fully ensures investor and data protection, market stability and integrity, and which is properly supervised from EU level together with national authorities, will be good enough. Particularly in times of Green Deal, we can’t be blind to the carbon footprint of the applications, either. I furthermore welcome the ECB stands on central digital currency. We cannot let Libra undermine monetary sovereignty. There is no place for digital assets not meeting high-level EU standards. And the same is true for critical third-party providers.

Even after all the experiences of privatisation of social security systems have resulted in social disasters, this Parliament insists on getting taxpayers to pay for the privatisation of social security in countries through exemptions and tax benefits.  The second example has to do with the very weak regulation that is proposed for cryptocurrencies despite the common diagnosis of a large part of the political groups that cryptocurrencies have no use, they produce no social advantage, do not respond to any customer needs, serve to promote tax evasion and fraud and promote illegal transactions, and yet Parliament is moving forward with an extraordinarily backward regulatory proposal, including contributing to the idea that cryptocurrencies have something to offer consumers when they do not.

Yet, at the same time, the ECB financed private banks with EUR 1 600 billion through the TL and TRO programmes, which were poured into private banks at virtually negative rates, with a great favour to private banks. Yet these banks, as is always the case in crises, have filled their bellies but have not poured this money into the real economy. This is the point, this is what happens during all crises: banks are getting richer and citizens are getting poorer and poorer.

In order to make the ideal consumer, subject to the advertising injunction, they intend to break this link with the sovereign power that is money.

Therefore, these assets, basically, have no sustainable value for society and, because of that, are prohibited in a number of jurisdictions. Some of them, some of us, call that financial innovation. That would be a fine thing. Another financial innovation, global stablecoins, has even more serious and wider reaching negative implications, especially regarding financial stability, privacy and data protection risks, monetary policy transmission and especially monetary sovereignty, as was mentioned here already. As a response to that, the third financial innovation, central bank digital currencies, were initiated and this should be studied and debated thoroughly here at the European Parliament and other institutions, and we will certainly do that.

The Proposal for a Multiannual Financial Framework and the EU Recovery Plan do not meet today's needs, and the Strategy for a Sustainable and Digital Europe published in March does not take into account the current economic situation. The project to build a European Capital Markets Union gives the impression that small and medium-sized enterprises are to be the focus of building a common capital market in Europe, and in fact we are hearing about shifting national supervisory powers towards the European institutions, which will have harmful consequences precisely for small and medium-sized enterprises, for favouring banks, and in addition, new obligations are being requested here. , e.g. related to green transformation.

We should move quickly to ban these cryptocurrencies, which are privately owned and made by global players. We must, of course, produce our own digital euro currency.

But this path can only be successful if, at the same time, we also have the courage to stand up to these global players who want to enter the financial market. Let us not delude ourselves: this is about a lot of fast money – fast money that is used for criminal gangs, for terrorist financing. This is about large-scale money laundering, cryptocurrencies where it is not possible to trace where the funds come from, what exactly that money is. Not even Europe's banks today show the extent to which they work with cryptocurrencies. That is very worrying. So we are breeding bubbles here that may one day burst and that will cost the next generation dearly. We need to take decisive action now.

Besides, they require that the debt bias is removed from the corporate tax system, and they would be promoted if we had a common withholding tax. Well, this isn’t on the table, is it? As long as it’s not on the table, let’s be realistic and pragmatic on what we can achieve with the capital markets union, and with the European Union, in this.  Besides – and this is the main point I would like to make – don’t compare us to the US. We need the European in the capital market. That means strong protection of retail investors and clear standards for sustainability, both environmental and social. The US is not an example for Europe on this. We need to take the lead ourselves.

Many surveys show that what they suffer the most, especially in times of crisis, is access to financial resources and a lack of capital. They thus have a major disadvantage over large companies and competitors. If we want a digital, green and innovative economy, we must also talk in one breath about financial support for small and medium-sized enterprises. A small business simply won't be able to afford to buy equipment and services to keep up with the competition. Therefore, well-set conditions of the Capital Union will help them overcome the harder period and develop further. Building a capital union is also important for eliminating the European comparative disadvantage compared to the AMERICAN capital market. The Capital Union is thus an important element for European growth and the creation of new jobs.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 198, "date": "2020-10-07.json", "name": "Seán Kelly (PPE).", "mepid": "96668", "text": "   – Madam President, the impact the pandemic has had on the European economy has been enormous, with a drop of 12% in GDP reported in the eurozone. The impact of course is global. We have seen similar hits elsewhere. The United Kingdom 20%, the US 9%, my own country 6%, but we are officially back in recession. So in the context of getting the economy back on track, initiatives like the capital markets union are ever more relevant than they were before the pandemic. Putting in place a well functioning capital markets union, as we see in the United States for example, should be considered an important part of our growth strategy for the next decade. It would provide new sources of funding for businesses, reduce the cost of raising capital, increase options for savings across the EU, and make EU financial system more stable, resilient and competitive. The CMU offers enormous potential for our businesses and start-ups, it would make the EU a far more attractive location for innovation and entrepreneurship and help drive jobs to the economy and also of course be very valuable to SMEs. I look forward to Commissioner Dombrovskis and my good friend Mairead McGuinness, who is now taking over his role, making this a reality during this term.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 199, "date": "2020-10-07.json", "name": "Valdis Dombrovskis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Executive Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, thank you once again for this opportunity to debate these important topics today. The future of finance is digital. We have seen it also during the lockdown and we will need it for the recovery, to give better financial products for consumers and to open new funding channels for companies. A number of points were raised by Members during this debate on the new market players where we would follow an approach of ‘same activity, same rules’, ensuring a level playing field between existing market players and potential newcomers. We are supportive of the work of the European Central Bank on the initiative of a central bank digital currency and, as you know, the European Central Bank recently published a report in this regard. I heard a number of concerns which were raised in the context of crypto-assets, and we will continue to bring crypto-assets into the regulated sphere, to address the risks properly for financial stability, for consumer protection, for anti-money laundering, and especially crypto-assets like Global stablecoins will require – and that’s what we have proposed – more stringent rules, given their potentially systematic impact. Moving to the capital markets union, over the past five years we have made a lot of progress with our plan to integrate European capital markets into a union. Now we need to go further still. It’s important for our people and our businesses to diversify the funding sources of the European economy and to put European savings to productive use. We know that it’s not going to be easy to go to the next level, but our recovery will be far more robust and lasting if we do. I am glad that the Commission’s approach in these initiatives is closely aligned with your reports. We share the same main objectives, and I am confident that this House will confirm this at the vote: that our two institutions are indeed the strong partners the EU needs in this critical moment. Please rest assured that these reports will remain an important reference point for our work to implement those policies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 200, "date": "2020-10-07.json", "name": "Ondřej Kovařík", "mepid": "118949", "text": "  rapporteur. – Madam President, there were a number of issues raised during this debate, which I think shows that actually there is an urgency and an importance in the debate that we are about to have about digital financial services. I would definitely welcome, Executive Vice—President, a number of the commitments that you made in your introductory speech, especially those on putting forward initiatives on digital onboarding. I think this is a very important initiative that we really need to put forward in the European Union, especially in order to strengthen and enhance the single market in this area, and also the further strengthening of the anti-money laundering framework, which you mentioned will take place next year. I think this is also a very important point for this House to discuss. Another issue that was raised – and I think this is also why the urgency is there – is the reaction from our side to initiatives such as Libra, a private stablecoin which has the potential to change drastically the way financial and monetary relations are organised in the economy. So I think this House will be happy to have a debate on this issue, and we also welcome the ECB proposals and the scenarios that were published recently. We’re definitely looking forward to a discussion of the proposals that the Commission has already made on crypto—assets and digital operational resilience. I also see a very good link between enhancing digital financial services and tapping the potential of the capital markets union, as was mentioned by a number of colleagues. Finally, you mentioned, Mr Executive Vice—President, that the future of financial services is digital. I would say that the future of the economy and the future of the European Union is digital, so actually we should make sure that the framework that we have is fit for this purpose.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 201, "date": "2020-10-07.json", "name": "Isabel Benjumea Benjumea", "mepid": "197679", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Madam President, thank you very much, Vice-President, for being here with us today, and thank you very much for all the contributions to the debate we have had. Truly, as I said in my initial speech, after this terrible pandemic that we are still suffering, comes a terrible social and economic crisis, and there is no better social policy than job creation. Those who create jobs are future entrepreneurs, those small start-ups who are looking for funding to launch a business idea, or small and medium-sized enterprises, which, as has also been said, are the main job creators within the Union Therefore, we need both those who are seeking funding to start a business , such as those who are seeking funding to keep their business running, have better and greater access to financing. And the union of capital markets, the ability to access capital markets throughout the Union in an accessible, simplified, barrier-free way, without excessive taxes and in a way that allows these companies access to these funds, will allow for a form of financing that, at a time when we are entering a terrible economic crisis , certainly has to be a reality. But for there to be those funds, we need money to enter the markets, and that's what small savers are key for. Small savers have to find these capital markets attractive and, therefore, you have to do it in a safe and attractive way for them, so that they have a more varied offer of investment.  But nothing in the report of which I have had the honour of being rapporteur, or anything that it puts in the action plan presented to us by the Commission, which is undoubtedly a good action plan, makes sense if the most complicated issues, which are the issues of insolvency, are not put on the table , tax issues and supervisory issues, and if a plan with specific dates is not put on the table, with specific objectives, and if it is not worked together with the Member States and the rest of the actors in the financial sector. I therefore ask the Commission for more ambition to be able to make the union of capital markets a reality and I ask you to support, with your vote, the report to be voted on this afternoon.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 202, "date": "2020-10-07.json", "name": "Przewodnicząca. –", "mepid": "197525", "text": "  I close the debate.

Proposed actions include facilitating SME listing, a pan—European IPO fund for floating SME shares on stock markets and a European single access point which centralises relevant information to help them attract investors. Other proposals call for the encouragement of retail investors through the design of appropriate products and the promotion of financial literacy, starting with schools. Moreover, a link with programmes to develop sustainable finance has been hardwired into the proposals. Emphasis is maintained on safeguarding the robust regulatory standards, built since 2008, to protect citizens from any financial crash. A fundamental aim is to establish a long—term European culture of direct investment by citizens in productive assets, especially those run by SMEs. Indeed, alternative channels of financing are more than ever needed to support the economic and social fabric constituted by SMEs. This would also reduce the pressure on banks which presently seem overloaded with targets they must meet, not all of them congruent with each other.
