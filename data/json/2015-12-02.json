Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you first of all for inviting the Presidency of the Council to take part in this debate on cooperation with Turkey and in particular on the outcome of the summit which took place on Sunday.  The Presidency welcomes the results of this summit, which was organised at the initiative of the President of the European Council and which you have attended throughout its duration, Mr President. The Commission's first Vice-President, Mr Timmermans, who negotiated the action plan with the Turkish authorities, should also be thanked and congratulated for his commitment.  This summit meeting was fully timely, because it was able to address issues of vital to the security of the Union. Indeed, our relations with Turkey, particularly in the current context, are of considerable importance, both on the issues of migration and on the wider framework of our relations. We share many common interests with Turkey and our cooperation is indispensable in the face of the three major crises affecting us and affecting Turkey. First, the war in Syria and the absolute need to find a political solution to this particularly deadly and destabilizing conflict. Secondly, the problem of refugees, which is directly linked to this conflict, and finally terrorism, which has struck in Paris, but which has also struck in Turkey and elsewhere and which must be fought relentlessly. The summit brought concrete results to the point of confirmation of the need for increased cooperation and regular dialogue. The revitalization of our relations, the liberalisation of the visa regime, readmission rules, and humanitarian and financial aid for the 2 million refugees in Syria are precisely concrete results. It must also be said that everything we have concluded with Turkey must nevertheless encourage us to continue what we are doing within the European Union. All measures concerning better surveillance of our borders, better control of our external borders, relocation policies, the various other approaches to borders must of course be pursued, so we must implement everything that has been decided and everything that still needs to be decided must be decided quickly.  You understand, Mr President, that it is not now up to the Presidency to present in detail the outcome of the summit. It will be more appropriate for the Vice-President, first vice-president of the Commission, to give you his assessment of this meeting.  However, as the summit's final declaration notes, all elements approved on Sunday will have to progress in parallel and be carefully evaluated. This also applies to the accession process for which all the conditions applicable to all candidates are obviously also applicable to Turkey.  And the Council will take special care to ensure that the measures adopted last Sunday are implemented in their entirety and in solidarity. And of course Parliament will be fully informed of the follow-up of these decisions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2015-12-02.json", "name": "Frans Timmermans", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   First Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, President Jean-Claude Juncker has asked me to debrief you on his behalf since I was also at the summit. By the way, President Schulz, you yourself were at the summit. You intervened and you were there for the whole duration of the summit, so Parliament was very well represented and was an integral part of our decision-making. I hope President Schulz will share Jean-Claude Juncker’s view and my view that this summit was fruitful and opened a new chapter in the EU’s partnership with Turkey. Since April, the EU has held four meetings at Heads of State and Government level to discuss the migration crisis. At each of these meetings we said it was necessary to engage with Turkey – and this is what we did on Sunday. It is clear that we need to cooperate to secure our borders, jointly to bring order into migratory flows, and to stem irregular migration. But the focus of the summit went far beyond the current refugee crisis. Turkey is a strategic partner for Europe in many areas: trade, the economy, foreign policy, energy and customs. At the summit, we reached agreement on how to move forward in all key areas of our cooperation. We agreed on the need for a structured, frequent and more dynamic high-level dialogue. We decided to have summits twice a year to discuss mutual relations and international issues. We hope that the meeting created a new partnership both on refugee-related matters and beyond. To name one example, the recent and atrocious attacks in Paris and Ankara – including a bomb again last night – showed how Europe and Turkey are confronted by the same security threats, and they reinforced our resolve to step up counter-terrorism cooperation, which should be a strong focus of this dialogue. This new chapter of our relationship, and now our partnership, will not lead to a situation in which we forget the remaining divergences and differences we may have with Turkey – on human rights and freedom of the press. All of these will be matters to which we will come back again and again. We need to work with Turkey in order to narrow the gap between our positions. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. The Commission is now working to ensure that implementation is swift, effective and immediate. The Commission will prepare a report on the state of play for the 15 December European Council. To go more specifically into what was agreed: firstly, re-energising the EU-Turkey relationship must also mean putting new energy into the ongoing accession negotiations. The summit declaration jointly welcomes the decision to hold the intergovernmental conference on 14 December for the opening of Chapter 17 on economic and monetary union. In a letter sent by President Juncker to Prime Minister Davutoğlu, the Commission reiterated its commitment to complete the preparatory work for the opening, in the first quarter of 2016, of Chapters 15, on energy; 23, on judiciary and fundamental rights; 24, on justice, freedom and security; 26, on education and culture; and 31, on foreign, security and defence policy. Secondly, Turkey has committed to accelerating the fulfilment of the visa liberalisation benchmarks, and we welcome that. The Commission will assist Turkey in this endeavour, and strive to achieve visa liberalisation for Turkish citizens in the Schengen area by October 2016, provided, of course, that all requirements have been met by then. We want to accelerate the process but we do not want to change the requirements. They will remain firm and they need to be applied in full. By the way, Turkey did not ask us to relax the requirements. Progress needs to be made on the management of borders, asylum and migration, quality of travel documents and respect for minorities’ rights. Moreover, the visa liberalisation process can only go hand in hand with substantial progress on the EU-Turkey readmission agreement, notably on the obligation to take back third-country nationals. The date for full implementation of the readmission agreement has been considerably brought forward, to June 2016, from the initially proposed date of October 2017. Thirdly, we agreed on addressing the refugee crisis together. We agreed to activate the joint action plan that was agreed ad referenda on 15 October and welcomed by Heads of State and Government of the EU’s 28 Member States at the European Council held the same day. This is a joint action plan to step up cooperation on migration management in a coordinated effort to tackle the refugee crisis. It identifies a series of actions for both the European Union and the Republic of Turkey. The aim is twofold: this is about confronting common challenges in a concerted manner and supplementing Turkey’s efforts in managing the large number of people in need of international protection in the country. On Sunday, Turkey committed to implementing immediately the elements agreed on in the action plan, notably immediate action to stem the flow of irregular migrants to the EU and to improve the socio-economic situation of Syrians under temporary protection in Turkey. Both sides reaffirmed their shared commitment to step up the fight against smugglers. The EU has committed to providing immediate and ongoing humanitarian assistance in Turkey, including through its overall financial support. The Commission has put forward its decision: the Turkey Refugee Facility was adopted last week. On Sunday there was consensus among leaders that the EU is committed to providing an initial EUR 3 billion of additional resources. The need for, and nature of, this funding will be reviewed in the light of the developing situation. The details will be worked out with the EU Member States by the next European Council. However, let me be crystal clear about the destination for these funds: this is not money for Turkey – it is money to provide help to refugees in Turkey. This is money to provide for medical care for Syrians, for schooling, and for better living conditions for Syrian refugees in Turkey. I hope this House will not question the importance of burden-sharing, not only within the EU but also with all our neighbours. We have put in place several instruments for that: the Syrian Trust Fund, the African Trust Fund and the Turkey Refugee Facility. Let me finish on the question of resettlement. I have repeatedly stressed, including before you, that you take a lot of human misery out of the equation if you have resettlement. You take the criminal networks out of the equation – with all the risks that people take to come to Europe – and you introduce fair burden sharing by the international community. And, by the way, you can identify precisely who you invite to come to Europe. Resettlement is part of the overall partnership with Turkey set out on Sunday. It is explicitly referred to under Point 6 of the summit declaration. The next steps on resettlement were discussed on the margins of the summit. The Commission will prepare a framework for such a voluntary scheme by 15 December. I want to repeat what President Juncker has said: this will be an open and voluntary process. Those Member States willing to join this common undertaking will tell us – yes or no – whether they would like to be part of this endeavour, which the Commission deems very necessary.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2015-12-02.json", "name": "Manfred Weber", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the Mr Vice-President, I would like to thank the Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which It is good that the summit took place, it was a positive sign. It is good that he has achieved a result. I would like to thank the Commission – Frans Timmermans, you – for the work that is involved in achieving results. But let us also be honest: the summit took place mainly because we have a major refugee issue on the doorstep via the Balkan route, which we must resolve together.  Let us also be honest: the problems are so great because a Member State of the European Union, namely Greece, does not implement the Schengen standards at its external Schengen border. If we were to use all the police and border guards that we are now using to re-establish border security within Europe – between Germany and France, between Bavaria and Austria, between Sweden and Denmark – if we were all using them all to secure the 190-kilometre-long Greek-Turkish border together, then Europe would be better served than what we are unfortunately experiencing in the European Union at the moment. That is why we must be honest that we also have to carry out our tasks internally, namely to secure our borders properly. The points that have been offered to Turkey are far-reaching and there will also be a number of questions in my group. For example, the full liberalisation of visas will lead to debates. We already have the problems of overstayers with other countries – people who enter without a visa and then no longer comply with their obligation to leave. In any case, it will be necessary for us in Europe to think about an entry-exit system, in order to at least document who remains in Europe as an overstayer and who does not.  In our view, the issue of negotiating chapters is an opportunity to hold talks. We support this, but it is clear to us that all the talks are open to results, because we believe in a privileged partnership with Turkey.  Finally, on the EUR 3 billion, the EU is delivering, the Commission is proposing that Parliament is prepared to put the EUR 500 million on the table. And I hope that the Member States will finally fulfil their obligations. When we talk about money, I would like to point out that other countries in the region are also doing a great deal. We are talking a lot now about Turkey, but also Lebanon, Jordan, many in this region are doing enormous work, and I hope that a wave of refugees does not have to arise before the Member States and before we Europeans build up so much partnership with these states that we also provide enormous support to these countries. Last but not least, I would like to make it clear that we support the Commission's approach of finding pragmatic solutions now, on the one hand, but also addressing the critical points in relation to Turkey on the other. In the progress report, this was done by the Commission: the issues of freedom of the press, rights and respect for human rights in Turkey were also clearly addressed by us Europeans in relation to Turkey. Thank you for that clarity. Ladies and gentlemen, it was good that this summit took place. We will now move forward step by step in implementation and we want to resolve the outstanding issues constructively in the coming weeks.

I would like to point out that another country in the EU even has state territory on African land, namely Spain, which has been able to secure the corresponding European external border in Ceuta for years.

We Socialists and Democrats have not changed our position, Turkey's future will be in the European Union for us, so it is good that negotiations are resumed and that we are beginning to discuss visa liberalisation seriously.  Turkey needs Europe, because the link with the European Union is the levee, for Turkey, to avoid authoritarian temptations and a wear and tear of democracy, and we too need Turkey because Ankara is a force for stability and without the cooperation of our Turkish friends it will not be possible to manage the refugee crisis.  We therefore support the efforts made by the Commission and appreciate the valuable work done in particular by Vice-President Timmermans, but reaching out to Turkey does not mean giving Turkey a blank cheque, let alone underestimating the drift we are unfortunately witnessing. I want to say this very sincerely, I am a little concerned – indeed, very concerned – about the squeeze on the freedom of fundamental freedoms that we seem to be witnessing in Turkey. Attacks on minorities, primarily kurdish minorities, are not acceptable. And the concentration of power in the hands of one individual also hurts democracy. We will also ensure that the funding provided, as Timmermans rightly said, actually goes to refugees.

So we must increase the level of confrontation, opening the chapters does not mean giving Turkey a winning game, it does mean putting Turkey with its back to the wall, that is to say, checking whether we can really move forward in terms of human rights, the solution of the Cyprus question, which is also essential to us.

Yes, it is good to have a summit with Turkey to discuss cooperation, and we welcome that, but there is a big difference between cooperating with Turkey and asking them to clear up our mess.  We feel under a humanitarian and moral obligation to help refugees from Syria who settle in neighbouring countries, and whatever we do will cost money, but we also need to be clear about the signal that we are going to send to those who want to come to the EU, whether they are coming as refugees or coming for economic reasons. So instead, the leader of a large Member State sends a signal that the EU is open to everyone, whether or not they are refugees, and then, when other EU countries struggle and erect borders between each other, EU leaders ask Turkey to play host instead on top of the millions that they already host.  This is unlikely to offer a long-term solution to the crisis and it will do nothing to stem the flows from the Balkan States. Yes, Turkey is a major important NATO ally of ours, but as Turkey’s ally, let us be more honest with them. Let us not pretend that EU membership is on the horizon. There are far too many people in the EU who will never accept Turkey for reasons including: pure prejudice against Turks and their faith; concerns over human rights; concerns over freedom of movement; concerns over the number of votes that they would have in Council and in Parliament; and concerns over EU borders being extended to Iraq, Iran and Syria.  So let us be clear to the Turks about what that relationship is, but let us also be clear to our voters what EU countries get in return for signing a visa-free agreement, and what we get in return for the EUR 3 billion that Turkey is demanding. And let us finally get to grips with some of the basics: a thorough registration process; a proper returns and readmissions agreement with countries in exchange for our aid; and effective external border controls.

Cooperation with Turkey – yes; outsourcing our problems – no. And let us be honest: the impression that we have is the opposite. A visa-free regime, EUR 3 billion, and speeding up the accession negotiations in return for some Turkish cooperation in helping to manage the refugee crisis. I have to tell you, Mr President, that it is shameful that nothing was said about human rights in Turkey, freedom of the press in Turkey, or the state of democracy in Turkey in the written conclusions. That is the failure of this summit, in my opinion. Let us be honest, the situation in Turkey is becoming worse and worse. I think there is no other country worldwide where there are more journalists in prison than in Turkey at the moment. I have nothing against the search for better cooperation with Turkey to manage the refugee crisis, but at least have the honesty and the courage to talk about the problems in Turkey. Do not just say ‘OK, we shall not talk about them anymore in the conclusions’. It was only at the end, in the press conference, that Mr Tusk said three or four words about it, not in the written conclusions.  That brings me to the key point. Not outsourcing our problems, but solving our problems means that we have to fix our external borders, our European border and coastguard. What I see is that we are not capable of doing so. Greece, especially, is saying they cannot participate, because Greece is the only country for the moment blocking a decision in the Council that has to be taken in a few weeks in December. It is blocking it because it is a question of sovereignty. It is not allowed for foreigners to come to help us to protect our borders. Well maybe we could invite Mr Tsipras a second time to this Parliament, not to talk about the economy, and not to talk about this problem, but to talk about his lack of will for European solutions to the problems that we are facing at the moment.  I was not shocked when, this morning, I read that some countries want to push Greece out of Schengen. Well, the external border of Greece is not a Greek border: it is a European border. It is not a German border, a Belgian border, or a French border, and that is the key. That is what you have to achieve now, with or without Mr Tsipras.

Mr President, first of all, I would like to say something to Mr Verhofstadt: Belgium has no problems at all and has nevertheless become a centre for trafficking criminals. Greece has countless problems, which also stem from decisions of the European Union, and I think it needs more support than a complaint to the European Parliament. I understand, first of all, that the main issue of the agreement with Turkey was the management of refugee flows by that country. However, the European Union has an obligation to underline how the suffering of the peoples of the region began when the United States and Member States of the European Union decided how to teach and export democracy. When we were talking about an upcoming 'Arab winter', some people, including in this Chamber, cultivated the illusion of the 'Arab Spring'. The Commission must closely monitor the management of billions towards Turkey. There are thousands of refugees living in model facilities, but there are many thousands more living under truly miserable conditions. Today, in fact, there is a complaint that Turkey, a few 24 hours after the agreement, has arrested 1,200 refugees and is trying to return them where? back to Syria! The Commission must react immediately. The agreement avoids a word about the lame democracy in Turkey, while referring to the opening of funds. Cyprus is ready - I say this for the sake of knowledge - to assist in this direction if Turkey shows that it is also ready to support a solution in Cyprus, which will create conditions for genuine Cypriot independence, and this is achieved if it is determined by the solution that the future is in the hands of the Cypriots alone, based on the rules of the European Union and the security provided by our presence within the Union. The Cypriots of the Federal State have no need for a foreign guarantee to comply with the rules of the solution.

My group has always worked to ensure that the European Union negotiates systematically and consistently with Turkey. We have never had any doubt that the European Union needs Turkey and that it is the other way round. I have to tell you that I found it a sad experience in the debate on the future of Turkey and the European Union that it was only when tens of thousands of refugees from Turkey had migrated to the centre of the European Union that the leaders of the European Union remembered that Turkey was really needed. There have been much better times with Turkey to re-engage in visa liberalisation and negotiations. We think it is good that something is being blocked, but we think that so far the leaders of the European institutions and also the Council are not signalling enough awareness of the difficulty of achieving what we want to achieve with Turkey today. We have heard a great deal about what is to be achieved for the refugees, that better accommodation, prospects for children and prospects for employment should be created. Tell me how you really want to guarantee this to the Turkish Government today. I am very suspicious of that so far. In fact, I see that the new possible agreement in Turkey is rather interpreted as being oriented towards foreclosure, that one is even prepared to prevent refugees from leaving, and even to go so far as to detain them. If that is the case, it will indeed be a new step by the European Union – away from its own values and also away from international law. The first news of this kind came from Turkey in the last few days. Ladies and gentlemen! I believe that we need to talk about human rights much more aggressively with Turkey. In fact, the tightening up in Turkey must not be treated under 'remote running'. The assassination of the lawyer Tahir Eli just before the start of the summit, the arrest of the journalist Can Dündar, whom many of us know personally, were real provocations before this summit. I want the European Union to actively seek a better relationship with Turkey, but I do not believe that Turkey can be a good, reliable partner for refugee matters or also for Syria if we simply ignore the internal development in Turkey.

But the EU’s common asylum policy is the lowest ebb for policy yet. Chancellor Merkel took the cork out of a champagne bottle and said anyone could come, and now you are trying to put the cork back in and realising it is not possible.

Not only do they want EUR 3 billion from you this year, they are going to want EUR 3 billion from you every single year. And in return they have given absolutely no guarantees whatsoever that they will stop people from coming, or indeed take people back. And they have managed to persuade you, whatever the Commissioner says, into offering them, by October next year, visa-free access for 75 million people, whose average GDP income is half that of the poorest EU Member State. I guess what you are doing is this: you are saying the way we will stop illegal immigration is to make it all legal immigration, and if that does not take the biscuit, now you are going to fast-track Turkey to be an EU Member State. So let us just think about that. A country, 97% of whose land mass is in Asia, apparently you want to join Europe. It is a country that appears to be keener on bombing the Kurds than it is on taking on ISIS. It is a country that has turned a complete blind eye to ISIS fighters travelling through its territory. It is a country where, according to the Pew institute in a poll last week, 8% of those 75 million actively encourage and support the aims of ISIS. It is a country directly and closely linked with buying ISIS oil, and we will finish up bordering Syria, Iraq and Iran. It is mad. It is the most dangerous decision the European Union has yet taken. I am sure the British Prime Minister will be delighted. He has campaigned for this since 2005. To me, without any of the other debates, if there was one single reason why Britain should in this referendum vote to leave the European Union, it is the folly of political integration with Turkey.

One sentence to my Austrian predecessor: by arguing that more refugees should come to Austria, because only with the help of Turkey can the flow of refugees be limited. He is therefore in favour of more refugees to Austria. I wanted to say the following main points: I would like to thank the Commission and the Council for the summit. Because there is a chance to get order in the process, to reduce the numbers. If Turkey has taken in 2.5 million refugees for four years, and Lebanon, with a population of 4 million, 1.4 million refugees, then we have a responsibility to help these countries – because of the refugees and also because of these countries. We have to play our part in this. And if this has the consequence that fewer refugees come in here and that we can provide decent care for these refugees in accordance with the Geneva Convention, that seems to me to be the right way forward. And if, at the same time, we have the opportunity to establish a structure for the control of external borders, to regulate the question of registration sensibly, to carry out on this basis an understandable form of quotaisation in the Member States, which is manageable and controllable, then this seems to me to be a way of removing this pressure. Let me say one last sentence: all this will only apply if we succeed in ending the war there. And ending the war is only possible with Turkey. And opening chapters with Turkey on human rights and the rule of law, I find exciting, because then Turkey really has to show what has happened. I would also like to say that Turkey will not become a member if, in a series of 72 unanimous decisions in the Council that would be necessary for membership, the sixth and seventh decisions are now taken, irrespective of the decision of the parliaments. But i find it exciting to talk about human rights in Turkey. And if that is also linked to having fewer refugees, that seems to me to be a good deal.

Of course, the answer is not only with Turkey and with Lebanon and with Jordan and with African countries we need to work more closely, but we need to say clearly and be honest – the negotiations with Turkey are different from the previous accession negotiations. The negotiations are open and no decision has been taken on Turkey's full membership of the European Union. Such membership is currently impossible. For us, of course, it is important to negotiate with Turkey, to have in the southeast a predictable partner, a neighbor that complies with European legislation, respects its commitments, a neighbor who accepts our legislation.

His answer was: ‘it would be a good idea’. Let us not lose track of the reasons for people coming to Europe. They are not coming to Europe because Mrs Merkel invited them, they are coming to Europe because they want their children not to be victims of barrel bombs thrown from Assad’s planes. (Applause) They want to come to Europe because they do not want to be slaughtered by Daesh or al-Nusra in other parts of Syria. They want to come to Europe because after years of an atrocious war, they have nowhere else to go if they want their children to have an education, if they want to have healthcare, if they want a future that every single one of you wants for yourself and your children as well. We are talking about human beings. We are not talking about fortune-seekers invited by Mrs Merkel. Mrs Merkel took responsibility to offer international protection when it was necessary. We would have less trouble in Europe if every single leader of Europe had done the same when it was necessary at the time. (Applause) Now let me insist on some of the push factors, because it is important for the agreement we have reached with Turkey. As I said before, why are some people leaving from Turkey or through Turkey to Europe? Talk to them, try it! These are nice people, educated people; these are people who can tell you a story. They will tell you: ‘I have left because after two years I am finished, all my savings are gone and I am not allowed to work in Turkey’. So what did we do? We agreed with the Turks that they would allow Syrians to start working in Turkey very soon. That is part of what we have discussed. They say: ‘I am leaving because there is no education for my children’. This is exactly what we are going to do: we are going to use the EUR 3 billion to make sure that there are more facilities for education for children where they are now in Turkey. They say: ‘we are leaving because our living conditions are horrible and we do not have access to medical care’. These EUR 3 billion will be used to improve living conditions and to improve medical care. It is not just the right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do, because keeping people there and offering them help there is much cheaper for the European taxpayer and is much cheaper in moral terms, because it takes the smugglers out of the equation. It takes the danger out of the equation for people having to cross the Mediterranean in very difficult conditions. So when we have these agreements on these projects, it is to take away some of the push factors. This, I think, is a smart approach. Visa liberalisation. Why are we on this trajectory with the Turks? Because if we aligned our visa policies, it would be easier for the Turks to act at their external borders when people come from Pakistan, Bangladesh or other countries who do not have the right to international protection and should then be stopped at the borders. Visa liberalisation also means that we can create the right conditions for Turkey to have the right kind of passports: biometric passports. It would make it much easier for us to control our borders. These are positive measures for the European Union. Do not portray everything as though we are on our knees for Turkey and giving things away. Then about the chapters. I really do not understand some here, like Ms Keller, who just now said: ‘we do not want to talk, we have given up on human rights, we accept everything’. Benchmarking Chapter 23 and 24 is the best possible way of engaging Turkey in a debate on human rights. Opening Chapters 23 and 24 is the best possible way of forcing the Turks to account for what they are doing and to try and help them reform the system so that they move away from the mistakes they make today. So do you really think that we will improve the situation in Turkey by turning our backs on the Turks and saying: ‘oh, let it go’? I do not think so. I think this engaging with them will yield results. And yes, of course, we are engaging with them because we need to stem the flow of those coming to Europe who do not have the right to international protection. Of course we are doing that – but it is in our interest to do so, it is in the interests of the refugees to do so and it is in the interest of Turkey to do so.

It is the result of very intensive teamwork and it really is a pleasure to present this package to you today, together with Vice-President Katainen and Commissioner Vella. This is a really innovative way of working in the Commission. We have worked together with more than half of the Commissioners for a year to bring everything together because here, if we want to make this transformation, we need all areas of our activities. And so this novel way of working is something that is also the way forward: the way the Commission should be working in the future. In the week that COP21 in Paris has started, this is, I think, a very timely proposal. Action on the circular economy ties in closely with our energy and climate policies. More and more evidence shows the wider benefits of the circular economy, including in lowering carbon dioxide emissions. There are many good reasons for moving away from our linear economic model, which is extremely resource-intensive. In a world where the population rises every day, with huge demands placed on land, water, food, feed, raw materials and energy, we cannot rely further on a ‘take, make, use and throw away’ approach. The circular economy, as an agenda for change, is not only an environmental necessity, it is the only model that makes sense in the long term for our European economy. It makes economic sense to use natural resources in a smarter way. Europe cannot compete on wage costs, although sometimes we try – and we lose. And Europe is not graced with the same natural resources as other parts of the world: they are finite in Europe, and when they are available, they are very expensive. The future is in providing products that are used and reused and do not deplete the earth’s natural resources. It will also allow us to continue as a market leader for green technologies. So the question is not whether we want to set Europe on a circular path of growth. It is rather how we, at our level, help our businesses, citizens and Member States to get where they want to be, where they need to be, and to get there more quickly and in better shape. With the package we are proposing today, we want to give a concrete push to the circular economy and accelerate the transition. What we are presenting is an ambitious and comprehensive EU framework that Europe needs to take action and make real progress towards the circular economy. It is an all-encompassing approach of smart regulation, market- based instruments, innovation and incentives. It is a clear signal to economic operators that we are simplifying the EU single market in this area to create new business opportunities and to boost the market for secondary raw materials. We want to be more ambitious than in the past by going beyond waste, with measures covering the full life-cycle of products, from the design of a product and production processes – and of better-informed consumption choices – to modern waste management. We want to back this up with our financial instruments and funds. Our action plan and revised waste proposals adopted today are mutually supportive measures that will contribute to making real progress on the ground. While Jyrki will shortly go into more detail on the wide range of actions we propose, let me say a word about our waste management proposals. Continuously advancing on waste management remains a priority. With targets, and through incentives and support for recycling and reuse, we want to ensure that resources stay within the circle and are available for future use. Waste is not managed as well as it could be. From the total waste production in the EU, only a limited share, 36%, was effectively recycled. The largest share, 37%, was simply sent for disposal, whether in landfills or on the land. Losing this material means that significant growth and competitiveness potential is not being exploited. To fundamentally improve waste management practices we need EU waste legislation. The legislative package we have adopted today will provide a very clear and stable policy framework allowing public and private actors across the EU to develop long-term investment strategies focusing on prevention, reuse and recycling, and avoiding overcapacity in incineration. Is it ambitious? Well, let me say that this is most likely the world’s most ambitious legislation and probably contains the strictest recycling and land-filling targets on earth. Our proposal will also reduce the administrative burden for SMEs and public administrations by improving definitions and simplifying reporting requirements. While reflecting a high level of ambition, our proposals also take due account of the different realities and recycling performance levels across the EU. Differences today are huge, but our objective is to achieve gradual convergence to best-practice levels. Efforts to close today’s implementation gaps will be supported by the EU Cohesion Policy, with EUR 5.5 billion already available in the run-up to 2020. Food waste is a particular priority area where we want rapid change. It is economically, socially and, quite simply, morally unacceptable that so much edible food is wasted every year in Europe. In September we adopted the UN Sustainability Development Goals, including a target to halve food waste by 2030 at the retail and consumer level, and to reduce food losses along production and supply chains. The EU and its Member States are committed to delivering on this target. With that aim, we will develop a reliable method to quantify and understand food waste in order to act on it efficiently. We will also work hand-in-hand with Member States and stakeholders on a dedicated platform to support the achievement of our goal. If I may, I would now like to give the floor to Vice-President Katainen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 66, "date": "2015-12-02.json", "name": "Jyrki Katainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, it is a very big honour to be here to discuss with you the very significant package the Commission has proposed. This is part of the European Investment Package. The circular economy is a phenomenon in the global market economy which one can compare to globalisation, which we have witnessed over the last two decades. So it is not just a side-effect or a secondary element of the market economy; instead it is a global mega-trend and will be even more so in the years to come. The package which we have proposed is more ambitious than the previous legislative package on waste. Now we are completing the circle. Now we can really talk about the Circular Economy Package. This package is a competitive package and it is also a single market package. How ambitious it is can be measured partially also by the speed with which the co-legislators are dealing with the proposals that the Commissioner is bringing forward. This is about empowering consumers and encouraging businesses to move from an inefficient and unsustainable linear economy to a circular market economy. The package is the beginning of the story. It will not transform the European economy from the current linear model in one go, overnight, to a circular economy. But at least, at the moment, with this package we can create a good start and a good basis and a good structure to further develop circular economy initiatives. The action plan will complement the two initial legislative proposals concerning waste. In the action plan there are proposals ranging from product design to creating an internal market to secondary raw materials, and further support for the industrial symbiosis by recognising the value of by-products. A key objective here is to work on further deepening the EU single market, which is also the most important part of the investment plan for the EU. This matters because there are barriers that make it difficult for businesses to optimise the resources used. That is why creating a market for secondary raw materials and ensuring a reliable quality standard is crucial. It is fundamentally about broadening our internal market. The ecodesign framework is a tool to strengthen development where products are easier to repair, dismantle and recycle. We will broaden the scope of ecodesign from energy efficiency to resource efficiency. Ecodesign is an important tool, which will empower consumers and create a level playing field for businesses. We are also announcing a specific strategy on plastics – an important and complex issue. Today only 25% of plastic waste is recycled, whereas half goes to landfills, with economic and environmental consequences. Large quantities of those plastics end up in the oceans, creating marine litter. We will develop work to address all these issues based on the latest evidence. In addition to this, there will also be a revised regulation on fertilisers in order to recognise organic and waste-based fertilisers and to support bio-nutrition. Also, there will be a legislative proposal on minimum standards for reused water for irrigation. Public authorities, starting with the Commission, will be encouraged to step up their uptake of circular economic criteria in public procurement. This has great potential for the circular economy, as public procurement makes up nearly 20% of EU GDP. We will therefore emphasise circular economy aspects in new or revised criteria for creating public procurement, and the Commission will lead by example. Finally, the Commission strongly supports innovation to make the circular economy happen. We need to rethink our ways of producing and consuming. We need to create new technologies and business models, which will shape our future. In the Horizon 2020 work programmes for 2016 and 2017, we are putting EUR 650 million on the table for innovative demonstration projects. Added to this, there are EUR 5.5 billion in structural funds for circular economy purposes. In addition to this, EFSI can finance projects which are either joint ventures between the private and public sectors or private investors. So by quickly implementing the proposals now, we can achieve both economic and environmental – but also societal – gains by transforming our linear economy to a circular market economy.

Today we have before us an action plan which, with precise actions and deadlines, identifies from the immediately beginning of the eco-design of a product, the steps necessary to accelerate the transition of our economic system from linear to circular, with a holistic vision fundamental to us Socialists and Democrats.  This seems to me to be a good starting point and, on the other hand, we can no longer afford to allow 600 million tonnes of waste, which could be reused as raw materials and resources, to be thrown away in Europe every year. We would, however, make a mistake in considering the circular economy only as an environmental policy or, worse still, a matter of waste, it is much more than that! I cannot fail to note that the fact that several Directorates-General have cooperated in this proposal, in itself, underlines that the circular economy is a mainstreaming policy among all sectors of the Commission and we will be watching closely to ensure that this happens with the appropriate funding.  There is, however, one point on which you have not kept your promise to the full: lowering the recycling of municipal waste to 65%, I say this without hesitation, is a mistake. There is also a lack of concrete targets for prevention, the first link in the waste cycle chain, starting precisely from the food waste that was already mentioned Let us be clear, we are not passionate about targets, the problem is not one percentage point more or less, the problem, dear Commissioners, is that with an ambitious roadmap like the one you have presented, to be credible , must be supported by the setting of measurable targets to be achieved that are equally ambitious and because, if we really want to turn towards a circular economy, it is also with truly ambitious targets that we can promote a system that reduces waste and focuses on efficiency, durability and recycling, and reuse of products. On this point, as I say right now, the Group of the Party of European Socialists and Democrats is not prepared to lower the bar of expectations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 69, "date": "2015-12-02.json", "name": "Mark Demesmaeker", "mepid": "117477", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Trash is cash. The expression comes from you, Mr. Timmermans. That was well liked. Making better and more sustainable use of resources is essential. We have been delayed for a year and a half and I will of course study the proposal in detail, but I have already had some questions and criticisms, specifically around waste legislation.  1. You yourself said that the major differences between Member States in implementing existing legislation and achieving the 2020 targets are a huge challenge. For example, while in Flanders we recycle 65% of our household waste, some Member States still dispose of 80% of it. A full implementation of the existing waste legislation is therefore a necessary first step. But what efforts will the Commission make? 2. I understand the need for customization, but I do not think that lowering the ambition level from 70% to 65% on recycling targets for household waste and to provide a reprieve to a whole host of Member States is not such a good choice. Alternative solutions to get everyone on board are possible, e.g. through twinning projects, the formulation of interim objectives. 3. Tailor-made solutions are needed not only for Member States that are struggling, but also for forerunners such as my own region. How does the Commission intend to encourage this in practice and ensure that innovation is given every opportunity?

For example, it confirms that there will be no investment in incinerators that is not absolutely justified, i.e. only in exceptional cases.

Our economy has lost its inertia to encourage the European economy at European level to embrace the circular economy as a way into the future.  The new proposal contains new elements, which is commendable, because we really rounded off the economy. However, binding resource efficiency targets have been lacking. The link to the European Semester in resource efficiency indicators has been lost. Waste reduction targets have been lacking, targets for reducing marine pollution and excessive food waste have been lacking. Mind you, he wrote it all down and voted it in his report, in July this year, the European Parliament. But that information is clearly lost somewhere in the corridors of the European Commission.

Let me start by saying that Commissioner Vella will be present in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on 21 December. That committee will have the opportunity to look at the package in a very in-depth manner.  First, what is different with this package compared to the previous one, which was withdrawn by the Commission? First of all, the previous legislative proposal on waste was partially based on humble aspirations. For instance, if you look at the landfill target, it was not legally binding. I do hope that there is no political group – even the Greens – who would put their political weight behind changing our proposal to the one we withdrew, because it would be weaker than the current proposal.  This proposal is now legally binding, whereas the former was not – it was aspirational; it was a kind of hope that somebody would do something. Now it is legally binding. Also, it is not 25%: it is 10% by 2030. Furthermore, what is different is that we are not only talking about how to deal with the waste, but about how to reduce the amount of waste. That is important and it is one of the reasons why we wanted to withdraw the package, make it more realistic and make it more ambitious, and also to look at how we could reduce the amount of waste and create incentives to use so-called waste, which provides valuable raw materials for industry if dealt with properly.  I very much liked Mr Tajani’s use of the word ‘reindustrialisation’. This is very important, because if we manage to get our incentives right – and Mr Telička mentioned economic incentives also – it really encourages the private sector, entrepreneurs, innovators and also industry, to transform the current business model into a more circular business model.  Also, if you compare the circular recycling target and look at the landfill target, they are one entity. By 2030, recycling levels should be up to 65%. This is legally binding. We also have a review clause which means that by 2025 we have to look at whether we should raise the target above 65%. Also, when we change the landfill target to be more ambitious, it will strengthen achievement of the recycling target.  How many jobs will this create? Well, nobody really knows. Our assessment is that just looking at the landfill target and recycling target, one could imagine some 170 000 new direct jobs. But I would not stare at those figures, because nobody really knows how business will change in the meantime. If you look, for instance, at the Eco-design Directive or eco—design practices and energy labelling practices – without any widening of the scope which we are about to propose – just current practices, our assessment is that, by 2020, the amount of energy we will have saved is approximately the same as the annual primary energy consumption of Italy. So basically it will save money and increase the purchasing power of the average consumer in Europe by a little under EUR 500 per year. Nobody can really assess what kind of impact this will have on job creation. Even if we add our proposal to widen the scope of eco-design, nobody knows exactly what its impact will be, but it is positive anyway; it is significant.  I want to thank Members for this discussion and have one last point on food waste because it was clearly mentioned. Member States are committed to sustainable development goals, and this is mentioned very clearly in the waste legislative package, so Member States must take measures to reduce food waste at each stage of the food supply chain, monitor food waste levels and report back, recording the progress made. The Commission will also elaborate a common methodology to measure food waste. In addition to this, we will clarify legislation relating to waste food and feed in order to facilitate redistribution of safe, edible food to people in need, where it is safe to do so. We will also look at what we could do in order to guide Member States in food donations. This is a big issue. This is a big part of the European investment package, and there is plenty of room for a pragmatic approach with moderate result-minded thinking.

Without a detailed analysis of the proposal published only a few hours earlier, on the basis of the preliminary information, I certainly welcome the committee's new approach. The realisation of a circular economy is not just a waste management issue. The essence of a circular economy is sustainability, based primarily on smart use of raw materials, proper product design and precise definition of the tasks of economic operators.  In agreement with the teachings of Pope Francis I, I believe that without a break from our current \"discarding\" consumer habits, our planet will be unable to survive. The transition to a circular economy will allow us to put behind us the wasteful habits of production and consumption, while creating new business models and job opportunities in Europe.  At the same time, it is important that we take into account the different economic conditions and starting positions of the Member States in our work. The new targets should be feasible, helping to change sustainability approaches rather than increasing infringements.

The previous proposal set a target of 30% increase in resource efficiency by 2030, while the revised package does not contain this. The consequences of including such a measure could result in the creation of 2 million new jobs and a 1% increase in GDP. Likewise, the new circular economy package does not bring about indicators of resource consumption in the European Semester. More ambitious proposals would bring about a number of much-needed changes from an environmental, economic and social point of view. For this reason, I believe that a newer package of proposals, which does not contain effective and binding measures to reduce the use of resources and does not include indicators of resource consumption in the context of the European Semester, will unfortunately not contribute to sustainable development to the extent that it should and would like.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 122, "date": "2015-12-02.json", "name": "Ivan Štefanec (PPE)", "mepid": "124929", "text": "  Writing. – The accumulation of unprocessed waste places an enormous burden on the environment, endangers the health of people living near landfill sites and also entails great spending on safety measures and future remediation of such sites.

And thanks, too, to the Ombudswoman who drew up the original report on which we now have this report. Altogether I think we are submitting a very good report to this plenary for you to vote on. It is a report that will protect the human rights of refugees and migrants at our external borders better, but it is also a report that will enable Frontex to have a clearer picture about where human rights violation might occur and how to solve this problem. It is a win-win situation. What we are proposing is to establish a complaints mechanism that refugees and migrants can use, through which they can address their complaints to Frontex if they feel that they have been mistreated in a Frontex operation – whether involving Frontex employees or guest officers of Member States. All these groups are recognisable by their Frontex armband, and therefore we think that we cannot expect refugees to try to research which Member State a specific guest officer might have been from. Rather, it is really important that they can address their complaints to Frontex and that we task Frontex, as we proposed to do, with making sure that those complaints actually arrive at the right place and are followed up, so that the Member States do not eventually need to follow up on those complaints. Of course, this will need sufficient resources in Frontex to handle the task because it is quite a new and significant task that we want to place in the trustworthy hands of the fundamental rights officer of Frontex. I am very hopeful that Frontex will now act swiftly in response to this request, without waiting until the next Frontex mandate review has been adopted, because that will take some time. I am glad too that the Frontex Consultative Forum sees implementation of the complaint mechanism as a core priority for its work next year. The Consultative Forum, by the way, is a body that the European Parliament helped to create in the last review of the Frontex mandate, so our work here in the Parliament is indeed essential to the functioning of our external borders agency. I believe that, with this complaint mechanism, we can take a further step towards ensuring even more human rights at our external borders. Frontex has, in the past, received more and more tasks, and it may receive even more in the future. So it is only right and fair that Frontex also has to do more on human rights. I hope this House can support our report, which we have been working on for several months now, with really great collaboration among the shadow rapporteurs and the co-rapporteur and with both the Committee on Petitions and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. I also hope that the Commissioner can give us a date when the complaint mechanism can be included in the next Frontex mandate review that he proposes, because I think it is very important that human rights safeguards keep pace with the enlargement of any task Frontex may have.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 130, "date": "2015-12-02.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, first of all thank you for having considered this special report of the European Ombudsman on Frontex and for your follow-up on this very same report. I am aware of the main concern expressed in favour of an individual complaint mechanism in Frontex, and I took good note of the joint report recommending the inclusion of such provisions. The Commission will take the suggestions made in the report into account in its proposal for the future European border guard, which it will present later this month. We agree that the fundamental rights officer could be given a crucial role in handling complaints covering all personnel directly involved in Frontex operations.  The nature and the scope of such a mechanism will certainly be a subject for discussion in both Parliament and the Council. It is my intention to provide for a mechanism whereby the fundamental rights officer, as suggested by the co-rapporteurs, could receive complaints in a structural manner and whereby the appropriate workflows would be established for onward referral to the Member States concerned, and information subsequently obtained about the outcome of the investigation. On the one hand, this should be an administrative mechanism which would allow Frontex to maintain a degree of transparency and accountability, rendering its actions more credible towards the outside and also providing it with the means to deal with these issues internally. But at the same time this is also a fundamental rights tool, because we cannot forget that we are talking about people and ensuring that they are treated in a dignified way. That is why I believe that such a mechanism could be helpful for the credibility of European external borders support operations.  At a time when common external border management and shared responsibility are even more important in rendering the European Union’s migration and asylum policy more effective, we must also make sure that we are not a ‘fortress Europe’. More security goes hand in hand with a stronger and efficient protection mechanism of the fundamental rights of people.

We should highlight the proactive approach to safeguarding human rights and the measures taken by Frontex with regard to the complaints mechanism. However, we have to acknowledge that the disciplinary measures against national law-enforcement officers participating in Frontex operations remain exclusively under Member State competence and that Frontex has no competence in initiating disciplinary measures against other persons, apart from its personnel, since it has only a coordination function.

This is why we chose – and we also thank the colleagues in this room – to accept an accelerated procedure for the adoption of this report today.  There is a legal mandate for Frontex to make sure that fundamental rights are observed in all its activities, and what this report seeks to do is to properly institute the possibility for a person submitting a complaint to make sure that the complaint is actually received. What happens today is that external complaints are not transmitted properly to Member States, with the result that you can have vulnerable persons whose fundamental rights may have been breached during a Frontex operation. What this report says is that such complaints should be admissible. This report also says that this should not prejudice Frontex’s operations and its prerogatives to save lives. Of course, this should not in any way jeopardise Frontex’s aim of ensuring the secure and effective management of our border controls. This report, in my opinion, is perfectly in sync with what Parliament feels this important agency should be doing.

I believe that the complaints mechanism is a really important step towards better protection of human rights at the external borders. Of course, this does not solve all the problems we have with human rights that we have at the external borders – that is quite clear. However, I believe that this will bring us a little more justice at the external borders, so that refugees and migrants do not feel vulnerable to border guards, but also to Frontex, so that the Frontex agency can better verify where human rights violations actually happen, why they happen and how we can better prevent them in the future.  I think that we have put forward a proposal here that is also feasible, that is feasible for refugees – even if refugees are concerned or if they are afraid – and which is also feasible for Frontex, even when it comes to posted officials from the Member States.

It is necessary to overcome the agency’s accountability and transparency problems with the external agencies’ border control practices, and to ensure that the staff working for or with Frontex fully comply with the EU’s Charter of Fundamental rights.  This can be achieved only if Frontex sets up a monitoring mechanism to deal with complaints of breaches of human rights internally.

The Aegean islands have been flooded by the thousands of poor refugees in Syria.

Mainly because of the insufficient transparency of their actions, in particular as regards human rights violations, i.e. the return of refugees without verifying their right to asylum. The Ombudsman decided to include in his last report a specific request for the creation of a mechanism for the submission and handling of individual complaints. This would be of great importance to Frontex, especially as this need is the result of an increasing number of humanitarian and legal challenges at the EU's external borders.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow 80% of Europeans will live in cities: that is why mobility should be a right for all. For those people who travel to work or to look for them, for these people - and these young people especially - who are going to study, for those people who go to the dentist or the doctor, and for those who go to the cinema or the stadium to have fun: basically, mobility is our daily life.  However, much remains to be done to ensure that mobility benefits everyone, as it is still far from being chosen; most of the time, it is suffered, because of traffic jams, because of the loss of time, because of air pollution. The cause is the excessive use of the individual car, which works with traditional fuels. Cities were built for cars: let's return the cities to the inhabitants, because there is a climate emergency - we are in the middle of COP 21. Urban transportation alone accounts for 25% of greenhouse gas emissions. It is up to us to reverse this trend if we want the European Union to meet its emissions targets by 2030. There is also a health emergency: in 2015, breathing kills. 400,000 premature deaths per year are due to fine particulate matter emitted by diesel engines. Is it necessary, when we have pollution peaks, that we sequester pregnant women, children, the elderly so that they keep lungs intact? There is no longer time to wait: pollution is the disease of the 21st century, as the United Nations acknowledges. There is also an urgency with regard to our independence. The energy consumption needed for our transport makes us too dependent on oil dictatorships, now in the spotlight. There is also an urgent need for the lives of road users. 38% of road traffic deaths occur in urban areas. How can we reduce the number of deaths in the city if we do not reduce the use of cars? And finally, there is a social emergency: 25 million European households are the new mobility insecure, because they have little or no access to public transport, or because these transport are too expensive. So, another mobility is not only possible, but it is above all indispensable. If we want to rethink the way we move, we must take into account the social, environmental, economic and democratic impacts of transport. We must take into account current and future generations. To achieve this, the European Union must set ambitious targets. In the midst of COP 21, let's put energy efficiency at the heart of our urban mobility policies. This will, like it or not, be through the exit of diesel, by the disappearance of our urban centres from traditional petrol cars by 2050. This will also involve the development of clean transport: tram, cable car, bicycle, car sharing, which generate jobs. This will involve the modal deferral of the road to the river, the road to the railway, but also through intermodality through the combination of walking, cycling and public transport.  There are very, very many obstacles. The lobbies of all kinds are there; we are talking in particular about this famous automobile lobby, the proponents of the status quo, who, as we know, will do everything to ensure that these proposals do not come to life. But let's not forget our responsibility. Ambitious legislation is needed if this Commission - your Commission, Commissioner - is really to be the last chance, as Mr Juncker says and reminds us. The Europeans are waiting for us at the turn and are counting on us to move forward. So I say: let us not disappoint them, urban mobility must absolutely be a priority.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 166, "date": "2015-12-02.json", "name": "Violeta Bulc", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, the report Members are adopting today is the result of very intensive and fruitful work. It is comprehensive, inspiring and – I am happy to say – to a large extent in line with the Commission’s thinking. I would like to thank the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteur and everyone who worked on the report. There were more than 500 amendments, which demonstrates how much thought and energy went into it. The report showed that cities are of an ever—growing importance for all of us, quite simply because more and more of us are living in the city – 80% of Europeans live in urban areas. So it is logical that we have to tackle some serious challenges in urban areas: congestion, demographic change, road safety, access to mobility and air pollution, including CO2. The report reflects these challenges and proposes solutions that can be manifested. I will not go through all of them, but will mention only three that I find particularly important at this point. First, sustainability and urban mobility plans. These have proven to be a very useful instrument and show that voluntary instruments can work very well. This is encouraging for our efforts to support cities through the exchange of best practices and guidance. So, I would ask Members, when back in their constituencies, to support the Commission in promoting these. An intelligent transport system is the second area. Members may be aware that the Commission is running a platform for Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C—ITS). The aim is to deploy C—ITS as soon as possible, EU—wide, in a coordinated manner. Cities would greatly benefit from this. More generally, the report recognises the incredible potential that digitalisation offers for individual mobility and city logistics. We fully agree on this point. Digitalisation of transport is therefore a personal priority for me as well.  The third area is investment and innovation. Both are key enablers for jobs and growth. Let us reflect together on how we can support cities in attracting more investment and how this investment can support innovation and how innovation can support sustainability. The report confirms that innovation in urban mobility offers huge opportunities. Just take clean transport and the multiple benefits that decarbonisaton of transport offers. Let us stop associating decarbonisation with cost and start thinking of it in terms of investment. With urbanisation as a global mega-trend, I am convinced that it will really pay off and will contribute to the Commission’s agenda for growth and new jobs. Let me also mention EFSI at this point, which is an appropriate mechanism to address its needs.  Urban mobility is such a rich topic that I would need to mention many more issues to be complete – road safety, the sharing economy, active mobility, EFSI, SAVE and the cohesion funds, multimodality and many more. But now it is time for the debate. I am really looking forward to hearing Members’ concrete comments and I will be very happy to respond to their proposals at the end of the debate.

This is an excellent and collaborative report that fully takes account of both the common and particular transport issues faced by people across the EU living in different urban communities. I am very pleased also that our report focuses constructively on innovation in the area of freight. As our rapporteur said, urban areas account for around a quarter of European carbon emissions from transport and so, Commissioner, we urgently need genuinely sustainable mobility for goods and for our economies. I would like your comments on that point. On road safety, it is especially welcome that the report calls strongly for advanced traffic and speed management measures, including enforcement. As elected representatives, we must recognise and act on the fact that a large majority of Europeans think that road safety in cities is a serious problem. Many, many cyclists and pedestrians are killed or seriously injured in our cities in Europe every year. What, Commissioner, are you going to do about that?  Towns and cities are also often unequal places with extreme divisions between rich and poor. As acknowledged by this report, good public transport has important social and economic benefits, as well as environmental ones, helping people gain access to jobs and get out of poverty.

Allow me to comment a little bit more and give you more information about our next steps.  We are all becoming more and more aware of the multidimensional challenges that urban mobility presents. With the 2011 Transport White Paper, the Commission set the objective of a competitive and resource-efficient urban mobility. The urban mobility package of 2013 addressed in greater detail how to achieve these objectives, but this report gives new impetus to the implementation of that package.  With Parliament’s support, the Commission will concentrate efforts in the area where EU action can bring added value but with full respect for the subsidiarity principle. In particular, we are planning to: pursue a more holistic approach to smart, sustainable and resilient cities; further support cities, industry and R&amp;I by promoting a marketplace for trading solutions; offer cities and innovative projects promoters support for real—life testing under Horizon 2020; help cities to use different EU funding opportunities, and to combine public and private investment, for instance from the European Fund for Strategic Investment; and run platforms – as one of you also mentioned – for exchange of practices, since at EU level this can have a much bigger impact than many think.  Let me now directly respond to some of your questions and comments.  As regards freight, by all means, you have full support for that from me. The 2011 White Paper already talked about nearly—zero—emissions city logistics by 2030, so green urban logistics are in our programme and in our minds.  The second question was on road safety, which is a very important element, especially for the most vulnerable in traffic. A lot of work has been done, but we are pushing Member States on a daily basis to do even more. We especially work very closely with the countries that statistics have shown to be the worst, with the direct involvement of all stakeholders in the country to bring fatalities figures close to zero in the future. By the way, bikes, as Mr Cramer and some other colleagues have mentioned, are one of the important elements of the green freight solutions in cities so yes, this topic will not go away and we will continue to address it and look for options on how to support it even further.  There were a couple of questions and comments regarding diesel. Clearly we need to improve the overall system that allows cars to be placed on the market – the type-approval system. We need more European oversight, effective control mechanisms and better quality and greater independence of vehicle testing. We need to move – and I fully support this – from lab testing to real driving emission tests for CO2 as soon as possible. At the same time, I do count on the electrification of transport being delivered, as we expect, in the near future. As regards awareness raising, the Commission for example has been promoting multimodality with the ‘Do the right mix’ campaign as part of European Mobility Week and has focused attention on walking and cycling in combination with an increased use of public and collective transport as a good way forward for all of us. Allow me also quickly to go back to the comment regarding cycling. Please, let us not underestimate the economic benefits that this brings, not only in health, but also the positive effects on congestion and CO2 and, of course, the positive effect on the transport industry. I welcome the Council’s declaration, and we will work within our mandate to support it.  Finally, allow me also just to say a couple more words regarding the overall subject. Long-term engagement at all levels of governance is key to making European cities smart, well-connected and green, and the Commission is ready to support the emergence of new ideas within our mandate. They are the stakeholders that can drive prosperity and offer quality jobs.  Within my portfolio, 2016 is the year for decarbonisation and I am sure that we will address urban mobility very comprehensively as part of that initiative.

In this area, it is essential to make progress as soon as possible, which must be achieved both by redirecting as much of today's road users as possible to more environmentally friendly rail transport and, on the other hand, by providing as much space as possible for technologies based on non-internal combustion engines in the propulsion of urban road transport vehicles.  In order to achieve these objectives, it is essential, on the one hand, to further develop urban rail transport and, on the other hand, to support the widest possible use of electric and other non-greenhouse gas drive systems in urban road transport.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 197, "date": "2015-12-02.json", "name": "Victor Negrescu (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "88882", "text": "  in writing. – I support this initiative for the introduction of a Sustainable Urban Mobility plan, financed by the EU budget, to protect the well-being and the safety of EU citizens and of the environment.

The report ultimately outlines the fact that existing initiatives such as road charging (Eurovignette), and new approaches to urban transport such as car sharing, are imperative in the intermodal mobility chain, alongside cycling, walking and public transport.

Furthermore, I stressed the importance of cross-border urban interconnecting in the urban planning process, as this stimulates regional development. In sustainable urban mobility, the quality of human life must be the focus, with a direct focus on the release of places from excessive congestion by vehicles, or the planning of parking lots, in order to allow free movement of pedestrians and the attractiveness of urban centres.

I believe that spatial planning is the most important stage for creating smooth, safe and persistent transport networks that have a real impact on citizens' lives and transport, and I emphasise that safety must always be seen as a key element of sustainable urban planning.

Mr President, members of Parliament, just a few days before the official closing ceremony of the European Year for Development on 9 December in Luxembourg, I am particularly pleased to have this exchange with you on this example of excellent collaboration with the European institutions, involving Member States, civil society, the private sector and all those involved in development issues. From the outset, the Council and the Member States of the European Union have been very directly involved in the European Year for Development. Firstly, in the context of the preparatory work for the adoption of the decision of the European Parliament and the Council, which enabled the launch of the European Year for Development, on the basis of a Commission proposal. As of January 1, 2015, we were ready to celebrate and live this year under the motto \"Our world, our dignity, our future\".  Together, we have put in place an exceptional programme of activities to highlight the results achieved by the European Union, acting with the Member States, as a global player and the world's leading provider of official development assistance. Key events were held, such as the inaugural session in Riga or the debate in Brussels on the post-2015 development agenda, particularly with young people, in the presence of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. A large number of Member States have also organised an official inauguration of the European Year for Development in their countries, in the presence of the highest authorities, demonstrating their commitment to development cooperation and attracting the spotlight of the national media. But, above all, Member States have played a key role in implementing the European Year for Development by bringing activities closer to European citizens. We have worked hand in hand with regional and local authorities, civil society, education, culture and research actors, all those partners who, in one way or another, share a sense of responsibility and solidarity. We have, of course, also associated the private sector, because its role is paramount and development is a responsibility for all of us. We have focused on social media and digital media, which have reached one of the priority target groups, youth. Young people are at the heart of the new 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Many young people are actively engaged, but it was essential to continue to support them, to inform them in their approach, and to arouse the interest of those who feel even less concerned. 2015 was an emblematic year rich in international events directly linked to sustainable development: the Milan World Expo, the UN General Assembly, at which the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals were adopted, the Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa, the Climate Change Conference - right now in Paris - , to name but the most important. These are all events that have served as a sounding board for the European Year for Development and have enabled the European Union to carry its message with strength and conviction.  I do not need to repeat here the importance of development. The many debates we have had in this Chamber in recent months, particularly on migration and the refugee crisis, have once again demonstrated this, if necessary. Development is often the key and is, in a way, the flip side of migration.  I had the opportunity to say that when we debated sustainable development specifically a few months ago. The fight against poverty and despair that drives people to leave their country in the worst conditions must remain a high priority. This year has enabled us to raise public awareness of the benefits of development cooperation, not only for beneficiaries, but also for EU citizens, and to increase understanding of the concept of policy coherence in the service of development. Despite the difficult times we are going through, European citizens tell us that they are largely in favour of development cooperation and that they remain in solidarity with our less favoured partners. We must do everything we can to keep this state of mind alive and continue to translate this will for solidarity into concrete actions.  I would like to thank, here, first of all, the European Parliament and, in particular, Mrs McAvan and her Committee on Development for their contribution to the success of this European Year. Next week you will be, Madam, with us, in Luxembourg, to close this year. I would also like to congratulate myself here on the spirit of inter-institutional cooperation which has enabled a joint declaration by Parliament, the Commission and the Council, which represents the legacy of the European Year for Development, to be set in motion in a very tight timetable. This declaration will be symbolically signed in Luxembourg on 9 December to, precisely, perpetuate the spirit of this Year and encourage the European institutions and Member States to continue their efforts to raise awareness among European citizens beyond 31 December 2015.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 216, "date": "2015-12-02.json", "name": "Neven Mimica", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, we are approaching the end of the European Year for Development. This has been a year of partnership, innovation, networking and the sharing of experience. It has seen the European institutions come together with national governments and parliaments, and with civil society and private sector and international organisations, to promote the message that development cooperation is important for all.  The Year’s motto, ‘Our world, our dignity, our future’ has been a constant reminder that development cooperation is not just about people in developing countries. It is also about how we, as Europeans, respond to them. I wish to thank Parliament for its vital role in initiating, supporting and driving the European Year for Development.  This has taken many forms. I can see that the square outside this Chamber is being decorated with European Year For Development posters. I would like to thank, in particular, President Martin Schulz, Mrs Linda McAvan, the Chair of the Committee on Development, and Mr Charles Goerens, member of the Committee, for their strong support. 2015 has been a critical year for development, with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development adopted and, hopefully, an ambitious climate framework forthcoming. At the same time, a significant increase in refugees and migrants worldwide is a stark reminder of how important it is to address the root causes of instability and irregular migration – in other words, to give everyone the potential to live a life of dignity at home, rather than fleeing from hunger, poverty, insecurity or violations of human rights. For me the main success of the European Year for Development was – and is – the partnership with so many development actors in Europe and beyond. I am very happy that Parliament, the Council and the Commission will together acknowledge the legacy of this year by endorsing a joint declaration at the official closing ceremony in Luxembourg.  Let us work together to maintain this spirit of partnership when discussing, promoting and communicating development cooperation beyond 31 December this year. Let us all take the legacy of the European Year for Development forward to become a common framework and a true platform for a continuous and ongoing European development dialogue in the years to come.

Mr. President, Mr. Minister, Mr. Commissioner, we may have expected 2015 to develop in another way at the beginning of this year. Perhaps someone will say that 2015 has actually been more years of mass migration towards Europe than the European Year of Development has been and there is no doubt that migration has dominated our discussions and attention lately, but all this only confirms the importance of an effective development policy. This confirms the need to focus more on the causes of the problem, not just the symptoms. The causes of poverty, war, and then of course mass migration. And the causes can be found precisely in systematic violations of human rights, in endemic corruption in many countries in our neighborhood and in the absence of good rule.  And that is why this year, the European Year of Development, we have sought and managed to change the global framework for development and enter a specific development goal, development goal 16, on peace, on justice, on the fight against corruption, on effective justice, on good governance. This is one great success of the European Union. Here I am, using the opportunity to highlight here the role of Mr. Commissioner. Implementation is now important and in this implementation of the new global Agenda 2030, we need to focus precisely on this development goal 16 as a priority in our action, all in line with the concept of human rights-based development policy.

Mr President, it can be said, after eleven months of large-scale awareness campaigning, that the European Year for Development has been a success. The cooperation that has been established between the actors that are the political leaders, the representatives of NGOs, the territorial representatives, and those of the private sector in particular should be commended. The major challenges that emerged in 2015 highlighted the indispensable contribution of development to solving our problems. In this regard, the refugee crisis is note. The last few weeks show how essential it was to put the principle of respect for dignity at the centre of the 2015 campaign. Some, including the European Commission and a few Member States, have acted in accordance with this principle. Others, although supportive of the idea of the European Year for Development, have tended to promote the principle of indifference. No threshold, no ceiling, no consideration based on the exploitation of difference can impair dignity. The European Year for Development reminds us that the current problems of illegality, poor governance and the threat to internal peace in developing countries are the result of what we have done over the last 15-20 years. These problems are the result of our action, but also of our inaction. What we fail or refuse to do today is sure to affect the situation in the world over the next twenty years. Let us be determined, resolute, uncompromising as soon as our promise is made. This promise will have to be declined not only in terms of principles, but also in terms of the means we intend to mobilize for implementation. There is no question of ending the great awareness campaign of 2015; the motto \"Our world, our dignity, our future\" is intended to be perpetuated as it is important to preserve it in the path laid out in 2015.

We must stop giving with one hand what we take away with the other, as is the case, for example, with our trade policy, which cannot continue to impoverish the people of the South and undermine the objectives of development policy.

Only in those countries where there are corresponding binding rules do we see really good progress and a higher proportion of women on supervisory boards. Patience is no longer a category. The European Parliament has done its job. What do we want? In listed companies, the proportion of women will increase to 40% by 2020. And what do we want? By introducing objective procedures. Objective procedures, that is, that the best men and the best women should be selected. That is good for the economy, and it is, of course, fair. That is the point alone. This is actually gentle and an offer to the Member States. And then there is also this passage, which allows countries such as Germany, for example, to make their national efforts – all that they have tried in recent years and are now trying to achieve a higher proportion of women in companies – counted. In other words, there is really an offer for the Member States to be courageous and to adopt this report. This dossier is ready and ready to be negotiated, it is on the table. I would therefore really like to thank the Luxembourg Presidency for showing this energy, and now – I do not want to say one last, but nevertheless – to make an effort to try to take on board the Member States that are now keeping themselves covered.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like first of all to thank you, Commissioner, but also to thank the Luxembourg Presidency and, in particular, Minister Mutsch for their efforts to unblock the situation with regard to this draft directive. Unfortunately, two years after the European Parliament voted at first reading, I could take almost word for word the speech I gave in plenary on that occasion. Parliament has done its part and it is up to the Member States to roll up their sleeves and put into practice the commitments they have made for gender equality in Europe. Let me first point out the facts, because it seems that there are still some irreducible skeptics about the potential of this directive. On the one hand, the facts have shown that a greater presence of women on boards translates into better governance and economic performance. Again, what are we waiting for to harness women's potential and empower us to achieve economic and social goals? On the other hand, the facts also show that legislative pressure works. Between the publication of the proposed directive and today, we have gone from 15.8% to more than 20% of women on boards of directors. The trend of progress is much stronger since there is European legislative pressure. Companies anticipate the effects of the directive and select competent women. In addition, I would like to stress once again the snowball effect we can expect from this directive: positive effects at different levels of the hierarchy, in particular thanks to the related measures that could be put in place. So, for those who are not convinced, at least be pragmatic. The second general point is that the legal basis chosen, the tool chosen, which is the directive, and the proposals put forward by Parliament already offer Member States a great deal of leeway. In the end, the only thing we have been waiting for, and for two years now, is a commitment from the Member States and coherent measures to achieve real results.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Regner, Mrs Gabriel, I welcome first of all the opportunity to address Parliament and to inform you of the progress of the work on the Commission's proposal for a directive on improving gender balance on boards of directors. On this issue, Parliament has already adopted - as you have just mentioned - its position at first reading, in which it largely supports the Commission's approach. In October, the Commission published new figures on gender balance on the boards of listed companies. These figures show that, in the European Union as a whole, barely one-fifth of board members are women. Although ridiculously low, this figure indicates some progress. I agree, we would have to be extremely patient so that, in fact, at this process, we can get to equality or balance. So it is indeed necessary to settle this in a different way and to speed it up a bit.  It should not be forgotten that in 2010, when these debates began at EU level, only one in ten of the boards of directors was a woman. So we have to continue to address this problem. There is simply no reason why, in the twenty-first century, boards of directors should be dominated by men. Greater equality in leadership positions is a positive signal to society as a whole.  The balance between women and men in decision-making bodies is of course a question of concrete equality. It is also a symbol, but I would add that diversity is very often - as you said, Mrs Gabriel - positive from the point of view of good corporate governance. Ladies and gentlemen, the Luxembourg Presidency has made this issue one of its top priorities. We have put forward several new drafting proposals to find a compromise within the Council. Within the Council's bodies, the proposal has been extensively discussed and discussed. We have now, after all these discussions, put the issue on the agenda of the EPSCO Council, which will meet next Monday, to take stock and see if, in fact, a qualified majority in favour of the proposal could emerge. I do not want to anticipate the outcome of these discussions in the Council, but I can, unfortunately, already tell you that the recent debates at The Coreper have not been very encouraging. Today I have received very good news, since I have learned that a country, which you know well, Commissioner, has indeed announced that it has changed its position from an unfavourable position to a favourable one. That, I think, is a good signal that is quite positive. So, as you know, this proposal contains binding procedural rules that aim to achieve quantitative objectives. It requires that the selection process for board members be fair and based on merit and transparency. The main difficulties arise from the fact that Member States have different approaches to the subject. Some Member States are at a more advanced stage than others in terms of the level of equality between women and men in this regard. But, on the whole, I would say that there is a consensus in favour of the objective of this proposal. However, while a large number of Member States are in favour of EU-wide legislation, others - and unfortunately, for the time being, they are still a blocking minority - retain a preference for national measures (by the other way forward) or advocate non-binding measures at EU level.  The Presidency has also drawn up, in the context of gender equality, the Council's conclusions, which will also be adopted - on this point, I believe they will succeed - at the EPSCO Council on 7 December. Our work was based on a report by the European Institute for Gender Equality, which provided an update on the current situation in the European Union. In conclusion, we must ensure that our largest companies can benefit from the talent and dynamism of both women and men. Europe has a multitude of untapped talents and above all, today we find that 60% of university graduates in Europe are women. There is therefore no reason why, in the twenty-first century, governments, businesses, banks or other institutions are still mainly led by men. Let me thank the European Parliament for keeping the issue of gender equality on the agenda.

Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, we are here this evening quite few - many, I should say, unfortunately, two years after the first reading vote on the Kratsa-Regner report, to debate again the subject of greater participation of women in the decision-making bodies of large European companies listed on the stock exchange and to know exactly where the work in the Council stands. Mr Minister, you have a little, on the model of the Scottish shower, alternated the good and the bad news. We can only conclude from this that we are whole-hearted with you and with Commissioner Jourova for progress, on a path of progress, at the EPSCO Council meeting on 7 December.  Nevertheless, I wanted to point out, as my colleague, Mariya Gabriel, has done, that there is unquestionably, on the part of the European Parliament, in the context of this first reading, an effort of lucidity, of responsibility, a strong commitment which has been made but with great pragmatism and respect for the positions of the Member States, respect for the principle of subsidiarity , respect for a number of principles and wishes that had already been put forward by different Member States.  We have taken responsibility, we have taken a significant number of steps without compromising on the essentials, without res due to our strong commitment to greater participation of women in the decision-making process on boards of directors. There are still a few of us here in Parliament who think that coercion and quotas can work. I come, for example, from a country - France - where a law came into force in 2011, the so-called Copé-Zimmermann law. It definitely worked. It has undoubtedly produced effects: 33% of women on the boards of large French groups. Undoubtedly, the constraint works. But we are respectful of what can be said, of the different legal cultures and approaches of the Member States. We just have to keep this in mind - as has been said by others, but I want to stress this point - that the waste of women's talent, the waste of women's skills, the waste of the fantastic training and education efforts that are being deployed through our education systems, our training systems for women, for young girls...

The OECD bases its position on the fact that companies statistically benefit from including more women in boardrooms economically.

However, eight out of ten directors of European companies are men. This is unequal, unfair, costs us money and harms the competitiveness of the Union. And it's easy to solve. Quotas have proven effective in correcting such problems: a political decision is sufficient to facilitate and encourage the incorporation of female talent into the direction of the European economy. There are good reasons to do so. Studies abound – like the one presented right here last month by FIona Jurdant of the OECD – that show that companies with balanced advice are more competitive, have fewer governance problems, more performance in capital, and better economic performance. That's why they work better and build more trust in clients and investors; therefore, incorporating that value into our economy is strategic and innovative; therefore, to bet on public programs and legislation to achieve this, an investment; that is why it is a competitive advantage in which we must be world leaders; and that's why we need transparency and fairness in selecting the people who make up the board of directors.

Women were excluded from operational and decision-making posts for ideological reasons. These acted as barriers to entry that inhibited the full development of productive potential in societies, firms and governments. Quotas were the tool to overcome this barrier. Once equality of gender opportunity and its effective implementation are ensured, chances for an improvement in productivity are improved. Gender quotas automatically become archive material. They have been effective at operational level. They will be equally so for executive, decision-making positions.  I speak from experience. In the Malta Labour Party, we introduced quotas for women in elections to the general conference and the national executive. Within fifteen years, quotas were no longer needed. Gender parity was being automatically achieved, via the ‘normal’ electoral process for these institutions. There was a clear improvement in their functioning.

However, we are far from true gender equality, particularly in the business world where senior management positions are still held by men. The fact is that, in the EU today, women account for just 21.2% of board members of the largest publicly listed companies registered in the EU countries. Although quotas are a controversial topic, I view them as the best available solution to ensure better gender balance on corporate boards of European companies.  Therefore I support the 2012 Commission proposal for a directive setting a minimum objective of 40% of the under-represented sex in non-executive board-member positions in listed companies in Europe by 2020, or 2018 for listed public undertakings. The European Parliament has strongly backed this proposal; unfortunately the Council was less enthusiastic. I would therefore wish to remind Members of the blocking minority, and that we need strong rules to tackle the gender imbalance in company boardrooms and ensure greater gender equality in the corporate world, and also in our society.

On 10 June Parliament adopted a resolution in plenary on this situation, where it asked the Commission to assess the situation and to establish an EU mechanism to monitor democracy, the rule of law and human rights annually across the EU. The aim of the resolution is not to single out a single Member State or government but to call on EU institutions, particularly the Commission as the guardian of the EU Treaties, to fulfil an obligation to ensure the application of and compliance with the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, across the Union.  The EU, as we all know, was founded on values of respect, freedom, democracy, equality and rule of law as well as human rights. With this in mind it is important that Member States and all EU institutions work together to protect these basic European principles.  In paragraph 11 of the resolution the European Parliament urged the Commission to ‘activate the first stage of the EU framework to strengthen the rule of law, and therefore to initiate immediately an in-depth monitoring process concerning the situation of democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights in Hungary, assessing a potential systemic serious breach of the values on which the Union is founded as per Article 2 TEU including the combined impact of a number of measures exacerbating the state of democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights, and evaluating the emergence of a systemic threat to the rule of law in that Member State that could develop into a clear risk of a serious breach within the meaning of Article 7 TEU’, and asked the Commission to ‘report back on this matter to Parliament and the Council before September 2015’. So I put the following questions to the Commission: Has the Commission carried out this in-depth monitoring process as requested by Parliament? If not, can the Commission explained the reasons for not having initiated such in-depth monitoring? Secondly can the Commission provide the European Parliament with its assessment of the situation of democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights in Hungary today? Third, has the Commission activated the Rule of Law Framework as called for by the European Parliament, and if not, can the Commission provide a reasoned argument for not having done so? I am very much looking forward to the responses of the Commission and the debate of Members on these key questions.

I know that there is a lot of discussion on whether to trigger Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union or the Rule of Law Framework as regards Hungary. Today I would like to set out for the House what action the Commission is taking to monitor the situation in Hungary, and to ensure that European Union law and fundamental values remain respected there. And it is against that background that I will also explain to you why the Commission does not believe that there are grounds at this stage to trigger Article 7 or the Rule of Law Framework. During our previous debates I have always made it clear that the Commission will be vigilant when concrete measures and actions are taken by the Hungarian authorities. I have also said that the Commission will use all the means at its disposal to ensure that Hungary – as well as any other Member State – complies with its obligations. And you know that the Commission has already done so in the past when it took Hungary, for instance, successfully to Court for the early retirement of judges or violation of the independence of the Data Protection Supervisor.  This is what we have done. Following Parliament’s resolution of 10 June 2015, the Commission has taken a number of actions with respect to the recent developments in Hungary. Let me give you a brief overview. As regards migration, the Hungarian Government formally announced on 15 September 2015 a ‘crisis situation caused by mass immigration’ on the basis of legislation that had entered into force that same day. A preliminary assessment of the Hungarian legislation revealed a number of concerns and questions on substance and implementation relating in particular to the compatibility of this legislation with the EU’s asylum and borders acquis, and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. These issues were addressed by the Commission’s services in a letter sent on 6 October 2015 to the Hungarian authorities.  A detailed reply from the Hungarian authorities was received on 4 November, which clarified a number of questions but did not remove all outstanding concerns. This response is currently under assessment by the Commission.  As regards the debate on the reintroduction of the death penalty, both Commission President Juncker and First Vice-President Timmermans made clear statements on this: Article 2 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights prohibits explicitly and clearly any person from being condemned to death, or executed. In addition, the European Court of Human Rights has ruled that the death penalty is a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights. The abolition of the death penalty is a condition which states are required to meet in order to become members of the Council of Europe or of the European Union. The reintroduction of capital punishment would be contrary to the EU’s fundamental values. A reintroduction of the death penalty by a Member State would therefore lead to the application of Article 7 of the Treaty. The debate launched by Prime Minister Orbán did not materialise and the death penalty has not been introduced.  As regards the situation of civil society in Hungary, the Commission expressed its concerns about the disagreement between Norway and Hungary and about the follow-up to this dispute, which may have a serious impact on a number of NGOs working on the promotion of human rights in Hungary, and negatively affect the functioning of the European Economic Area and Norwegian financial mechanisms.  The Commission’s services sent an administrative letter to the Hungarian authorities underlining this concern. On 7 October this year it was reported that the National Tax Authority had closed its investigation into the NGOs relating to the European Economic Area/Norway grants. The decision to withdraw the tax registration numbers of the NGOs concerned is still pending before a Hungarian court. We have also noticed that a Hungarian court ruled that a police raid on watchdog NGOs in 2014 was illegal. As regards the situation of Roma, the housing situation remains a concern. The Commission’s services started an EU pilot procedure and are assessing the matter in the light of the Directive on Racial Equality, which prohibits discrimination on grounds of ethnic origin in a number of fields, including housing.  On the education of Roma, concerns remain as well, in particular relating to possible segregation and discrimination of Roma children. Also on this matter the Commission’s services started an EU pilot procedure and are following further developments, again in the light of the Directive on Racial Equality.  As regards the transposition and implementation of the Framework Decision on racism and xenophobia in Hungary, a meeting took place on 15 October 2015 between the Commission’s services and the Hungarian authorities to discuss a number of outstanding issues. The meeting was part of a series of bilateral dialogues held during the past year with Member States on this topic prior to the possible launching of infringement procedures.  I can assure you that the Commission will not hesitate to take action to ensure the proper transposition and implementation of the Framework Decision by Hungary, like any other Member State. We underlined this in the European Agenda on Security as well as during the Commission’s Colloquium on Fundamental Rights in October. As regards the situation of the media, the Hungarian Parliament amended on 27 May 2015 its advertising tax law, following an EU Pilot procedure and an in-depth state aid investigation launched by the Commission. As a result, the EU Pilot procedure could be closed, while the state aid investigation continues, as certain state-aid related aspects still remain to be clarified.  The Commission has also taken note of the opinion of the Venice Commission of 22 June 2015 on Media legislation in Hungary and is following the response of the Hungarian authorities to the recommendations contained therein. As regards corruption and misuse of EU funds, the Commission suspended on 14 July 2015 payments for several contracts across eight programmes due to the use of an excessively restrictive selection criterion in public procurement procedures. The Commission had already suspended interim payments to Hungary from the European Regional Development Fund for priorities 1, 2 and 3 of the operational programme ‘Economic Development’. This suspension was lifted by the Commission on 23 September 2015, following corrective action by the Hungarian authorities. OLAF is continuing investigations.  In the context of the European Semester, the Commission noted continued shortcomings as regards corruption and lack of transparency affecting public administration, decision-making and public procurement in Hungary. Following a Commission proposal, country-specific recommendations were adopted by the Council on 14 July 2015, calling for action to address these issues.  The Commission is actively pursuing infringement procedures against Hungary in a range of other areas. Several infringement procedures are rule-of-law related, for instance, concerning the principle of legal certainty, the effectiveness of judicial review, or the powers and independence of administrative authorities. Other infringement procedures are related to economic discrimination, in particular affecting the freedom of establishment, the freedom to provide services or the free movement of capital. In addition, the Commission is actively conducting state aid investigations, inter alia concerning two recent Hungarian measures with steeply progressive rate structures, notably a food-chain inspection fee and a new tax on sales of tobacco products. In these cases the Commission issued injunctions, prohibiting Hungary from applying the progressive rates until the Commission has concluded its assessment. The Commission also opened, last week, in-depth state aid investigations into Hungary’s plans to provide financing for the construction of two new nuclear reactors in the Paks plant. The Commission is also following how the judiciary in Hungary is fulfilling its role of guarantor of the rule of law. In recent months a number of noteworthy judgments have been rendered by the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court and also by ordinary Hungarian courts.  This overview demonstrates that the Commission is actively monitoring the situation in Hungary and is ready to use all the means at its disposal to ensure that Hungary – as well as any other Member State – complies with the obligations under European Union law and respects the values of the European Union enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. This includes using infringement procedures in case of violations of European Union law as well as the EU Rule of Law Framework where this is necessary. The Commission has at this stage not activated the Rule of Law Framework as regards Hungary. The Rule of Law Framework will be activated where there are clear indications of a systemic threat to the rule of law in a Member State, in particular in situations which cannot be effectively addressed by infringement procedures and if the ‘rule of law safeguards’ which exist at national level no longer seem capable of effectively addressing these threats. These national ‘rule of law safeguards’ refer to all judicial and constitutional mechanisms and safeguards which aim to ensure the protection of democracy and fundamental rights in a Member State.  Considering that concerns about the situation in Hungary are being addressed by a range of infringement procedures and pre-infringement procedures, and that also the Hungarian justice system has a role to play, the Commission takes the view that the conditions to activate the Rule of Law Framework regarding Hungary are at this stage not met.  The Commission will continue to monitor the situation in Hungary closely, including the functioning of the national rule of law safeguards referred to above.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 313, "date": "2015-12-02.json", "name": "Monika Hohlmeier", "mepid": "96780", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. First of all, iwould like to thank the Commissioner for the very comprehensive overview. And also a thank you for the answer that you actually gave us on 5 November, which, unfortunately, did not pass on Parliament's administration to Members within the appropriate timeframe, so that we therefore unfortunately received the answer so late that we made an unjustified reproach to you in the question, namely that you allegedly did not reply to us. You have replied to us, and I would like to express my thanks for that. Secondly, I would like to thank you for being very objective in dealing with the issue. In view of the problems that we have, not only in Hungary, but also in Greece and Poland, for example, in a great variety, but also in Slovakia and the Czech Republic at the moment, in the area of dealing with refugees, in dealing with refugees and the like, I think it is urgently necessary for you to try to address this in a objective, structured way and to continue the work here with care. What I see as problematic on the part of Parliament at the moment – and I have said this to colleagues on several occasions – is that the focus is solely on Hungary, when there are enough other Member States with very similar problems. The judicial system in Greece suffers at least as much as it does in Hungary. It is under a left-wing populist and right-wing populist government, which has been experiencing considerable problems for many years, without us discussing this offensively against Greece here in this Parliament under the threat of Article 7 through Parliament. We also have problems with refugees in Hungary, not just in Hungary. We have the same problems in Greece, including with human rights violations. We also have problems in Poland, partly with arguments that are very strong and which are very intense and speak out against refugees, with everyone signing the Convention on Human Rights and having to know that refugees have the right to find refuge in a Member State of the European Union if they are fleeing war, death, hardship and misery and cannot survive in their own homeland. Then we are obliged to give them a home. There should be no discussion about this, but solidarity among the Member States. I would like to say that I find the structured way of proceeding very positive. Commissioner, I would like to ask you: you wrote in your letter that there are a great deal of – so to speak – control mechanisms, monitoring systems. It would be very interesting for us to know which Member States are being followed in what way, because then, for example, as an MEP, I too could have a better overview of whether the systems are being applied fairly – so to speak, evenly – to all the Member States, or whether the view has become a little too specific.

Since 2010, the Hungarian Government has been agreath of European legislation and values, with no regard for the other Member States, the Commission, nothing and no one. Yet what we are debating tonight is not simply a Hungarian issue, but a European matter. The illiberal, anti-Union, far-right politics based on national selfishness are no longer just a threat to Hungary, they have also hit the ground up in other Member States. The Hungarian Government is deliberately and systematically weakening the European Union with its policies. And his party family, the European People's Party, tolerates this without a word. We know that this debate is about the future of the European Union.  Today, the Hungarian Prime Minister found the immigration crisis to be the product of the people smugglers, the paid rights team and the leaders of the Union, who are doing this refugee crisis. I ask if there is anyone in the Commission, or even in the People's Party, who dares to say with a calm heart that this blatant and toxic politics does not endanger the Union as a whole. I don't think so.

It is the European Parliament's duty to respond to violations in member states. However, country-specific assessments and analyses of the situation should be balanced and fact-based, and must not interfere with the democratically taken sovereign decisions of these countries. That is why the European Commission's balanced position is so welcome.  Hungary has been criticised in the European Parliament for its alleged attempt to reinstate the death penalty, but nothing like this has happened, and the Hungarian Government has denied from the outset that it had such intentions. It is absurd to criticise the Hungarian Government for seeing a link between immigration – mass immigration – and a security threat in the light of what happened in Paris. It is hypocritical to accus Hungarians of closing the border when it comes to solved the problem of protecting the EU's external borders with Turkish hands. Accusations of populism, nationalism or xenophobia, thrown without cause, serve only as a political weapon against uncomfortable governments or political parties. While respecting The German Willkommenskultur, we cannot agree to impose it on all European countries. While respecting the diversity of political views as the essence of democracy, we cannot accept a monopoly of left-liberal views in Europe. It is worth recalling Article 3a of the Treaty of Lisbon: \"The Union respects the equality of the Member States vis-60 vis-60, as well as their national identity inextricably linked to their fundamental political and constitutional structures.

This is about the European Union being a community of values. This should be a space where every single European citizen can live in freedom, make choices for his or her life without having to fear the authorities.  The thing is, listening to the Commission – not just now but during all the years in the past – the Commission is taking a fairly narrow legalistic approach, and I understand that it does not have that many instruments to do anything else, but the Commission is only assessing whether there is a strict violation of European Union laws. But let us be fair – and I think the Commissioner would agree with me – if we look at the state of Hungary today, is it a place where people are free, happy citizens? No, because there is a government there that is fuelling xenophobia and homophobia, that is harassing the media, harassing NGOs, harassing the opposition – just yesterday 17 people from the opposition were arrested on charges of defamation – restricting free research, and I could go on and on.  Maybe we do not really have a legal instrument to tackle this but we need a political instrument because, quite frankly, I too, like most of my Hungarian colleagues probably, are tired of talking about Hungary. Soon we will be having similar debates about Poland. I have serious concerns about Poland as well. The Polish Government is saying: ‘Oh, we think Mr Orbán is a perfect example to follow.’ What has the new parliament done? It has fired five judges and immediately appointed new ones. That makes me really concerned about the independence of the judiciary.  So I do think that we need to move beyond monitoring the situation or silent diplomacy. I mean, Mr Timmermans’ silent diplomacy is so silent that I do not even see him here today. I really hope that with all the Groups in this House we are going to elaborate the Democratic Governance Pact, which will serve to monitor and debate the situation in all Member States to ensure that we will have, or we will be, this community of values.

Mr President, since May 2010, the human rights situation in Hungary has been deteriorating.

Indeed, Hungary is not the only state concerned, all states are more or less concerned with human rights violations, and it would be good if both should cease their political obsessions. Your answer, Commissioner, was long, but I am not satisfied. Is the commission really the custodian of all the articles of the treaty? What about the role of the European Parliament if our resolution last June seems to pass in losses and profits? Is the Charter of Fundamental Rights really an integral part of the treaties?

The answer is simple: because the Hungarian Government, with the support of a large majority of parliament and the population, has implemented an immigration policy that is different from what the Commission represents here and the majority of Parliament, but is effective. It defended its own sovereign borders and, with it, the Schengen borders. And yes, he thinks the quota system is wrong, because it is not necessary to distribute immigrants, but to prevent immigration.  Should we have a common European migrant policy? Should. But it should be effective. To do that, we would have to face the fact that this influx of organised immigrants is part of a war. And by the way, let me add that just because a country, its population, does not welcome immigrants with signs that say \"Refugee welcome\" does not make it xenophobe.

I would also like to stress here, in this debate on the protection of the Virunga National Park, the link between development, ecology and security. The resolution that we will vote on in Strasbourg in two weeks’ time stresses the absolute need to protect the Virunga National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It stresses that irreversible damage to the Virunga National Park could occur as the result of exploration and exploitation of oil or other activities. Currently, fishing in Lake Edward generates an estimated USD 30 million per year to the benefit of the local communities which live near the park. This figure is projected to double as a result of sustainable fisheries created by the Virunga Alliance, the park’s clean energy initiative. Mountain gorilla tourism alone could generate USD 38 million per year and create thousands of jobs. I think we should do more to protect local communities, as well as the endangered species in the park, such as the mountain gorillas and okapi.  I recall that oil exploration and exploitation are not compatible with UNESCO World Heritage status.  The message of our resolution is very clear. We call on the Commission and the Member States to further address the root causes of armed conflicts and corruption and to support sustainable development and peace—building strategies in the park and the surrounding region. We also urge the Commission, the Member States, the DRC and any oil company interested in drilling for oil to protect the current boundaries and the neighbouring areas of the Virunga National Park from the exploitation of fossil fuels.

Virunga illustrates the multi—dimensional challenges faced in the Great Lakes region, where peace—building, stabilisation and state-building need to go hand in hand.  Virunga is a unique World Heritage Site. Sadly, it is also a dangerous place to work and a difficult place to protect. A group of courageous and dedicated individuals have sacrificed their safety and sometimes their lives in the cause of conservation. They deserve our respect and appreciation. The EU must remind partners, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), of their duties under international agreements, including those which relate to natural resources. At the same time, we recognise the importance of taking into account the needs and the economic aspirations of local populations. This is an important focus within our development assistance to the DRC, designed to incentivise environmental protection and alternatives to illegal activities within parks.  The honourable Member rightly draws attention to an important human rights dimension among the challenges faced by Virunga: serious crimes, including sexual violence and violence against children, stem from conflicts with and between armed groups. Sadly, Virunga is not alone in this respect. Predation by armed groups on the resources of other DRC national parks such as Garamba, the scene of illegal activities by the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) and groups from as far afield as Sudan, also needs to be urgently addressed. Supporting human rights defenders and civil society around the park needs to remain a priority for the EU.  Our overall approach to Virunga recognises not only the need to protect the park but also to encourage legitimate development. Virunga produces significant renewable and sustainable products and services, including managed fisheries, hydro-electricity and agriculture, and it ensures food security to millions of people.  One goal of our financial support has been to support priority actions defined by mutual agreement with the Government of DRC. We have used European Development Fund and budget resources to boost an ambitious development programme, the ‘Alliance Virunga’.  Under the 10th European Development Fund, the EU supported Virunga with around EUR 10 million. Under the 11th EDF, EUR 40 million is available, triggering other donors to add their resources and, in particular, substantial private funds from the Buffett Foundation.  This support needs to be seen in the broader context of EU support to DRC national conservation policies and management of forests and biodiversity. The regional programme on management of fragile ecosystems of Central Africa (ECOFAC), also supported by the EU, has funded complementary actions. And the Global Climate Change Alliance was allocated EUR 14 million under the Environment budget line for mitigation actions in the region.  Finally, environment and sustainable agriculture is an area of concentration in the 11th EDF, with EUR 120 million allocated across the Democratic Republic of Congo. The impact on the populations living in the vicinity of protected areas will be a key issue in the programme.  I would like now to turn to the remaining specific issues raised by the honourable Member in her question. The first of these concerns the diplomatic response. In partnership with the Member States and other donors present in the DRC, the EU conveys messages on the protection of the park and other World Heritage Sites. Virunga has been raised in meetings with President Kabila and Prime Minister Matata by high-level EU representatives including Commission Vice-President Sefčovič and Commissioner Mimica as well, of course, as the Head of the EU Delegation to the DRC and other EU Heads of Mission. The EU has participated in joint initiatives, including a joint letter to the Prime Minister, expressing concern about oil exploration in Virunga, which was sent earlier this year.  Recognising the integrity of the park is an essential part of the EU position: Lake Edward is part of the ‘universal value’ that grants Virunga World Heritage status, and oil exploration and exploitation are incompatible with the UNESCO Convention.  The question also mentions how the EU can help the DRC Government address armed conflicts and support sustainable development and peace—building. The EU supports the Addis Ababa Peace Security and Cooperation Framework, the principal international agreement focused on peace and stabilisation in the Great Lakes region. This is the only viable roadmap for long-term peace and security in the region. More specifically, the EU assists the DRC in addressing insecurity in Virunga and the surrounding area, and the EU is active in the justice and security sector reform processes. To give one example, an EU-funded expert has trained the judicial authorities in ballistics examination. This was done in the framework of Investment contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP) funded projects in support of military justice. Such expertise has been applied in the investigation into the shooting of the Director of Virunga National Park. The EU also supports conflict resolution initiatives through its Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace. Thus, the IcSP has funded two relevant projects: the ‘security and stabilisation of cross-border areas of the Central Albertine Rift’ and ‘Strengthening of government institutions in management of protected areas’.  The honourable Member also drew attention to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The UN Guiding Principles are a framework conducive to responsible business, forming part of our Strategy on Corporate Social Responsibility. An EU Staff Working Document sets out the EU’s activities in implementing the guidelines and promoting progress in business and human rights. And, of course, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises is also a building block of the Strategy on Corporate Social Responsibility.  More broadly, on natural resources, I would also recall the EU engagement on responsible sourcing of tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold originating from conflict-affected and high-risk areas and, in particular, the EU financial support to the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) initiative on natural resources. Finally, a word on the strategic environmental assessment of oil exploration and exploitation in the Northern Albertine Rift. The EU and other partners encourage the DRC to wait for the results of the Sustainable Environment Assessment (SEA) before any decision on oil exploration or exploitation is made. For the SEA to be a real decision-making tool, it will be essential to ensure the maximum level of professionalism and transparency in the award of the contract for the next phase. That includes sufficient ownership by the Ministry of the Environment in agreeing the Terms of Reference. I have tried to address the different aspects of this question. However, I wish to end on a broader conclusion. Ensuring a viable future for parks and protected areas in the DRC means addressing both the root causes of conflict and the root causes of illegal activity. It also means working on state—building, because in the long term only effective governance by the DRC itself will ensure the protection of the parks and their development for sustainable activities. For this reason, the EU’s ongoing focus on security sector reform, governance, anti-corruption and public financial management in the DRC remains as important as the specific support we have given and will continue to give to Virunga.  Also, of course, I cannot ignore the importance of democracy and accountability to the DRC’s stability. The EU will continue to recall the constitutional obligations and the need for a rapid consensus on the electoral cycle between now and November 2016.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 351, "date": "2015-12-02.json", "name": "Joachim Zeller", "mepid": "96762", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which The Virunga National Park on Lake Edward, in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is the oldest nature reserve in Africa. Famous for its wide variety of rare plants and animal species, but mainly because it has the last larger population of mountain gorillas. About 400 of these imposing animals still live in the mountain forests of the Virunga volcanoes.  The Virunga National Park, a World Heritage Site, is also one of the most endangered natural paradises. In the vicinity of the park and on its territory there is a strongly growing population. Many people who have fled the genocide in Rwanda are still there. But marauding militias and rebel groups are harassing the population, killing and raping people. It is poached and valuable timber is illegally harvested. The greatest threat is experienced by this unique natural paradise, which the government of the DRC once committed itself to protecting, but by the fact that this government of the DRC awards production concessions to international energy companies, because oil deposits are suspected in the area of Lake Edward.  Although Total – and a few days ago, under international pressure, so-called SOCO International, based in London – has returned its mining rights, the DRC maintains its claim to continue to search for and extract oil in the area. But it is not only hunting the animals and the natural resources of the park – in the last 20 years, 140 of the park protectors have already had to pay for the service to preserve the park with their lives. The Park Rangers need our urgent support, financially and materially, as they perform their dangerous service to the preservation of this natural monument for all mankind. However, this also means that no raw materials from illegal mining in this area may be imported into the EU, including products containing materials that originate from illegal mining or have been promoted through forced labour.  And pressure must be exerted on the governments of Congo, and also uganda, to ensure the protection of the World Natural Heritage that they have contractually guaranteed.

Irreparable damage to the park's fauna and flora may occur as a result of oil exploration and extraction, as has already been said here. More than 80% of the park area is covered by hydrocarbon exploration concessions. Concerns are raised that the granting of concessions is in breach of international conventions of which the Democratic Republic of congo is a signatory, as well as Congolese law itself. In addition, the legal system of that country, on the basis of which oil is exploited, is ineffective. Attempts are being made to declassify part or all of the park.  Wirunga Park is also one of the most dangerous places in the world: for more than 20 years there has been an armed conflict between rebel troops and government forces, so effective nature conservation in the area is greatly hampered and workers' lives are at risk. In the last 10 years only, more than 240 guards mentioned by my colleague Zeller have lost their lives in their service. There are systematic human rights violations in the park: guerrillas commit murders, rape the people living in the park, and destroy their settlements.  The European Union should assist the Congolese authorities in the reform of geological law so that this law effectively protects the unique fauna and flora and that investors wishing to operate in the Democratic Republic of congo operate in accordance with national and international standards.

In 2010 the Congolese government signed an oil exploration contract in areas covering 85% of the Virunga park area, although Congo law prohibits any exploitation in this park that is considered a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Thus, this national park is now threatened, in particular by the concessions given to multinationals.

It is therefore so important to take action to increase the transparency of the agency, m.in. through universal access to information on the complaints mechanism in the context of frontex's annual general report, or to increase the powers of a fundamental rights officer.

However, it seems impractical in reality, since many subsidies for polluting energy directly benefit the most vulnerable people.
