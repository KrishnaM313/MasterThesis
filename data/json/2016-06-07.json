Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, this week is an important step in the fight against tax fraud and evasion by multinationals, and I would really like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who helped me present this text here in plenary. I will not recall the stakes - everyone knows them, since the last financial scandals that mixed an industrial scale tax evasion, tax evasion and money laundering have erupted, whether in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Switzerland or Panama, and this continues since, as recently as last Friday, France decided to sue \"Booking.com\" for tax evasion to the tune of 356 million. I would therefore like to reiterate today why this is a crucial step that we are taking here in the European Parliament. As you know, the European Parliament, since the media coverage of these scandals, has been one of the driving forces behind a fundamental reform of the taxation of multinationals in Europe. It is here that political awareness has taken shape, and it is here that the pressure has accumulated to push the Council and the Member States to realis that we no longer want this two-speed Europe where, on the one hand, the huge majority of citizens finance tax and, on the other hand, the most powerful multinationals in the world evade this tax. This way of analysing the situation is not ideology or political positioning, it is simply a question of wishing that everyone contributes in the same way to the financing of youth employment, health care, school, universities, housing or security.  (The President interrupts the speaker.) Multinationals cannot choose to escape the collective effort simply because they can afford financial or tax advisors whose sole mission is to imagine how to evade tax - the same financial/tax advisors whose remuneration is based on the amounts that are diverted from the tax base. This report is therefore the logical continuation of our work, since a comprehensive reflection on taxation has been initiated in Parliament, notably thanks to the special committees TAXE 1, TAXE 2 and the Commission of Inquiry on the Panama Papers, which will soon begin its work. The technical measures in this report therefore ensure that the gaps in our legislation are filled or that these dysfunctions are repaired. So let's get to the heart of the matter: what's in this report? First of all, the report provides that companies pay their taxes where they make their profits, and that is why it contains a whole series of precise and binding definitions of the conditions that attest that a multinational is well established in a country, since today, all too often, multinationals organize themselves to transfer their profits to tax havens without paying any taxes in the country where they really operate. Secondly, the report also provides for a strict and common blacklist of the 28 Member States of tax havens and countries that distort competition through favourable tax conditions, including those located in the EU. Clearly, it is a common definition of what a tax haven is. The report also provides for clarification of patent legislation, since so far too many multinationals are using patent incentives to artificially reduce the amount of their profits, whereas initially it was really a policy to help countries and companies that were truly innovative. The report also provides for an end to double non-taxation. Clearly, it is over for a multinational to be taxed anywhere because the legislation of the 28 is so complicated that some multinationals put in place tax arrangements that hide their profits and the actual amount of taxes paid. With regard to the switch-over clause and the rules on controlled foreign companies, this report calls for the debate on a fair tax rate between all Member States for corporation tax in the European Union, and this measure will allow all Member States to tax, at their national rates, the profits of multinationals that are not taxed or taxed at less than 15% in another country. Finally, the report proposes to effectively control loans between entities of the same multinational, since too often multinationals use this system of loans not to boost investment, but only to evade tax. These measures are not intended, as I have unfortunately heard, to kill the economy, but to effectively combat tax evasion and evasion by multinationals. This is another step in the process initiated by the European Parliament, and I think that is exactly what the European citizens expect from us here in Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Pierre Moscovici", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. Madam President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be here today to discuss the proposed directive against tax evasion. Step by step, and, as we also see, debate after debate, we are moving towards a deeply renovated, more modern and also more ethical European tax landscape. I have already had the opportunity to present a proposal to you, so I will not go into more detail. I just want to remind you of what our political objective is - and I know how much it is shared by the European Parliament - which is to put an end, quite simply, to tax evasion in the European Union.  The current situation, in which some companies can avoid paying their fair share of taxes in the EU, is simply no longer sustainable. Like you, I was shocked by the new revelations in the press with the Panama Papers and, as you pointed out, the news offers us extensions every day. Like you, I know that the citizens of Europe have had enough and, like you, I feel the urgent need to act. That is why, from the beginning of its mandate, this Commission has constantly worked to reform the taxation of our companies and will work in this direction until the end of its mandate.  I now turn to Mr Bayet's report. This excellent report recognises the directive as a positive step in the fight against tax evasion, and I welcome that. I thank all those who have contributed to its drafting and, of course, I congratulate the rapporteur first. This report proposes a number of amendments. I go back briefly to some of them without being exhaustive. Firstly, to point out that, in many cases, the Commission is in complete agreement with the points suggested. Secondly, we believe that the objectives of some amendments would be better addressed in other initiatives or instruments. Many of them deal with issues covered by previous or lateral initiatives of the Commission. I will take two examples, if I may, Mr rapporteur.  The June 2015 action plan first confirmed that the Commission will provide Member States with guidance for adopting the so-called modified link approach to the patent-friendly tax regime system. He also indicated that transfer pricing rules needed to be adapted. The directive against tax evasion discussed this morning therefore does not appear to be the right legislative instrument to deal with these issues. At the time, the Commission chose to take a non-binding approach and this approach still seems sufficient to achieve our objectives. However, the Commission has made it clear, and I repeat here, that it could consider legislating on these issues, as you have suggested, if necessary but, again, within the framework of a legislative instrument that would be different from this directive. Second, you propose that the issue of tax havens be dealt with within the framework of this directive. Frankly, we do not think that is desirable, not that we do not want to fight tax havens; on the contrary, it is an indispensable political objective, and we obviously agree with you on the need to adopt extremely strong and determined additional measures to better combat tax havens. However, as you know, again, the Commission initially opted for a non-binding approach. The external strategy we have recently adopted has thus defined a common approach to assess, list and, if necessary, sanction third countries that refuse to apply internationally defined tax rules. We are working towards the establishment, in a timely manner, of a European blacklist of tax havens, which does not exist today and is in need, with common methods, common approaches and common sanctions. I also welcome the support given by The Member States to our blacklist proposal, with the selection of a first set of countries as early as this summer. Therefore, I join you in the objective, in the purpose, in the ambition and in the requirement. Again, I think this is an approach that needs to be disjointed or dealt with elsewhere or otherwise.  As you know, this text is being discussed in the Council. We had a first meeting at the last Ecofin Council, which allowed us to see both a number of points of agreement and to see where we still needed to make progress in reaching an agreement. On some points, the Council amended the proposal in the direction suggested by this House. I am thinking, for example, of removing public infrastructure projects from the interest limitation rule or introducing a definition of associated companies. The Commission approves these changes, which undoubtedly improve the proposal and are included in your report. Again, it is a guarantee of its quality.  I want to make my position very clear here: we need an agreement and we need it now. We must seize the opportunity of this Dutch Presidency, which has been ambitious in this area and which has been vigorous. We must also seize the political moment in which we are, in the shock wave of the Panama Papers, to conclude now. I do not want this debate to get sit down or take longer. The Member States are very close to an agreement, in truth.  I therefore welcome the timing of this debate, because I believe that it is an opportunity for Parliament to send a very clear and very strong message to the finance ministers of the 28 Member States. Always remember - but you are even better placed than I am to know this - that it is certainly the Commission that proposes and Parliament that legislates or co-manages, but that the Member States have decision-making power, also blocking, which must be revisited. The political pressure we are exerting together is extremely important in this regard.  The message you are sending, as I understand it, Mr rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, is that the rapid adoption of this directive, namely next week, in the framework of the Ecofin Council, to be held on 17 June in Luxembourg, is essential to better combat tax evasion. We have a kind of obligation to succeed. That is how I understand this report. Those are the main points I wanted to make today quickly to introduce our debate. Time does not allow me, in this introductory remark, to review each of the amendments contained in your report, but, of course, we will be able to discuss them in more detail in this debate, to which I am ready as always, with the conviction that the Commission and the European Parliament are, in this fight against tax evasion, partners who share the same purpose and the same will.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Luděk Niedermayer", "mepid": "124701", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, first of all this is the second step in the European effort to fight tax evasion and tax avoidance and let me appreciate the quality and speed of the Commission proposal. At the same time, let me say that I fully understand the difficulties in the Council in finding agreement on the directive. Nevertheless I would very much appreciate it if the Council pays a little bit more attention to Parliament’s position as I believe it can significantly improve the quality. Let me therefore send this message to Council members regardless of their not very strong presence.  Let me first give some overall remarks. This is an anti-BEPS directive that is focused on tax evasion and tax avoidance. We must be aware of the risk that efforts to make it stronger at any cost can change it from an anti-BEPS directive to an anti-business directive. So we must be sensitive to the fact that most firms do pay taxes fairly, and by economic activity, by employment, they are contributing to the prosperity of our society. We should also bear in mind that the administrative burden for SMEs is quite serious so we must always consider the pros and cons of tightening the directive. Second, let me say that we should not forget that this is just the beginning. There are more proposals that should come, and CCCTB especially is the key. On a substantive issue, one of the proposals focuses on making a distinction between genuine economic activity and activities used for tax avoidance, things like income from active business, tangible assets and so on should, in my opinion, be incorporated. Also some rules should be extended. Hybrid mismatches should be applicable not only within the Union, but also outside the Union, and I also believe that a nominal limit in the interest limitation rule can be increased without harming the fight against tax evasion. Let me conclude by saying that I believe we will approve it very soon and it will significantly contribute to improvement in this area and the opinion of Parliament will be taken into account.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Emmanuel Maurel", "mepid": "24505", "text": "  On behalf of the Group of S and D. - Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Bayet, rapporteur of this important text, when things move forward, we must acknowledge that they are moving forward. And, unquestionably, in the area of taxation, in recent months we still have this feeling that the European Union is moving forward.  It is making small steps, it is moving forward under duress, because it is obviously in the wake of scandals, revelations, and thanks to tremendous pressure from public opinion, European citizens, but also to an undeniable determination of MEPs that we now have to discuss a quality text that makes a number of proposals going in the right direction.  It is an ambitious text and it gives - especially at this very moment when people doubt the merits of European integration, where citizens are asking questions, where they are constantly expressing their circumspection, their disappointment, sometimes even their anger - the opportunity to prove with texts of this nature that Europe knows how to be ambitious , that Europe knows how to move forward, and that the European Parliament can find itself, right and left, on important texts. I congratulate the Committee on Economic Affairs and, of course, rapporteur Bayet for presenting a text in one block which, nevertheless, lays the foundations for important and progressive legislation.  First, this reform contains major progress in our tax regulations. It allows us to more accurately track the flow of profits coming in or out of the Eu- - both ways - and to ensure that they are taxed fairly. With regard to the incomes of companies returning to Europe, the so-called 'switch-over' clause, which ensures that inflows into the Union have been taxed at a rate that is not unfair, has been intelligently supplemented by our rapporteur Bayet in order to apply a common criterion throughout the European Union. That has been said, it is very important. Secondly, for flows coming out of Europe, the tax measure on the exit of profits that leave the Union completes the scheme. It has long been forgotten, by focusing on double taxation, that there is also a massive double non-taxation, and the Bayet report responds to it. Finally, and this seems very clear to me - the rapporteur and the Commissioner have insisted on this point - this text has been enriched by definitions that are at once simple, clear and understandable; this is particularly the case for \"stable establishment\". Why is this important? The rapporteur alluded to that at the time. We have a scandal in France with Booking.com, it is 300 million euros that are exempt from tax - I finish, Madam President - and for that reason, the text goes in the right direction. Of course, this is only the beginning, of course, the Council is not convinced, but we are on the right track.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Sander Loones", "mepid": "128717", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – About a year ago, we also sat here together in the European Parliament to talk about private investment: how can we attract more private investment in the European Union with the EfSI Juncker Plan? I looked it up, Mr Bayet, rapporteur of the report we are discussing today and a member of the Parti Socialiste, also spoke in the debate. And I can agree 100% of what he said at the time, which is that in the current economic climate, and I quote 'it is important that we give priority to investments that accelerate the recovery, that increase productivity and that promote reality'. 100% agreement: we must give priority to these additional investments in the European Union. Unfortunately, with this report today, we are doing the opposite, we are sending the opposite signal, also under the direction of the rapporteur, Mr Bayet. Each country decides how much tax it levies on corporations, so that's not really the problem. On the contrary, we can all recognise that taxes, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, are too high and have to go down today. So that's not really the problem. But there is a problem when tax structures are put in place specifically to artificially shift profits to countries where taxes are lower for the sole purpose of avoiding those taxes and the tax authorities.  We note that multinationals in particular use this, and that small and medium-sized enterprises cannot do so, that they do have to pay the full pound, and that is not true. That's just not right, it clashes with all people's feelings. Taxes must be paid where the profits are created. That is why we must adapt our European legislation to ensure that taxes are paid where economic activity takes place.  But instead of tackling these fraudulent constructions, I see that the focus in the report is being put elsewhere, namely on raising taxes. At the same time, I note that the finance ministers discussing this report are moving in the right direction and will make correct adjustments to the Commission's proposal. In any case, I hope that they will ignore most of this resolution and that they will value genuine entrepreneurs, and certainly the jobs they create.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Enrique Calvet Chambon", "mepid": "129407", "text": "  au nom du groupe ALDE. – Madame la Présidente, Monsieur le Commissaire Moscovici, je vais continuer dans la langue de Cervantes. Look, this is a key, economic and political issue, at the moment we are living on, and of the greatest importance to the system on which we all base European construction, which is that of liberal democracy, because civil society — and we are the highest representatives of civil society — no longer endures the lack of ethics in certain businesses. Parliament, therefore, Commissioner, sends you and the Council a very strong message, a very strong support for everything that is done to rationalize and to make more ethical the functioning of the economy in this area where, it is true, the Commission has been sensitive to popular outrage lately. That is why what I want to tell you is that beyond the technical terms which Mr Bayet has very well set out here, and on which we have fortunately reached an agreement a large majority of the House, beyond that we must make a good understanding of what this is all about. Because sometimes it is said that this goes against companies, that this is an anti-enterprise attitude. We're not going to go against companies at all. Those old demagogueries happened. But it is a question of companies, per maybe focusing more and more investment – as has been said here – linked to production, linked to their actual activity, than to paying for large law firms. And not just to combat evasion and fraud; even circumvention. That's what we want to stop. And, while we make these big companies more focused on producing, we're fairer to all medium- or small businesses that have no option to find investment in law firms to escape tax networks. That's what it's all about, protecting greater competitiveness and efficiency of our companies while, if we can raise a little more, the tax burden will be fairer and have a better response to the potentiality of agents and taxes. That's what it's all about, and it has nothing to do with attacking companies. It has to do with making a Europe fairer, more ethical, but also more efficient, and in that we ask you to be strong, Commissioner.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Fabio De Masi", "mepid": "124858", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to sanendour sto -- on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Madam President, Mr Moscovici, I would like to thank mr Moscovici for his work and for his work A US president once said that politics must serve those who work hard and follow the rules. But it is not only since Panama Leaks and Lux Leaks that we know that every cleaner in the European Parliament and every medium-sized company pays more tax on their income than Google or Apple. No social cuts, no failure to invest in the EU would be necessary with clear rules against the tax thieves of McDonalds and Co. Corporations in the EU should finally pay their taxes where they make profits – whether they artificially shift profits through subsidiaries or letterbox companies. The European Commission has now presented the regulation against tax avoidance. In the Council, the usual suspects are blocking tax justice. In Parliament, unfortunately, the usual suspects have watered down an originally very good draft by the rapporteur. Unfortunately, the rules in the EP report against fictitious interest rates are weaker than the Commission's absolute interest rate barrier and weaker in percentage interest rates than in the United States. Profits that have not been sufficiently taxed in tax havens should remain untaxed if they are active business. The law firms are already looking forward to lazy deals with Luxembourg. Withholding taxes on financial flows in tax havens also remain non-binding. Unfortunately, profits can continue to leave the EU untaxed. Withholding taxes would be a much more effective method than blacklists, which are a diplomatic disaster. I am curious to see whether the EU Commission will blacklist the United States with Delaware, for example. Unfortunately, we are missing a phase out of patent boxes, although here too the position of the OECD and also of the US Treasury is clear: patent boxes reduce taxes, but do not contribute to research and development. There should be no barrier to royalties in the same way as the interest rate barrier. Despite some positive aspects, such as the definition of tax havens and the extension of the rules against hybrid arrangements to third countries, we are therefore disappointed by the report.

Madam President, Commissioner Moscovici, rapporteur Bayet, after several weeks of discussions, sometimes difficult but always cordial, I believe that the European Parliament is ready to send a clear signal to the Member States which have not yet managed to agree on the directive to combat corporate tax evasion. This message is simple: it is possible to go further than the original proposal of the European Commission. Any setback would therefore be a deliberate choice of our European leaders to maintain I do not know what national advantages in this great competition for the less tax.  Unfortunately, the latest discussions between finance ministers suggest a cheap deal. Indeed, one of the six provisions of the text, the switch-over clause, which ensures that money entering Europe is properly taxed, risks being withdrawn from the final agreement. In addition, it is important to limit the deduction of interest by large companies to prevent them from artificially indebted some of their subsidiaries and thus pay no tax in those countries. Unfortunately, this limitation would not apply to existing loans and interest, which nevertheless play a key role in all the tax scandals identified so far. And the list of setbacks is still long... On this point, however, Parliament speaks with a clear voice. The European Commission's position should be a minimum. We need to go further and be more ambitious.  That is why the Greens have defended the addition of an update on pro-patent tax regimes. I want to emphasize this issue as this issue is essential in the fight against tax optimisation. This tool is a purely European invention, launched in 2006 by the Netherlands and which has spread to more than a dozen countries in Europe. Supposed to promote research and development, these tools actually offer an opportunity for large companies to reduce their tax rates without developing innovation and research, as the Commission itself points out. This problem must therefore be resolved without delay. The Commission is expected to present a legislative proposal in the coming months in co-decision, to allow Parliament to have a say. Mr Moscovici, you have an important role to play, first of all by making our recommendations to the finance ministers in order, at least, to limit the damage. Second, it is time for you to stop waiting to speed up other key issues such as the creation of a blacklist of tax havens, the introduction of sanctions against territories, intermediaries or companies engaged in or inciting tax evasion, as well as the publication of country-by-country information, extended to all countries.

Madam President, because there is often talk here of a great deal of unfair competition within the European Union, I think we must be clear. I come from a small country, which is a financial centre, Cyprus. Its comparative advantage is that it has low corporate tax rates; we are at 12%. That's what healthy competition requires. As in the various consumption taxes there are different taxes, different VAT, I believe it is fair and healthy competition to make a difference in terms of tax rates. It is one thing to have a different tax rate and another to avoid tax avoidance and tax evasion, for which we are clearly in favour of falling for it. It is not the countries of the European Union and it is the tax havens that we have to fight.

It is no secret that the large multinationals do not pay taxes, while the small ones are very crushed. In a European Union that works, in a world that works, a compromise really should be found to make everyone pay a very low level of tax, so that it is possible, precisely, to generate an economy and not to create distortions of competition and not to create unpleasant situations, such as those of the scandals that in Italy are called 'pulcinella's secrets'. Because everyone knew that Luxembourg was a tax haven. Everyone knew about the existence of Panama and everyone knows that everyone in these tax havens is there: there are great managers, there are politicians and there are all those who then go to manage politics from above and go and regulate the world a little as it works. People are a little angry and from now on we are trying in Europe to take forward proposals like the one we saw with the rapporteur, Mr Bayet. We as a group have worked very well, trying to work with the very groups that really wanted to take a step forward, and we initially found good participation from groups such as the GUE and the Greens to put forward a proposal to make companies pay real taxes. In addition, we have called for lower deductions for large multinationals, especially on elusive transfer pricing practices. The problem is that a compromise has also been found here, because in this Parliament, as in the Council, there are representatives of countries that use these practices to take advantage of the other members of the European Union. So we must examine our consciences because this is an issue on which no compromises must be found. People are archstufa of this system and further action needs to be taken, especially on the banks, where we have not yet made a single proposal.

Multinationals that have built their business model on tax evasion or circumvention need to understand that the game is over. The six points proposed to regulate the directive that is the subject of Mr Bayet's report would be a step forward, indeed.  The question is whether the European Union is politically legitimate to fight this fight.  In principle, you know our reluctance to deal with the political inefficiency of the European Union. However, we have to be pragmatic. States have used tax competition to the point of dumping. Their governments have been unable to cooperate and have resulted in the loss of tax revenues conducive to all scandals, such as LuxLeaks and Panama Papers.  France is a country that fails to make itself fiscally attractive because of the spending madness of the socialist and UMP governments. I also wonder about the real sincerity of the EPP and S-D legislators, who pretend to support projects that only come about under the pressure of scandals. France probably has more to gain from the implementation of the control tools proposed by the directive.

It is the folk sacrifices without end that finance the profits. What the capital earns is what the employee loses. With development laws like the one now being passed in Greece, you are funding new subsidies and tax exemptions to business groups from the tax evasion of the people, who are in danger of losing even their home to ever-increasing taxes that they cannot pay.

In this context, the fight against tax avoidance, particularly by large multinationals, must be an absolute priority of the European institutions.

And not only that: the tax avoidance on the part of multinationals leaves small and medium-sized enterprises, which are undoubtedly the engine of growth and job creation, in a much more unfavourable situation. In this regard, active work is being made within the European Union to promote measures necessary to reduce the so-called fiscal gap, and we must continue in that direction. I have no doubt.

Let's do it, ladies and gentlemen.

Although I may not hide the fact that we in the Socialist Group would like us all to be even more courageous here, we can see the constraints on which the Commission is moving. We are shocked to note that it is the elected governments of the Member States that often block developments here, withholding developments where we want to go much further. The most frightening question is: why does someone have to pay taxes somewhere and why not? We note that many multinationals have their profits precisely in countries where there is little tax. What do we expect? We expect them to prove to the tax authority that they actually developed the economic activity that led to that profit in this place. Pure sham constructions, legal structures, letterbox companies within the EU – there is no need for Panama, we remain within the EU – are unacceptable. If we agree on this – and I am sure that we will agree very quickly with 500 million Europeans – then we must shift the burden of proof to companies. In the future, like every single taxpayer, they will also have to prove in their tax return that it is right to claim a scheme that leads to lower taxes.  I am surprised that the governments of the Member States are in the most heated discussion here, and I am surprised that we ourselves in this House may still be discussing this, when all of us here know exactly how the tax authority, when it wants to deduct something from its income tax return, asks for evidence and provides evidence. Why should this apply to everyone, including any small and medium-sized enterprise, but not to multinationals? This is not to be understood by anyone. I am sure that if we move forward at this point, we will have managed to deal with one of the major problems much better than we have in the past.

A very important instrument of this tax avoidance is intra-company credit agreements between parts of companies in different jurisdictions. Interest payments are more or less faked for these in-house credit agreements to push profits back and forth, and then, of course, they end up where the tax rates are lowest. This is a shift in profits, these are tax loopholes, and something needs to be done about it. But the Commission, in its otherwise good proposal, is overdoing the OECD proposal and saying that we are now, in principle, limiting the deductibility of interest to 30%. I do think that this OECD proposal is inappropriate, because it naturally affects all companies, including those that finance honest investment projects and borrow from third parties – that is, financial intermediaries, banks and other financial institutions. Interest is the cost of investment projects, and if we limit the deductibility of interest, then that means nothing more than double taxation, because the non-deductible interest is taxed on the one hand as a profit for the company that carried out the investments, and on the other hand as income from the lender. It is all the more wrong that the European Parliament is now trying to limit this deductibility even more than the Commission has already proposed – to 20%.

I note that the Council, which prides itself on being the only one with jurisdiction in this matter, treats this Parliament over the leg, as if we did not exist! We know the Dutch Presidency - the Netherlands is the champions of tax cover-up, as we know - but here they are hiding and not even below the seat. One wonders what they have to hide.  What they have to hide is an avalanche of amendments - from the Member States - to the Commission's proposal. Amendments whose sole purpose is to significantly weaken the scope of the texts tabled. One would have hoped that after LuxLeaks, SwissLeaks, Offshore Leaks and the Panama Papers, the finance ministers would have amended themselves. Not at all! Of course, could we expect those who, for decades, have launched this tax war that Member States are engaged in at the expense of small taxpayers who suddenly change their minds?  I would like to take two examples: the Netherlands, during their Presidency, has refrained from making any progress on this concept of effective minimum taxation of companies.

This is clearly intended as a move towards a harmonised corporate tax rate. In a free market context, competition is always a good thing, and tax competition between jurisdictions is always, and everywhere, a good thing. Any attempt by governments to harmonise taxes is a conspiracy by those governments against the interests of taxpayers. The effect of such tax harmonisation is always to increase taxes, to reduce competitiveness – in this case of European economies – and, ultimately, it is the individual consumer who pays more because these costs are simply passed on. Countries with high-tax economies, like socialist France, cannot compete with countries which have lower corporate tax rates, such as Ireland. The EU’s solution is to destroy globally competitive business environments because it envies them. If countries like Britain want to have a globally competitive environment in which to create business, jobs and wealth, then we must leave an EU which is intent on harmonising taxes. Not only that, but in the EU the state is to be given more weapons with which to intimidate ordinary taxpayers. General rules against tax avoidance, as proposed today by the Commission, will be difficult to interpret and will consequently give the state a large stick with which to threaten the ordinary taxpayer. These rules will not be used against large corporates, as is claimed, they will be used by the state against those who cannot afford expensive lawyers. It would be better to simplify the tax system so that the taxpayer could be certain of his or her tax liability, rather than add a layer of complexity with anti—avoidance rules which will scare ordinary people away from making sensible investments for the future and into paying more tax than they need to do today.  We are also being asked to endorse the Committee’s proposal for an EU tax identification number. Clearly, the EU is too scared of British public opinion to tell us before our EU referendum, but we can put the pieces of the jigsaw together. The EU wants to tax us directly if we are daft enough to remain. The report recommends an EU-wide withholding tax and an EU exit tax, added to which are proposals in committee for a global register of assets held by individuals. Put these things together and you have the necessary building blocks for a wealth tax on citizens. The prospect of a financial transaction tax is also being discussed in working documents aimed at creating a eurozone budget. Not content with just its own budget, the eurozone wants to use the EU’s general budget as a means to keep the euro on life support. We know this actually from David Cameron’s so—called renegotiation, which attempts to protect the British economy from these costs but will fail to do so.  May I end on a positive note? We in Britain are about to vote – if the polls are to be believed – to leave the European Union so we shall not be troubled by these problems.

It is also interesting to see that two groups in this House are agreeing on how they will vote today on the report on combating tax avoidance practices by means of a blue card. So it is a very interesting discussion, and I would say that this shows how important the issue of combating tax avoidance is here in this House and at European level. It is an important issue, and I believe there is broad agreement that the three most important points on this issue are the following, and there is agreement on this: effective taxation at the place of value creation, that is, profits should be taxed where they are actually generated. More transparency: we have recently brought country-by-country reporting to the stage in this House, we have voted on the automatic exchange of information – transparency is important. Thirdly, as has already been mentioned today: a level playing field for all companies. Small and medium-sized enterprises cannot generally pay a third more corporation tax than large companies. This is unfair, it is not fair competition, and it is also damaging to Europe in the end. Fair competition also means fair competition at the global level. In this case, the OECD has set out a very important measure in this case with the BEPS Action Plan, namely this 15-point action plan. More than 100 Member States and countries outside the OECD have committed to comply with this Action Plan and to carry out an automatic exchange of information on financial accounts from 2018. Even Panama has done so because of international pressure under the spell of the affair. This report, which we are to vote on today, is moving away from these provisions of the OECD-BEPS Action Plan on a number of very important points, which I personally consider to be a mistake. The Commission's draft has adhered very strongly to this draft, but the rapporteur is going away: for example, with regard to the interest rate barrier, which has already been mentioned today, 20 instead of 30 per cent on EBITDA, which is a mistake, or when switching from exemption to imputation method.

As a result of this tactic, States have significant economic losses and amounts that could be allocated to other development-related activities are lost. At the same time, the respective small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the economic backbone of each country, are also affected. There should therefore be a uniform and fair system of taxation applied by all the countries of Europe. Under this system it should be to tax the profits of multinational companies in the country where these profits are obtained, so that they cannot channel them to other countries that are tax havens. Moreover, if they try to send this money to other countries, it should be taxed in the way that it would be taxed if it were acquired in the country in which it was acquired.

It is true that owners of shell companies benefit, often exploiting weak rules in offshore tax havens, but gaps also exist in our tax rules and can be exploited. Tax systems in Europe are in need of reform in order to fully close those loopholes allowing tax evasion and avoidance, eliminate special rules, and limit deductions, exemptions and credits.

I have to say it is hard to think of a more compelling case where collective action works than fighting tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. Tax dodging, just like pollution, climate change and international crime, does not respect borders. In fact it thrives in the mismatches that happen when countries do not speak to one another, when they do not cooperate and so helpful little loopholes emerge. We have to take a collaborative approach to tackling this problem if we are ever to succeed, and I am delighted that this is what is happening at EU level.

I welcome this ambition. It should set the templates for how we in the EU tackle tax dodging, leading the way internationally, and setting the example for other jurisdictions to follow.

At the same time, we have to keep going, and that's not enough. I would like to highlight two areas that may not have been discussed in this debate so far: the nature of the tax system itself, the nature of the European tax systems. Of course, the Member States have the right to set tax rates, different tax methods, but we need to know that as long as europe has such fragmented tax systems, companies in this European Union will use the resulting tax optimisation options, so that tax unification is inevitable in order to reduce tax avoidance. Secondly, it is not just about variable tax rates in general. There is a specific set of legislation tailored to individual companies. To give you an example, last year in my country, Hungary, an American company called General Electric used a tax-setting option in which, after revenue of some HUF 4000 billion, or about EUR 15 billion, it paid tax not in the country where it was doing business, but as a result of sales contracts between various tricky subsidiaries, broughtd tax payments to Hungary and benefited from tax advantages there. , which could result in a reduction in the corporate tax rate actually paid to 2%.

In many cases this kind of bilateral convention has really become a convention on avoiding any taxation. In my country, for instance, an investor sold shares in a big bank and my country could not tax a single euro of capital gain. Why?

After all, companies should pay their taxes where they have made the profits. We cannot repeat this often enough. In his report, Hugues Bayet has worked in this direction – step by step, but the direction is clear. We need a fundamental change in the system. Tax avoidance and tax evasion and all these forms of aggressive tax planning are a democratic problem, but they also lead to huge distortions of competition, because SMEs, micro-enterprises, which pay their taxes nicely, the employees anyway, and the big companies choose it. It is therefore high time that we also did something about European things. What is new and a plus is that, as is so often the case with artificial loans within a group of companies – for example, at Ikea – the profit is reduced by deductible interest. It is also important to demand transparency in trusts and foundations. Commissioner, will there be anything coming from you?  The authorities' means of control are also important. We see it everywhere in Europe: austerity is also reducing the financial authorities, especially those who are supposed to control, especially in the southern countries.

With Parliament's recommendation, we could even take a more ambitious form, as these rules now make it legally binding for Member States to effectively manage corporate tax evasion while ensuring free competition.  One of the most important elements in the fight against tax avoidance would be the introduction of a common consolidated corporate tax base, which could make a radical difference in the fight against artificial base erosion and profit-transfer strategies. The Commission has already promised to submit a proposal for a common consolidated company fund. It is important that this is published as soon as possible and that the negotiations on this are concluded as soon as possible.  But this is where I'd like to go back to aggressive tax planning. Dear Mr President, This is not just a crime of multinationals. These conditions are indeed established by the Member States of the European Union. National governments are creating the rules that are now the result of large international companies paying taxes below 5%, and everyone else paying around 30%. It's shameful, it's untenable.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 61, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Zbigniew Kuźmiuk (ECR).", "mepid": "28389", "text": "   – Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent work. The losses in budget revenue caused by aggressive tax planning of multinational companies – as has been said many times – account for between 4% and 10% of corporate tax revenues. In this situation, the Commission's desire to ensure that companies pay taxes where they make a profit deserves support. However, the report's proposals to call on the Commission to introduce a common consolidated corporate tax base or to set a minimum corporate tax rate of 15% should be considered too far-reaching, as it is nevertheless for the Member States to shape income tax rules. For example, in my country, Poland, in order to limit the removal of untaxed profits abroad, a clause was introduced, inter alia, prohibiting the circumvention of tax law, which means that financial operations unrelated to the real economic activity of the taxpayer will be illegal.

Mr President, I believe that we are all against tax evasion, against tax avoidance; But listening to the debates, I believe that, in our exaggerated attempt to combat tax avoidance and tax evasion, we may in the end strike the European Union itself in the back and, instead of creating blacklists and companies avoiding tax havens, in the end they will avoid the European Union itself. In the end, we're going to hurt our own businesses. In the end we will hurt the consumers themselves, the citizens themselves, the Gross National Product of our countries. We have to be very careful.  I'm hearing about tax flattening and uniform tax rates. These were applied to centrist systems in the former communist countries. You cannot, in free economies of fair competition and healthy competition, especially on the issue of taxation, come and impose a single leveling tax rate. What are the companies going to do? They will all leave the European Union, they will go to other countries and we will actually come in this way to put the United States of America, the third countries that are outside the European Union and the tax havens themselves in a very favourable position. We will essentially be blacklisted in our efforts to tackle tax avoidance and tax evasion.  I think we need to be clear: not tax avoidance, not tax evasion, not tax havens, but yes to free healthy tax competition. And we must say this: the European Union has the strictest rules on tax transparency, as far as its control systems are concerned, which no other competitive countries have. We must not harm competition from the European Union's financial services. As we have some countries that are strong in industry, we have some other countries are strong financial centers.

Europe needs a common consolidated tax base that nation states can use for the necessary collection of the taxes to be collected. Today, large international companies choose for themselves how much they want to pay in taxes. They call it tax optimization, and unfortunately there are some countries that are more than willing to help these companies. So we need the tax to be paid where the profits are generated. And the losers in this tax cheating game, as I would call it, are small and medium-sized enterprises. After all, small and medium-sized enterprises do not have the opportunity to avoid paying their taxes when they have made money. And that is why this is damaging the internal market. The big ones decide how much they will pay in tax, the little ones have to pay at box 1. And we should not forget that it is small and medium-sized enterprises that generate 80% of all the jobs created in the European Union. That is why we must have a level playing field for these companies. Then it is also important for the credibility of the European Union towards its citizens that real action is taken in relation to the tax evasion that we are seeing in these years.

Thus, fictitious transfers of the tax base on which taxes are calculated must be disadvantaged. That is the point of the debate. Let us not forget that the main problem is the transfer of the taxable amount, not so much the size of the tax rate, because sometimes, in the parliamentary debate, one has the impression that the concept of courage is confused with the idea that taxes must be increased. Let us not forget that the main reason why large and small businesses sometimes evade or evade taxes is that taxes are too high. Therefore, trying to solve the problem by increasing it further means going against precisely those small and medium-sized enterprises that are often filled with the debate.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the richness and quality of the proposals put forward this morning. Of course, I cannot respond to each and every one of you, given the number of speakers. I will therefore limit myself to resuming three points, which have been raised repeatedly this morning: the issue of tax evasion in relation to competitiveness, the pro-patent tax regimes and, finally, the general balance of the text, as it emerges before the discussion in the Council next week. I would like to make two small political remarks in an introductory way: one towards Mr Monot, who wondered if we were legitimate to act on this matter. No, we are not only legitimate, we are necessary, and it is typically in this kind of subject that we see what Europe is for, and the anti-Europeans are wrong about the target, because none of our Member States could separately fight tax evasion effectively. We are dealing with phenomena that are international, global, and the answer is, at least, European. And that is why we must have a voluntary Europe, an exemplary Europe; it proves the inanity of nationalism, of withdrawal, of excesses of all kinds or kinds.  I would also like to have a word for Mr Lamberts and the Greens, because I am pleased that this time we are no longer being criticised for not doing what we are doing, and I find it quite positive that there is a move towards taking into account a number of proposals which are of high quality. Moving forward together is all I want, as long as the analyses are of quality and the aims shared. But I go back to my three points. First, the issue of competitiveness and sovereignty and, in particular, the underlying issue of ACCIS (or CCCTB).  Our proposal, I should say, in general, our tax proposals are, I am convinced, balanced. The political will to fight against tax optimisation is not a fight against the company; this is not the case with this directive on or against tax evasion, nor is it the case with the public communication project - and I say publicly - country-by-country information, and I am proud to fight for it from the beginning, I say this in particular to Mrs Joly, who may not have yet understood it or found it. , but since I have been Commissioner, since the first day of my mandate, it has been a cause that I have been defending. I see in different media a particular voice that seems to claim that there is a contradiction between competitiveness and transparency. I am convinced that transparency is a weapon for competitiveness. We are not in an ideological battle for or against the company. Our fight is a fight for fiscal justice, which is also something that deeply serves the interest of the company. How? By ensuring a level playing field, especially for the benefit of our SMEs, which, as everyone knows, are the engine of growth and employment in the European Union. I would add, moreover, that we are committed to measures such as the common and consolidated corporate tax base, but also the resolution of tax disputes, which are important elements in the fight against double taxation.  Finally, I would add that both what we are doing in the fight against tax evasion and the project that I am pursuing - and I will go all the way - to resume in a smarter and perhaps more consensual way ACCIS is not a harmonization of tax rates. This is a debate we had in the Council, for example at the last Ecofin Council with Minister Noonan. What we want is not a minimum tax, it is not forced harmonisation - we respect fiscal sovereignty - but effective taxation. The time when a particular multinational company could, because it had a well-located head office or strategically placed subsidiaries, no longer pay taxes or pay substantial taxes where it creates wealth, that time is a time that must end. Our proposals do not call into question, I stress, the sovereignty of states over the setting of the level of taxation: we do not denied tax competition, but we want it to be harmonious, regulated and effective taxation rules. The proposal you are debating today - I am saying this because, again, I do not want there to be lies, falsehoods, misinterpretations - that there is no mechanism for withholding tax or tax identification. The Commission is still accused of being a super state - or rather Europe to be a super state and the Commission to be a super-government - that is not correct, do not we make a bad trial by accusing us of attacking sovereignty: I think on the contrary that by giving us collective rules, we are strengthening our common sovereignty. On patent-friendly tax regimes, it will be quicker, I repeat what I said in the introduction, we leave it to the Member States to implement their own commitments, that is to say to make their regime coincide with economic reality. At the end of this year, if this process is not satisfactory, we will consider binding measures; the Commission remains, I assure you, very vigilant on this point. This approach, moreover, allows us to remain in full coherence with that of the OECD, as several parliamentarians have called for. Finally, I want to say a word about what awaits us next week in the discussions in the Council after the exchange of views we had this morning. Our proposal, I am sure, not because I am putting it as Commissioner, but because we have worked it, because it is also in the direction of history, it is expected by the public, was good. It is true that you have improved it, and some of these improvements are in the compromise text currently on the Council table. Parliament, as always, will have done a useful job.  Like you, I regret that some provisions have been weakened in the negotiations, such as the transition rules on interest deductibility. I also regret that some are questioned in their entirety, such as the switch-over clause, which I still believe is useful and even necessary. But the text retains strong provisions, such as the rules on controlled foreign companies, strengthened to cover stable establishments, for that matter, which will apply within the European Union and in relations with third countries. This is a great step forward, as the general anti-abuse clause is a great step forward. We live in an institutional system that we know: the Commission proposes; Parliament is a legislator, it also represents the people of Europe; Member States decide, and they must be put under pressure, under pressure to decide the best. As I said in my introduction, I think we have to act and decide now. Your vote should help to keep up the pressure for an ambitious agreement in the Council on 17 June. It is to be credited to your rapporteur, Mr Bayet, it is also to be credited to the debates of this House. I really hope that the message that you are delivering, which I consider to be a converging message, will be consistent with what the Commission is proposing, to be heard next week by the Member States meeting in the Council. For the future proposals that the Commission will make in the coming months, I also think that the spirit that drives us is a useful spirit, a spirit that must endure. As you have understood, as I have come before you every time I come before you, I am struck by the fact that the Commission and Parliament, with, of course, differences on this or that point, with differences in sensitivity on the different benches of this House, have the same purpose, the same ambition, the same will in the fight against tax evasion and that yes, we are also here to make strong proposals, to make courageous proposals that put Member States before their responsibilities.

Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I thank you all for your speeches, and I thank in particular my fellow shadow rapporteurs, because, in this very political and relatively technical matter, I wanted to underline the quality of their listening and the respect they have shown during all the exchanges. Commissioner, as you have understood, I think that, although the methodology or methods differ somewhat from one political group to another, Parliament's unanimous will is to put an end to this system which allows multinationals not to pay taxes where they do business, to pay almost no tax, because - contrary to what I heard earlier - the average tax in Europe , the levy on corporate income or profits is 2.4%. In the United States, it is 19%. And these are not political figures. If someone doesn't believe me here, they can check the Parliament website. These figures are taken from studies by the OECD and the Commission. That's the reality. Therefore, we do not tax more in Europe than elsewhere, I would even say that it is the opposite.  Of course, this opinion sets out in a single text a whole set of principles that we believe are essential to ending this system. As you have said, in particular, my colleagues Niedermayer or Calvet-Chambon, we are not going to kill the economy, because we obviously differentiate between the real economy and the cheaters - the cheats who hide their profits, the cheats who use mailboxes in Panama, for example. We are not going to over-regulate either, we are just defining a whole series of holes in the legislation, those holes that are used by multinationals to avoid paying taxes. There has also been talk - as you said, Commissioner - of pro-patent tax regimes and tax havens, and my colleagues Joly, De Masi and Valli have told you so; but, Commissioner, this is no longer an administrative or institutional piping problem. What we want are solutions. We cannot continue with a patent regime that currently allows a whole series of multinationals to charge exorbitant amounts for years, mere logos simply to avoid paying taxes. Therefore, 'through the door or through the window', the Commission will have to help us make a difference.

The Union's political priorities relating to international taxation should focus mainly on regulating the payment of taxes where profits are generated, i.e. at the place of residence or at the place where the commercial activity is carried out. This approach will help to protect national tax systems more effectively. All the more importantly, according to OECD research and data, unfair and aggressive tax planning for multinationals contributes to the loss of between USD 100 and 240 billion from public budgets annually. Such actions directly lead to the loss of public income, reduce their employment and lead to problems in pension systems. For this reason, the emphasis on combating tax fraud in the report is the right move to condemn the threat to the cohesion of the internal market. In addition, when it comes to legal developments in this area, we should follow the rules on social integrity. It is therefore necessary to oppose the transfer of profits to tax havens and non-payment of profits in the country of origin, in particular multinationals having to pay taxes in good faith.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. I very much regret that the Presidency of the Council is not here, because I wanted to praise it explicitly for the fact that we have managed to make a necessary postponement in a very short time. Now that the Commissioner has the headphones, I can begin my criticism of the Commission. When, in April 2014– and I would remind you of this – we adopted MiFID and MiFIR here in this House in April 2014, we actually felt that we had adopted a cornerstone of European financial market regulation, where we were also able to proudly stand before the electorate at the last European election. It is more than regrettable that we are now debating an extension – more than two years later – and that we are going to decide this lunchtime to postpone the whole thing for another year, because the competent supervisory authority in particular has not been able to obtain the necessary technical infrastructure in good time, and because the Commission, too, has by no means kept to the timetable in the preparation of the delegated acts. , which we agreed in 2014. I would like to say this before: if we had a task to deal with in the last parliamentary term, it was to make the financial markets stable, to ensure consumer protection, to ensure that non-regulated areas such as high-frequency trading are regulated, to ensure that where people were driven speculatively in distress, on commodity futures markets, it was necessary to ensure that non-regulated areas such as high-frequency trading were regulated. , regulations that make this impossible – to name the challenges. It is more than regrettable that the whole thing can only enter into force on 3 January 2018. On the other hand– and I would also like to mention this – since I expressly believe that the Council and Parliament – in a very short period of time – in less time than the Commission took to draw up its proposal for postponement – we have also managed to identify the points that the Commission had overlooked. It hadnot moved a few dates, although they were part of it. And we have done something that has not been seen in Europe before, because we have been able to correct all the problems that we have identified in the context of implementation. I will also say that. It is not the case that the European legislator can have taken into account all the problems in detail in every directive, every regulation it enissues. The fact that we sometimes stand by and say ' we still have to make adjustments in a few places' has succeeded because, on the parliamentary side – and I would like to thank all the staff who have worked together here as shadow rapporteurs in the political groups – we have really succeeded in concentrating on the key points that deserve to be readjusted. So we have not marched into legislation with a belly-load of questions. And the Council – the Dutch Presidency of the Council – has shown the necessary flexibility to have us able to agree on this in a very short time. I think that's certainly on the credit side. We have therefore tried to adjust the problems that were to be faced without having to be included in other legislation elsewhere. This should also be a model for future legislation. Sometimes you still have to readjust, and if you agree on it, you can do that very quickly. I would now ask the Commission to really ensure that we get the missing regulatory technical standards as soon as possible, so that the markets really know what is to come so that the systems can be implemented and adjusted. We want stable financial markets, we want financial markets that have earned the trust of investors and that ensure that excesses are a thing of the past. That is our common mission, and we should work together to do so.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 89, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Jonathan Hill", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I am very pleased to have this opportunity to discuss these amendments to MiFID II, and I recognise there has been a huge amount of hard work done in the European Parliament and in the Council to get these agreed before July. I am particularly grateful to Mr Ferber and to the shadow rapporteurs on this file for having kept up the momentum and having dealt with it so effectively.  I very much agreed with what Mr Ferber said, that this package is a key part of our financial reforms, increasing the transparency of markets and improving their oversight. It responded to the G20 agreement back in Pittsburgh to reform derivatives and commodity markets, to make those markets work better, to make them more resilient, to make them more stable – and also of course to strengthen investor protection, not only by ensuring that investors have the right information, but also by introducing stronger rules to avoid conflicts of interest.  So we are agreed on the goal, and if that is the goal, to achieve it we need this legislation to be implemented properly, in a way which gives legal certainty, and which does not disrupt markets that provide investment to the wider economy and help businesses manage their risks.  This reform was always going to be an ambitious reform. It calls for data from hundreds of trading venues, from some 15 million financial instruments. Given the scale of that challenge, the complexity of the IT systems that were needed, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) judged – rightly, in my view – that more time was needed to get it right, not to undermine the new framework but to make sure that it works properly when it kicks in.  So, at their request, it is true that we proposed to extend by a year, until January 2018, the deadline for MiFID II entering into application, and I am grateful to the European Parliament and to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) for its support in accepting what I see as being a common-sense proposal. Like Mr Ferber, I am also glad that we have avoided revisiting the key aspects of the package that was agreed just two years ago, but that we have got some technical amendments in this package which improve the quality of the rules. Further clarification of the scope of the transparency requirements on package transactions was an issue raised by ESMA when they submitted their regulatory technical standards (RTS), and here I think that Parliament’s amendment helps us get the balance right. It ensures that the pre-trade transparency regime continues to apply where it is needed, without imposing unnecessary burdens where it is not.  It was also right to exempt securities financing transactions (SFTs) from transparency obligations. SFTs are not price forming and they will of course be regulated by the Securities Financing Transactions Regulation in the future, and so increased transparency in this area would create new burdens but serve little purpose. With the amendment on own account exemption we are acting to make sure that non-financial companies do not fall unnecessarily within the scope of MiFID II and its administrative and capital requirements.  We are now working hard to get the majority of MiFID II’s large number of level 2 measures adopted in June, and I completely agree with Mr Ferber that we have to keep the pace up. In a handful of areas we have asked ESMA to look again at their proposals reflecting issues that have also been raised by the European Parliament. Taken together, I believe that these measures should make MiFID II more effective. Member States will have to transpose the elements of MiFID II they are responsible for by 3 July 2017. The industry would need to start complying from January 2018. I believe that this is a sensible way forward to ensure the smooth implementation of this legislation and to bring more transparency, better consumer protection and more efficiency to markets in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 90, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Othmar Karas", "mepid": "4246", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for the work she has said. We do not just want, we urgently need stable financial markets. This has been expressed because stable financial markets are a prerequisite for the public and our customers regaining confidence in the financial market. The prerequisite for stable financial markets is regulation, where necessary is more transparency and control. In the new regulation of MiFID and MiFIR, investor protection was the central concern of the European Parliament, and increased investor protection can only be enforced if the technical conditions are met. These technical requirements did not exist. The rapporteur pointed out that, on the one hand, there was a gap in supervision, and on the other hand, the Commission was in default in presenting delegated acts. That is why Parliament has de facto used the post-match period to erase the implementation problems. Mr Ferber has pointed this out, and it is a sincere thanks to him, for using this extra time with the Council. Although we have used this time, although the implementation problems have now been corrected and the legislation has been restructured, we need an extension to stay in the footballer's language. It has to be said that even in the extended period, the deadlines are tight and the detailed work is extensive. Whoever now lets the reins grind, will have a nasty awakening.

As Mr Ferber said, these pieces of legislation are incredibly ambitious in their scope. They aim to make markets more transparent, offer better protection to consumers, regulate new high-frequency trading techniques and stop speculation in vital commodities like food and fuel. All measures which, sadly, were not in place before the financial crisis and for which citizens across Europe paid the price. Partly because of the sense of scope and ambition, it has proved difficult for the European Securities and Markets Authority to set up all of the technical infrastructure needed for the legislation to go live on the original date of 3 January 2017. This is inevitably disappointing. Undoubtedly, it would have been better if Parliament had been made aware of this problem much sooner than we were, but at the same time, with a new regime of this scale, it is vital that we get things right. That is why I am prepared to support the proposal to postpone the application of the new regime by 12 months. However, I want to reiterate, this is not an invitation for the European Securities Markets Expert Group (ESME) or the European Commission or the financial services industry to breathe a sigh of relief and do nothing. We have been told that 12 months was the minimum delay needed. If that is the case then every single day we will need to count in order to ensure that all is ready for the new go—live date of 3 January 2018; to be absolutely clear, there will be no second delay.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Marcus Ferber, the rapporteur, and all the shadow rapporteurs for working so cooperatively together. In doing so we have been able to send a very clear message from this House about exactly what we expect from ESME and the Commission during these additional 12 months. First, we expect regular updates and progress reports. We want to know exactly how the delay is being used to make sure that on 3 January 2018 the new improved financial services regime of method 2 comes into full effect. Second, we expect our concerns about some of the secondary legislation to be taken on board. We have been very clear over the last two years, about what these concerns are. If they are not reflected in the final level 2 legislation, then we have the right and the responsibility to reject what we have been sent. For me the most important parts of the level 2 framework are dealing with commodity derivatives. It is unacceptable that speculators and financial markets can so manipulate the markets that they drive up the price of food for shoppers or damage the incomes of farmers. Method 2 very clearly states that this kind of speculation must stop and so places limits on the size of position that any one player can hold at a given time. It is in the secondary legislation that those limits will be defined. I have said time and time again that I want to see the limits as low and as strict as possible, especially for the most liquid markets. The original ESME proposals were not good enough and I am glad to see they were sent back by the Commission. But the Commission did not take on board all of Parliament’s concerns. We will be looking very closely to make sure that it has done so by the time the draft come back to us for adoption or rejection.

They also have enormous consequences not only for the financial markets themselves, but also for all users, all European consumers and all the companies affected by this. Because we are dealing here with the difficulty of finding the right balance. On the Commission's side, of course, there is the fine aim of the Capital Markets Union. We want more jobs, we want more economic growth. We all wholeheartedly support that. The financial sector must also make an important contribution to this, by making it easier to finance and to flow the money needed as a lubricant. We are, of course, also dealing with Commissioner Timmermans' better regulatory agenda on the Commission's side. That's very difficult in a complicated case like MiFID/MiFIR, which is incredibly technical. Especially when you consider that, on the other hand, we naturally stand up for European citizens, consumers who want to get good information when it comes to financial products or their investments, so that they can also make a good decision in this area.  How do you weigh those interests? We have seen that this is a struggle, that it has not been too easy and that it has been delayed as a result. We understand that. It is more important to get good, workable regulation than to get it quickly. We also felt the risks were too great to disrupt markets, so we fully support this delay. However, of course you have to use that delay – as Mr Dodds just indicated – to make these regulations really better and workable.  Also, there are still issues around - I'll just say - a definition of research. What is research? That is the crux of these regulations, it is not just a detail somewhere. So we will have to find good solutions to get as much clarity as possible. Unambiguousness to those parts of the regulations that are essential.

It should be relevant information, not information about transactions that may never take place, but relevant information for investment decisions.

My group gave its opposition to the technical postponement. However, the majority groups have now tabled amendments to partially improve MiFID under pressure from the financial lobby. With regard to the common positions, speculation, particularly on commodity derivatives, is still a number of points in line with the decisions of the last Parliament, despite a number of protests by Parliament to the securities and supervisory authority ESMA and the Commission. Thus, market fluctuations are not taken into account when determining the position limits and it is still possible for individual traders to control more than one third of the total market volume.

Mr President, this summer it will be nine years since the financial crisis began. Even today, the nominal volume of financial markets is ten times the size of the real economy on a daily basis. Ten times! In other words, for a dollar of trade, you speculate for ten dollars. Needless to say, these activities are unnecessary and, in reality, harmful to the real economy. In particular, Anneliese Dodds mentioned, there is speculation on a daily basis about raw materials and especially food raw materials.  It is incredible that a text adopted in February 2014 with a view to being implemented at the beginning of 2017, that is, three years later, is still not in a position to be implemented in six months and which the Commission is asking, eighteen months after the adoption of the text: \"Can we not postpone for another year?\" This shows the state of readiness and above all the hyper-complexity of the text - and, make no mistake, complexity is often the vehicle of laxity. Simple legislation is often much stricter than hyper-complex legislation. Because of this complexity, we are being asked for an additional one year. And if it were just that, you could say, \"Either they were pretty unfe professional, let's give them another year\", knowing that this year more would be a year more speculation, especially on food products.  But it's not just about that. As luck would have it, this text was an opportunity to convey a number of new exemptions that will further reduce the transparency of financial markets. In other words, by inducing these exceptions, we confirm the suspicion that these delays are being used to weaken a text which already did not have the necessary level of ambition.

As Mr Lamberts said, the financial market has even paradoxically increased since the great crisis that took place in 2008-2009, precisely because this type of practice has been encouraged. This is also what the Commission is doing, by relaunching the Capital Markets Union and the financial market a little, instead of prioritising banking separation and the real economy. It is a demonstration that this Europe, this Juncker Europe, is a Europe that very often represents the strong interests of banks and interests other than European citizens. With regard to this proposal to extend – as I have already said – this is not good for us. Among other things, we have also taken advantage of the inclusion of changes – as my colleague from the Greens have always said – and these changes go to exempt, on own-account transactions by banks and financial operators, the transparency that they should have on derivative financial instruments, such as SFT (Securities Financing Transactions) and EFP, which are instruments on which, however much they may cause costs to banks , banks must be transparent because they are systemic bodies and when they need banks, they obviously knock on the door of governments and taxpayers. So if we exempt – and Parliament and some groups are in favour, but we are not – from transparency the banks on certain transactions, those responsible will then, after history, pull them out.

That is a good thing, although I share the rapporteur's criticism in substance and it should not be a carte blanche, neither for the Commission nor for ESMA, to delay things here. The fact is, however, that neither the supervisory authorities nor the financial industry are ready for implementation in the coming year. The set of rules is too complex, and MiFID II should finally draw the right conclusions from the 2007-2009 financial crisis and take into account the rapid progress in securities trading. The aim of MiFID is to create more transparency and, in particular, to strengthen investor protection. This will require stronger and stricter reporting requirements for banks and trading houses. The raw materials industry is also affected, as has already been mentioned today. Commodity traders will in future be treated like financial institutions and their hedging operations will be backed up with equity capital. This is based on two size criteria: the share of speculative derivative segoing transactions in the volume of trade and a market share test. Commodity traders may only have certain thresholds for goods in certain categories of goods, and 3% or 20% for emission allowances for oil products. However, commodity traders are not banks, as the Commissioner has said: we want to readjust here, and we need to find a regulation here, because regulating the raw materials sector could lead to serious financing problems, especially if prices are rising.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 100, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Λάμπρος Φουντούλης (", "mepid": "125070", "text": "  NI). Mr President, I do not think anyone will disagree that, like so many sectors of the economy, the market for financial instruments needs specific regulations to make it safer for all those who choose to operate in it; However necessary some of these arrangements may be, however much any gaps have been foreseen, the truth is that the everyday life of the ordinary citizen will not be affected for the better. Unemployment is rising and poverty is knocking on the door every day for more families. Unfortunately, in the midst of the crisis that Europe has been going through for the last ten years, citizens are demanding drastic solutions to their daily problems. But reports such as those we are discussing today do not offer these solutions. We should therefore focus on tackling the many serious and chronic problems of European citizens beyond targeted interventions.  The aim of the report is to strengthen investor protection by establishing strong organisational and behavioural requirements – but issues of little importance to the vast majority of the public.

We have an institutional slowness in dealing with specific problems. We had the international financial crisis of 2008, which the European Union paid very dearly for and which we can say has changed through the social and political consequences that the composition of the European Parliament itself has had. So we risk intervening in 2018, with no guarantee that until then there will be no new financial crisis.  There is a good chance of a new financial crisis. We only have to look at what is happening in China, for example. We only have to look at the problems of the banking system in the European South. We only have to look at the difficulties that banks have with negative interest rates, the difficulties of insurance companies and even the difficulties that will arise in the United States and the United Kingdom, two powerful financial centres because of political developments.

Parliament has been cohesive in getting this process concluded quickly and effectively.

So far as the specifics are concerned, we are working to get the majority of these Level 2 measures adopted in June. We have already adopted 11 RTSs. We will get the bulk of the remaining RTSs done this month.  It is the case that we have asked in just a handful of areas for ESMA to look again at its proposals, and in many cases that reflects issues that have been raised with us by Parliament. So we are looking again at some of the transparency requirements for bond and derivative markets. You asked for a more cautious approach and, in our view, that is warranted. On the important issue of position limits, which a number of Members raised, where agricultural derivatives are concerned we want to make position limits more sensitive, both for highly liquid markets and for less liquid markets. I understand that there are some in Parliament who want to restrict excessive volatility and speculation in vital commodities via the position limit regime. ESMA, as you know, has come back with a revised proposal, taking on board our ideas to make the limit regime more tailored to the underlying commodity type. We welcome that and now the task is to assess the merits of its proposal, balancing how the revised regime addresses excessive price movements in commodities, whilst maintaining liquidity in the markets. Also, for non-financial companies we want to make sure that the scope of the rules is appropriate and that they do not apply to those using financial markets responsibly to hedge their risk or where their financial business is genuinely small, relative to their core business.  In terms of the question I was asked about the implementation of the Level 2 measures, yes, I am determined to do that as fast as possible.

So anyone who says that we have followed the industry here – if I may say so, is lying to this House and lying to the public. It is a question of ESMA's failure to create the technical infrastructure and to create the conditions for national supervisory authorities to fulfil their role. Secondly, the two reports on which we are about to vote are not about the issue of the position limits for commodity futures. This is a regulatory technical standard where we are still in discussions – Lord Hill has just taken it up – where we as a Parliament have clearly described our position and where we are now waiting to see whether the Commission meets these requirements. But that is not part of the current vote. Thirdly, we have not taken up any point on the points that we have taken up, because the industry has called for it, but because over the last two years we – the shadow rapporteurs and I – have met monthly with ESMA and the Commission and discussed time and again how individual problems can still be resolved. And the points where ESMA or the Commission told us 'this is not possible to solve this because the directive does not exist', we have taken up the points. And we have taken up one last point – and I will also say this: within the framework of the Prospectus Directive proposed by the Commission, a change is being made to MiFID, and we have now done so in MiFID, and then it does not have to be done in the Prospectus Directive. These are not requirements of industry, but better regulation, as we have agreed here. That is why I firmly reject the accusation that we are only creating new loopholes for industry here.

It requires the establishment of a global labelling and tracing system within five years of the entry into force of the Protocol. The aim is also to establish a global contact point for information sharing within the Secretariat of the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. It will lead the development of national and regional labelling and tracing systems. The Protocol also contains additional provisions to combat the supply chain of illicit tobacco products.

In view of the volume of this phenomenon, which affects the consumption of one in ten cigarettes in Europe, we can only welcome the Szejnfeld report. Cigarette smuggling is a double threat. Firstly, by making tobacco products cheaper and more accessible, illegal trade is a source of great concern for citizens' health. Cheap white cigarettes escape European health controls by illegally importing cheap white cigarettes from non-EU countries. Furthermore, this criminal activity causes a great deal of damage to the treasuries by taking around EUR 10 billion a year from the revenues. Economic loss, by taking money away from anti-smoking policies and melanome research, also causes harm to the well-being of citizens.

In addition to social pathologies and criminal phenomena, the health effects of tobacco products of illicit origin are no less important. They are not subject to any sanitary, hygienic or certainly qualitative standards.

Tobacco products, both illicit and legal, cause unfathomable harm to the health and well-being of citizens.

The illicit trade in tobacco products is a scourge that effects all of Europe and Ireland is no exception. It costs the north of Ireland UKP 450 million each year.

I supported the Heubuch report because I believe it fully highlights the risks associated with the application of NAFSN, particularly for small producers and women. The text expresses the need to make cooperation frameworks for different countries monitorable and accessible, including performance indicators and forcing private companies to publish annual reports.

Firstly, there must always be an eye for efficiency and the added value that Member States can offer. Secondly, in addition to a police and military contribution, attention must also be paid to civil protection.

I am opposed to this report as, inter alia, it calls on the EU to make greater efforts to strengthen international security, and maintains that European security must be the principle of EU interventions. Moreover, the report does not recognise the negative role and destabilization that the operations of the 'good of the West' have brought to different parts of the world, and does not take into account that many of the EU's missions in recent years have not been successful in terms of long-term peace and stability of countries.

It is essential that the European Commission tackles this problem through a legislative proposal to combat these unfair trade practices.

The Union needs common ground rules, because voluntary self-regulation by traders has failed to solve these problems. It should be possible to report practices that are contrary to good commercial practice anonymously. If a small business is based on a single retail chain, he or she is clearly in a position from which it is difficult to point out grievances under his own name. Unfair negotiating stations are also commonplace in Finland, where grocery trade is highly concentrated. In Finland, for example, large retail chains can often collect so-called marketing money from suppliers. It is not always clear whether the money will provide marketing or whether it is simply a mandatory threshold money to guarantee the product's access to the shelf.

As you know, in the last couple of months we have been working very closely with your Parliament on the issue of the smugglers working between Turkey and Greece, the terrible loss of life in the Aegean Sea. Because of what we have done, the business model of the smugglers on that road has been broken, people are no longer dying in the Aegean, and the numbers coming across from Turkey are very low indeed. But, look at the southern Mediterranean. People are dying, drowning in the sea. Smugglers have found a new business model, so our work is far from over. We must do the same we have done on the route through the Aegean also in the southern Mediterranean to find solutions, sustainable solutions.  We cannot tolerate this, the loss of human life on this scale, and we must do everything we can to stop it. That means we must engage more effectively with third countries of origin and transit to address the migration challenge in the long term, but also right now, immediately, and by we, I mean both the EU and the Member States. Learning from last year’s most important lessons, including the Valletta summit, today we propose a new partnership framework for across-the-board cooperation on migration with third countries. And we are asking you, the European Parliament, the European Council, Member States and the European Investment Bank, to give it their full backing. This framework rethinks how all actors – Member States, EU institutions and third countries – work together to bring order to migration flows and strive for well-managed migration. It establishes a result-oriented approach to mobilise and focus all EU and Member States’ tools and resources for that purpose.  We propose to use a mix of positive and negative incentives to reward those third countries willing to cooperate effectively with us and to ensure that there are consequences for those who do not. This includes using our development and trade policies to create leverage. Member States would need to play their part and be ready to mirror this approach through their actions and resources. We will set up a coordination mechanism to make sure we fully tap the EU’s collective influence. Together, we can achieve much more.  Operationally, our short-term objective is to save lives in the Mediterranean, increase returns of those who do not have the right to stay, and enable migrants and refugees to stay closer to home rather than embark on dangerous journeys. As we stem irregular migration flows, we must open up legal ways to Europe for those in need, in particular with more resettlement for refugees.  We will develop compacts tailored to each partner country’s specific circumstances, whether country of origin or transit or hosting a large refugee population. This approach will help bring tangible benefits for the refugees, for third countries, and obviously for the European Union and our own citizens.  We propose to first launch contacts with a limited number of priority countries: Jordan, Lebanon, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Mali and Ethiopia. We will also increase our engagement with Tunisia and Libya. To start with, the focus will be on improving border and migration management on the ground. This will require appropriate financing. The Africa Trust Fund will immediately be strengthened with EUR 500 million from the reserve of the European Development Fund. We are calling on Member States to match this to reach one billion. This could be done now, not waiting for the next boat to capsize. But this is not only about additional funds. This is as much, maybe even more, about better mobilising the funds we – the EU and Member States – have at our disposal. Combining our forces, a total of EUR eight billion could be made available to support the compacts for the next five years.  Looking at longer-term challenges, we also need to do more to improve opportunities in countries of origin so people are not compelled to leave. For that, we need to reconsider our traditional models of development cooperation and give a much greater role to private investors. While bottlenecks to investment differ across regions, we think we can replicate outside Europe the success, if not the exact design, of our internal European Fund for Strategic Investments, so we will shortly propose a new external investment fund aiming to crowd in private investment in developing countries starting with Africa and the EU’s neighbourhood. For this we will mobilize EUR 3.1 billion which should trigger total investment of up to 31 billion, and we could even reach 62 billion if Member States and other partners match the EU’s contribution.  I am convinced that by doing this, we can reach concrete results together with our partners. For this, we need the full commitment of all EU institutions, Member States and partner countries.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2819, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vicepresidente della Commissione e Alto Rappresentante dell'Unione per gli affari esteri e la politica di sicurezza – Signora Presidente, mi permetta di usare un momento per associarmi al sentimento di dolore che quest'Aula ha espresso ieri per la perdita di Gianluca Buonanno. Siamo sempre stati, io e Gianluca, su posizioni opposte, anche in modo vivace, come era sempre con lui, sia in quest'Aula sia quando eravamo insieme al Parlamento italiano. Sicuramente oggi saremmo stati su posizioni opposte. Ma siamo innanzitutto esseri umani. Davanti a questo immenso dolore, vorrei esprimere le mie più sincere condoglianze alla famiglia, innanzitutto alla moglie e ai bambini, ai suoi cari e anche al suo gruppo politico sia qui che in Italia. Switching to English and turning to the issue we are presenting today, together with Frans, together with the rest of our colleagues in the Commission. We have today a couple of very strong messages on one side – political messages – and also a couple of very strong, concrete commitments that we are presenting today. We hope we will get the full support of the Parliament, and also of the Council and the rest of the institutions.  The first message is in the method; we are sitting here together again and last month we were also sitting here together on another issue: I think it was on the SDGs. This is the way in which this Commission has chosen to work; joining the different strengths of our policies, works and tools – external and internal – and trying to give a strategic vision to our actions. I would like to thank not only Frans, but also our services, for the excellent teamwork we have developed over these years. The second strong message is a shift in paradigm and attitude. We need to move from the narrative we have had so far – that the refugee and migration crisis is a European crisis, to the recognition that this is not only an issue for Europe. The majority of the movements of people in the world are happening inside Africa, inside Asia and not only towards Europe, and that it is a global phenomenon that we need to face with a global approach. I was in New York yesterday addressing the UN Security Council, meeting the Secretary-General and working with them on the preparation of the summit on migration that the UN will hold in the margins of the General Assembly in September. This is the right approach that we are trying to encourage. It is a global responsibility: every single partner, every single country, every single region in the world, every single regional organisation and every international institution has to do its part. Europe is trying to do its part, saving lives and saving lives at sea. With our operation Sophia, we have saved already tens of thousands of lives. All others have to do the same. Also, because it is not only the people that are dying at sea that we have to save, it is also the thousands of people dying in the desert before they reach the shores of the Mediterranean – they are not on our TV screens, but they are also human lives. This is a shift in mentality, a shift in approach, that would bring us to build partnerships; global partnerships are what we need to face a global phenomenon like this. The third strong message is that we need to focus on our partnership approach, firstly with the countries of our immediate region around the Mediterranean – compacts with Jordan and Lebanon were already decided in February. In this package, we have a strong message for their implementation, but the other message we have is a strong focus on Africa. Africa, for demographic reasons, for economic reasons, for inequalities, for climate change reasons, is going to continue to be a major continent when it comes to movement of people. This is not going to disappear anytime soon unless we take a strategic approach in the long term – as well as in the immediate term – to face the inequalities and the policy issues that are at the core of the reason why people are leaving their own countries. With this communication, we put our relations with Africa in terms of strategic partnership, strongly and also with some resources on it. So coming to the facts and the commitments. Frans already mentioned the numbers of the economic commitment we put in. Firstly, there is the increased contribution to the trust fund for Africa – the extra EUR 500 million – bringing it to EUR 2.3 billion for EU funds for migration-related actions in Africa. Let me here raise a plea to the Member States to match this commitment, because we will need to be consistent on that side too. The second concrete commitment: the renewed partnerships under the migration compacts tailored to the priority countries we have identified, Jordan and Lebanon. As I have said, we already developed compacts during the London conference earlier this year, so now it is about delivering on this. We have identified Nigeria, Niger, Senegal, Mali and Ethiopia as further priority countries. I have launched already processes to debate with all of them in the last seven or eight months to discuss with their governments and presidents, as well as civil society and local authorities, what is needed in these countries. Sometimes it is specific areas of the countries or specific villages or regions in the countries where the majority of the flows originate, because of difficult economic, climatic, social or sometimes human rights situations. Our actions must be targeted where they are needed, and we have to have a win-win approach, moving from the delivery of aid to investment in Africa, especially starting with the aforementioned countries.  The win-win approach is what we need because, if this is a global phenomenon, we need to manage it together. This means that these countries, which are at the same time countries of origin, of transit and of destination, all need our support to manage better their internal challenges when it comes to hosting refugees and migrants. This also means providing support to the local authorities, infrastructures and possibility to sustain the effort from all different points of view.  Third, the long-term approach. Frans mentioned that we have launched an external investment plan which is a Copernican revolution in our approach to development cooperation. We discussed this with the EU development ministers and the foreign ministers in the last two Foreign Affairs Councils. Investing in Africa and trying to mix, in a smart way, European funds, public funds, private investors – we don't have to be scared of bringing the private sector in – and international financial institutions, starting with the EIB as guarantors. Following the good example of the European Fund for Strategic Investments, we need to learn the lessons that can be learned there, and develop a long—term investment plan for our partners who need infrastructure, social improvements, creation of jobs and support for growth in those countries. This, I believe, is finally an approach that is at the same time immediate and strategic. This can complement, in a coherent way, the proposals that we adopted last year with the agenda on migration, which already had one external part of measures. This builds on that, on the excellent achievement we had in the Valetta summit, building on partnership with our African friends and developing in a coherent way the work we have done in the last year, broadening and deepening our work, both in the immediate and in the short term.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2820, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Manfred Weber", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Vice-Presidents, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Migration is the mega-issue of our time, and we will probably have many more discussions about it. The principle is clear to my group: they are two sides of the same coin. One is: yes to help, yes to partnership – we must stop dying in our neighbourhood. On the other hand, however, it is also very clear that we must protect Europe from new waves of immigration, from new waves of migration, which Europeans are also afraid of. These are the two sides of the coin to be answered. First of all, it is important for me to do what both the Commission representatives have made clear, first of all to communicate to our citizens: if Europe is united, if we have good Commission proposals, then we can also deliver. The months-long exceptional situation in the Balkans has been stopped, and the wave-through has ended. We have now restored law and order in the Aegean. The smuggling gangs are being put to work. And the most important thing that has been said is that at least death has been curbed, fewer people are dying in the Aegean. In other words, if we act together, we will deliver. Aid is also arriving more on the ground, the first few hundred million of the new funds have now been invested, for example, in Turkey, and we are helping on the ground. It works, and we all know that it is only the beginning of a long-term development to get to grips with migration issues. That is why we need to work on legislation. On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to express my thanks for the fact that we have found such good cooperation in the LIBE Committee on the Coast Guard and that we are showing there that we want to deliver together, including on safe third countries, on all the issues that we are putting forward in terms of legislation. It is disappointing, I would also like to say, that, according to the latest figures, the Member States are failing in the African Trust Fund. We have 1.8 billion from the EU budget on the table and so far only 81 million have been provided by the Member States. The Council, which is not here, should write this down. The commitments made in Valletta should also be implemented, please! That is the first step. The second step, however, is now the question of how we deal strategically with our neighbour, Africa. We must all be aware that the fate of our continent, the fate of Europe, is closely linked to the development of the African continent. I would therefore like to thank the Commission for its proposals today, from Federica Mogherini, from Frans Timmermans, and I would also like to mention Commissioners Hahn and Mr Stylianides, who have worked on them. Thank you for that. These are good basic proposals for the work we have to do. If we realise that Africa's population can double by 2050, it is one of the mega-themes of our time, to which Europe must provide answers. We have to describe the truths. The truth is that we must turn, we must take the problems seriously, not only out of pity for Africa, but out of self-interest. Out of self-interest, we must turn to this continent. We will also have to invest more money, we will have to give up more prosperity. We will have to make better use of the funds that have already been made available, but we will also have to break new ground. That is why I would also like to emphasise, on the part of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that the idea of rebuilding the EFSI for Africa, using the leverage approach, will be constructive in our approach, and that we are open to it. Trade policy has been mentioned: an important tool of the European Union. We need to build partnership through trade policy, not so much from a European perspective, but also more from the African perspective. But we also need to be clear. For if a partner in Africa does not cooperate, for example, on the repatriation of illegal immigrants, on the repatriation of rejected refugees and asylum seekers, then this must also have consequences in terms of trade policy. Then you can't continue to do business as usual and continue to do business as before. We need to talk plainly with our African partners. I would like to add one more thought to the debate, because today we have also discussed the Blue Card and the legal routes to Europe: my group is prepared to participate constructively in the issue. We need further development in the Blue Card. But I would also like to encourage reflection: we have millions of people are still out of work in the European Union, we have millions of young people in the south of the continent out of work. That is why I would like to make it clear to my group that Blue Card cannot mean that we are now opening up new ways of bringing even more migrant workers to Europe. We must first ensure that European youth have a future before we think about the African on this European continent. I would like to thank you for the proposals that have come today.

We did not see that we were faced with a young continent, which had so many problems and so many potentials, and above all we did not understand that, with this continent, we could share these challenges. If you think about it, all the great challenges that affect us also concern Africa. The fight against terrorism: are we fighting terrorism without Africa? The government of migration flows: do we do it without Africa? Interreligious dialogue? Economic, civil and cultural development? Africa is a partner for us. Now finally there is the turning point. And there is the turning point – let us be honest here too – thanks to the Italian Government and thanks to the European Commission. I say thank you to both of you, Federica Mogherini and Frans Timmermans, and to the entire European Commission for these proposals. There are two knots, I'm going straight to the concrete. The first node is the financial resource. You have done your best: EUR 500 million from the reserve fund is what the European Commission could realistically do. There is now work to be done by the Member States. We cannot put it into words and then not make the money available, including from the Member States. And then there is the multiplication and leverage mechanism on which we must check the EIB first. Governance must be done, but it must also change its mission, which cannot be to finance only triple-A projects, otherwise triple-A projects in Africa are not being financed, and we are hanging around. And we can do anything but make fun of ourselves. Projects in Africa are risky and therefore are not triple-A. The second issue is political and cultural. The Compact, this program, is not just a seuritarian program. Of course, it serves to manage migratory flows well. Let us pay attention to the theme of 'young Africans come to take away young Europeans' jobs'. This is a story that doesn't even hold up scientifically. Let me tell you who's studying these problems. The Compact, this programme serves to securize, of course, but it serves above all to establish a political, economic, civil and cultural partnership with Africa. If it's just a ruse to curb flows, it's very little. If, on the other hand, it is, as I am convinced it is, a means of finally achieving a great alliance, it is a great thing and deserves to be called a revolutionary turning point.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2822, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Helga Stevens", "mepid": "125105", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – The Commission is coming up with a new master plan today. The intention seems to be to provide financial support to the main African transit countries in exchange for two achievements. First, they must stop migrants by fighting people smugglers. Secondly, they must take back illegal migrants from Europe.  NVA previously called for the conclusion of 'anti-drowning agreements' with all countries around the Mediterranean. We note today that this is being followed up. It proposes to send migrants back from the EU to Tunisia, Egypt, Mali, etc., while making efforts to resettle genuine refugees. Push-backs, combined with resettlement, our familiar mantra.  The EU's border and coastguard, in the creation of which I am actively contributing as shadow rapporteur, can carry out these return operations. In order to achieve a comprehensive approach, we now have the introduction of a maximum ceiling for asylum seekers to be accommodated.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2823, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Guy Verhofstadt", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, first of all let me say to the Commission that I am very pleased with the global approach that you have finalised this morning – alongside the European Border and Coast Guard, the new asylum system and the new proposals on economic migration. Let us hope that we achieve a result by the end of the year.  I have to tell you that this is also a bit of a personal matter, because my first European Council was in 1999 in the north of Finland in Tampere, where we decided: from now on there is going to be a European asylum and migration policy. That was decided in principle in 1999 and now, 17 years later – I should say, finally – maybe we are nearly there.  So I am positive about the global approach, but I am more critical about the idea of now making migration compacts with third countries. If the Commission intends to simply duplicate the deal with Turkey, then I have a number of key problems with this, because  I have here Amnesty International’s report of one week ago about this Turkey deal.  For Europe it is a way forward. There are fewer people coming to Europe – at any rate in that part of the Mediterranean, because, in the meanwhile, there is an increase in the number of people flowing to Europe in other parts of the Mediterranean and I think the one is connected to the other.  But in addition to that – and independently from that – what the report is saying is that for the refugees this is certainly not the solution to their problems. They live in awful conditions. There are more than 100 000 of these migrants who are stuck between IS and a wall that Turkey is building up, kilometre by kilometre, on the border with Syria. At the same time there is no possibility for these people to have asylum, because Turkey has not ratified all the protocols of the Geneva Convention and so asylum is not possible for Syrian refugees. The conclusion, then, is that for refugees this deal is tragic. It is a drama. It is a problem.  So to say today that we have the solution to our problems, that we are simply going to duplicate the deal with Turkey and we are going to roll it out to all the other countries: sorry, I do not think that is the way forward in the future. It is simply saying: OK, we will give you money and you keep the refugees. Well, that cannot be the deal. That cannot be a compact. So my proposal is that, instead of having this migration compact, we need a real partnership with these countries. This real partnership has, I think, some tricky elements. It first of all means us, together – not them – us Europeans together, opening reception centres in these countries to pick up these migrants and refugees, in reception centres – in Libya, in Egypt, in Tunisia, in Lebanon, in Jordan, in the North African countries. Secondly, in these reception centres we can manage this together and make a distinction between those who are real refugees who can be resettled inside the European Union –  which is one possibility – and those who are migrants.  For our part we need to establish projects in the transit countries or in the countries of origin to give them a life, an expectation and a future in these countries of origin. There the situation is better than ever because, let us not forgot, Africa today has growth of between 4% and 5%. There is a basis for good projects in these transit countries and countries of origin. That seems to me to be the way forward, not to say: we are giving you money, we have already been promising you money for two decades but we never gave it to you, now you can have it if you keep the refugees. For me that is not a compact. If that is the compact, I am against it. I hope it will not be by accident if we can make real partnerships with them, managing the borders together, making projects in the transit countries and so on. Then it is a way forward. So you have to adapt your proposal in that way. Finally, on the last element, the question of the Blue Card, I have to tell you one thing. The Blue Card – which does not in fact exist for the moment, there are 10 000 Blue Cards – is a good attempt. I do not think that a directive is the right way forward, Mr Timmermans. I think there is a better way forward, which is to make one Blue Card, like there is one green card in the US: one Blue Card instead of a directive which will lead to 28 blue cards in the European Union. I think we, as the European Parliament, have the task, with you, to push the Council to accept one system instead of the 28 systems that could result from this directive.

A new deal where the European Commission is trying to work with member states to prevent deaths at sea and manage migration.  The great weaving out we have made with Turkey is repeating itself. The weeffout is that we don't say, \"Africa, African countries, we see your problems. How can we help you?\" But we say, 'We, we in Europe, we have screaming populists and that's why we want to stop migration'. Everything seems to be aimed at holding back refugees rather than helping them. And if we look at the figures, I wonder if your proposals are achieving their goal. This year, more people have died in the same period than they did a year ago. How is that possible? And why would your proposals solve this? There have not been more migrants who made the crossing, but more who have had to pay for it with death. Isn't there simply something wrong with how we offer a helping hand at sea?  An important observation you make is that poverty is the reason for many Africans to come to Europe. And you are starting – and to my delight – again the discussion about legal migration. We like to think about this, but at the same time you are breaking a foundation under development cooperation. The goal of development money is to combat poverty. That is also in our Treaty of Lisbon. But what does our surprise tell us? The Commission wants to use these funds to keep people there, to keep the borders closed.  Mr Timmermans, if I may speak to the great Social Democrat Schaeffer, no one can eat from borders. I wonder how your colleague Mimica actually looks at this? Or the Ministers for Development Cooperation in Europe? Or the members of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee? You take money away from the poorest to pay customs officers with it.  Dear Vice-President, two quotes from you: \"The MDG showed us that lack of development of some countries is a threat to all, but so is unsustainable development on a global scale. This is the challenge that today we commit to overcome together\". Those were your words when introducing the sustainable development goals.

Why don't we start paying a peace tax to terrorists to be calm in Paris, London, Brussels and all the capitals of European countries? After half a year or a year, could we really start discussing this proposal with serious faces? Once again, what I said at the beginning of this migrant crisis: the main condition of the European Union's bilateral or multilateral agreements with African countries must be security and border security in the region. All aid projects submitted to the states of the region can and must also be linked to ensuring peace and security in these countries. Another essential and ongoing condition is the strict and professional external control of the European Union itself, in particular its southern borders. And yet, it is necessary to abandon the quota policy. It has been, is, and will be, an obvious incentive for migration to Europe, because this sends a signal 'you are welcome here, you will be taken care of'. It's obvious.

Recall how the whole Arabian Peninsula has descended into chaos, as was the case with Egypt and Mubarak, with Tunisia and Ben Ali, as was the case in Libya with Gaddafi, and how they then tried to fight Assad in Syria, and how the waves of applause erupted everywhere, that an Arab Spring brought a much better time here.

But now that an intercontinental migration wave is also heading towards Austria, where people are crossing four or five safe third countries, including Union countries, all of which are not safe enough for them, where European ones are, we come to a point where we have to say: stop, it is enough!

This morning, German media spoke of the need to build pressure on African states. I do not think that is the first point. First and foremost, it is really about a partnership. It is a question of fighting the causes of flight together, of investing in democracy, in the environment, in jobs, so that people no longer have to set off. It is a question of putting a stop to people smugglers, including through cooperation in the coastguard and the like. It is a question of enabling legal migration, because we need it partly in Europe. It is a question of creating a situation in the partner countries that allows for return and withdrawal. This is not only true, it is long overdue. This plan goes beyond short-term crisis management. Only long-term sustainable cooperation can help us to make up for what we have failed to do for decades. It won't be easy. Two concerns accompany us in this discussion: the first concern is the concern for financing. You have already pointed this out, Mr Weber. If of 11.8 billion 81 million have been paid into one pot, then I do not believe the Member States really want to do anything, and then I am not so optimistic that I believe their forecasts. That is why it can only be the case that the Member States pay into such a pot quickly and immediately, otherwise our money would also be leaked. The second concern concerns the question of who we actually want to cooperate with in the individual states: investment in peace, progress, democracy, yes, is urgently needed, but pragmatic approaches and realism are also needed. We must therefore not only treat everyone equally according to the motto of one size fits, but must negotiate individual contracts that are also based on our European values.

But now we will use trade sanctions when a country is not taking back the refugees, the people that fled from that specific country.

So we have a moral duty to stop these flows. On the other hand, there is an inalienable right, which is that right that must allow a person to live and grow in the country in which he was born.

The only thing that is certain is that there is no one to take responsibility and say with courage and more truth that he failed, to chant a \"mea culpa\". So far, you've failed miserably. The fences at the borders of the Balkan countries and the use of Article 25 of the Schengen Treaty by the Member States demonstrate this.

First, in-depth thinking is needed on funding. On the one hand, the good practices that already exist in the selected and so-called priority countries deserve to be better valued; on the other hand, the question of the effectiveness of our financial instruments and, in particular, the EDF must be asked. We need to reduce the number of priorities to have a better impact.  Second, yes, Africa is a key continent. In terms of migration management, support for border controls between African countries and the management of intra-African migration needs to be strengthened. As far as the causes of migration are concerned, it is imperative to achieve results in development cooperation. This requires a real effort and we are doing it: finding a working approach and incentives and not neglecting other economic and trade tools as levers for reforms related to the rule of law and human rights.  A general point: attention to the message that will be sent to all other countries that are not priorities at the moment. And a special question: what role for African regional organizations?

Many, even most war refugees, do not want to come to Europe, but have been forced to do so. The European Union must provide significantly greater support to refugees as much as possible in the convergence of their homeland, for example through the UN Refugee Organisation.

The situation is tragic. Even the people rescued from the long-dead naya are faced with miserable living conditions, while hotspots are now being turned into concentration camps. In order to stop crime, hollow promises must be stopped and immediate action taken. To create immediately a common and fair asylum system, based on practical solidarity and equal burden-sharing.

I am therefore of the opinion that the European Union must take three concrete measures to reduce migratory pressure on Europe. First of all, a distinction must be made between economic migrants and refugees. Those seeking a better way of life can take advantage of legal ways of entering European territory, but under no legislation do they have the right to enter the European Union illegally, trying to cross unregulated borders. Hope must be dissipated that Europe will provide them with the same support as refugees fleeing war. Furthermore, the European Union must step up the return of illegal immigrants to their countries of origin. I therefore welcome the reinforced role of the European Border and Coast Guard in this regard. But for the work of the new office to be effective, the European Union must swiftly sign readmission agreements with the countries of origin.  Finally, I am of the opinion that the possibility of setting up hotspots outside European territory should be considered again. I believe that this measure will reduce migratory pressure on Europe, because only those entitled to international protection will be able to reach the Member States as a result of their application being approved under European law.

It was understandable that priority was accorded to negotiations with Turkey, but other more vulnerable countries also need our attention, something which was acknowledged today. But when Member States have contributed just 80 million to the 1.8 billion Trust Fund for Africa, the European Parliament must insist that genuine new money be provided and that development aid in particular should not be diverted, as otherwise more for more risks becoming more for less. It is one reason why the Italian proposal for eurobonds as part of the compact should be considered. These bonds would be not just financial bonds, but bonds of solidarity between Europe and the wider world.  Following the UN Conference on Financing for Development, the pledge is made for climate finance at COP21 and Europe’s own support for a financial transactions tax. We have to be open to creating new innovative forms of international finance to meet new international challenges.  I admit that the idea of a grand bargain with third countries to halt refugee flows is distasteful to many. You do not bargain over people’s lives. But let us face it, the EU has done precisely that, linking visa and trade concessions to readmission agreements over many years. So if the money is genuinely additional, if we recognise that 86% of refugees are in the global South and not making their way to Europe, if this new money first and foremost improves the lives and livelihoods of those refugees and of all peoples in the countries to which they have fled, if Europe honours its promise of safe routes for legal migration, then we should give it our support.  Finally, this communication on first reading does appear to fall into the trap of assuming that Europe in its external policy is much more effective as a funder than as a political actor.

It is essential to ensure that we have honest and honest partners in African countries. At the same time, it is also essential to strengthen the legal and safe routes of immigration to Europe, as you say. We have heard that the Balkan route is closed, that there is less dying in the Mediterranean Sea, but there is a growing human trafficking and new migration routes are opening up. I cannot pass the unimaginable fact that newcomers to Greece can only apply for asylum via Skype. These are things that can be improved immediately and give hope to people. Finally, I agree that European migration management requires a long-term, strategic approach. However, this must not only focus on the containment of flows with Africa, but, in particular, the establishment of sincere cooperation with Africa, which will strengthen the African continent in political and economic terms, in cooperation with Europe and in contacts between people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2892, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Μιλτιάδης Κύρκος (", "mepid": "125113", "text": "  S&amp;D). Mr President, Africa's explosive population growth combined with the enormous poverty of certain regions and the wars raises a hot question: Can mass, by millions, migration of african citizens be part of the solution? On the occasion of the influx of tens of thousands of economic migrants from Africa and beyond, the Commission is trying to give a double answer and is saying 'no', proposing a new ambitious framework for cooperation with incentives and disincentives for the countries of Africa and our neighbourhood. In other words, it is trying to give a double answer to both underdevelopment and the reduction of migration flows. If you convince us that this project will hit the huge waste of resources and corruption in the implementation of actions through a mechanism of transparency and a genuine investigation of complaints by civil society, I believe that your proposal will be a valuable contribution.

The basis of the document is conditionality which betrays the meaning of cooperation and aims to subject the whole relationship with third countries, which should be based on mutual respect and fairness. I find it worrying to divert the funds allocated to cooperation for border management purposes; it does not create opportunities for young Africans, it does not combat inequalities, but it increases inequalities, and it does not attack the root causes of migratory flows.

First, we must have a real development policy: there is no point in telling us, morning, noon and evening, that we are the ones who give the most money to Africa, we need to rethink our development policy so that it is useful and effective, which is not the case today. Second, legal pathways for economic immigration must be built. This is the only way to combat illegal immigration; you have to give, for example, multiple-entry visas that allow a migrant to come to work for a few months, go home and eventually return when he has work. We must fight against all employers - I am thinking of agriculture, construction - who illegally employ illegal immigrants, and at the same time allow readmissions to be effective.

In the debates this afternoon you mixed many different things. Mr Verhofstadt was asking at the beginning – it is a pity he is not here – whether this is a duplication of the deal with Turkey. The two situations are completely different. As Frans mentioned at the beginning, from Turkey we have mainly Syrian refugees. It is temporary – hopefully temporary, we are working also on that, this is another story – a flow of refugees, asylum seekers. That falls into one specific international legal framework. We are trying to deal with that in a sort of immediate and also – let me use this word that I do not like at all, but that is the reality of our policies today – emergency mode.  What we are putting on the table here is something completely different. It is something that starts from the fact that with Africa we have a common interest in working on the development of the continent with a sense of partnership.  Some of you asked how are the African interlocutors reacting to this? Very well. Yesterday I was in New York at the Security Council. African countries, but not only African countries, Latin American countries, were saying: This is the right way to go because finally you are not only investing  in development – which is the right thing to do, by the way, in itself. And incidentally, I am proud to say that the European Union is the first donor worldwide, it is the first – and if you want, I can give you the figures for it also being the first donor to Africa – the first donor internationally with more than half of the official development assistance worldwide: EUR 68 billion in 2015, over EUR 20 billion ODA to Africa every year, and this is going to stay. I am proud of that.  This is the right thing to do anyway but there is another issue. Please go to Ethiopia and talk to the women that came back voluntarily, not from Europe but from the Gulf because they were becoming slaves, while we support projects from the ILO to reintegrate them into their communities, offering training and job opportunities. Listen to their stories and then come back to me and say that we are doing deals on their shoulders. No. We are protecting their lives and their rights. Go and talk with the young girls from Nigeria who turn into sex slaves in Europe and tell me that the deal we want to strike with Nigeria is not to protect their rights and their lives.  I am sorry, but you do not protect the lives of people only by saving them at sea. You also save their lives at the beginning of the journey. Go to Lampedusa and listen to the stories that the survivors tell you, or if you cannot fly there, watch the movie ‘Fuocoammare’ (Fire at Sea). There was a showing of it a couple of months ago in the European Parliament in Brussels. Listen to those words that tell you that these people are turned into slaves from the very beginning of their journeys. They are in chains crossing the deserts, locked in jails in Libya, locked in the boats that then sink.  We have a human responsibility – and our African partners as well have a human responsibility – to protect their lives. This is what we are talking about, and doing this together with international agencies starting from the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the UNHCR.  So what we are talking about is job creation, perfectly rightly, for African women, for African youth – go to Agadez, that was living from tourism before security made it impossible – about offering those young people job opportunities that are not linked to the smuggling networks or the criminal organisations, working on education, working on social development, working also on human rights and protection of the people. This is what we are talking about.  So, is it enough? No. But sorry, if we never start to do the right thing, in 10 years’ time the people who come after us will be facing exactly the same thing and I wish the people that were here 10 years ago had made the same choices as we are proposing to you today, because maybe today we would have better situations in Africa and also in Europe. We have to start somewhere.  So we know very well this this proposal is not going to turn the situation upside down in 24 hours, but there is no policy that could do that, and we should stop selling illusions to our people. But there are good things we can start doing consistently in partnership to change things, and we have to start.  So this is what we are proposing today. This goes together with opening regular channels for migration, for sure, this also is not my direct responsibility. This is also linked to the need for Member States to be coherent and do their part. This is also about other actors in the world doing their part and being coherent, from Asia to Latin America, to North America and the international organisations, to the UN system and to our African partners, because the only thing that would change Africa is not only our compacts, it is African leadership.  And here, believe me, we are very straightforward, very much so, because there is no other way of changing African societies other than yes, investing, but also creating, together with investments, the conditions for investments to flourish which are: the rule of law, interconnection within the continent – if you want to fly or to travel from one African capital to another you have to fly to Europe; does that make sense? – developing infrastructures, developing security conditions that are good for European investments, that are good for African investors as well, and people. So yes, it can be win-win-win.  Last, but not least, some of you mentioned the fact that, as the flows diminish or go down to zero on the eastern route, we see an increase on the central Mediterranean route. Let me tell you, please have a look at the numbers but most of all at the nationalities. They are two completely different routes and there is no link, as of today. Last year, through Libya to Sicily, we were facing a major inflow of Syrians. It is not the case today. At the moment we are not seeing a shift. It is simply that Africa is young, it is poor, it is facing the dramatic effect of climate change, and it is only natural that this happens, if we do not work with a long-term strategic perspective to change this. That is what we are suggesting to you to do.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2900, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Frans Timmermans", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   First Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, I will make just a few remarks in addition to what High Representative Mogherini said. It is my deep conviction that the only way we can maintain a humane refugee policy, based on our most fundamental values, is if we make a clear distinction between people who deserve international protection and people who come to Europe because they see economic opportunity in Europe. All too often – and we have heard it again here today – people pretend that everyone arriving on Europe’s shores is an economic migrant. I have heard some of your Members saying it today. This is a cheap way of getting rid of your moral and legal responsibility vis—à—vis people who deserve international protection, but it is made possible because, until now, we have not been good enough at making a clear distinction between people who deserve international protection and people who do not. Why? Because for too many years Greece and Italy were left alone with a problem. They asked time and time and time again for a European solution and the only answer they got from the rest of Europe was that ‘it’s not our problem, but your problem, so take care of it’.  So now we need to solve it and the only sustainable way of solving it is by  doing it in a European way. We can solve it, and get pan—European support for a humane refugee policy, if, and only if, we sort out the issue of economic migration in a sustainable way, and the compact with African countries is one element for doing that. That is why I passionately believe in this way forward. I have heard no one who criticises it giving us a better idea. If you have a better idea, share it with us. But to simply say, ‘let everyone into Europe’ is the shortest way to ending our humanitarian policy, the shortest way to ending the reception of refugees in Europe and the shortest way to giving populists the opportunity to say that everyone who comes here is an opportunist looking for a better future at our expense.  Tell that to a family fleeing from Raqqah, fleeing from Aleppo, from barrel bombs. Tell them that they are economic migrants. It is a scandal. So that is why we believe that, as part of a comprehensive long-term migration and refugee policy, we also need to be able to show that we can return people to their places of origin if they do not have the right to international protection and, more importantly, that we create opportunity in African countries so that economic growth does not disappear into the pockets of the elite but goes to everyone with talent and every young person has an opportunity to build a life for themselves in their country of origin. That is what we need to do and this is surely not going to be done on its own. We need the Member States to contribute. The biggest problem here is not just a lack of finance. It is the lack of clear direction, of coordinated efforts, of doing the same thing from all 28 with the European Union and its institutions and all doing it in the same vein, instead of having individual, very often post—colonial, ideas of how to have a relationship with individual African countries. Let us bring some order into this.  Finally, let us never forget that we are talking about human beings. We are not talking about numbers or objects. We are talking about people who have dreams – like you and me – who want a better life for their children and who do not want to be abandoned by the rich part of the world. I had a very wonderful experience last week in Sweden, a country that has taken in per capita more refugees than any other European country – more than 160 000. Now that they have the impression that we are slowly getting this under control, you see the mood in the Swedish society shifting towards, ‘OK, let us make a success of this’, companies offering thousands of intern places for refugees, schools accommodating many new pupils and communities welcoming new citizens. I hope that next week at the European Championships we will see Zlatan Ibrahimović being one of the stars – the son of people who fled the Balkan wars 20 years ago and who is now a very proud Swede, and Sweden is very proud of him.

Two million Portuguese have done so throughout the 20th century. We have to get used to thinking a little more than the first mate. There is a whole work of information and pedagogy to do, starting with policy makers and ending up in schools. At a time when accounting is over, we run the risk of dehumanising refugees: the risk of no longer seeing human beings in them and seeing only numbers.

Naturally, this is a completely different context, taking into account the ethnic origin of migrants. It is not war refugees, but people who, for demographic, economic and inequality reasons, continue to come from Africa to Europe. This European agenda on migration must be addressed both from an economic support perspective and from a law enforcement perspective in African states. I recommend mobilising the European institutions and the Member States to find tools and resources that, in collaboration with third countries, lead to control of the migration phenomenon.

Above all, we must help these countries – Jordan, Lebanon, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Mali, Ethiopia, Tunisia and Libya – from which an unstoppable exodus would otherwise start. This reversal of the trend is the only way to prevent desperate people from dying in the Mediterranean. Every euro spent on Africa and the Mediterranean is one euro spent on Europe.

Recently, I pointed out in a question to the Commission the urgent need to promote readmission agreements with African countries of origin for economic migrants, with which there is currently no such agreement.

Honourable Members of the Parliament, Mr President, I am really pleased to present before you today a revised EU Blue Card proposal and an EU action plan on integration. From the very beginning, this House has valued the importance of having sound and forward-looking legal migration policies, which are the other important side of the coin of managing migration comprehensively and in an effective way. But legal migration goes beyond migration and mobility as such. It plays an important role in strengthening the EU’s competitiveness and it can address demographic challenges and labour shortages. While, on the one hand, we will need to continue investing in the skills of our existing workforce and addressing unemployment, the rapid ageing of the population in the European Union will require us to attract skills from abroad to address shortages in specific sectors. I will give you two examples. In the ICT sector we need more than 100 000 highly skilled professionals per year. In the health sector there will be around one million unfilled highly skilled vacancies by 2020. Even if we upskill our labour force, this takes time. Besides that, we will still need more people to fill the shortages. Let me also state another fact, which I know is difficult to hear in the current context: European societies are and will continue to become increasingly diverse. Today there are 20 million non-EU nationals residing in the European Union – around 4% of its total population. The key element here is not to fight this reality but to embrace it and turn it into an advantage by ensuring the successful integration of migrants – including, of course, refugees – into the host societies as soon as possible, therefore maximising the benefits of immigration. Today’s proposals address all these issues. On the Blue Card, the European Union is increasingly competing with the growing number of other destinations for the same global pool of talent. We want to become more attractive than countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States of America. Therefore, the EU needs to establish a more efficient, transparent and simpler scheme for attracting highly skilled workers. This will bring substantial benefits to the European Union in terms of innovation, transfer of technology and increased investment flows. This will enhance the European Union’s competitiveness and help create new jobs. In fact, the new Blue Card scheme would bring an estimated post-dip annual economic impact of between EUR 1.4 billion to EUR 6.2 billion from additional highly skilled workers coming to the European Union to take up jobs. Right now, the existing Blue Card is unattractive, unknown and fragmented. So, how can we change? How can we remedy these shortcomings? Today’s proposal aims at establishing an ambitious Europe-wide scheme. It will be easier to qualify for the EU Blue Card. The scheme is also made more accessible if you have graduated recently or work in a shortage occupation. The EU Blue Card is also made accessible to highly skilled beneficiaries of international protection. This will allow them to make full use of their potential and skills and support their integration. The Blue Card can be obtained faster because the maximum processing time is shorter. The new proposal also provides for enhanced rights in terms of intra-EU mobility, access to employment and long-term residence, and for family members. On the action plan on integration, we are not starting from scratch on integration but we should learn from the past when looking at the future. If we look at integration outcomes across the European Union, third country nationals continue to face barriers in the education systems or the labour market. They are more at risk of poverty or social exclusion. The recent inflow of third country nationals to Europe, and in particular of refugees, represents an additional challenge but is also an opportunity and we have to seize this window of opportunity. It is therefore high time to investment more on integration if we want to ensure that all third country nationals can fully contribute to our economies and societies. I want to be very clear: the cost of non-integration in the longer-term will be higher than the cost of investing today in effective integration policies. On the other hand, if we succeed in making integration a success story, this will be highly beneficial, both for the host countries and for the migrants themselves. Effective integration also entails an understanding and subscribing to EU fundamental rights and values. This is an essential element of living and participating in the European Union, and we should not shy away from addressing this question when we define what it means to live in and belong to Europe. Now, while we fully recognise that integration policies are made and done at national, and particularly at regional and local levels, it is also true that those levels across the European Union are experiencing the same challenges. So the European Union has a role to play in supporting all stakeholders in this process in coordinating and in helping structurally and financially.  The action plan adopted today offers a comprehensive framework to support Member States’ efforts in developing and strengthening their integration policies. It targets all third country nationals in the European Union while including several actions that address the specific challenges faced by refugees. The key areas of action that we have identified are: Firstly, support to third country nationals, but also the communities that welcome them at the earliest possible moment in the migration process through pre-departure and pre-arrival measures. Secondly, education and training. Thirdly, integration of third country nationals into the labour market and into vocational training. Fourthly, facilitating access to basic services such as adequate and affordable housing and health. Fifthly, and finally, the action plan also proposes to strengthen the coordination between the various actors working on integration at national, regional and local level and proposes a more strategic approach towards the use of EU funds for integration, not only asylum, migration and integration funds but also the European Social Fund and other relevant EU funds. Honourable Members of the Parliament, I look forward to hearing your comments on our proposals today but most importantly, I count on you to help us turn them into reality as soon as possible. It was one and a half years ago that I was committed to bring this proposal here today and I am more than happy to do so.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2918, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Kinga Gál", "mepid": "28150", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. - Dear President, Allow me to comment on this point of discussion on the migration issue as a whole, as these are very closely related issues. The Commission's proposals, all that we have just heard and before, must aim at reducing the total burden on Europe. It is now clear that the protection of the Union's external borders, and thus the protection of its maritime borders, is a priority for European interests. And that is not only our interest, but also our humanitarian responsibility, because uncertain steps can be interpreted as an invitation to the hundreds of thousands waiting for a better life. And if we keep it consistently, we will do everything we can to keep it from coming to the Union illegally, maybe we can stop the Mediterranean from becoming a mass grave.  To do this, what we heard at the previous point of discussion is that we need to separate genuine refugees from migrants and return illegal economic migrants. We need to spend money on everything and do our part in addressing the causes of the migration wave. Our development and visa policy must be dependent on cooperation from third countries. But it is a clear and important realisation – and I am pleased that it is being said today – that urgent responses to illegal migration cannot be combined with medium and long-term responses to demographic and labour market challenges. In order to solve the latter problems, account should be taken of the specific situation of the Member States and member states should take sovereign decisions in this area. No mandatory or automatic mechanisms may be introduced.  The blockade proposal should take into account the high rate of skilled young unemployment in Europe and this initiative will have to look like this. The integration of migrants who have come to the EU has not been very successful so far, and it is becoming increasingly clear that there are new complex problems in which education will play a major role. We must say that Europe's ability to integrate is finite and that we adhere to our traditional European values. We expect those who want to live in Europe to respect them, so that integration can be easier.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2919, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Claude Moraes", "mepid": "4519", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his statement and the proposals. They are very important proposals and indeed very brave coming at the time of the global migration crisis. As we heard in the previous debate, it is a global migration crisis. But if I start with the first proposal on integration, I was reminded of a Swiss German poet – I cannot remember the name – who, when asked about guest workers in Germany, said ‘we invited guest workers to Germany, unfortunately we got human beings’. The problem is that if we do not manage migration, and if we do not manage the integration of those whom we invite or of those refugees who are deserving of international protection, we will pay the cost. I think the Commissioner has made that point. But the Commission, the European Parliament and of course the Member States above all have to understand that integration is not an option. We will pay the cost if we do not employ those integration measures that we can have at our disposal.  Ultimately, most integration measures are done at local level, but we know from our discussions with the Commission that there are key integration measures that we can advance with the Commission in the labour market that are at our disposal. We know that some countries, like the United Kingdom, will opt out of those and I want to make that clear to those who are listening very carefully to that point. On the question of the Blue Card, many people throw around issues like the Australian-style points system. Well let us be very clear on the question of the Blue Card: at the moment it is completely unsatisfactory. The issue of managing migration, which everyone wants to talk about across the political spectrum, has to be worthy of the name. If we are going to manage migration for the benefit of migrants in a proper respectful mutual partnership with those countries who are sending migrants, then we have to have a proper well-studied proposal, like the seasonal workers proposal or the student proposal that my colleague Ms Wikström has finished. Legal migration must not be done on the cheap and on the quick. With the Commission we must do it properly, so that we have a proper mutual understanding with the sending countries: no cherry picking, a proper legal migration proposal that is worthy of its name.

It is therefore a very good thing that the EU is thinking about its policies and is now having a debate. There is a lot of fodder for discussion on the table today. I will confine myself to a few key comments.  Let me first stress and reiterate that asylum and migration are two different things that need to be dealt with separately. For example, asylum cannot solve structural internal economic shortcomings and legal migration cannot solve the asylum crisis either.  That's how I get to my second point. The revision of the Blue Card Directive. It is essential for our economy that Europe can attract highly qualified people. But, I repeat, the blue card must not be a shortcut for asylum. I therefore stress the importance of an effective free vacancy that can only be filled via the blue card. A revision of the Blue Card Directive should recognise that Member States are best placed to assess the needs of their national labour market.  And finally, once in Europe, it is important that newcomers integrate well. I therefore support the proposal to free up European funds for the integration of new comers. It is important that these funds go to the competent institutions and the Member States so that they can spend them themselves in accordance with their own local needs.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2922, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Nathalie Griesbeck", "mepid": "28208", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. Mr President, Commissioner, it has been several years since we have been calling for an ambitious reform of this text in the face of the shortcomings of the 2009 Blue Card Directive and we are saying, in particular my parliamentary group, that there is an urgent need for Europe to have a genuine and effective policy on legal immigration, successful integration, while at the same time combating both irregular immigration and illegal work. Four points quickly: in order to do this, we need to really re-examine this legislative instrument, as you have pointed out, Commissioner, to avoid us carrying out a half-hearted reform, as we often, unfortunately, we do and which results in us putting the work back on the job, a few years later, to adapt it to the situation. In short, let us come together with a reform that is meaningful and courageous, let us legislate with ambition, as we are used to saying here. Second point: we need to adapt the scheme by setting legal immigration quotas for the Union and do it country by country, sector by sector, according to the needs of the European economy, this, for example, thirdly, with a European portal containing information on needs, on job offers that the Union needs for the system to function smoothly , correctly and efficiently. And finally, as Guy Verhofstadt pointed out in the previous debate, let us not create 28 devices, but a device that is readable, effective and usable.

We refuse that a person's administrative situation conditions his rights and his freedom. More importantly, we deny this division between legal and illegal people, because no human being is illegal. Illegal is a condition imposed on them by their laws. They want legal, a few—very few—for highly skilled jobs, in a very utilitarian view of migration, and they want illegals for cheap labor, 21st-century slaves.

As the Commission figures show, there are major shortages. I would add engineers to his list, and if we want to move further in terms of a just transition towards a low-carbon economy, engineers are people that we need. They do not all have to be men.  But the group that we are talking about very much this afternoon are people who actually do have choices about where they go, and some of the proposed changes to the Blue Card sound very positive. Indeed, a number of them were argued for by some of us in this Chamber the first time round – I am sure Mr Moraes will remember that. But when this Blue Card was coming into place, again at the beginning, one of the things that we were told was that people who have choices were often put off coming to the European Union because they actually perceived it as a place where they would experience racism, where they would experience xenophobia and where they would not be made welcome. Would the Commission like to comment on whether he feels that the European Union has moved on to become a more welcoming environment, or indeed whether the integration proposals that he has are going to work as part of a two-way street?

You say that sometimes there are times when it would take too long to train particular skills that we need in our economy for ourselves, and again, I agree. Also, you accept that there is a need for control rather than for uncontrolled immigration, and again I agree.  Of course, in terms of training up skills, there is an awful lot more that we need to do. I agree with all of that. But the debate that we have in the United Kingdom when we come up to the referendum on 23 June is not just about non-EU immigration, it is also about EU immigration. It is the same issue to us whether people come from Poland or Pakistan, whether they come from Austria or Australia, whether they come from Spain or Senegal.  We believe that people should be treated the same. Nobody would have argued, 40 years ago – certainly not in the UK – that we should have a system of uncontrolled immigration from the other 27 countries of the European Union, but highly controlled migration from the other 167.

A different issue is the legal and safe access of people fleeing war and seeking protection on our territory. We will prevent thousands of deaths in the Mediterranean while we fight human traffickers. We will better manage the influx of people. But we have to be serious: resettlement mechanisms only meet their objective with numbers that go against reality. And they do not replace other access instruments, such as humanitarian visas. It is clear that the success of resettlement mechanisms depends on collaboration with third countries. But also here, a warning to navigation: more funding can not be more frontloading, that is, face the present with what was destined for the future.

The Blue Card reduces work on the black market, from which profiteers only profit, contributes positively to integration and reduces discrimination against migrants. Equal treatment and equal pay is not only a way of ensuring the social integration of migrants, but generally contributes to the fight against social dumping. However, we need a single Blue Card that covers the entire European market, not the 28 countries.

From my point of view, this is progress, because just a year ago, the same Commissioner put forward the figure of 50 million. The successes of the National Front in France and the FP in Austria have already earned us 30 million fewer immigrants. Some more successes of the patriots and we will come to a much lower figure.

In this respect, in my group's position paper, I have included a number of proposals inspired on the basis of good practice from several European countries, including Germany, and which have also obtained the open support of my country's Foreign Ministry.

Mr Avromoupoulos rightly pointed out that integration and legal labour migration are two crucial elements of a holistic approach to migration.  I have two short questions on the second aspect. First of all, we know that the blue card system is not popular. In 2014, this system was used 13000 times, of which 12000 was used by Germany. What I am missing in this proposal is: what is concretely in it to make it more attractive to the other 27 countries? On the one hand, according to your proposal, we are going to oblige these countries to participate in this system, when perhaps the basic problems of the blue card have not yet been fully resolved.  My second question is linked to the need for social and economic development in Africa. It is highly skilled migrant workers who are important to rebuild society on the ground.

The Commission is taking a step towards our demands, noting that Europe can only prosper if it facilitates the mobility of knowledge and people. The legislative proposal on the amendment of the Blue Card is a good one.

For this, the EU—Turkey action plan is a crucial way to have an effective migration policy. We need to save and protect people fleeing conflict, but not all migrants are refugees. Those who do not need international protection must be returned safely. Developing tools for legal migration to Europe is also a way to combat irregular migration.

On the Blue Card, the scope remains only for highly skilled employees. This is the purpose of the Blue Card. For other skill types we have existing instruments, such as the Single Permit and the Seasonal Workers Directive. In the coming months, we will focus on making sure they are implemented properly, but we will also make a comprehensive evaluation of all existing legal migration instruments to see if there are any shortcomings.  On refugees, Mrs Valero, actually this is the only element that challenges the scope because we do allow those who have received international protection in an EU Member State to apply for the Blue Card, if, of course, they fulfil all the conditions. As you know, the rights of asylum seekers are laid down in the EU asylum legislation and they have access to the labour market no later than nine months after they submit their application. For highly skilled potential asylum seekers outside the European Union, they can simply apply for the Blue Card if they secure a job offer.  On the single scheme, how can we ever have a truly internationally competitive scheme like the United States’ Green Card if we continue to have more than 20 different systems? Let us be very clear on what we are putting on the table. Member States still decide on the volumes, and they have safeguards to protect their labour markets when there are sudden moments of high unemployment through the labour market test, as well as safeguards against abuse. An EU scheme will help to increase our competitiveness and create opportunities for more investment and jobs in the European Union. Some words about the brain drain that concerns many of you, justifiably: our proposal includes a mechanism to limit brain drain. Firstly by promoting ethical recruitment: Member States may refuse a Blue Card if an applicant comes from a sensitive sector – for example, health care in a developing country. Secondly, by promoting circular migration: a Blue Card makes it easier to go back and forth for periods of time. A well-managed policy leads to a win—win situation. It has benefits for receiving countries but also for the countries of origin, such as remittance payments and the return of migrants with new skills and networks. This will turn the brain drain into a brain gain. I hope you will agree with me that the status quo on the Blue Card was not sustainable. It had to be improved and we have been as ambitious as possible. We count on you to take this work forward now with the Council. On the integration action plan: as Claude Moraes stressed, integration is not an option. I think we all agree that it is in the ultimate economic – but also social – interest of everyone in the European Union to integrate third country nationals fully and as soon as possible. Of course, this is – and remains – a national competence, but our action plan aims to support Member States towards building more cohesive and, ultimately, stronger societies.  This is not about creating pull factors or spending money disproportionately. This is precisely about making that investment in the beginning so that the returns are bigger in the end for everyone. Building on the action plan, we will continue to mainstream the priority of integration, non—discrimination and inclusion into all relevant policy actions and areas. Finally, we will regularly review the implementation of the actions presented in this action plan and the progress achieved in Member States, identify additional actions needed for the future, and report to the Parliament and the Council.  Now allow me to say some words in Greek, answering the question put by my compatriot, Mr Chrysogonos. Mr Chrysogen, first of all I would like to thank you for your question. I said a few things earlier about the brain drain, about the brain drain. My assessment, and I mean it, is that attracting people with a high level of skills to the European Union will ultimately have beneficial effects for all of us: the European Union, the Member States, the blue card holders themselves and of course their home countries. I spoke earlier about the benefits of the European Union and of course of the Member States. I would like to take this opportunity to stress that these people – you have no doubt – will acquire new skills, improve what they already have. Have no doubt also that, as the time comes to return home, they will return better ready to contribute to the reconstruction of their countries. Many of them come from countries that have literally collapsed and disintegrated. So when that day comes, it will be an indirect contribution from Europe and it will be an investment to be present with us. I really mean this because I do believe that this whole proposal makes a positive contribution for everyone, both for Europe and for the Member States and for third countries. It will be the Member States that determine the number of skilled migrants they need and which countries are able to absorb. What we have presented today is a dynamic move forward, given the experience we have gained all this time from the migration and refugee crisis. But it was also time for Europe to open legal channels. Until a few years ago, Europe had no immigration policy, only a few nuggets scattered across various Commission Directorates. Now it is both holistic and coherent and comes to answer the current big problem under the stifling pressure of refugee and migration flows. But it has also come to create a legal framework, because in the future – I said this before – Europe will need a workforce. And no one should worry about what will happen within Europe, because a short time from now – I would like to tell you this from today – we will present a comprehensive plan to finally combat the phenomenon of unemployment. Europe is here, present, and the Member States expect a lot from us and the answer and help will have it very soon.  But the fact that Europe will need a workforce in the future everyone knows, and we are talking about too many millions, which will de facto emerge as a necessity in the future. Europe is getting old. We know that and we repeat it often in our discussions here. I wish she was able to respond on her own. But we will need a workforce and that is why today we are creating the legal environment, the legal conditions, so that we can move forward in response to the demands of the times and especially of future needs. If there were two years ago what we are presenting today, it would have been different and more effective to deal with even the migration crisis, as manifested through the flows of migrants mainly, in the first instance, and refugees later on.  I would like to think that what we are doing really meets our own debt but also your expectations, to remind us of our earlier discussions in this Chamber where you have always urged us to get to this point. And today we are pleased to be here in front of you, saying that not only have we done so, but also that we owe a great deal to the European Parliament, which has given us the impetus, the encouragement, to move forward with this result. Thank you very much for coming.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2961, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Die Präsidentin. –", "mepid": "97017", "text": "   The debate is closed.

The Commission is only now trying to open negotiations with governments in Africa and the Middle East to conclude migration agreements.

The Commission's proposals to reform the blue card will have only a limited impact in strengthening Europe's economic dynamism. This will remain insufficient as long as only highly qualified third-country nationals are targeted. On the contrary, this reform should be an opportunity to move beyond the overly restrictive approach of European policies on legal migration. We also need to align the EU's economic immigration policy with the gaps in the European labour market. Instead of the premise that we need to attract workers with high skills, it is important to target any type of skill in sectors where there is a shortage of labour and where European nationals would not respond to the call. In addition, the blue card could become a single work permit allowing free movement throughout the EU. Closing the door to this possibility would dampen our growth potential, which would be all the more damaging given the demographic challenges we face.

But I am happy to be with you already here today to share and discuss with you the key elements of our Agenda. The Skills Agenda is one of the most important initiatives on the Commission’s Work Programme this year. It will directly contribute to our promise to deliver on Jobs, Growth and Fairness. I would like to address my thanks to Parliament for your active contribution to the debate on skills: from last year’s report on ‘Creating a competitive EU labour market for the 21st century’, by Martina Dlabajová to the adoption this year of the resolution on ‘Skills policies and youth unemployment’ by Marek Plura, or the report on ‘Mobility in vocational education and training’ , by Ernest Maragall, to mention only a few of your initiatives, as well as the very useful joint hearing of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL) and the Committee on Culture and Education (CULT) in April, where I participated together with my colleague Tibor Navracsics. Skills are a pathway to prosperity. With the right skills, people are equipped for good-quality jobs and can fulfil their potential as confident, active citizens. Also, in a fast-changing global economy, skills determine Europe’s competitiveness and the capacity to drive innovation. Yet the situation in Europe calls for action. More than 70 million Europeans have poor reading, writing, numeracy and digital skills. One in four adults has not achieved an upper secondary qualification. Too many people work in jobs that do not match their talents. Women represent 60% of new graduates, but their employment rate remains below that of men. At the same time, 40% of European employers have difficulty finding people with the right skills. And too few people have the entrepreneurial skills and mindsets needed to establish their own business. Furthermore, the digital transformation is re-shaping the way we live, work, and do business and the types of skills needed. Europe faces shortages in high-level skills – you just had a discussion on that with my colleague Mr Avramopoulos – and despite good employment outcomes, vocational education and training is still regarded as a second choice by many. While national and regional labour markets and education and training systems encounter specific challenges, all Member States face similar problems. The New Skills Agenda for Europe focuses on three priority areas: improving skills levels and their labour market relevance across Europe; making skills and qualifications easier to understand and compare across borders and economic sectors; and improving forecasting and understanding of skills needs now and in the future. To step up action and not to leave anyone behind, we propose a basic skills guarantee. This is a recommendation to Member States to bring together their resources to offer low-skilled people opportunities to catch up and acquire the skills that will help them to find employment, stay in work, and improve their working situation. A revision of the European Qualifications Framework will make it easier to understand and compare skills and qualifications, and facilitate work and study mobility. We are also putting forward a ‘Blueprint’ for cooperation on skills in specific economic sectors to stimulate stakeholders to work together, to identify skills needs and identify practical solutions. Refugees and migrants come to Europe with a diversity of skill-sets that can contribute to our economies. In order to facilitate integration into the labour markets, we propose a Skills Profile Tool for Third Country Nationals to help identify and document their skills, their qualifications, and their professional experience. A red thread across our Agenda is the need to stimulate strong business-education partnerships, such as those under the European Pact for Youth. These partnerships also have a crucial role in promoting entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial mindsets. Other actions will follow over the next two years. Later this year, we will propose a revision of the Europass Framework to support the documentation of skills and qualifications and better skills intelligence. We count on your support for swift adoption when the time comes. We will also launch a ‘Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition’ to develop a large digital talent pool and ensure that individuals at all levels are equipped with adequate digital skills. For 2017, work in the pipeline includes a revision of the 2006 Key Competences Framework, proposals supporting the modernisation of vocational education and training, and an initiative on graduate tracking to improve information on how graduates progress in the labour market. European funds are there to help with the implementation of these proposals. For the period 2014-2020, there is more than EUR 27 billion of the European Social Fund available to support skills. Europe’s prosperity depends upon our most valuable asset – our people. In a fast-changing global economy, it is people’s skills which will be a motor for our competitiveness and growth. The Skills Agenda sets out how Europe will add value to Member States’ action and to mobilise actors. Together, I am sure together we can unlock Europe’s full potential.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2968, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "David Casa", "mepid": "28122", "text": "  f'isem group PPE. – Mr Sinjura President u nilqa' b'sodisfazzjon il-ħolqien tan-New Skills Guarantee li tkellmet dwaru l-Kummissarju, li ser jgħin mhux ftit sabiex jimtela l-vojt li l-Youth Guarantee i setgħetx tindirizza, u li ser jgħin biex dawk l-adulti f'livell baxx ta' snajja', sabiex jitgħallmu l-essenzjal bħall-qari, is-somom u ħiliet diġliita.

If we only look at the schools in Europe, they certainly do not meet the requirements of a digital future. As a result, we are not playing in the top league in digital competence in the world. In order to be added, we need a successful education strategy, which, in my view, consists of three core areas. This is free access to education, including the teaching of digital skills. All young people need cross-cutting skills that enable them to make informed decisions, develop initiative and build self-confidence. Apprenticeship plans must also ensure that young people have access to, use, and are not just consumers. Secondly, we need a review of education and training. More complex job and competence profiles lead to new requirements for employees. Training must also be more closely interlinked with the world of work, where social partners must be closely involved in curricula and competence strategies.  The third point is the institutionalisation of lifelong learning. In order to be able to keep up with technological development, which is getting faster and faster, and thus also to ensure the competitiveness of the European Union, we need a qualification strategy that counteracts the future shortage of skilled workers. Lifelong learning must be institutionalised, for example through a guaranteed minimum right to paid educational leave.

Indeed, we know that there is a discrepancy between qualifications and market needs, and I understand that the Commission's initiative aims to reduce this divergence. But according to a 2015 report by the European Centre for Vocational Training,  25% of workers are over-skilled for their work and 27% of workers are over-skilled and whose current work does not offer opportunities for further development.

I look forward to it all the more because it is one of the key issues that my colleagues in the ALDE faction have been advocating for a long time.  When we talk about new skills, we should always look at them with a link to the real needs of the labour market. You yourself, Commissioner, mentioned that almost 40% of companies in Europe said in the survey that they were having trouble finding employees with the required skills, including digital ones. National skills and demand mismatches could be overcome by higher labour mobility. We should therefore support it more, for example through a system of mutual recognition of qualifications or even indirectly by increasing emphasis on digital literacy and language learning. Member States should also take advantage of opportunities offered by the European Social Fund, for example, and increase the adaptability of the workforce.  It is our duty to show young people how the labour market really works and to provide them with adequate practical training during their studies. We should work together to make apprenticeships and technical education more attractive to young people. Let us pay more attention to dual \"work-based\" training, working to raise standards of education and training. New recommendations for the development of practical skills are key to the effective integration of people into the labour market. We should therefore focus in particular on better anticipating future skills and skills needs. To do this, we need to link the world of education with the labour market.

This insecurity, in turn, is reflected in the social and cultural life of European citizens. Young people are transformed into objects to be filled with skills, which have little or nothing to do with the development of civic virtues and critical spirit, identified exclusively as a function of an exasperated search for infinite economic growth. What is more, it was decided to use an instrument such as The Youth Guarantee, allocating more than one billion euros, which produced no positive results.

Therefore, this agenda for new skills does not come a day early because it offers an answer to these specific pain points.  People are always more than the diploma they hold. Everyone has his or her own backpack, his own talents. These ten initiatives must not only make it clear to themselves and to the potential employer what exactly is in that backpack, but also that backpack itself must be filled. And that has to happen throughout the career, a career that will take quite a long time for someone who starts working there today. Careers of 45 years will be no exception for my generation.

Europe-wide recognition of skills and a uniform understanding of qualifications are of paramount importance for an open Europe with a cross-border labour market. We must ensure that there is a better permeability of academic and vocational education and training. Thanks to my own professional experience at a medium-sized company, the training occupations with the concept of dual training are particularly close to my heart. I think it is right that the Commission wants to strengthen dual training. In order to achieve this, I believe that it is appropriate to exchange best practice models, in which the social partners must be involved. But I also warn that no one can guarantee successful education, and better education does not automatically lead to a secure job. The educational mission for primary education lies with the state. I believe that businesses and society can expect good basic training to be provided by the state, which leaves enough room for second chance and takes people on their way to education and does not let them down.

It was the same story 20 years ago in the mid-1990s, when 15% of our young people were unemployed and they did not have the relevant skills. It is the same story, but it is something that we really need to address. Now we have an agenda focused on it, looking at our education and training sector, which is so important.  We need to involve industry and employers in our education schemes. It is not enough for them to give their opinions and to complain that they do not have the relevant skills. They need to be involved directly in apprenticeship models and in funding apprenticeship models as well, because it is in their own interest to ensure that they work to develop employees who have the relevant skills.

Secondly, in addition to cognitive skills, cross-cutting skills are necessary, but also socio-mental skills. Thirdly, we must not only involve entrepreneurs and others in education processes, but also require them to be very involved in the absorption of prepared young people and job creation. Fourthly, there is a need to change the methods and methods of education, also much greater recognition of non-formal education than before.

What we have to do is firstly the following: we have to equip the young people of Europe with the right skills they will need to have access to the jobs of the future. We are discussing a lot about online and about the digital single market, but digital skills are the point where our whole digital agenda becomes personal. It is the point where the citizens of Europe feel that Europe does something for them. What do we have to do in concrete terms? Firstly, I believe that we have to involve youth organisations more and more strongly when we draft new policy proposals. Secondly, I think that digital literacy has to become one of the core skills acquired from an early age and also later perfected throughout one's life. The education systems at national level have to be adapted to this. The Member States have to make sure that their education systems respond to the needs of the market and that we do not lose out in terms of global competitiveness.

But let me add this: I am very happy that we agree on the necessity and the importance of a Skills Agenda. Of course improving skills must go hand in hand with macroeconomic politics to stimulate job creation. The two are mutually reinforcing. The European fund for Strategic Investments is one flagship action which is helping us to do just that, injecting investment into the real economy to create more and good quality jobs.  And let me repeat what I said already in the joint committee meeting last April: employability is not a dirty word. Education and training must prepare young people to participate fully in society and to be an active citizen, and help them to acquire transversal skills, but people rightly expect that their education and training will also help them to get a good job. Good basic skills, having a good basis to build upon for lifelong learning, is therefore in the interest of both the economy and the individual fulfilment of every person.  Our Skills Agenda is an agenda for all. It is for young and old, for people in education, in unemployment, inactive people and people in work. The success of the Skills Agenda will depend on the commitment and the active engagement of many players, Member States first and foremost, as well as businesses and trade unions, education and training institutions, workers, learners and many others.

In particular, in countries affected by violent fiscal policy, unemployment rates exceed 20%.

It is due to the structure of the EU and the Eurozone. It is due to the merch austerity and poverty that lead to underconsumption. It is due to the unequal distribution of wealth generated in the Union, with the countries of the South leading the way in unemployment, while Germany with huge trade surpluses has an unemployment rate of 4.5%.

Our relationship has led to results that are mutually beneficial for both sides, particularly in trade, investment and development. The European Union is the first destination for Bangladesh exports. A combination of substantial EU investments in Bangladesh with EU development assistance has certainly contributed to Bangladesh economic growth and to its achievements in terms of poverty reduction and reaching the Millennium Development Goals.  The relationship is still growing. The EU and Bangladesh continue addressing together new challenges, such as contributing to the sustainability of the Bangladesh ready-made garment industry, a very important topic I think, through the Sustainability Compact and, more recently, addressing comprehensively migration and mobility.  In this context, the first European Union-Bangladesh dialogue on migration management was held in Dhaka on 5 April 2016. The most important policy objectives in Bangladesh are possibly to become a middle-income country by 2021 and therefore to continue lifting Bangladeshi people out of poverty, which I think has to be the first priority. Achieving this very ambitious target will need the involvement and determination of all Bangladeshi citizens and institutions, as well as the support of Bangladesh international partners. The worrying political evolution in Bangladesh could be very detrimental in this respect and since the controversial January 2014 elections, boycotted by the opposition and criticised by the international community, the political, human rights and security situation in the country has unfortunately steadily deteriorated. The resolutions on Bangladesh adopted by the European Parliament in the last two years cover these 2014 elections, human rights violations and freedom of expression. High Representative Federica Mogherini, her spokespersons and the European Union Heads of Mission have also issued statements on these and other issues such as the death penalty and the recent brutal killings, even yesterday, of independent thinkers and activists. This is a very worrying situation. These resolutions and statements over the last couple of years track and summarise very well a growing collective concern in the European Union about the political evolution in Bangladesh.  We think it is important that an overall new social and political consensus will need to be built in Bangladesh for democracy, human rights, freedom of expression and political liberties to be fully restored, promoted and protected in the country. It is time to put an end to the arbitrary arrest and harassment of opposition leaders, to restore tolerance and to open spaces for public political debate. It is also time to ensure freedom of expression as a fundamental human right and to promote respect. It is also essential to ensure the protection and safety of all citizens. Especially the brutal murders and horrifying attacks on citizens must cease, and of course investigations into these killings need to take place, and those responsible have to be brought to justice. It is now time for the Government of Bangladesh and democratic political parties together to engage in real dialogue for the country’s stability, democracy and economic development.  The European Union needs a Bangladesh where core universal human rights values are upheld. I have spoken already about social-economic rights: they have to be effectively protected; but of course where institutions respect the rule of law and fully ensure protection and safety of all citizens, priority must be placed on the promotion of tolerance and freedom of expression. Of course the Government of Bangladesh has a primary role in this perspective. We will continue to follow closely the situation and address our concerns at our regular dialogue with the Government of Bangladesh.

I reiterate, therefore, the call that our Parliament already made in November 2015 to the Bangladeshi authorities to investigate these crimes independently and transparently, so that the culprits are identified and punished. The Dhaka authorities have already said that they will have zero tolerance for such atrocities, that they will improve security and that they have begun investigating some of the crimes committed. All these crimes need to be investigated and we need to see results.

Three years after the signing of the Sustainability Pact we consider some commitments made by the Government of Bangladesh to be positive. However, much more needs to be done in our opinion.  For example, the government must comply with ILO Convention 87, it must extend the application of the entire Labour Law to industrial free zones for export and must also, of course, continue with the fight against corruption and enforcement of compliance with labour standards.  And I end up, Mr President, hoping that this Pact, resulting from the commitment and goodwill of many international, European, independent countries and bangladeshi companies, will be an example for improving working conditions in other countries and for more effective and also coordinated international community action.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3029, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Josef Weidenholzer (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "111014", "text": "   Mr President, I would like to thank the The situation in Bangladesh is very worrying and the risk of civil war can no longer be ruled out.

On behalf of the Council, I would like to offer my condolences to the families and to the next of kin. Obviously for us it is also extremely important that those who are responsible for this are brought to justice. Let me say a few words about the input that you have brought to the debate tonight. I think we are all quite conscious of the fact that Bangladesh is an enormously complex and extremely vulnerable country; in terms of environmental issues it is the most vulnerable country in the world. It is the most densely populated country in the world, and it is a country that has different aspects.  On the one hand, it has made some progress in reaching the sustainable development goals, which is actually amazing. If you look at the rise of civil society in Bangladesh we have seen that, through very important progress made through civil society in cooperation with the government, enrolment in primary education is now close to 100%. At the same time, we see a reduction in poverty, and maternal mortality has declined by 40% in nine years. That is the positive news. But at the same time, the Council joins you today in looking at some of the very negative developments that we have seen.  First of all, I think the shrinking space for the democratic and secular opposition comes at a par with all the issues that you have mentioned – the multiplication of terrorist attacks, targeting bloggers, religious minorities – including Christians, I would say – foreigners and law enforcement officers. The most brutal murders included a student, a professor, two LGTBI activists, a policeman and a security guard, a Hindu tailor, the wife of a police officer, a Christian grocer and a Buddhist monk.  We are talking about a rise in these kinds of very violent human rights violations, and we see at the same time a limiting of political space for political opposition, as well as for civil society. It obviously worries the Council, as it does you, and I want to say that beyond all kinds of declarations we give out regularly – and I can give you most of the statements that we have given out in the last couple of months – it is not enough to make statements. All these statements refer to the facts that you have been putting forward, including the violence and the need for justice. It is also important that we work on countering, first of all, the issues that are behind this, including projects to counter violent extremism and to assist in deradicalisation. We will continue, and I will come back to that in a second, this important element in our human rights instruments. We are very worried about the rise of that. It is also very important for the Government of Bangladesh to acknowledge the risks of this radicalism, including possibly the risks posed by ISIS. Therefore, and this was also in answer to some of the questions, the dialogue in the context of the United Nations that some of you have mentioned is extremely important. It is also important that our delegations reach out not only through projects in these areas, but also in the bilateral meeting at the ASEM Summit, to the Government of Bangladesh on these very disturbing developments.  When we talk about human rights, we should talk about the fact that the human rights situation is steadily deteriorating, mainly at the expense of the most vulnerable segments of the population of Bangladesh. Your appeal should be communicated; the response by law enforcement agencies seems at best too slow and inadequate, for example in the most important and iconic cases, the horrible rape and assassination of a 19-year-old female student in the military cantonment of Comilla, which still remains unexplained.  I wanted to mention, in the context of this complex situation in Bangladesh, the Sustainability Compact, especially in Bangladesh, but also in other countries. We have to talk about human rights in the broader sense of the word, including the social-economic rights and the role of unions and so on and so forth. Following the Rana Plaza collapse where everybody was extremely horrified – and this was already more than three years ago – over 1 100 people were killed and thousands injured. The Sustainability Compact was agreed between the government and the European Union, the United States and the ILO, with commitments on three interlinked pillars in the ready-made garment industry. I would like to support all of you who have said that this is not only a compact that should remain on paper, but needs operationalisation and implementation, as well as the responsiblisation of the business sector in order to ensure that it actually works.  It requires some elements. First, respect for labour rights, in particular freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining; I think that includes the important role of the unions. Second, the structural integrity of factory buildings and occupational safety and health; I think we should also support where we can – bilaterally but also in the context of the European Union – the Government of Bangladesh and others in ensuring this. Then, of course, responsible business conduct is absolutely important. The donors fund the ready-made garment industry programme in the context of remediation measures. That goes up to USD 200 million, so it is not small fry, so to speak. Canada has recently also joined as a partner. We recognise the progress made by Bangladesh, but of course, and I think that was correctly mentioned, the need is there for the government to facilitate trade unions’ registration, to upgrade the directorate of labour with additional staff and resources, and to ensure that the legal framework is also applicable in the export processing zones, protecting freedom of association and collective bargaining.  I think these are important points. What do we have as instruments? First of all, we have the dialogue with the Government of Bangladesh, and I think it should focus especially on these areas. Continuing progress in the SDGs, at the same time making it apparent that we are worried about a deterioration in the political space and the degradation of the security situation. We must also see where we can assist, because this is a major issue. It is the responsibility of all actors, including the government first and foremost, but also other actors – terrorist groups, responsible and irresponsible political parties – to play their role in ensuring that this political degradation does not continue. Certainly, through our European Union assistance –and we have development assistance on the DCI up to EUR 690 million to ensure that our programmes are up to date as regards the present situation and developments. There was one question on sanctions. I am not such a great fan of sanctions towards Bangladesh at this point, speaking obviously also on behalf of the European Council. I think we have three lines of action now in the context of what I have just said regarding the SDGs, the human rights dialogue and political dialogue on the critical issue we just discussed, and the Compact. That would be better than formally suspending trade cooperation negotiations. That would most likely be detrimental and hardly facilitate any improvement in the political, human rights and security situation in Bangladesh.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3043, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Presidente. –", "mepid": "96864", "text": "  The debate is closed.

If we do this tomorrow, given that a number of Member States have already ratified, it will be possible for this agreement to enter into force this year. We are also voting – and this is the easiest thing – on the Croatia Protocol, which is linked to it, as well as on our resolution. We should strengthen our bilateral relations because it is in the common interest. I also believe that these relations can be particularly strengthened if the Philippines continues on its path to democracy and respect for fundamental rights. Then this relationship can be formalized much more. The Philippines, with over 100 million inhabitants in the heart of Southeast Asia, is a major and important political and economic partner for us. The Philippines is located on the important international shipping route and the air navigation route in the South China Sea, and due to the territorial discussions that are taking place there, this is an important issue where we need a stakeholder for a peaceful solution. That is why it makes sense to develop good relations with the Philippines. The Philippines is also involved in these territorial disputes in the South China Sea. China's aggressive methods in the waters under discussion are of great importance and are of great concern in the international world. I would like to renew our appeal here that this dispute should be resolved peacefully and on the basis of international law. Nor must freedom of navigation be violated. I would also like to express and encourage and encourage the partners to seek a peaceful solution and to find closer cooperation here, including in the exploration of resources. The Philippines is important in the fight against international terrorism. The military groups in the southern Philippines are in close contact with regional Southeast Asian and international terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda and ISIS. It is necessary to jointly counter the propaganda of these international organisations. I believe that the Mindanao peace process and the March 2014 agreement for a peace agreement should be respected and that work must continue to ensure that the Bangsamoro Basic Law is finally adopted in the new Philippine Parliament. The new President of the Philippines will take office on 30 July. He has made some harsh remarks that have led to discussions. The hardline zero-tolerance policy he has expressed also gives rise to some concerns about how to proceed with the development of fundamental rights. But there are also well-founded positions and views that he will continue the Mindanao peace process and that we attach great importance to it. The European Union gave GSP+ trade preferences to the Philippines last December. This benefits the Philippine economy and also Europe. This could also be an example for other ASEAN countries that should try to ratify and advance, like the Philippines, core international conventions on human rights and labour rights, better the environment and good governance. This should certainly be taken as an example and recognition that this is a precondition for GSP+ status. If this framework agreement is a success, we in the European Union should strive to negotiate a free trade agreement with the Philippines in the foreseeable future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3048, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Bert Koenders", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – I would like to thank also very much Elmar Brok for his report and for his presentation tonight. I agree with his view and the importance he attaches to strengthening and cementing the relationship with the Philippines. The Philippines is sometimes, in my view, underestimated as to how important that country is. It is far away, but it is a key partner for the European Union. We have extensive trade contacts; it is an important country, as you mentioned, because of its strategic location in Southeast Asia. It is a country which has a very complex situation both internally and externally – you mentioned and correctly so the importance of the Mindanao peace process and the need to underpin this peace agreement, to invest in it, and to hope also that it will lead to further legislation in the Philippines itself. We have a relationship – the Philippines and the European Union – as you know, grounded in a very long history and strong mutual interests. This year we celebrate the 25th anniversary of the European Union-Philippines partnership. Over the last quarter century our ties have grown into a partnership with many different elements, including trade development, I think probably at its core, but also increasingly encompassing political and security cooperation and with – which I think is important – extensive people—to—people contact. Of course many of us know this because actually the Philippines is a country which exports labour and we have to make sure that the way that the labour is exported also in Europe is respected in terms of human rights. The new agreement that you were mentioning, Mr Brok, will provide political momentum – I hope in a modern and comprehensive framework, which will allow this relationship to grow even further over the coming decades, in particular when it comes to politics and political ties. The 11 March statement on behalf of the European Union on recent developments in the South China Sea, as well as the European Union’s continued support to the important Mindanao peace process has also been welcomed by the Philippines. I think the successful conclusion of that peace process has at least the potential to deliver an important peace dividend in the fight against radicalisation. Some groups, and in particular Abu Sayyaf, have claimed allegiance to ISIS and, of course, the European Union wishes to work closely with the Philippines in the most intelligent way possible to see how the Philippine Government can deal effectively with this internal threat. Just to give an example on these political ties that we are working on, this cementing as you mentioned it, the Philippines have accepted to co-chair together us, an ASEAN regional forum on the prevention of violent extremism, in 2016/17, so that we can work on different parts of this – not only the repressive part but also on the prevention and the de—radicalisation part. The entry into force of the PCA is expected to be followed by the conclusion of a free trade agreement in the coming years. It is a good step. The first round of negotiations on the FTA took place in a good atmosphere. Since December 2014, GSP+ is granting better access to the European Union market for the Philippines, based on its commitment – and I think that is important – to implement core international conventions on human and labour rights, sustainable development and good governance.  The positive effects of the GSP+ are seen in growing Philippine exports to Europe. The first report on this was presented to you in January, as well as your report, Mr Brok, and it points out that work still needs to be done, especially in the area of UN human rights conventions, referred to in the GSP+ decision. I think, as you mentioned – and we see it also in the report – that refers specifically to judicial reform and to issues such as impunity and extrajudicial killings. These issues were already raised by you, correctly so, in a June 2012 EP resolution on cases of impunity in the Philippines.  Air transport is another crucial area for our relations with the Philippines as it links people cultures and businesses. I am pleased to announce the expected signature in the near future of a horizontal agreement on air services between us and the Philippines. I think this will bring existing bilateral air services agreements between the Philippines and the EU Member States into conformity with European Union law.  Then development: the Philippines is also a country with a lot of inequality. There are a lot of development issues, including on the area of sustainable development goals. We have a multiannual indicative programme covering the period 2014 to 2020 amounting to EUR 325 million; that represents a pretty big increase – 2.5 times compared to the previous period. I think it is important now that we work together with the Philippines chairmanship of ASEAN next year, and I think the Philippines have been extremely important to us in their willingness to engage on our aspirations to join the East Asia Summit. Of course, it is important to note and to say something, and Mr Brok you did this as well in the general elections that took place on 9 May. First of all, voter turnout was high; many people voted. The result was clear and the outcome is largely thanks also to the electoral commission of the Philippines and to the cooperation of the outgoing Aquino administration. I am aware, as you are, of a number of statements made during and after the election campaign by the winning candidate, but also by others, and notably the stated intention to reintroduce the death penalty. I can assure you that the European Union is determined to uphold the values of democracy, rule of law and human rights in its relationship with the Philippines. We are looking forward to engaging with the new administration constructively on all issues; we have to judge the new administration by their deeds. I intend to learn about the policy orientations of the future administration as soon as possible, ideally in the margins of the Asia—Europe meeting which will take place on 15 July – two weeks after the inauguration of the President-elect, Roberto Duterte.  To conclude, Mr President, the ratification of the PCA will provide a platform for increased cooperation and institutionalised contacts across the board of our relationship, including through all these elements: development, trade GSP+, labour rights and a dialogue on human rights.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3049, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Werner Langen", "mepid": "1928", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Mr President, I would like to thank the president for his work I would like to join the two previous speakers in thanking Mr Brok for this very good report and the Minister for analysing the outstanding problems.

This approval of the agreement confirms the impetus that we Europeans want to give to trade and its freedom, including as an opportunity for the development of democracy and human rights, decisive conditions for concluding any trade agreement.  However, the particular significance of this agreement is that the proposal covers a hugely expanding part of the world. South-East Asia has countries that grow much more than Europe grows and has young, active and voracious populations of life. Among these countries are the Philippines: a large and beautiful land, with an ancient history and with a traditional relationship with the West. The Philippines, like so many other countries, still has serious problems of crime, corruption and abuse by the security forces, but we must not forget that they are a great democracy, with a Constitution that defends the fundamental principles of freedom and respect for people. That is why the references, which we have also raised with regard to improving human rights, poverty and climate change, are part of a desire for cooperation, support and friendship with the Philippines, and are not destructive.

Secondly, our transatlantic partnership is at stake as a geopolitical factor. And, three, the normative international legal order is equally at stake for the EU.  The European Parliament's resolution is also clear on the sticking points of the conflict situation in the South China Sea. With its refusal of international arbitration and a policy of fait accompli, including military facts on the ground, Beijing is directly addressed.  Fortunately, however, the resolution does not allow for this observation. It calls for an effective common code of conduct for the South China Sea.

Furthermore, I would also like to stress how inappropriate it is for us to insert ourselves uncritically into the tensions in the South China Sea, the frontier of the confrontation between China and the United States, also exemplified by the signing of the TPP.

I have listened carefully to most of your points, actually to all of your points, and taken good note of your expectations and concerns regarding the implementation of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA), and beyond that regarding the overall relationship between the European Union and the Philippines. I think from this debate with you that we both share a common desire to further develop European Union-Philippines relations, but to continue to ensure that this deepening remains based on our global common values and interests. You have referred to different issues there and I think they are around the issue of human rights, free and fair trade, the situation in the Chinese Sea and the issue of the peace process in the Philippines. Let me start with the issue of the human rights situation. Let me remove all kinds of worries that this would remain unmonitored, so to speak. The EU’s assessment of the human rights situation in the Philippines has been described, notably in the report on the generalised scheme of preferences covering 2014—2015 – submitted to you in January 2016 – and I think we are planning to continue to judge compliance with the United Nations human rights conventions, referred to obviously in the GSP+ decision, and the EU’s GoJust programme will provide a vehicle to strengthen institutional capacities so that we do not only monitor but also strengthen the capacity and the work of the National Human Rights Commission in the Philippines.  In 2017, the universal periodic review will look at the implementation of the international commitments made by the Philippines while under the PCA, as you know, a human rights dialogue will be established. On the FTA negotiations themselves: they were launched at the end of last year. We had a first round in May 2016 and we hope to conclude an agreement that covers a broad range of issues. As you know, in the ASEAN region the Philippines are very important to us; I think they are the fifth, and probably soon the fourth, largest economy and the second biggest market. The trade in services between the European Union and the Philippines was worth also substantial figures, over three billion in 2014. The European Union is also the largest investor, foreign investor, in the Philippines. That is sometimes not known. People think it is the United States; no, it is the European Union. Now I think the issues surrounding unfair competition are very important and should be addressed, obviously, in the FTA, in negotiations. There will be a dedicated specific trade sustainability impact assessment for the bilateral FTA that will incorporate many issues, including this one, but also human rights dimensions, as well as impact assessment and sustainability impact assessments. I think it is important to say that. Then you were all talking about the external and internal strategic situation in the Philippines and outside the Philippines. First of all, the issue of the country’s stands on the South China Sea and the Permanent Arbitration Court. Let me just say what the European Union’s position is. As you know, probably, we have already highlighted, in the EU-28 statement of 11 March 2016 on recent developments in the South China Sea, our principal position on the need to maintain the rule of law, to settle disputes peacefully without recourse to a threat or use of force and to abstain from unilateral actions which could increase the tensions. These are the three elements of the Council’s position on this.  Of course, concerning the sovereignty issues themselves, we have no position; we do not take a position. The European Union is a contracting party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and we have really full confidence in the proceedings underway and are looking forward to the Tribunal rendering its work public this summer. A negotiated solution on the code of conduct between China and ASEAN, underway for quite some time, supported by confidence-building measures, is the best solution, and we encourage ASEAN and the Philippines to continue on this path. Let me mention in conclusion the importance of the internal peace processes in the Philippines. I think this will be one of the yardsticks, especially for the people of the Philippines: to what extent also the new incoming administration will be able to make progress in peace negotiations both in Mindanao and with the NPA. We will of course promote this. We will support that. I will not go into all the details of these negotiations, because of the time, but do realise and know that European Union support for Mindanao is also part of the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace programme – for instance the EU’s support for implementation of the comprehensive agreement on Bangsamoro, which is a substantial programme of over EUR 5 million, implementation of which started in August 2015.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3063, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Przewodniczący. –", "mepid": "28372", "text": "  I close the debate.

We all know as well that there have been very serious concerns and differences in the past over certain aspects of US counterterrorism policies, and the European Union has engaged with the United States on these issues for many years – on many issues, from waterboarding to rendition, all kinds of issues that run counter to international human rights standards. This dialogue has enabled us to raise a range of issues and serious concerns that we have with the United States on this issue. It is important to highlight – we are now in 2016 – that President Obama formally ended the CIA programme within days of taking up office, and that was a very crucial decision. At the time, through an executive order, he prohibited any form of torture or ill-treatment, as well as so-called ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’ and secret detention.  We share the views expressed by President Obama at the time that these techniques are against our values and they do not serve the fight against terrorism. The Council has stated repeatedly that the fight against terrorism has to take place in full respect of international law, international humanitarian law and refugee law. That was true at the time and it is still true today. We can only tackle terrorism if we stay true to our core values and the European Union condemns all forms of torture and other ill—treatment under any circumstances and works towards their prevention and eradication within the European Union and worldwide as a priority of its human rights policy. Now the programme that was referred to in the questions was stopped many years ago, and President Obama has brought US counterterrorism policies much closer to the approach we have here in the European Union, including the prohibition of what were called – as a euphemism, I am afraid – ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’ and the strong use of the criminal justice system. Article 4 of the EU Treaty states clearly that national security remains the sole responsibility of each Member State. This means that the work of Member States’ intelligence agencies is outside the scope of the competence of the European Union and its institutions. Therefore, I understand some of your concerns that the Council has not given follow-up to the recommendations that are included in your resolution for the simple reason that the Council does not have the competence to do so according to the European Union Treaty.  Is that a satisfactory situation? The answer is obviously a ‘no’. Personally, as a European, I am ashamed that these practices in the past took place on European territory. I want to express on behalf of the Council that same shame today, but the Council has to act within the competences that are conferred on it by the Treaty. But this is not the end of the story, and I am sure that the Commissioner will also go into some of the aspects regarding her competence. It does not mean that the activities of individual Member States that take part in unlawful activities are without scrutiny. EU Member States are bound by the European Convention on Human Rights and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.  The counterterrorism actions of Member States, including alleged involvement in the CIA secret flights, are reviewed by the European Court of Human Rights. In the past, the Court has condemned the practice of illegal renditions on European territory in at least one verdict. Other inquiries are still pending so there is a solid judicial framework. The Council wants to underline the importance of this solid judicial framework from a political point of view, leaving at the same time the judgment to the courts, as it should.  Moving forward, it is important to continue to ensure that counterterrorism policies fully respect human rights, both at the European Union and Member State levels.

This Parliament has repeatedly condemned the CIA’s secret detention and extraordinary rendition programme which resulted in multiple human rights violations, including the use of torture and other inhumane and degrading treatment, abduction, secret detention, detention without trial and violations of the non-refoulement principle.  It is absolutely clear that, despite their particular nature, policies of national security and counter-terrorism are not exempt from the principle of accountability, and there can be no impunity for violations of international and human rights law. Accountability for extraordinary renditions, abductions, illegal secret detentions and torture is essential in order to protect and promote human rights effectively in the international, internal and external policies of the EU and to ensure legitimate and effective security policies based on the rule of law.  This Parliament has repeatedly called for a full investigation into the collaboration of EU Member States with the CIA’s secret detention and extraordinary rendition programme, for its recommendations to be followed up, for the examination of new elements that might emerge, and for its rights of inquiry to be fully made use of and developed. The report by the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has revealed facts that reinforce allegations that a number of EU Member States, the authorities and the officials and agents of their security and intelligence services, were complicit in the CIA’s secret detention and extraordinary rendition programme, sometimes through corrupt means based on substantial amounts of money provided by the CIA in exchange for their cooperation. The report by the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence rebuts CIA claims that torture revealed information that could not have been collected through traditional non—violent interrogation techniques. The climate of impunity regarding the CIA programme has enabled the continuation of fundamental rights violations as further revealed by the mass surveillance programmes of the US National Security Agency and secret services of various EU Member States. The US must investigate and prosecute the multiple human rights violations resulting from the CIA rendition and secret detention programmes, and cooperate with all requests from EU Member States for information, extradition or effective remedies for victims in connection with the CIA programme.  EU Member States must investigate the allegations that there were secret prisons on their territory where people were held under the CIA programme, and prosecute those involved in the operations, taking into account all the new evidence that has come to light. Member States must investigate fully recent allegations that illegal detention, rendition and torture took place on their territory, and prosecute those responsible.  We expressed our concerns regarding the obstacles encountered by national parliamentary and judicial investigations into Member States’ involvement in the CIA programme, the abuse of state secrecy and the undue classification of documents, resulting in the termination of criminal proceedings and leading to the de facto impunity of perpetrations of human rights violations. We therefore ask the Council if it has apologised for the breaching of the principle of sincere cooperation between the Union institutions, as enshrined in the Treaties, when it incorrectly attempted to persuade Parliament to accept deliberately shortened versions of the minutes of the meetings of the Council working parties on public international law and transatlantic relations with senior US officials. Did the Council issue a declaration acknowledging Member States’ involvement in the CIA programme and the difficulties encountered by Member States in the context of the inquiry? Did the Council give its full support to truth finding and accountability processes in the Member States? Did the Council hold hearings with relevant EU security agencies to clarify their knowledge of  [microphone momentarily switched off] a programme and the EU’s response?  (The President asked the speaker to speak more slowly) Did the Council propose safeguards so as to guarantee respect for human rights and intelligence sharing, as well as strict limit delimitation of roles between intelligence and law enforcement activities? All these questions are of the utmost importance, as well as the question to the Commission as to whether the Commission has put forward proposals for developing arrangements for democratic oversight of cross-border intelligence activities in the context of EU counter—terrorism policies.

The practices referred to in the report of the US Senate on the CIA detention and interrogation programme constitute serious violations of fundamental rights. The fight against terrorism cannot justify unlawful arrest, arbitrary detention, torture or other ill-treatment. However, I also need to note that national security is outside the remit of Commission competence. The Treaty does not give the Commission any competence to lead investigations into the actions of national intelligence and security services. Moreover, the Charter of Fundamental Rights only applies where the Member States are implementing EU law.  Finally, the relevant facts occurred before the Member States in question acceded to the EU. This notwithstanding, the Commission has consistently stressed since that all Member States concerned have to conduct in-depth, independent and impartial investigations to establish the facts. They should establish responsibilities and enable the victims to obtain compensation for damages. This is a positive obligation which derives from the European Convention on Human Rights and this has been recalled recently by the European Court of Human Rights. When it comes to asylum and judicial cooperation, at the time of the execution of the CIA programme there were no EU provisions applicable to judicial cooperation between the EU and the United States. The two agreements with the United States, one on extradition and the other on mutual legal assistance, entered into force on 1 February 2010. They clarify and unify the legal framework of judicial cooperation in criminal matters with the United States. Likewise, at the time there were no EU provisions for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees, nor were there any EU provisions applicable to procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status. Directives 2004/83/EC and 2005/85/EC entered into force and were transposed after these events. Within the remit of EU law, the EU’s and the Member States’ actions against terrorism must always comply with fundamental rights standards. The EU-US agreements on extradition and judicial cooperation, as well as other relevant EU legislation against terrorism, must be implemented and applied in a manner fully compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3068, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Roberta Metsola", "mepid": "118859", "text": "  f'isem group PPE. – Sur President, aħna u nagħmlu l-ġlieda tagħna kontra t-terroriżmu m'għandna ninsew qatt x'inhi l-istampa l-kbira u għalhekk x'inhuma l-ganiħjiet ġenerali tagħna li qed niddefendu.

A US Senate report revealed that the CIA used methods of brutally interrogating and torturing people on European soil after the September 11 attacks. European governments must realise that this is not just a disgrace, but a serious violation of fundamental rights and European values. New evidence is still coming to the day. We visited Romania with the LIBE Committee delegation last autumn, but the authorities refused to allow us to enter the building of the alleged detention.  It was different before in Lithuania. It is precisely the European Parliament's report on this mission that has made a strong contribution to the disclosure of certain secrets. Crucially, as mentioned above, the publication of the US Senate report was crucial. It not only revealed the scale of the crimes, but also that torture is ineffective in the fight against terrorism.  Under international law, there can be no excuse for such acts. And we need to show that we are serious in order to judge those responsible. It was the most systematic violation of human rights and humanitarian law since The Second World War on European soil. Individual European governments have not completed detailed investigations into alleged involvement, let alone taking action against those responsible or at least taking moral responsibility.  It's disappointing that only the Hollywood film industry has managed to get to the classified information from the Senate torture report. While civil society, NGOs and even supporters of detainees have not achieved this. Dozens of people remain in Guantanamo, with no charges or legal proceedings.  Investigations in individual Member States must continue in order to determine the degree of involvement. These violations will never go away, and no carpet is big enough to sweep them under it.

However, I would like to say frankly that I have some doubts about how this matter is to be present in the European Parliament. Firstly, as the Minister representing the Presidency said, the United States has closed a programme that could be harshly criticised and which is likely to be the subject of further research. Commissioner Jurova says that at that time there was no European Union instrumentation, there were no legal agreements, there were no obligations. The Presidency reminds me, and I also want to remind you, that the issue of national security is in the area of accountability of the Member States, and that is where the procedures for establishing these facts should take place. This is a question of sovereign decisions by these countries.  The European Parliament has every right to appeal to the public, to mobilise public opinion, but does it have the right to conduct investigations? I think that, on the basis of the Treaties, this can be the case for the European institutions themselves, not the Member States. So there is a need for some rationality in action.  No one can pass indifferently to the facts of the use of uncivilized methods, against torture. However, there are no terrorists in this discussion. That is what I would like to ask: why are there no terrorists in this discussion? They are the ones who want to destroy our civilization.

We can all talk about whether the legal framework was in place at the time or whether it is a matter of national sovereignty, but actually I get the feeling that the Council and the Member States are hiding behind legalistic arguments. If it is true, as Minister Koenders says, that national security is a purely national matter then I would like to understand why it was that the Member State governments back in, I believe, October 2001 collectively decided to allow CIA flights in European airspace.  They collectively decided that, but now they are hiding behind the argument that it is a national matter. When it is about accountability and about responsibility, all of a sudden it is a national matter. No, I think that if the governments at the time had the courage to take that decision collectively, then they should now be accountable and responsible collectively as well, and not hide behind these arguments.  Then you say, Minister Koenders, but we have the judiciary and we have a solid judicial framework. Well, I actually observed that Member State governments of different colours (irrespective of the colour, I might say) have gone out of their way to frustrate judicial investigations and prosecutions. They have tried everything in their power to stop those processes.  You mentioned the word ‘shame’. I very much agree with you.

The United States, the European Union and its governments, which are responsible, have been left and left undisturbed. The committees set up were literally to wash away the imperialists' responsibilities.  It goes a long way to projecting the European Union as a defender of human rights, at the same time as calling for strengthening so-called counter-terrorism cooperation with the United States, in the name of which you are carrying out imperialist wars and torture. Repressive mechanisms of the United States, the European Union, NATO and agencies such as the C.I.A., the Euro army, the CFSP, Europol, the new border guard-coast guard are working closely together to hit the popular movement to suppress refugees and migrants. They compete in state and industrial espionage for the profits of their monopolies. They themselves financed the repulsive action of mechanisms such as the Islamic State.

Worse, that cooperation was paid for with large sums of money, as the US Senate Intelligence Committee of December 2015 reveals. Even worse, impunity has been granted by EU states to those responsible for these crimes. In Italy, for instance, state secrecy was used to block the judiciary and, as a result, innocent, low—level officers were convicted, while top culprits are protected. Italy now wants to put in jail the Portuguese American, Sabrina de Sousa, a former CIA officer who was tried in absentia and never given the chance to prove her denial of any involvement. Even the victim of torture and kidnapping in that case, Mr Abu Omar, the imam of Milan, has stated that she is only a scapegoat.

I have said also in the first part of my declaration what the view of the Council is, ranging from the way we look at the policies of President Obama to correcting what has happened before, including the so-called enhanced interrogation techniques, secret detention and the like. Secondly, I have mentioned also the fact that we have a certain competence. While I do respect, certainly, the sharp oppositions being put against the Council tonight, I think by Ms in ‘t Veld, I do not understand that now all at once the Council collectively is responsible for this.

The only declaration that has been made was after 9/11 to cooperate, as all of us did, with the United States in the fight against terror.

In some countries investigations are continuing, in others they are stopping, elsewhere they are not even being launched. We have seen, in fact, that the study by the ad hoc committee of the American Senate has not led to any kind of assumption of responsibility on the part of the UNITED States, while in Europe, despite the recognition of violations of fundamental rights and cases of torture, much remains to be done with the investigations and the handing over of those responsible to justice.

Firstly, in order to draw attention to the importance of the development of the space industry for the whole of Europe. Secondly, with a call for long-term financial guarantees. Thirdly, with an attempt to promote what has already been done, what has already been done, and I would remind you that this is the only civilian system in the world, not a military system, as in the case of Russia, China or the United States. Fourthly, it is also an initiative to build a number of different mechanisms to support tasks for Galileo and Copernicus in the area of security in general. I would like to emphasise – security in general, not military tasks. Fifthly, I was very keen to emphasise the importance of systems for virtually all economic areas. There is agriculture, and infrastructure, and connectivity, and energy, but of course also educational tasks or science tasks.  What is important, of course, is the recommendations themselves. I will not present the report because it has been sent to you. On the other hand, my recommendations stem primarily from the conviction that the development and financing of space industry and technologies is one of the most important guarantors of Europe's economic success, as well as the improvement of the quality of services and the building of effective security systems – as I mentioned earlier – as well as the strengthening of this element, which President Juncker often speaks of– a creative, initiativeal, strong Europe.  What is important in these systems is also to ensure that the most important, most significant threats that exist at present are controlled. They are very different – they are both climate threats, that is, those that are associated with natural disasters, and terrorist ones, that is, man-made with complete premeditation, as well as special events and failures, for example in energy areas. It is also important that space systems and technology provide an opportunity to react quickly to completely new phenomena, such as the current difficulty of dealing with drones, which are commonly used by individuals, by individuals, and which pose serious risks, for example in air traffic, as well as terrorist threats. At the end of this preliminary speech, I would like to thank Mr Marinescu, who prepared, on behalf of the ITRE Committee, an assistive opinion in which he drew attention to elements relating primarily to the economy. I would also like to thank those colleagues who have tabled a total of more than two hundred different amendments, which in fact improve the report itself and draw attention to a number of other elements which, because of its limited scope, could not be included in the original version.

I hope that you will be able to shape the governance of these programmes and bring the European agencies together with the Commission and industry, and at the same time I would like to make you a proposal.

I want to thank, in particular, the Foreign Affairs Committee for its work on space capabilities for European security and defence that was coordinated by Mr Zdrojewski, with input from Mr Marinescu who represented the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.  I have to say that this debate is timely as we are now preparing the space strategy for Europe that will be presented and adopted in the autumn of this year. This is also timely because these are challenging – but really exciting – times for space in the world and in Europe. Europe is today the second biggest player in space. Space is crucial for security and defence, but it also generates an important spill-over effect in many other sectors, enabling business development, jobs creation and growth. Of course, things are changing as the global context is evolving fast, competition is building up and the market is increasingly driven by the private sector. European companies need a market large enough to sell their products, yet this is not always the case, of course, today. Our strategic assets such as critical technologies components and systems are really crucially important here. Despite its increase, the budget available for space remains small compared to our competitors. We have to face these challenges together. Europe cannot afford to treat it as ‘business as usual’ because competitors and partners are really moving fast. This is why the Commission announced its intention to work towards the new space strategy for Europe, and we intend to be inclusive – involving, of course, the Member States, the European Space Agency, EUMETSAT, the industry and, of course, Parliament. I therefore welcome our debate today and wish to engage more with you over the next month on space issues.  But before I come to the space strategy, let me say just a few words on our European flagship space programmes, Copernicus and Galileo, because they are moving forward. As I commented several months ago, four out of six Copernicus services are fully operational and the community of users is growing. We launched successfully another satellite in April. EGNOS is operational and two weeks ago we had another successful launch for Galileo, which brings the number of satellites in orbit to 14. We really can, and should, be proud of that. Of course, I have to mention the initial services which will start later this year. We hope to launch four more satellites in November. The main challenge now is to work to exploit these achievements for new or better services, products and applications. Space solutions and technologies can have a decisive impact on high political priorities such as climate change, air quality, border management, transport, environment issues and security. Actually, the largest impact may be outside of the space domain, per se. Most of the growth and economic value will come from the commercial downstream uses of space. Market uptake of our programmes is therefore at the heart of this strategy. We will propose measures in that sense. The role of the Commission in the public sector should be as an enabler. We should promote favourable conditions and encourage businesses to develop innovative products and services. Innovation clusters and business incubators will be supported. This will benefit SMEs and, of course, start—ups. We are also looking at how we can use smart financing and synergies among different EU programmes to increase the uptake of space. Our top priority for Copernicus is ensuring fast and easy access to data and services anywhere in Europe, so we envisaged supporting the development of several industry—led platforms, making the most of the available data—processing technologies. We will identify any legislative, administrative and technical barriers that need to be addressed.  On Galileo, together with the GSA, we will continue to make chipsets and receivers Galileo— and EGNOS—compatible and develop the relevant applications. Our intention is to promote the use of EGNOS and Galileo in various sectors, focusing of course on those with the highest potential. But we also need to take a strategic view. Our main objective should be to bring the benefits of space to European society and to the European economy. We need a strategy to address the current and emerging challenges. We need a strategy that covers all the relevant public and private actors in Europe. We want to mainstream the use of space to support public policies, providing effective solutions to the big societal challenges such as – as I said before – climate change, security, migration, and the digital agenda. We want to promote a globally—competitive European space sector that is innovative, agile and entrepreneurial, and create more jobs and, of course, more growth in Europe. We want a space environment that is sustainable and remains accessible, safe and secure.  This is the vision of the strategy that we are working on. We expect it to cover five main areas. First, as already said, we want to maximise the benefits of Galileo and Copernicus. Second, we want to respond to emerging needs – for example, we may consider how space could better contribute to security policy, border surveillance and maritime security. We are also looking into the international developments taking place and how space technology could help our climate change agenda, notably with regard to CO2 emissions. Third, we want to boost the competitiveness of the European space industry throughout research, innovation and the modernisation of the industrial base. That means using opportunities from new business models to encourage greater involvement and risk—sharing by the private sector and a smart financing approach. Fourth, we want to address the strategic aspects and dualist dimension of space. This means supporting the resilience and protection of critical space and ground infrastructure, including in the context of the current space surveillance and tracking framework. We are assessing how we can support Europe’s independent access to space. When talking about security and strategic aspects of space, and similarly to what is said in the report of Mr Zdrojewski, I consider that space based capabilities and services can, and should, play a key role in the context of European security and defence. I particularly note the references in your report to GovSatCom capacities, SST, precise navigation and earth observation. This is also an element discussed in the context of the announced European Defence Action Plan which I am preparing together with Vice—President Katainen.  Finally, we want to strengthen the role and impact of the EU as a global actor. In April, we launch a broad public consultation process open until 12 July, to help us shape the strategy.  To sum up and conclude, I see space as an enabler for solutions to key political priorities and societal challenges, as a vector for growth, enabling new services, new business opportunities in space, as an industrial sector in its own right, which is facing increasing challenges and needs to be supported, and as a strategic asset supporting Europe’s autonomy of action on the global stage. The opportunities offered by space programmes will only be felt if they are used widely by both public and private users. That means stronger and more coordinated efforts at all levels – European, national and local. So we have to work together to bring the benefits of space closer to our citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3095, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Françoise Grossetête", "mepid": "2025", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union has so far been ahead of the curve in space, and it is particularly important that it stays ahead of the curve, given that today the space sector is facing major changes at the international level and this requires a European response to the height of the stakes, which are immense. Indeed, the United States is investing, Russia adopted a new space strategy in 2014, China has started launching communications satellites and India has also understood that it must play today in the court of space powers. The European Union must therefore do everything it can to ensure that it does not get left behind. Access to space is a strategic issue for our political and economic independence. The multitude of space data is not sufficiently exploited and we would benefit from using it more widely by developing a real space market in Europe. To do this, of course, we must provide unwavering support to Galileo and Copernicus, because we need these technical tools to fulfil all our ambitions in this area. We also need, as you said very well, to be prepared for applications in a number of sectors, including the automotive sector, the airline industry and many others. I could also take an example, because the impact of space, the space sector is important in the field of agriculture, I conclude, the environment, but for example we also need a real global strategy because, in the area of COP 21 for example, Mr President, well with space, we will have a real vision of what is happening in our oceans. , also in terms of greenhouse gas emission limits.

It is characterised by terrorists attacks, hybrid wars, mass murder and other challenges to our common security and defence affecting all Member States and to which all Member States of the European Union must respond by adopting a joint strategy and a coordinated response. These security challenges call for the strengthening of the European Union’s security through the continued development and support of the European Union Common Security and Defence Policy, in order to make it a more effective policy instrument and a real guarantee of the safety of EU citizens and the promotion and protection of European norms, interests and values, as enshrined in the Treaty on European Union. Space capabilities in Europe – the satellites – could be used to better assess and identify the flow of illegal immigrants and their roots. In the case of those coming from North Africa, they could be used to identify the ship-boarding areas in order to engage with them faster and save more lives, to improve naval security and to support European Union missions abroad. The European Council of June 2015, which focused on defence, called for the fostering of greater and more systematic European defence cooperation, with a view to delivering key capabilities, including through the coherent and efficient use of EU funds and existing EU capabilities.  Space policy is an essential component of the strategic autonomy which the European Union must develop in order to safeguard sensitive technological and industrial capabilities and independent capabilities needed to carry out assessments. The references to financial implications for further development of the space capabilities in connection with the Common Security and Defence Policy should be maintained, as they are mainly about creating perspectives and not going against the provisions of the Treaty. The European Union/United States cooperation on future space-based capabilities and services for security and defence purposes is, in my opinion, mutually beneficial.

That is why the union's new space strategy is so important if we are to keep up with the world. In this respect, the development of the space market is also very important.  However, defence capabilities are also linked to space technologies, as the Zdrojewski report mainly refers to. The proliferation of space technologies leads to competition for space resources. Many countries are actively developing anti-satellite technologies, including in the field of orbital weapons, which demonstrates the militarisation of space and the need for European countries to develop space infrastructure defence capabilities.  Mr Zdrojewski's report rightly emphasises the need to develop the European space industry, including in terms of enhancing the defence capabilities of EU countries. This should be done in close cooperation with our allies, because it is right to say a document on the need to coordinate the activities and compatibility of European space capabilities with NATO and the US.  (The President interrupted the speech due to a lack of simultaneous translation into Italian)  However, the Commission's planned measures to support the space industry should reduce the high concentration of space industry. The two companies employ more than half of the staff of the European space industry.

The Union's space strategy, which was presented in January 2016 by Commissioner Pieńkowska, aims to strengthen the competitiveness of industry.

I would like to make one appeal to Commissioner Bieńkowska on the space strategy: we need to raise awareness of the flagship programmes we have, both to Galileo and certainly to Copernicus. We need to involve more private companies, because these private entrepreneurs can create the jobs and growth we so desperately need. The government can't do that.

In my view, it is a sector where it is almost perfectly possible to show how the public sector, how the European Union can support the private sector. On my mobile phone I have 10 or 15 applications where space technology is used, from the software for running to navigation software and so on. This is not just about companies operating in space technology itself, but about small European startups that can use Galileo and Copernicus, which can use data provided by the public sector, which private individuals could not do in this form. We have to do that, we have to invest massively in this, because European industry needs the support of the Commission and of all of us.

I particularly welcome the fact that the report by the AFET Committee does not only refer to security and defence in the classical sense, but also emphasises the dangers posed by space debris or collisions of objects in space. Preventing accidents will be a major challenge in the medium term, especially as traffic in space continues to grow. And on Earth, too, security has many aspects. For example, Earth observation from space can help us observe climate change and respond faster and better to natural disasters. However, while the issues of security and defence must be taken into account in the EU's space programmes, there is no doubt that the programmes are civil and must remain civil.

Such an ambitious programme the European Parliament is, of course, not everyone, as usual in a democracy, able to support it. We are talking about many things, most about the use of space technologies. This is important, but even more important is the technological advantage that has always been gained by countries that have been at the fore front in space technologies. This technological advantage lasts differently, even three or four decades. This is the perspective we think about if we invest in good, state-of-the-art space technologies. We believe in the European Parliament, at least in the ITRE Committee, that spending on an ambitious space policy is not just expenditure. These are investments for decades. Once again, ambitions cost money, but lack thereof would cost us much more. It will increase our dependence on others, reduce safety, expose us to wasting the potential of our industry, contribute to the brain drain. So we encourage an ambitious programme.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3108, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "Flavio Zanonato (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124800", "text": "   – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, there is no doubt that we are at a crucial moment in defining a forward-looking European space strategy, which will maximise the social, employment, economic, scientific and technological benefits of space investment in the European Union. A strategy that must be able to guarantee Europe, in the short and long term, independent access to space and a dominant position in global markets in the field of space technologies and services. A great many of these cases have been mentioned. This will only be possible with consistent and massive support for galileo and copernicus space research and programmes. It should be remembered that the technologies developed in the context of space research have added value in many other areas. Reference has already been made to transport, agriculture, humanitarian aid, climate and energy, but we could talk about all the science on materials, electronics and astronomy. The space industry is undergoing profound changes, mainly due to technological innovations that create opportunities for citizens and renewed interest in space by the public and private sectors. That is why it is essential to identify possible technical and legislative obstacles and to focus on establishing a coherent and stable regulatory framework to facilitate the commercialisation of space data-based services. It is also necessary to give adequate support to the European space industry – I agree here with my colleague Mr Tajani – to support entrepreneurship and to promote internationalisation.

We are talking about a high-tech sector that creates many jobs, billions in annual turnover and numerous business opportunities for applications applied in everyday life, both in telecommunications, navigation, media, transport, meteorology and others. We need to identify how the uptake of space data can support the economic growth of our Union by focusing on the benefits of space related to the digital single market and capital markets, synergies with the European Structural and Investment Funds. On the other hand, European space policy must be an integral part of our security policy. The exchange of information and space data forms part of the response to global security challenges, including the fight against terrorism. A common space policy will help to achieve Europe's leadership by developing independent technologies and missions, services and applications in other areas beyond economic and security.  Little is known about the fact that, for example, Bulgaria occupies a worthy place among the countries with a space program. It is the third country after the United States and Russia, which produces ready meals for space crews, has its own cosmonaut and is the eighteenth country with its own satellite.

It has a direct impact on citizens' daily lives, for example weather forecasts are based on data generated by the space industry. Such activities are a driver of innovation and competitiveness, especially in the area of the so-called sharing economy. The data generated by the space industry is crucial for its development. Take, for example, self-driving cars. For this project, it is necessary to improve land mapping and satellite navigation techniques, which are respectively the objectives of the EU's Copernicus and Galileo programmes.  In the context of the challenges ahead, closer coordination of the European Union's space policy is needed. Number of stakeholders: Member States, the European Space Agency and the EU itself make it difficult to optimise decision-making and reduces the effectiveness of implementation of decisions taken. The main objective of the Union should be to ensure better coordination between the different actors and a more effective management of public resources. In this context, we should mention the funding structure of the Union's space policy, which focuses on the development of existing programmes.  Apart from completely new initiatives, the Union excludes the possibility of active participation by the new Member States, which are just taking their first steps in space policy.

Firm in our intentions: the industry needs public orders for it. Are we ready to schedule the sequel to Galileo and Copernicus? The national preference for institutional orders and fire is the global norm, except in Europe. Why not impose the European preference? Are we so afraid of it? Citizens need a public power that invests in its existing infrastructure, such as Kourou.  Will Europe finally fulfil its role in financing the firing range and the connection to the new transatlantic cable? To require a strategic and visionary Commission is to be realistic, because our customers today will be our competitors of tomorrow: India, very soon, and perhaps after Indonesia, or even Saudi Arabia.

Mr President, the European Union must stop treating space with the same ideas as the other areas of joint action. First of all, space policy involves research, i.e. the development of human resources. Funds should be given to support scientists in this field in all countries. It is unfair for Greek astrophysicists to migrate to Western Europe because they do not have the infrastructure to proceed with their research in Greece.  Space cannot today be treated simply as another market for private investors. That would be irresponsible. Space decisions directly affect the security of countries but may also have long-term effects on the natural environment. It is therefore not possible to make space a market like any other. Space technologies have added value for many sectors such as telecommunications and transport. The European Union must work in the field of space not only with the US and Japan but also with other space powers, such as Russia, India and China, in order to have even greater results in cutting-edge space technology, which must finally be put at the service of humanity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3114, "date": "2016-06-07.json", "name": "João Ferreira (GUE/NGL).", "mepid": "96706", "text": "   – Mr President, we have always advocated a space policy based on deepening cooperation between European countries and not only.

On the contrary, this militarization is explicitly assumed and defended, as it happens here today, while we are being told about the development of the space market.  It is revealing of the way the European Union looks into space and is also dangerous. The endless adventure of mankind for the discovery of this great book continually open, of which Galileo spoke to us, cannot serve to prolong on earth the wicked, aggressive and oppressive order that some have been imposing.

This is valuable for us because, as was said, we are just in the process of preparing the space strategy, the first such European strategy. I want also to say at the very beginning that it is extremely important also for those Member States that are just starting space activities. I am really trying to engage with those Member States, with all of them.  Last week, we had an informal EU ESA Council meeting in Den Haag because all the European Member States, both those who are ESA members and those who are not, have to be included in our work – all the stakeholders. Of course I do not want to make governance the first major topic of the strategy, but we do have to design the governance and the whole work of the strategy in a very smart way because space is really a strategic asset for Europe. It is a strategic industrial sector.  Many here were discussing the link between space and defence policy. I can commit here because I am in charge of both strategies, so this is a space strategy but also for the defence action plan. I can commit that I will be very attentive to this dimension, even more so because 2016 is a very central year for European defence. We will have a global strategy, and then a defence action plan. They will be the two key milestones to increase cooperation and defence at European level and between the Member States also. We will be focusing very much on cooperation in research, in defence, cooperation on industrial projects, which is very important, and stronger coherence of capability needs. I agree also with those who call for action in order to ensure autonomous access to space. I think that without such an access there is no space strategy in Europe.  I want very much also to underline the ambition of the strategy. We want and will be ambitious. This will be an ambitious strategy but I can only echo Jerzy Buzek who said that the lack of ambition will cost us more. I also want to turn your attention to the fact that the ambition of the strategy means also ambition on the means we can allocate to space. We have started to discuss this but I really count on your support in this regard because especially now and in the next few years, it will be extremely important.

However, I will say right away – not quite, because on this occasion there is still a need to both promote and inform about what space technologies are. So we have a lot of work ahead of us. Thank you for the speeches by Mr Tajani, Mrs Grossetête, Mr Jerzy Buzek, Mrs Anna Fotygi, because they show concern for this common, strong, modern, creative Europe. I would like to thank Anna Fotydze in particular, because it was she in the SEDE committee who launched the procedure for this report, which was also very important to me.  I would also like to respond to Mr Schaffhauser, but he is not there, so I will congratulate Mrs Grossetête, because what France is doing when it comes to space technology deserves special recognition and, I must say, it is a great, gigantic effort. And the fact that France is now also spreading this effort to other countries, much less advanced, deserves respect and can be a source of pride, not attack, as has just happened.  Lastly, mrs Lösing, who is not there either, there is no war, no military, no militarisation. The concept of safety, on the other hand, concerns many elements – the movement of an ambulance on the road, the search for a missing tourist, the search for a ship, the response to various threats that are related to industrial disasters. And we must remember that when we talk about safety, we are sensitive to the fate of every individual. We will also stress in all our space capabilities that the system being built – not by a single country, but by the whole of Europe – is to lay the foundations, the foundation of a strong, modern, future-strong Europe that will also be economically strong.
