We await the result of the investigation to find out the causes of this event and any responsibilities. What is certain is that these children and adolescents had to be better protected. As you know, last week we celebrated Women's Day. I insisted that this celebration is not just a rhetorical occasion and as long as women continue to be victims of violence, discrimination, forced marriages, exclusion from the world of work, politics or positions of responsibility, we will have to fight every day of the year to affirm respect for their fundamental rights. At the extraordinary meeting of the FEMM commission, I stressed that it is not possible to respond to the great challenges of the world - terrorism, radicalization, poverty and unemployment - without true gender equality. I met Lamiya Aji Bashar and Hauwa Ibrahim, two women winners of our Sakharov prize; I reaffirmed our commitment to support their action but also their courage and their history must make us responsible so that the Union remains a beacon of human rights in the world. This is why we ask for a collective effort by the Member States and by the European institutions themselves for the ratification and application of the Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence. I am proud to be the President of an institution that makes its voice heard loud and clear on women's rights every day. Yet, right here, in the European Parliament, a few days ago, we witnessed an extremely serious episode: a parliamentarian attacked in a manner gender equality is unacceptable.He has offended all women by violating our founding values and more so while presiding over a woman as part of a discussion on pay differences between women and men.As far as I am concerned, I do not intend to tolerate such behavior (Applause), even more serious as it is expressed by those who should represent the European peoples with dignity.As President of this Parliament, I want to apologize to all my colleagues, to all the women who work in this institution, to the guests and to all the women, for these extremely offensive statements.As soon as the process of the investigation that I have initiated is completed, I will announce the sanction which will be appropriate to the gravity of the statements made in this chamber.(Applause)", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "Presidente. –", "mepid": "2187", "text": "The final draft agenda, set by the Conference of Presidents, pursuant to Rule 149 of the Rules, was distributed at the meeting of 9 March 2017.Following consultations with the political groups, I would like to submit to the House the following proposal to amend the final draft agenda.Thursday: The discussion on \"Sudan: the cases of Hassan Abduraheem and Abdulmonen Abdumawla is replaced by the discussion on\" Zimbabwe, the case of Pastor Evan Mawarire \".

Mercury is acutely toxic and is one of the ten most harmful naturally occurring substances on this planet. Fetuses, newborns and children belong to the particularly endangered group, as the brain and nervous system are very sensitive to mercury during the growth phase. Even small amounts of ingested mercury can cause serious damage to health. In the 1950s, thousands of people and many animals in the Japanese coastal city of Minamata were diagnosed with massive and irreparable damage to the central nervous system. The media talked about Minamata disease. The cause of these diseases was a high degree of mercury poisoning, caused by the discharge of contaminated sewage from a local chemical factory into the sea. According to current estimates, around ten thousand people were seriously harmed and around three thousand died as a result of the poisoning. Given the dangers to human health and the environment, an in-depth approach would have been necessary to meet our responsibilities rather than just making cosmetic corrections. Above all, I saw my task as rapporteur in representing the approach of the Minamata Convention as best as possible and in getting an ambitious proposal off the ground. This approach received broad support from the Environment Committee. That made me very happy and showed that the majority of the committee understood its task. Unfortunately, the compromise that was reached after the second trialogue lacks the ambitious positions that the draft report contained after the vote in the Environment Committee. I would have liked to have gone into a third round of negotiations to defend the parliamentary position. I very much regret that during the negotiations I addressed the crucial questions did not receive the necessary backing from the majority of shadow rapporteurs.In some areas, the report bears the signature of primarily German corporate interests.Nonetheless, I decided to endorse this report in order to pave the way for the ratification of the Minamata Agreement by the EU.Even if I had hoped for a more ambitious text, once the report has been adopted, we can hope for a reduction in the use of mercury, at least in the field of dentistry.After phasing out its use in the chlor-alkali industry this year, the greatest need for mercury in Europe is 75 tonnes per year for amalgam fillings.It is now up to the member states to implement this EU legislation into national law as soon as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 17, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, mercury is a pollutant of global concern that enters the food chain where it accumulates, mainly in fish. The EU’s mercury policy is the most advanced worldwide, but 40-80% of the mercury deposited in the EU comes from other parts of the globe. That is why we called for global action and took on a leading role in the negotiations of the Minamata Convention on Mercury. The Convention, which was signed at the end of 2013, is to a great extent inspired by EU legislation, so it requires only limited changes to the EU acquis. Consequently, the new mercury regulation aims primarily at fine-tuning EU law so as to ensure full compliance with all provisions of the Minamata Convention and enable its ratification by the EU and the Member States. We expect that ratification by the EU and those Member States that have completed their required national procedures will take place before the end of June. This should trigger the entry into force of the Convention, taking us a major step closer to a safer, healthier mercury-free society. As top mercury-polluters take action to implement the Convention, we expect a dramatic drop of mercury emissions to air and water worldwide, leading to reduced exposure to mercury within the EU. The entry into force of the Minamata Convention will help level the playing field, as all major economies will apply requirements similar to those already applying in the EU on products, industrial processes and waste management. In turn, this will support the EU’s innovative eco-industry, which will be able to make the most of their technological lead in export markets. Furthermore, this regulation is a golden opportunity to complement our already advanced EU acquis with new measures going beyond the minimum of the Convention. The Commission is very happy that Parliament fully supported our proposal to put an end to new uses of mercury in products and industrial processes. This flagship measure demonstrates the EU’s continued global leadership in this policy area. The new regulation will also ensure that all known industrial processes using mercury convert to mercury-free alternatives and that mercury waste is safely start out of reach, thereby avoiding its improper use and release into the environment. Finally, the regulation sets out a clear road map for reducing the use of dental amalgam and assessing the feasibility of phasing out its use. I also draw your attention to two statements by the Commission that will be appended to the Minutes. The first one signals our continued engagement at international level, which will aim at further narrowing the remaining gaps between the level of protection guaranteed by the Minamata Convention and the stricter requirements that prevail in the EU. Our second statement concerns the so-called ‘no opinion clause’ in comitology. The new mercury regulation is undoubtedly a major step forward in the EU acquis. I therefore call upon all of you to express your support for this very good outcome of the informal trilogue process. Commission statement on international cooperation on mercury The Minamata convention and the new Mercury Regulation are major contributions to protecting citizens from mercury pollution globally and in the EU. International cooperation should be sustained to ensure successful implementation of the Convention by all Parties and further strengthen its provisions. The European Commission is therefore committed to supporting continued cooperation, in accordance with the Convention and subject to applicable EU policies, rules and procedures, inter alia undertaking work in the following areas: Narrowing the gap between EU law and the provisions of the Convention through the review clause of the list of prohibited mercury-added products; In the context of the provisions of the Convention on financing, capacity building and technology transfer, activities such as improving traceability of mercury trade and use, promoting certification of mercury-free artisanal and  small-scale gold mining and mercury-free labels for gold, and increasing the capacity of developing countries including in the area of mercury waste management. Commission statement on comitology The Commission underlines that it is contrary to the letter and to the spirit of Regulation 182/2011 (OJ L 55 of 28.2.2011, p. 13) to invoke Article 5 § 4, subparagraph 2, point b) in a systematic manner. Recourse to this provision must respond to a specific need to depart from the rule of principle which is that the Commission may adopt a draft implementing act when no opinion is delivered. Given that it is an exception to the general rule established by Article 5 § 4 recourse to subparagraph 2, point b), cannot be simply seen as a \"discretionary power\" of the Legislator, but must be interpreted in a restrictive manner and thus must be justified.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 18, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "Michel Dantin", "mepid": "97296", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to thank my colleagues in Parliament, the Commission and the Council with whom I have worked closely to improve the protection of European citizens against the harmful effects of mercury. As rapporteur for the PPE Group, I welcome the results of these negotiations. The text that is finally submitted to us seems more realistic than the previous versions. This new text is ambitious to say the least. It puts our Europe at the forefront of the fight against heavy metal pollution on the international stage, but it also leaves our companies and our researchers the time necessary to develop viable alternatives. Among the main elements of the reform, I note that the export of mercury is now prohibited and that the use of recycled mercury is encouraged. With regard to dental amalgams, only encapsulated forms are authorized, guaranteeing both the health of the patient and the health of the practitioners. Dentists should also equip themselves with amalgam separators to avoid any release into the environment. For populations at risk, children, pregnant women, the use of amalgams is prohibited, unless medical advice to the contrary. Lastly, the agreement provides for reducing mercury levels in products and processes. Regarding the management of mercury-containing waste, I fought with my colleagues in the EPP to obtain the safest storage, that is to say after the stabilization of the waste. In the face of heavy metal pollution, the \"Mercury\" regulation before us today is an example of an efficient Europe that protects. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, a Europe that protects.

For this reason it is necessary to regulate its uses and movements and to decide in perspective how to treat it when it becomes waste with the aim, where possible, of reducing or eliminating its use in a reasonable amount of time. With this logic we moved in the negotiations with the Council and the Commission, which concluded last December with a broad consensus, which then received unanimity in the Environment Committee. Tomorrow we hope that the text can be definitively approved, without further amendments by the House. This will make it possible for the Union to ratify the Minamata Convention on mercury and take part in its first conference of the parties scheduled for the end of September in Geneva. But neither today's debate nor tomorrow's vote are formal at all: the text we bring to plenary, which is the result of the contribution of almost all the political groups, marks some major changes compared to the Commission's initial proposal. I want to name just a few: dental amalgam in the first place. Currently, this is the first form of mercury use in Europe and presents several risks to citizens' health and the environment. For this reason, we would have liked its use to be completely outdated within a few years. We did not succeed, also due to the resistance of the Council. However, compared to the Commission's initial proposal, we have achieved: first, a ban on the use of amalgam for vulnerable populations (pregnant women, breastfeeding women, children under 15, all baby teeth) from 1 January 2019; second, the drawing up of national plans for the gradual reduction of the use of amalgam; third, a report of the Commission by June 2020 on the feasibility of the total elimination of the use of amalgam; fourth, we have achieved that dental facilities that use dental amalgam are equipped with amalgam separators, so as to avoid their discharge into municipal wastewater. We have been able to introduce other important changes with respect to the initial text on mercury-contaminated sites, which will finally be identified and made public, with the hope that the States can soon accept a legislative initiative from the Union. Furthermore, we will finally be able to apply the mercury content limits defined for the internal market to the export of batteries and non-electronic measuring devices, thereby overcoming incomprehensible double standards between what we sell within the Union and what we export. Unfortunately, we have not obtained a similar ambition on the export of lamps: but in any case on many of them, from 2018, mercury limits lower or equal to those defined according to the Minamata Convention will apply. Thanks to the commitment of the European Parliament, several production processes that still use mercury will have an expiration date and companies will be induced to find alternatives that are more sustainable from an environmental point of view.

This deal will help to close the gap between international efforts under the UN Minamata Convention and efforts at the EU level. The updated regulation will also allow the EU to give consent to ratification of the Minamata Convention, which was signed in 2013. This was not an easy negotiation, but on balance the compromise reached is a good outcome. Although mercury use has declined significantly in recent years, releases into the air, water and land can still be a threat. This agreement will help improve protection of human health and the environment from exposure to mercury. There are updated provisions regarding the scope of exports and imports and the storage of mercury waste. Mercury use will also be banned in artisanal and small—scale gold mining, whilst the compromise reached on the phasing-out of mercury in dental usage is welcome. There is a ban on the use of amalgam for children under 15 and pregnant and breastfeeding women from 2018. Member States will have to adopt national action plans on the phase-down of mercury in dentistry and the Commission will study the feasibility of a complete phase-out in the long term, preferably by 2030. This gradual approach is important. I am a firm proponent of decision-making on the basis of scientific evidence. Dental amalgam is safe, effective and durable.

A particularly important achievement is the ban on the use of dental amalgam sites for children, pregnant women and nursing mothers. At present, the majority of the mercury imported into Europe is used to make dental amalgam. In the coming years, the Commission will be required to assess the possibility of a total ban on amalgam use. Some Member States are not prepared to give up the use of amalgam, but with this decision we are sending a clear message to the citizens of their will to reduce their use and move to cost-effective, mercury-free dental places. A total ban on amalgam would have very positive environmental and health effects in Europe and in those non-European countries where mercury is mined. With the Mercury Regulation, EU legislation meets and must meet the criteria of the UN Minamata Agreement. However, as new technologies develop, we must be prepared to make our legislation even stricter on the use of this mercury. Mercury is one of the ten most toxic substances according to the World Health Organization, and exposure to mercury causes diseases of the nervous system and internal organs, among other things.

We also know that, when dispersed in the environment, it can transform itself into a more complex and harmful compound, methylmercury, which also has the ability to overcome the placental barrier, inhibiting the mental development of children before their birth. Furthermore, the World Health Organization has made it clear that its toxicity is without a threshold, so even very small doses can cause serious damage to health. But despite this, the worldwide use of mercury remains high - around 3 600 tons per year - and the pollution it is responsible for knows no borders. We support the report by my colleague Eck, which responds to these health needs of citizens, and we have also proposed a two-line amendment, with which we can avoid spilling into our seas 75 tons of mercury from derivatives from dental fillings which, still today, unfortunately, they are used in some countries of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 25, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "Mireille D’Ornano", "mepid": "124750", "text": "on behalf of the ENF group. - Mr President, Commissioner, after the Minamata disaster which affected Japan for several decades, it was time to take into account the harmful effects of this highly toxic substance, mercury, on health and on our environment .

That is why the EPP Group will of course vote for the compromise tomorrow. I believe, however, that compromises can be made, as we did at the end of this report. Because when it comes to how you are exposed to mercury, exposure is very important. So it depends very much on whether it is gaseous or in another form, a bound form. That's why we were happy that in the end you weighed up a few points, for example in the industrial processes, where you have a very closed process, but on the other hand many jobs would have been endangered if we had left this process too quickly. There are also very many different views on amalgam. I think it has to be a goal - that's why I welcome the compromise - that we get rid of amalgam if possible. Because there are question marks, and if there are question marks, it is better if we have alternatives. But the experts are still arguing about how available these alternatives are and how quickly we can replace them completely. That is why it is right to start immediately with the sensitive groups and specify the direction of attack, but not now - especially not without an impact assessment - to adopt the complete ban immediately. Finally, one more sentence on a subject that has not played a role in this report, but which does play a role in the public discussion about mercury. It's about the mercury in energy-saving lamps. We have regulated that with RoHS. There are very, very strict limits. There isn't much left. Compared to the thermometers we used to have, that's more than a hundred times less. But we mustn't forget that a lot of mercury is produced when coal is burned, and the Commission has calculated that the use of energy-saving lamps - if they are still necessary, if you don't have newer technologies - still makes sense because they can save coal-fired power stations.And in the end this is not only good for the environment in general, but also especially for mercury.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 27, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "Pavel Poc (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "96715", "text": "- Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate my colleagues on the agreement reached on the proposal for a regulation on mercury. I am very pleased to note that the European Parliament has again succeeded in substantially improving the European Commission's original proposal. The new rules aim to strengthen protection against pollution by this highly toxic substance, and the agreed changes will ensure that EU legislation is in line with the international rules set out in the Minamata Convention. This will make it possible to ratify the text of the Convention quickly by the EU, paving the way for its early entry into force. Global cooperation is key and essential: pollution by this substance knows no borders and while, since the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1102/2008, annual demand for mercury in the EU has fallen to around 400 tonnes, global consumption is still high at 3,600 tonnes per year. . At the same time, mercury poses a serious threat to human health, precisely due to the presence of its compound methylmercury in fish and seafood. And from that point of view, it is alarming that more than 13% of fish samples from around the world would probably not be recommended for commercial sale by either the WHO or the European Commission. It is clear that without international cooperation, this problem simply cannot be solved. It is positive that the proposal ultimately takes a rational approach to the gradual reduction of amalgam, starting with particularly vulnerable groups and with the aim of a total ban.

Many thanks also to the rapporteur for the report. Mercury is highly toxic - we've heard that on various occasions. I actually knew from an early age how toxic it is because my mother always made it clear to us that, for God's sake, we shouldn't drop the thermometer that used to measure fever, where you can see the liquid mercury, because which otherwise actually releases harmful substances and would also harm us. Because we're talking about children - Peter Liese mentioned energy-saving lamps: I thought it was very bad at the time that lightbulbs were banned and energy-saving lamps came because they contain mercury. We have two cases in Germany where a child, because such an energy-saving lamp broke, burned itself to the fumes and was marked by it for life. Of course, that shouldn't happen. Fortunately, that only happened twice, but still. That said, mercury is highly toxic. It has also been said to be found everywhere in the environment, in fish, in seafood. Of course that shouldn't be. We have it in the ground and we have to try to reduce that. I therefore agree, like everyone else, that amalgam is to be banned now, especially for small children with their milk teeth and for pregnant women and nursing mothers. This is really necessary because otherwise poisoning can happen, especially in children, in an indirect or direct way. I also think it's good that people are looking into whether amalgam, which contains mercury, shouldn't be generally banned sooner or later. The Commission has been asked to make a proposal here. That is also perfectly correct. I would like to address one more aspect that did not play such a major role in the debate or has not yet been addressed at all: There are some areas in medicine where mercury is irreplaceable, but where it has so far been used correctly, even in very small doses.That is with homeopathy and with anthroposophic medicine.I think it is very good - I have also tabled relevant amendments here - that you can still do that, because otherwise there would be no more options for certain therapies.Mind you: Paracelsus said that the dose makes the poison.It is so minimal there that it helps people, but does not damage the environment significantly.Overall, we should definitely vote in favor of this regulation, because it is perfectly right and tries to protect people more.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 30, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "João Ferreira (GUE/NGL).", "mepid": "96706", "text": "- Mr President, mercury is one of the biggest pollutants in the world with significant and lasting impacts on human health and the environment.

Once in the environment, mercury accumulates along food chains through a process of bioaccumulation. Eating foods contaminated with methylmercury - the most toxic organic chemical form - is an important source of contamination. The restrictions on the use of mercury, import, export, storage and production of products and processes are therefore entirely justified, and we even think that it would have been possible to go further in this area, as demonstrated by the work done by the rapporteur and the initial position of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

It was a proposal that did not comply with either the Minamata Convention or our own waste legislation. The Commission proposed the least rigorous option, which is permanent storage of mercury in liquid form, without treatment and exclusively in salt mines. It was a proposal apparently tailored to the current situation, despite the fact that from these warehouses - and according to written responses from the Commission - more than a thousand tons of mercury have been illegally transported to Switzerland, the Netherlands and Greece, to be sold in third countries. Fortunately, Parliament has rectified and for that I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Eck, and all the shadow rapporteurs, especially Mr Dantin, because they have listened to technical and environmental arguments. From now on, only mercury will be temporarily stored on the surface. Definitive storage will have to be done on the surface or in salt mines and, if it is on the surface, it must be solidified and treated. The best technicians and experts in handling mercury are in my region, in the Almadén region, the largest mine in the world, and they consider that mercury should only be removed if there is a previous solidification treatment. Finally, Commissioner, I would like to invite the Commission to appear in the Committee on the Environment to explain the fraud that has occurred, as I have said before, in recent years and to give us reliable figures and tell us about the steps taken , and if there have been sanctions.

The aim was to only use mercury where there are absolutely no suitable alternatives. As some colleagues have already mentioned, there are a few exceptions for which no suitable replacement has yet been found. One that my colleague Meissner has already mentioned is in the area of ​​homeopathic and anthroposophic medicines.

However, the Commission supports the precautionary prohibition of amalgam use for dental care of children and pregnant and breastfeeding women. This prohibition has been included in the regulation. Furthermore, reducing the use of mercury is beneficial for the environment and the requirement for Member States to draw up national plans on the phasing-down of dental amalgam should make a significant contribution towards this objective.

I believe that the text we approved has strong positive elements and objectively represents a very important step forward in terms of the regulatory definition of corporate governance in the European Union. The discussion was very long - the Commission's text was presented three years ago - it took all this time to reach a widely shared solution due to the sensitivity of the subject and the elements of different legislation that we had to deal with. : the commitment was necessary but I believe it has reached a point of conclusion which will benefit the Union. However, this result would not have been possible without the support of Parliament's Secretariat and without the commitment of many of my colleagues, starting with Olle Ludvigsson who was the rapporteur for the ECON committee. I also thank the shadow rapporteurs of the various political groups, with whom we have sometimes heatedly discussed but who have followed this dossier competently and with a great sense of responsibility. Now, this positive result will allow us to take further steps forward. The goal was very simple to describe, a little more complex and difficult to achieve. It was and still has to pass from a condition in which companies and their managers often invest to have short-term returns, to have personal advantages that do not correspond to the interests of the community. For this reason, it is important to incentivize the exact opposite: to give transparency to everything that investors need and to ensure that companies make choices that guarantee a profit for them, but above all benefits for the community, looking at the medium and long term. This was the logic that Jacques Delors had introduced with the 1993 White Paper: we kept it as a reference this logic and that text of great cultural as well as economic value. There are some aspects that I would like to quickly underline: tighter controls and full transparency on the remuneration of directors of listed companies, starting with the so-called say-on-pay, i.e. the vote by shareholders on the directors' remuneration policy and on the annual report. on its application; the same transparency for institutional investors and asset managers, which will help guide the action of these players towards a more targeted approach to medium and long-term returns; the obligations of transparency, the red thread that contains the whole directive also for proxy advisors; and then the right for companies to identify their shareholders. Finally, still transparency and control regarding transactions with related parties. Everything that can be seen and interpreted is a great advantage, both for those who decide to invest and for those who will benefit from the positive effects of these companies. There is one last thing I would like to quickly underline: we had introduced legislation on country-by-country reporting into the text in committee. The reminder that came from that discussion allowed the commission to present a specific text which is now being examined by the ECON commission. I think this is right: we made this effort together, this responsible choice, to give the regulatory system this advantage too. The conclusion will be close and I imagine also positive as regards this further element of a sound fiscal policy in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 50, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "Olle Ludvigsson", "mepid": "96673", "text": "draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - Mr President! There is no doubt that corporate governance in Europe can be improved. Everyone wins. The agreement we have reached in tripartite negotiations is generally very positive in this regard.

This is extremely important. With regard to the work of institutional investors and asset managers, the negotiations have presented and emphasized the importance of maintaining strong and clear provisions on increased transparency.

The journey was not always easy. However, thanks to the determination and willingness to compromise by all the parties involved, a political agreement was reached in December last year. It is time to adopt this important directive, which will foster more long—term, transparent and sustainable capital markets in Europe. The compromise proposal on the table today represents a balanced outcome. Let me refer to some of the main aspects. First, I welcome the agreed approach concerning transparency of institutional investors, asset managers and proxy advisers. It will encourage institutional investors and asset managers to look at the long-term perspective and also consider environmental, social and governance factors when they invest. This is what our economy needs. Second, the proposed solutions on remuneration will ensure more transparency and better oversight of directors’ pay, not only for shareholders, but also for companies and the whole society. How directors are paid influences how they conduct business. Third, the proposed compromise will also ensure more efficient communication throughout the investment chain. In this way it will enable listed companies and their shareholders to communicate more efficiently. Therefore it is a crucial step to encourage more shareholder engagement. We also need safeguards against abusive related-party transactions in order to attract more foreign investors to our capital markets. I note that the level of ambition in this respect has been reduced from what the Commission initially aimed at. Nevertheless, I believe that overall the compromise would clearly improve the current regulatory framework for related-party transactions across the EU. We need this directive to enhance Europe’s competitiveness. It builds on lessons learned from the financial crisis and aims to foster sustainable growth.

Dear Commissioner, Colleagues, Whenever we conduct a debate on the functioning of enterprises, companies on the European market, we must bear in mind the basic elements that cannot be abandoned, that is, ensuring stable operations for our European companies allowing for the development and increasing the number of jobs, and secondly, on ensuring the competitiveness of our companies against companies from other markets. This is what is happening in the world of globalization, there is no exception to it. Therefore, any action of this type must be primarily aimed at adopting instruments that will strengthen it, not weaken it. The work on the directive on long-term shareholder engagement initially went in the wrong direction. Most of all, it was hampered by the attempts to include country by country reporting in this directive. Only when it was possible to isolate this problem into a completely different legislative solution, could this work be carried out with impetus and we could focus on what is most important, i.e. on the proper functioning of capital markets and on ensuring transparency in the remuneration policy. This transparency is, of course, of great importance from one point of view: a company that is in a weak financial condition cannot award its directors unbelievably high remuneration because it is socially unacceptable.

With this proposal, we want to involve shareholders more in the events in the companies in which they have invested. We want shareholders to be able to exercise proper control over the management of companies and not let managers often take short-term and excessive risks. Furthermore, and I consider it important, we want shareholders to be able to decide on the company's corporate remuneration policy. Currently, only a few Member States allow shareholders to intervene in directors' salaries. We require that the amount of executive remuneration be approved by the General Meeting.

A Europe that regulates in a positive direction, a Europe that recognizes that shameless financialization of economic activity can undermine a medium and long-term vision - and this was very well said by Mr Cofferati. Our industry was also built because captains of industry - as we said at the time - had a medium and long term vision for several generations. This is often supported by small businesses and SMEs and this is what this text is intended to reintroduce at the level of large companies. This legislation reminds us of something simple: transparency - you used that word, Commissioner, and you were right to use it - must not stop at the threshold of large companies. I understand very well the desire of a certain number, both of leaders and at the same time of politicians, to ensure that the company does not weigh too much on the company that would prevent it from being able to develop. I hear that argument, but for all that, absolute freedom, absolute deregulation, does not and does not bear fruit.

That is why it was not acceptable to us in the Legal Affairs Committee at that time as the EPP Group what was there in this report, and that is why it went far beyond what we had as a proposal from the Commission.

That is why it is right today to speak of the long-term nature of systems, of the transparency that we need there, of the competitiveness that you also mentioned. That is why it makes sense to deal with the remuneration as well, because we often had to use tax funds to absorb something that did not affect those responsible. That's why it's sensible.

For me, the social market economy is an ideal model in which the rights of both employees and employers are guaranteed. A model that is neither wild capitalism without rules nor over-regulated socialism.

Many investors invest money for us, such as insurance companies and pension funds. It is up to these investors to break with the quarterly culture in companies and opt for a long-term perspective. Countries can and must support them by strengthening the bond between shareholders and companies, for example through loyalty dividends or in other ways.

It took a long time, but this was because the merit was complex: we had to discuss with the Luxembourg presidency, then the Dutch, then the Slovakian to come to a conclusion with the Maltese one. This speaks volumes about how complex the set of themes we had to unravel was. I would like to point out just a few things quickly. I think that the political and institutional system should not work to place restrictive constraints on businesses. Sometimes they are needed but our prevailing behavior must be to give stimuli and incentives and I believe that in the text that we will approve tomorrow, so I hope, all this is very clear, just as I believe that managers must be helped to adopt positive behaviors in their companies. , not to engage in financial speculation, as has often happened, to the detriment of the capital invested and the people who work in those companies. Again, I would like to reassure my colleague who fears that politics may also decide on the remuneration of actors and singers. This is not the case, least of all in this text: politics does not decide; it will be up to the shareholders to decide, which unfortunately does not always happen, with serious damage to the whole structure that generates wealth, for forms and channels that are not the best and most desirable ones. Therefore, the function of politics is a precise function but it also has a positive character if the conclusions are those that are in the written text. The last point concerns country-by-country reporting: I think it is right not to have the solution on reporting in this text and that its placement in the text of the new directive is the best thing. But, let's say quite frankly, when we started there discussion, that Commission text was not there and if we had not discussed among ourselves, even animatedly, the new Commission proposal would not have been born.We obtained a result thanks also to the sense of balance, which did not lead to breakdowns but a little courage and a little determination, which was not lacking in the relationship between all the speakers, starting with the shadow speakers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 74, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "President. –", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  The debate is closed.

I welcome the initiative and I believe it shall be considered as a substantial part of the legislation dealing with the involvement of stakeholders in corporate governance.

The truth is that it has been a pleasure. I think we have done a good exercise in analyzing above all the state of gender equality at the level of the European Union. I also want to thank - and I want to mention it especially - to the European Institute for Gender Equality, because without them, without their help, it would have been much more difficult to also make this report - through all the analyzes they do the data they collect, the index they develop, which I think is extremely positive—; from this point of view, well, I also want to thank you. This report aims to send out a very clear message, which is that, judging by the data and the concrete analysis of certain indicators, we are blocked, when we do not take steps back, in terms of gender equality at the level of the European Union. And this is the first thing we must recognize because this is not installed in the public debate, nor in the policy debate. And I think it's important that we say it. If we take the pension gap indicator, it is not just that we are still at 40%, it is that in half of the Member States that gap has increased. If we take the wage gap, we are at 16.2, which is practically the same level as we had in 2012; we have not practically advanced. In terms of political participation, progress in recent years is only 6%. We are going very little by little, even in this house, where we have gone from 30 to 37. Yes, there is progress, but it is very, very scarce. And then the violence data. Not only because of the cases that we repeatedly see in many of our Member States, but also because of the data, and in this case the report refers to the study and survey of the European Agency for Fundamental Rights, based in Vienna, which thus revealed that 33% of women who acknowledge having been victims of an episode of violence at some point in their life, and 55% who acknowledge having been victims of an episode of sexual harassment at some point in their life. Therefore, I think we must recognize that this data is not good. And the question that we have asked ourselves and that we have shared with the other speakers is how the institutions are responding to this question. And it is true - and this is not only at the level of the European Union, but also at the level of many Member States - that the equality agenda is quite blocked. We have had times when there was a lot of ambition in this matter - even here, legislative, and in many Member States - and now this is no longer the case. And, of course, I have to refer to some of the things that happen, especially in the Council. The Commission withdrew the Directive on maternity leave due to blocking in the Council - although we obviously hope Commissioner Jourová, as she announced the last time, on the 24th, the new package of measures, which we are obviously ready to work to get ahead - but we also have the Directive on quotas in the boards of directors blocked, and, in the matter of violence, we are in the phase of ratifying the Istanbul Convention, and one of the things that the report asks is that it be done as quickly as possible and as quickly as possible, and that all those Member States that have not yet done so, to do so as quickly as possible. But we also do not want to stop claiming a specific instrument to combat gender violence at the level of the European Union, which we believe is absolutely indispensable. And, of course, other appeals that we make are very important. With regard to the Directive on quotas in the boards of directors, if we take the results in Norway, for example, we see that the results are very effective, and I think it would be good if the Board unblocked this dossier once and for all. Same, for example, with the pay gap.We have the announcement this week from the Icelandic Government that it will oblige all companies with more than 25 employees to explain how they ensure equal pay within the company.Well, they are measures that I think we should also be replicating at the level of the European Union.And the last thing I have to say: we want the European Commission to once again have a strategy on gender equality.I believe that this is a wish shared by this House and that is my last request.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 79, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "Agnieszka Kozłowska-Rajewicz", "mepid": "124889", "text": "rapporteur. - Mr Chairman! I, too, would like to start by thanking both the shadow rapporteurs and all the authors of the amendments for the very fruitful cooperation in drawing up my report. I am pleased that we can discuss this report and the two others in March. This is a special month: it has become the month when we are engaged in an in-depth debate on women's rights. It is also the month when all over the world there are demonstrations of women who, despite a hundred years of emancipation, still have to fight their rights in this way. And today, on the occasion of these three reports, there is an old list of outstanding issues. Both in the reports and probably in today's discussion, we will be addressing all these issues: economic issues, the right to motherhood, the right to equal pay, freedom from violence, financing equality measures and many others. Please state! As for the report I am writing on the implementation of the Directive on the access of women and men to goods and services, I would like to point out that this directive is a key point on the map of equality legislation in the European Union, as it is the first to legislate to extend the principle of equal treatment. treatment of women and men outside the labor market and transfers them into the area of ​​everyday life, which is access to goods and services. The most important success of this directive is the introduction of the same rules for women and men when calculating insurance premiums - and therefore pension contributions - in private funds. Thanks to this directive, women and men do not have to pay smaller or larger contributions just because of their gender. Insurance companies must focus on substantive criteria, such as accident history and health. And this approach aptly illustrates the principle of equal treatment of women and men in general, because the fight for equal rights is nothing more than an appeal to be guided by substantive criteria, competences, achievements instead of relying on gender stereotypes. There are also provisions in this directive - and this is what our report refers to - that deals with the protection of pregnant and maternal women. There are laws on the prohibition of sexual harassment. Much has been said about the necessity of the functioning of equality institutions in the Member States, such as ombudsmen and plenipotentiaries for equality, who implement and control the equality law in many legal acts. This directive has been successfully transposed into national law in all Member States, but its practical functioning needs to be strengthened. That is why in the report - and this is its key message - we emphasize the application of the law in practice, because, as we know, paper is patient, you can write anything on it, and in various places there are a lot of provisions regarding equal treatment of women and men, but without political will, without social awareness, without the existence of appropriate institutions and, above all, without adequate funding, this law remains dead. This is what we emphasize in this report: to apply these provisions in practice and to strengthen the equality institutions that uphold the exercise of this right. In the report, we also stress the importance of awareness of equal treatment for women and men, both among service providers and among consumers. Another important element is drawing attention to new market phenomena, such as the sharing economy, such as Uber or Airbnb. These are new phenomena, unregulated. We have to consider how and to what extent they are covered by the directive. We also speak in this report about the Istanbul Convention as a means of protection against violence and the importance of the provisions for the protection of women during motherhood.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 80, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "Clare Moody", "mepid": "124944", "text": "  rapporteur. – Mr President, I would like to thank the other rapporteurs for their cooperation and support in writing this document. I am proud to be presenting a report here in the plenary, following International Women’s Day, on such an important topic and I appreciate the presence of Commissioner Jourová to address – and I hope follow up on – the recommendation the Parliament makes this week. It should be a source of great pride to the EU that equality between women and men has been enshrined as a fundamental value of the Union since its very beginning. I do a lot of meetings and communications in my region and, when I talk about the support the EU provides to women, it generates an overwhelmingly positive response. There are 15 directives supporting gender equality and it is explicitly the subject of different aspects of the budget. However, we are still a long way from achieving the goal of gender equality. Indeed, if it was all sorted, there would not be a need for this report at all, and I look forward to the day when that is the case. But, in many ways and for many reasons, I fear we are in danger of slipping backwards: that gender-related issues have fallen down the political agenda and, when they are considered, a certain amount of complacency has taken hold. The report looks in detail at three specific areas: European structural and investment funds; the rights, equality and citizenship programme; and Horizon 2020. The structural and investment funds provide vital support, particularly for enabling women to work and on promoting gender equality, for example through supporting social infrastructure or women entrepreneurs. But there is not an overall strategy to make sure that there is systematic support to women in these programmes. The rights, equality and citizenship programme includes some very important areas of funding, and this support goes directly to organisations that are working in communities and have the reach and expertise to make a difference. A good example of this is the Daphne programme for combating violence against women. However, this programme also demonstrates the creeping decline in support and focus on equality. It has seen a fall in its annual funding since 2011, despite the heavy demands for this work. The Horizon 2020 Framework Programme in many ways shows the good work taking note of gender issues can achieve. It includes gender mainstreaming and provides specific support in the research process, in gender equality plans and in research content. However, these efforts need to be consistently supported by specific budget lines. In addition to these specific areas, the report looks at the budget more widely, including more recently-established work. For example, the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund included gender mainstreaming in its founding principles. There are very real and particular issues for women and girls in these situations, and the essential support we provide must recognise those. Overall, I have highlighted where there has been success, but where gender mainstreaming has been – or should be – adopted has also been underlined. For us to truly make progress on ending gender inequality we must move away from assuming support for women should be siloed in particular programmes and recognise the need to focus on the impact of all EU funds.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 81, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, our 2017 Annual Report on Equality between Women and Men, which was published last week ahead of the International Women’s Day, shows that despite progress there is still a lot of work to be done. On the positive side, the report indicates that new initiatives have flourished throughout Europe in many areas, including promoting women’s participation in decision-making and economic independence and combating stereotypes and gender-based violence. On the more worrying side, it shows signs that Member States may be moving in the opposite direction and that, in some instances, we might even witness stagnation. We have already heard these worries from your speeches. In addition, the gender gaps in pay and pensions are decreasing at a glacial rate. Therefore, the EU has an important role to play to ensure continued progress in all countries, and I am glad that the European Parliament has always been an important partner in this endeavour. Further efforts are needed to close the gender gaps in employment, pay and decision-making and to fight gender-based violence. The Commission is prepared to table a comprehensive and ambitious package to improve conditions for working parents and carers, to better reconcile the work-life balance and to support the higher participation of women in the labour market. Yes, this is the package which we promised to come up with after withdrawing the maternity leave directive. If you remember, I tried to explain that the maternity leave directive had already been implemented – or rather the goals of this directive as it was proposed were implemented – in the vast majority of Member States and that we need to come with something more ambitious, also covering greater flexibility and better choices for working parents. This is the policy – not only legislation, but a comprehensive policy – which the Commission is going to propose and adopt in April. I am looking forward very much to discussions in this House on this package. Also, regarding violence, we announced for 2017 a year of focused actions to fight violence against women, and I am glad to see that many actions are taking place to follow this aim not only in the Member States, but also in this House. In addition, we remain committed to finalising the negotiations for the EU accession to the Council of Europe Istanbul Convention as soon as possible, and we call on Member States to continue their ratification processes. I can assure you that whenever I go those Member States that have not yet ratified the Convention, I am pushing them to do it as soon as possible, as this is also an important step forward in order for the EU to join the Istanbul Convention. On women on boards, we heard that it has been blocked. I can only confirm that this is true. This has been blocked in the Council. I invested a lot of energy and time into convincing those Member States that we needed to achieve the necessary majority, which is one big Member State and two smaller ones, namely Germany, which already has the law. To my great disappointment, this has been blocked. We had to open something which I call the ‘second front’, so we are now addressing – through the Diversity Charter and through many, many different individual actions – the companies directly so that they change their corporate governance policy and introduce more diversity in their managerial culture. I believe that, in the meantime, we will be able to push the Member States to change their position so that we can adopt the women on boards directive. The Commission also welcomes the report on implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services. We will remain fully committed to ensuring gender equality in the access and provision of goods and services across the EU and will ensure that the Directive is fully and correctly implemented in all the Member States. Promoting gender equality, of course, requires the allocation of adequate funding possibilities at all levels. The 2014-2020 funding programmes already provide means of promoting gender equality and gender mainstreaming in key policy areas. Examples include the European structural and investment funds, and in particular the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund, which are key financial sources for promoting equality, for example in access to employment, career progression, reconciliation of work and private life, equal pay for equal work, labour market integration of migrant women, and investment in the provision of childcare infrastructure. Also, the rights, equality and citizenship programme co-finances national and transnational projects, promoting equal economic independence, overcoming rigid gender roles and stereotypes, and raising awareness of the gender pension gap and its causes and consequences. It also invests in preventing and combating violence against women by financing projects supporting victims of violence, training relevant professionals, raising awareness, and preventing violence linked to harmful practices. There are also other programmes, such as Horizon 2020 or the Development Cooperation Instrument, that are instrumental in promoting gender equality and gender mainstreaming. Currently gender budgeting is not applied systematically to the EU general budget. However, indicative funding for gender equality can be provided for programmes that include a clear gender equality objective and use gender equality indicators, allowing for the specification of allocated amounts. The strategic engagement for gender equality provides an overview of EUR 6.17 billion in EU-level funding allocated to achieving the targets and objectives of the strategic engagement. This report and its recommendations are very timely, as preparations for both the 2020 EU funding programmes are starting. The promise made 60 years ago in the Rome Treaty of equal treatment between women and men must continue.

And in this sense we must give a new impetus, and that is why the Committee on Budgets has made some proposals. We ask, for example, that all chapters of the European budget have clear gender objectives and that the budget allocated to achieve them be specified. That the projects financed by the European Union have gender indicators, both in the selection of projects and in their monitoring and evaluation. The amount allocated from the annual financial framework to achieve gender equality is a first step, but when we look at the latest figures on the cost of inequality it is clear that it must be increased.

The young mothers themselves were often consigned to a life of slavery and abuse in the Magdalene laundries. Things have moved on but we still have a long way to go. We do not have to go back decades to find unequal treatment of women. We do not have to go back to Ireland, why we do not even have to go outside this Chamber. Just this month in the mini plenary in Brussels, one of our supposed colleagues made the statement that because women are smaller, weaker, less intelligent they should be paid less than men. I have news for that MEP: there are women in this Chamber who are bigger, stronger and more intelligent than many men. That does not make them superior to any man. It makes them equal to all.

I would first of all like to thank my colleague Urtasun, who gathered a large amount of factual information and pointed out the fundamental trends in this area. The report objectively states that the situation has improved, albeit very small, very slow and insufficient. Of course, the increase in the education of women, which today accounts for 60% at universities, is positive. The number of women in political positions has increased slightly, today it is 29%. Nevertheless, we cannot, of course, be satisfied that the differences persist, especially in wages, 16% to the detriment of women, to the level of pensions, 40% to the detriment of women. There is still a higher proportion of men in the management of companies, up to 71%. And, of course, we continue to face a high level of violence, which is widespread in the EU, with 33% of women experiencing physical violence. However, what hinders the improvement of conditions for a better distribution of caring roles in the family is, above all, that Member States do not allow, for example, to take paternity leave, 1/4 of Member States do not, 8 Member States do not have paid parental leave. It is clear that today women are not discriminated against because they are women, but because they simply have a different position in the community than men, because they have an irreplaceable motherly role. And related to their role is childcare. Today, 97% of women take care of children on parental leave. So this is the main reason for income differences. Unfortunately, I cannot agree with the unilaterally ideological approach of this report, which does not appreciate the work of caring mothers and parents, and evaluates the traditional division of roles in the family unilaterally, only critically, as stereotypes. Therefore, I will also propose some amendments and, if they are not agreed, I will not be able to support this report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 86, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "Iratxe García Pérez", "mepid": "28298", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, I wanted, of course, to start the speech by thanking the group rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs for the work done on these reports.

Of course we have made progress, of course we are an example regarding our policies in other territories outside the European Union and that one of the fundamental values ​​of the Union is that equality between men and women, equal opportunities and equal rights . But, unfortunately, politics in recent years has caused a serious setback in all policies, both economic and recognition of rights. The austerity policy has been serious with respect to those policies directed to the attention of public services to which, in many cases, women acceded to favor the policies of reconciliation between personal and working life.

Colleagues! Women's rights and equality are issues that should bind us together here in Parliament. Of course, I also regret the words of one of the parliamentarians who pejoratively assessed women and I absolutely do not agree with such statements. However, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the Committee on Women's Affairs is increasingly dealing with ideological issues, and I think this is working against women. In this committee, we should act together on the basis of good practices, because in many Member States there are really very good practices when it comes to women's rights, for example in the area of ​​closing the wage gap. And my homeland, Poland is such a good example of a country where the wage gap is one of the smallest in the European Union. If we manage to maintain the current trend, we will achieve equal wages for women and men in 2021. Let us not ideologize the work of this committee. Let us fight for these wage gaps in all Member States to be as small as possible, for the disproportions in pensions between women and men to be as small as possible. Let us firmly oppose violence against women in every dimension: material, physical and mental. I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that we do not antagonize each other. I address these words especially to the left side of the room: do not exclude the voice of conservatives who believe that the roles of an employee, mother and wife can be beautifully combined. Help women who want to combine these roles, and do not throw leftist ideology into these solutions.

Never like now must we remember that equality in Europe remains a pending task for all. The pay gap should embarrass us as Europeans and it is not a myth, it is a fact, because the figures do not lie. The pay gap in Europe is around 20%. In the case of pensions, it is double, 40%. For those who argue that this is a matter of belief, make no mistake: the devil is in the details. It is not that a European when hired is paid less for being a woman, no. I am going to give you an example: in jobs with a different name but comparable in qualifications, those performed by men are better paid. And that is data. A secretary and an administrative officer with the same tasks and the same responsibility and functions charge differently. A supermarket cashier charges less than a restocker. In other words, it involves, among other things, the description and evaluation of the positions. Do you know what one of the antidotes for this is? Transparency, publish, ask companies to publish the lists of positions, their content and their remuneration. There are those who - at the height of hypocrisy - claim that the gap is due to free decisions by women. Well, some say that we are improving, and it is true, but in an outrageously slow way. The European Commission assures us that if we do not go backwards, it will take 70 years for the gender gap to close. 70 years! We cannot afford 70 years of waiting. It has actually taken a little over 70 years for Mr Korwin-Mikke, who is not here today, to become famous thanks to his despicable xenophobic, racist and sexist claims of him in this House. I thank President Tajani for his apologies on behalf of the European Parliament and I hope to hear shortly about the sanction that will be imposed and I trust that it will be the maximum possible. Because, Mr Korwin-Mikke, even if you are not here to listen to this, I also find it difficult to believe that you and I receive the same salary, that European citizens dedicate the same taxes to pay you and me, and that our vote respective value has the same value. But those are the rules of representative democracy, because there is no wage gap between MEPs. Mr Korwin-Mikke charges the same as Mrs Marine Le Pen or Mr Farage or I or any of us here. The gap that we must truly close in Parliament is the one that ignores or ridicules our work, the one that puts a fair mirror between the citizens and their representatives, the one that only shows Europhobic punches, filonazi sexism or morbid appointments. Because achieving true equality between men and women will not be a victory for one over the other, but a shared achievement. Because we all win with a fairer society that does not waste the talent, effort and competition of half the world.

Fortunately, this act of discrimination has been duly reprimanded by you. Today I would like to address another major problem area: We are observing an increasing feminization of poverty in the EU. It is triggered by the austerity measures imposed in the wake of the austerity policy, particularly in public services and the health system. The austerity policy is leading to a massive wave of privatization, which affects the quality of care and the responsibility for caring for small children and old people in our society is once again incumbent on the families and therefore mostly has to be assumed by women.

We Greens warmly welcome this report because it speaks a clear language and because it reveals major grievances, especially grievances in the area of ​​inadequate implementation of gender mainstreaming. We all know that gender mainstreaming is actually an obligation of the European Union. We are here, so we have a certain responsibility to actually implement it. But this is also not the case in the EU funds and EU programs in particular, and this is what this report shows. We have a lot of catching up to do here, and of course we are calling for gender mainstreaming to be implemented in all EU programs and all EU funds. An essential key instrument of gender mainstreaming is gender budgeting - I think that has already been mentioned by one or the other today - where we think that the European Commission, in particular, is lagging far behind its implementation possibilities although for years there have been repeated calls from this House, and also from the Women's Committee and other committees, to apply gender budgeting not just in the areas where it is easiest or most obvious, but really in all programs.

Double objective: first, to deconstruct what has been established, even if, for that, we must deny even the natural law; secondly, to rebuild ideology with great blows, all this while giving as a guarantee the defense of noble ideals. The titles evoke great causes, the content more resembles a series of communitarian demands. The report by MP Kozłowska-Rajewicz takes stock of equality between men and women in access to goods and services. Good concrete proposals are made in favor of working women and mothers, on the creation of reception infrastructures for their children or the social and legal protection of the latter. But, quickly, the ideology emerges: we no longer speak of equality between men and women, but of the fight against discrimination based on sexual practice, gender reassignment or gender. MP Moody's report criticizes the use of EU funds on gender equality. While I share his criticism of the lack of control, I cannot help but note the many communitarian paragraphs. You want to strengthen the “Asylum, migration and integration” fund by creating specific funding to ensure the safety of migrants and refugees. Nice gesture, if it was not done to the detriment of all citizens of the European Union! Indeed, AMIF represents 510 million euros, just for the situation in Greece, to finance the relocation of migrants who entered illegally. 500 euros per head, the gift is indeed beautiful, but salty for the European taxpayer. You don't stop there. You are asking for the payment of 18 million euros to the Daphne program, which aims to fight gender discrimination. Here we are again. It is nevertheless symptomatic: the FEMM commission cannot help but refer to gender, the product of an ideology which aims to make believe that the individual is no longer a boy or a girl at birth, by virtue of of his sex, but a being brought to define himself, as he sees fit, according to his desires and his sexual practices. Yes, men and women are equal before the law, and no, their sexual practices have nothing to do with this sacred equality. In the report by Deputy Urtasun, you are heading in the same direction. Discrimination against LGBTI people, categorized by you, would be the consequence of their sexual practices. You call for penalizing so-called homophobic attitudes, which would give an LGBT man or woman a special right by virtue of their sexual practice. For the commission, which claims to be the champion of equality between men and women, it is funny. Under the pretext of fighting against inequalities, your ideological blindness leads you to categorize people according to their situation and to pit them against other categories: women against men, migrants against Europeans, LGBTI against heterosexuals, And the list is long. Finally, you attack conscientious objection, and this is very serious.

This evening, we are debating three reports which were discussed and then voted on in the Committee on Women's Rights. I will start my remarks with a few words on the report by our colleague Moody, words which I will say in replacement of our colleague, Barbara Matera, who was the shadow rapporteur of the EPP Group on this report, and who cannot be with us this evening, because of the birth of her child. The Moody report is devoted to the need to integrate the gender dimension into the European Union budget as a horizontal policy objective. Certain European programs, foremost among them the \"Rights, equality and citizenship\" program, as well as the Horizon 2020 program, contain specific actions in favor of equality between men and women. The first program is absolutely essential for funding actions to combat violence against women; the second, Horizon 2020, offers opportunities to develop funding actions to promote female entrepreneurship: two major causes that are among the key priorities of the PPE group. In the work on the Moody report, we wanted, as a group, to underline the major role played by the European Social Fund in the financing of projects to fight against discrimination against women, in the financing of projects promoting the 'Men and women equality. We also wanted to draw attention to the need to focus, perhaps more, the various European funds dedicated to actions in favor of equality between men and women, on projects which are truly concrete, for which studies impact and feedback made it possible to see that there was a real effectiveness and real positive feedback.Once again, it is important that, indeed, European funds take this priority action very seriously, but at the same time we must know how to keep reason and be thrifty when it comes to the management of European taxpayers' money.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 99, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "Vilija Blinkevičiūtė (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "96681", "text": "- Thank you, p.

First of all, I would like to thank all three rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs for their great work and reports, but despite the various pieces of legislation, recommendations and strategies in the field of gender equality, the reality is that we are only halfway to achieving gender equality. the progress that is being made is simply insufficient. There is still no progress in reducing the gender pay gap. Some countries may be performing better, say, but according to the latest Eurostat data, in some Member States this gap has even widened over the last five years, which of course affects both lower women's pensions and higher female poverty. . It must also be acknowledged that it is more difficult for women to reconcile work and family responsibilities. The worries of childcare, upbringing, and nursing of family members usually lie on their shoulders. As a result, their professional careers and social security are affected, and, Commissioner, we look forward to the package on reconciling work and family life promised by the Commission at the end of April and to the proposal for four directives. I would like to draw one more thing and simply call on the Member States to take concrete measures to combat violence against women. Indeed, it is very important that the Member States ratify the Istanbul Convention on Violence against Women without delay, as so far only half of the countries of the European Union have taken such a decision.

On the one hand, this is incredibly encouraging as it demonstrates the broad recognition that inequality is unacceptable in this day and age. But on the other hand, it is also a little bit sad, as despite the overwhelming consensus that there is absolutely no reason why women should be treated differently or be more restricted in their life choices than men, women are still battling to put an end to unjustifiable forms of gender discrimination. This I find quite exasperating. Of course, putting an end to gender inequality is not easy. It is a sad truth that such inequality is so deeply embedded in our society that it has become a form of socialisation that many are simply unaware of. Choices made in education and decisions taken with regard to work-life balance are all, to an extent, influenced by some form of gender stereotyping which can lock women into situations or careers where they are at an unfair disadvantage to men. From society, women and girls need positive role models to help them see beyond such entrenched stereotypes. From Member State governments, they need a level playing field that allows them the chance to pursue careers and shine, based on merit alone. The increased willingness and growing urgency of action opens the door for change. However, unless this willingness translates into meaningful action there is absolutely no guarantee that gender inequality will be fully resolved. It is Member State governments that will make this happen most quickly and most appropriately.

Tomorrow we will be voting on three important reports. Each one is geared towards empowering women and reducing gender discrimination in various areas. An important point in all of these matters is how we as politicians take gender mainstreaming into account in our daily work. Because when it comes to formulating political goals and implementing them in practice, the differences between men and women are still all too visible. We must therefore take greater account of the different difficulties women and men face in all areas of life - in this context, above all, the reality that women face. European equality laws are not always uniform enough and implementation needs to be improved. The independence and resources of European gender equality agencies also need to be strengthened. I am therefore looking forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in Parliament, the Commission and the Council to further reduce these differences between women and men.

Also in the access to medical goods and services, situations of discrimination and differentiation continue to occur - practices that deserve vigorous repudiation and that must be eliminated; practices that highlight, as evident, the need to reinforce access to free and quality public services, namely in sectors such as health or maternity and child care support services. But it is necessary to remember that inequalities between men and women have deepened in the most elementary levels of life, in an unprecedented civilizational setback, and that this reality cannot be disconnected either from the policies of exploitation and profit, or from the policies of the Union European Union, namely austerity and impoverishment policies that promote low wages, job insecurity and job deregulation and working hours.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 103, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "Jordi Solé (Verts/ALE).", "mepid": "185974", "text": "   – Mr President, may I thank all the rapporteurs for the good work they have done.

I find it extremely hypocritical that the EU wants gender quotas in boardrooms, but that you are more than happy to take away one of the few advantages that women could have had and that was justifiable so long as it was proven by credible data. What was once a transparent way of calculating premiums has now led to insurance companies finding hidden alternatives, for example, basing premiums on employment sectors which have a higher percentage of males and females. The final report on gender equality calls for gender quotas on boards of listed companies and encourages Member States to dissolve companies that do not tick those boxes. It goes on to call for gender quotas for elections and in the explanatory statement it talks about the division of household responsibilities.

The statistics that the Commission has presented to us for the two-year period 14-15 are not, colleagues, too encouraging. The data is improving, of course, but it is improving too slowly and, after all, it is not just statistics that are needed to tell us how things change so slowly; we don't need statistics to tell the hard work that is still made to be a woman. This is what our daily life tells us, the daily life of our friends, our sisters, our fellow citizens and the women we meet every day on our path. Our life here also tells us about it, when we hear violent words, unacceptable words, shameful words, which we heard some time ago. And then we are aware, today more than ever, that the work we have to do, that the road that leads to full equality is still a long way, it is still a tortuous road; there are many things to do and we find many of the things to do in these reports, which we hope will really serve as a stimulus to the Member States to do things, to guarantee those rights that are still shamefully denied to many women. I am thinking, for example, of the rights to sexual and reproductive health which are still denied today, colleagues. And then the things we have said are all important things, you have said so many significant things. But I want to remember the last, the last important thing: the achievement of absolute equality between men and women cannot be separated from a real and authentic fight against gender violence, which still seems to be today a virus that takes on new forms; I think about violence on social networks and bullying.In short, there is still a lot of work to be done, but we are here, colleagues, and we are ready to do it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 108, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "Jana Žitňanská (ECR).", "mepid": "124901", "text": "- Mr President, when we talk about equality between men and women, I cannot fail to mention one very important issue, namely the differences between men and women in the payment of pensions.

I know that, in this context, several Members are reluctant to look at non-traditional, flexible working hours. Personally, however, I do not agree with this view. I think that flexible working, for example in the form of part-time work, can be very helpful, for example, for parents of younger children who want to better organize their own work-life balance. I will be happy if we succeed in promoting that we can make better use of the opportunities offered by flexibility in organizing work in our countries, and at the same time that we do not deprive women of retirement age.

They become fathers and mothers, and they don't want the whole of society to be turned upside down because of a few exceptions and small minorities, and that too for a lot of money.

Of course, a lot of progress has been made, but we still have a long way to go to achieve fair equality between women and men. Among the many debates that these reports give rise to, some themes are dear to me. Among these, the right to abortion and access to reproductive rights. Of course, I cannot speak of these rights without thinking of Simone Veil, a woman who has so marked our continent and this hemicycle over which she so brilliantly chaired. I understand that in the name of the principle of subsidiarity or out of religious conscience, some national delegations have different positions. However, as long as the right to abortion and access to reproductive rights are discussed in this Chamber, I will proudly vote in favor. For me, this is a fundamental right which, in the face of the radicalization of certain political currents, today needs all the more to be claimed and protected. It’s a matter of common sense. The place of women in the economy and in business is also one of the points on which France can be proud of having made progress. Thus, the Copé-Zimmerman law, since 2011, institutes the obligation of a balanced representation of women and men on the boards of directors and supervisory of companies. We are pleased that the texts of the European Parliament and of the Commission now recommend this.

I would like to thank the rapporteur, Agnieszka Kozłowska-Rajewicz, for the good cooperation on her report on equal access to goods and services, as she, like me, aims to achieve equality for all people in Europe. The implementation of the principle of equal treatment is an indicator of the level of development of democracy. It is therefore particularly regrettable that in many cases discrimination still determines people's everyday lives. Because who doesn't know that: the disposable razor for women costs a lot more than the same product that is available for men. The short haircut for a woman is quite a bit more expensive than the same haircut for a man and so on and so forth. We can all cite countless examples from our everyday lives. This is our reality. It has been ten years since the directive on equal treatment for men and women in access to goods and services had to be implemented. Much has happened. But of course there are still numerous pitfalls that everyday life offers, and in many cases these differences are practically burned into our society and perceived as so normal that you often no longer notice them. In public spaces, it is often mothers and breastfeeding women who struggle with discrimination. You cannot use many services and are sometimes simply left standing at the airport, for example, despite a valid ticket. Women are also affected by higher costs and different pricing for insurance and credit products. The prices of other goods and services are also often set on a gender-specific basis, and there are still these explicit exceptions in the area of ​​media, advertising and education.

Next, there are a few points where there are movements in society and in politics that run counter to the rights of women and others, such as the LGBT, and emphasize traditional roles.

Thanks to Mr Ernest Urtasun, our rapporteur. Today we are talking about equality between women and men. I would then like to highlight a special aspect of it, namely mental illness. As a green member, I really see that well-being and balance in life are linked to a sustainable society. Mental illness is a major growing problem, especially among young people, and men and women are affected differently by inequality. We need to stop hatred and threats online. Women's double work makes them extra vulnerable to mental illness. We need to better equip our young boys, as loneliness, crime and addiction are grossly overrepresented among men. Combating mental illness at the gate is about a sustainable society - a society where everyone has room to grow based on their special conditions. We must put people at the center in a completely new way. It is about tackling poverty and poor conditions in the labor market, but also about fighting violence and discrimination. I want to see large investments in the female-dominated sector and reduced working hours. Of course, I want all parents in my Europe to have the right to parental leave.

There are several reasons for this, we heard it here tonight from our commissioner Jurova, but also from other colleagues. I will once again list just a few to perhaps reflect on: discrimination in the workplace that can be both direct and indirect and that is prohibited; the fact that different jobs and different sectors in which women work are paid less than those in which men dominate; repeatedly mentioned by the fact that workplace practices and the pay system are such that women do not have the same access to training, employee rewards and funds. In addition, the jobs that women do and women's skills are underestimated and are less valued because they are seen as an expression of innate female characteristics rather than acquired skills and competencies. We also know that there is a shortage of women in managerial positions, that there are not enough of them in politics and the economy, and that only one third of women are scientists, engineers in the European Union. Gender roles and traditions influence career choices and educational pathways. And another reason, or cause, is the reconciliation of work and family obligations. This has been discussed several times. Women work shorter and often full-time jobs, and the pay gap increases even more when women become mothers. What I would like to appeal to once again today is that we respect the fundamental value of the European Union, and that is equality between men and women, that we finally implement the fifteen directives we have in this area, and I believe we will succeed soon. , but we must be in solidarity and work together.

Women’s rights are human rights. We must therefore use this as a rallying cry to mobilise a new generation of feminists to stand up for what is right, and I mean old feminists and young feminists, women feminists and men feminists.

The promotion of gender equality also needs a budget, Commissioner, and I therefore consider it pertinent to request funding for specific measures involving non-governmental organizations, local and regional authorities for education. Gender imbalance, in fact, can be seen in the European institutions and I think it is necessary both at national and European level to find ways to balance.

Obviously abortion is an act of violence, primarily against the unborn child, but we do not realize to what extent abortion legislation itself is a source of coercion against women. If the so-called abortion is done by law, the mother may be persuaded by the feral partner, may be persuaded by the family, may also, unfortunately - which is particularly dramatic - be persuaded by a doctor, and often fall victim to structural pressure. The whole abortion mentality created by this legislation causes the woman to be cornered. It is also depressing - and this is the top of everything - that doctors who want to respect and protect life have been attacked many times here.

We desperately need to see progress. But it is not only progress in terms of statistical data, but also progress in terms of improving the atmosphere in our society. And here you all know that we are in a very difficult era of a worsening atmosphere in society, so we need to be much stronger in combating all the factors which create this worsening, including online, which is a big topic that has not been covered here. However, I strongly disagree that what we do is only words. We take a lot of concrete actions. By the way, apart from words, what is stronger than the words we have? I esteem so much, I value so highly the fact that President Tajani today apologised for the shameful statement which we heard here last week. These are strong words which show the whole of Europe the values we stand for. It is very important that we are brave enough to say the words we believe in, and we do a lot of concrete things to fulfil the promises we make. The debate showed that we are addressing the proper problems with our strategic engagement, because as you know, there are four priorities: equal pay for equal work; increased employment of women and their economic independence; relevant representation of women in decision-making positions; and significantly decrease the level and scope of violence against women in Europe. We need to use all the instruments we have, not just legislation. You have also rightly declared here repeatedly that what we need is proper enforcement of the current legislation. We have a lot of anti-discrimination pieces of legislation, and we need to be much better in enforcement. We also have to use other instruments to better target the problem in individual Member States. That is why we are more frequently using the so-called country-specific recommendations, which last year addressed the specific problems in Member States. But we need to address the issue of the atmosphere in society. We need better funding; we need to fund proper campaigning to address the main problems. You know that we are now organising a very strong – and I would say loud – campaign which shows that we have the goal of zero tolerance to violence against women. We are funding and we are organising the campaign in all the Member States, again targeting specific forms of violence in the Member States. I would like to say that in the proposals of this Commission you can hardly find any cases of positive discrimination. Please, read the latest version of the Women on boards directive. This is gender neutral. We want diversity on boards. You cannot find anything which could be called social engineering. Believe me, as somebody coming from a former totalitarian country, I am extremely sensitive about this, and in our package to enable the people to better combine work duties and family life, we are very careful to open up the choices so that people can choose how they want to live. If mothers want to stay at home with the children, they can. If they want to go to work, they should not be prevented from doing so by the barriers which are still present in the EU. This is why I am very sensitive about everybody who criticises the Commission for engaging in social engineering, because simply it is not true, and I am happy to present this in the new package on work-life balance. Last comment on EU funds: I worked for almost 20 years in the field of EU funding, and I remember times when there was a goal which was called gender equality. As applicants for the money, we were ticking the boxes: gender-equal project? Yes! It was so artificial and so discouraging for all those who really wanted to do something to help gender equality. I am one hundred per cent for better use of EU funds, better policy and better achievement of goals in gender equality, but let us do it in an effective and efficient way so that we are not using the EU money for counterproductive results. So thank you for your comments. After every discussion on gender equality, I am more encouraged and more inspired to do the everyday work. I am looking forward to further cooperation with you.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 137, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "Ernest Urtasun", "mepid": "124972", "text": "speaker. - Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank all the contributions to the debate. I think it has been an important debate. Sometimes I have to admit that I have the feeling that, as a relatively young person who takes many things for granted in our society, sometimes we find ourselves defending elements of equality between men and women that we thought we had already achieved, and having to face demonstrations like that of our Polish colleague - as many of you have mentioned - it is obviously deeply shocking. By the way, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Avaaz's campaign to collect signatures in favor of sanctions against the deputy - which I think a lot of people have signed - and also, therefore, urge Mr. Tajani to have this sanction, which he will announce this week, be as forceful as possible. What I would like to do is invite everyone, parliamentarians, but also especially the Commission and the Council ... Look, we have two options: or wait 50 or 70 years to reach equality in terms of the pay gap, pension gap, etc., which are the calculations that the Commission itself has made about what period we will need at the current rate, or do something. And doing something means getting down to work on one thing the commissioner has said: better apply the legislation. Yes, but also, Commissioner, making laws is important. I already know that many things do not depend on you, most things are blocked in the Council. We are perfectly aware, but we do wish that, at the very least, we could work hand in hand with the Commission and Parliament to get some things done in the Council.

Commissioner, Ladies and Gentlemen! Firstly, I would like to thank once again all those who contributed to the final version of the report on equal rights for women and men in access to goods and services. Not only parliamentarians, but also advisers, the administration, which also worked very hard. As our discussion today is of a ritualistic nature, I would like to draw your attention to two general matters in this conclusion. First, the absolutely crucial issue - and this is also emerging from today's discussion - is to deal with the work-home tension, this home-work conflict that has dragged on from the very beginning. The first emancipated women fought for the right to education and to work, and today we here in Parliament, with the matter largely settled, are fighting for the right to motherhood and to have a family on some rational terms. Let it not be a double job, that it would not be a double burden on women, but that it would be more just and rational. This issue of reconciliation is absolutely crucial. I very much appreciate and look forward to the further action of the European Commission on the roadmap on this matter. The issue of maternity and parental leaves, flexible working hours, the home worker market, nurseries, kindergartens and nursing homes is also always topical. The second thing that is absolutely crucial is respect for the law. We really do have the right to equal treatment of women and men and to equality in many places, but this right is still not implemented. Commissioner! It calls for hard provisions, very specific provisions, not recommendations. Because every time we have recommendations, we are met with disregard, non-respect, omission or bad interpretation. If we only have a recommendation and not a hard recipe, there will always be some Korwin-Mikke that he had wanted to be the misogynist king here a week ago.He's not with us today.Probably on TV or radio.I would also like to call on the media not to invite people who are sexists who do not represent Parliament's position and that they do not promote such an attitude.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 139, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "Clare Moody", "mepid": "124944", "text": "   rapporteur. – Mr President, this has been a very interesting debate.

I welcome the Commissioner’s recognition that this report is timely in relation to discussions on the EU budget, and that we should use all means available. The budget must be seen as part of those ‘all means’. If we are to make progress, we have to adopt gender mainstreaming across the whole budget, using the many gender budgeting tools that have been proven to work. Unless we recognise the hidden and unintended consequences of the way the budget is used, we will always fail to address our goal of defeating inequality.

I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Gomes, and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for having dedicated their time and energy to this topic. We are facing a new technological revolution driven by big data, artificial intelligence and robotics. Big data and artificial intelligence holds huge potential for our strong industrial base and for the public sector and can help solve societal challenges, whether it is better health care, combating climate change and protecting the environment, more efficient transport, agricultural productivity – and the list can go on. As with any major technological development, there are significant challenges that we must deal with. I fully share the focus of the Parliament on the need to ensure trust. Big data needs a high level of personal data protection and strong security. In this regard the EU data protection reform the Parliament and Council adopted last year sets the highest data protection standards in the world. For example, the regulation reinforces the tools allowing people to keep control over the use of their personal data. It will be easier for citizens to obtain the rectification or deletion of personal data. The regulation also introduces the right to portability and clarifies the notions of consent, profiling and transparency. Data protection by design and data protection by default become essential principles. This helps businesses to develop new methods for security and protection of personal data. For the use of big data analytics, anonymisation and pseudonymisation are very important. The General Data Protection Regulation promotes the use of such measures, rendering impossible the identification of the individual and disguising the identity of the person while keeping the data retraceable. Data security measures such as encryption are also a useful tool to adequately protect personal data. As regards law enforcement, the data protection police directive stresses that where decisions with legal effects are taken on individuals, they are given the right to obtain human intervention. The principles of data processing, such as purpose limitation, no excessive collection, data security must be fully respected. In order to ensure that the legal framework is properly applied from its entry into application in May 2018, the Commission’s focus is to work with Member States – with the data protection authorities as well as with businesses and civil society – to ensure that the rules are well understood and that they will be applied in a uniform way all over the European Union. We will also develop awareness-raising activities for citizens. The new rules also require that an appropriate level of security for personal data processing is ensured, depending on the risks and type of processing. And this is also a fundamental data protection principle. Overall, cyber security is also important to ensure confidence, and the EU Network and Information Security Directive is also due for implementation next year. Furthermore, the Commission looks forward to the discussions and adoption of the e-privacy Regulation, which will increase trust in electronic communications services – trust and protection, which must go hand in hand. Finally, the Commission is currently looking at how to ensure the free flow of non-personal data across sectors and across borders within the EU. The Communication entitled Building a European Data Economy was adopted on 10 January this year, and an online public consultation has been launched and is running until 26 April. In the near future, most economic activity will depend on data, but if data cannot move freely, our growth potential is limited. The Communication looks at unjustified data location restrictions, access to data and how more data can become available for use and reuse. The more we have data availability and the more data is used, the better the data economy will develop. It is clear that alongside an adequate legal framework it is essential to take into consideration the ethical dimension of such activities. This is a shared concern across the world, and as politicians we have to remain vigilant on all these aspects.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 161, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "Der Präsident. –", "mepid": "2323", "text": "The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow, Tuesday 14 March 2017.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 162, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "Der Präsident. –", "mepid": "2323", "text": "The next item on the agenda is the brief presentation of Stefan Eck's report on minimum requirements for the protection of farm rabbits (2016/2077 (INI)) (A8-0011 / 2017).", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 163, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "Stefan Eck", "mepid": "124863", "text": "Rapporteur. - Mister President! Rabbits are number two of the most farmed livestock in the EU. However, the sector only generates 1.1% of total European meat production. But we also need binding regulations for niche products, especially when animal welfare and food safety are affected. In 2005, EFSA pointed out that the mortality and disease rate of fattening rabbits is significantly higher than that of all other livestock species - in particular due to the unsuitable battery cages that do not meet the natural needs of these animals. For this reason, the use of antibiotics in high doses is also the rule. I do not need to explain in detail what this means in terms of antibiotic resistance. There is legislation that provides minimum standards for the protection of pigs, calves, laying hens and broilers. But there is no single piece of legislation on minimum standards for the protection of rabbits. In addition, there has been a steady decline in the demand for rabbit meat in recent years, and not without reason. Consumers are demanding higher animal welfare standards, which the Eurobarometer 442 on the attitude of Europeans towards animal welfare made very clear. Consumers want more food safety and they want high quality products. More and more consumers are boycotting rabbit meat because it has become known the cruel conditions under which rabbits are kept. It is not for nothing that more than 600,000 animal lovers from all over Europe petitioned the Commission and the Council to ban battery cages last year. With the own-initiative report, I have pursued the following goals: Firstly, to harmonize the internal market and to respond to consumer wishes for safe food and more animal welfare, in particular by gradually phasing out battery cage management without neglecting the interests of the industry, and secondly, reducing the extreme suffering of this species by introducing animal welfare standards; thirdly, to draw the public's attention to the cruel conditions in rabbit fattening farms. The last goal has already been achieved. The media have taken up the topic and intend to report on the intolerable conditions. The present own-initiative report will of course also be in focus. It is a question of the credibility of this Parliament if a decision is made to ban battery cages for laying hens, but - like the EPP - everything is done to ensure that this method of keeping rabbits is retained for an indefinite period of time. You have to be very far from reality if you don't realize that my own-initiative report does justice to the demand for safe food, the improvement of animal welfare standards and the precarious situation of breeders. But how does the EPP react? Last week she launched an alternative motion for a resolution to thwart a legal provision for a gradual phase-out from battery cage management under all circumstances - in the election year 2017! What is to be made of the European agricultural and animal welfare policy, in which an animal species is deliberately forgotten and these animals suffer immeasurably because there is no legislation? Animal welfare must not degenerate into mere lip service? When we vote on the report in the morning, we should bear in mind that it would be a fatal sign if the European Parliament simply disregarded the wishes of consumers and the requests of animal lovers in a time of ever increasing allegations of remote citizenship. I hope that the citizens of the EU and the 330 million rabbits and rabbit breeders can count on a majority in this House tomorrow.

The report provides a comprehensive overview of all dimensions of the welfare of farm rabbits. Animal welfare forms an important part of the priorities of the Commissioner for Health and Food Safety. The report encourages the Commission to take a number of non-legislative actions such as drawing up a roadmap to include guidelines on good practices and a Commission recommendation relating to rabbit health, welfare and housing. The report also invites the Commission to use scientific evidence as the basis for proposing new measures for housing requirements, for breeding does and for rabbits reared for meat production. I would remind the honourable Members that all farmed animal species, including rabbits, are protected by the rules of Directive 98/58 concerning the protection of animals kept for farming purposes. The directive requires that farmers take all responsible steps to ensure that animals under their care are not caused unnecessary pain, suffering or injury. In addition, in 2005 the European Food Safety Authority published an opinion on the impact of the current housing and husbandry systems on the health and welfare of farmed domestic rabbits. This opinion provides Member States and farmers with data on aspects of farming systems which may put the welfare of the rabbits at risk. The rules of the directive should be seen in conjunction with this opinion. Rabbit production in the EU is essentially concentrated in a few Member States mainly Italy, Spain and France. Against this background and in line with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, the Commission takes the view that the Member States involved are better placed to address the relevant issues concerning rabbit production. As honourable Members will know, Member States are primarily responsible for the implementation of EU legislation. Better enforcement of the EU animal welfare legislation is one of the key priorities for animal welfare, and the Commission has invested substantial resources in pursuit of this aim. This priority is particularly relevant because we continue to see a widespread lack of compliance regarding animal welfare rules across many Member States. In consideration of this analysis and given its limited resources, the Commission does not consider it appropriate to propose an initiative on the welfare of farm rabbits.

Thus, under the terms of this text, financial support may be granted to them from European funds from the rural development component in order to facilitate the transition to a new method of breeding, replacing, in particular, battery breeding by battery breeding. enclosure.

An EU-wide legal provision that benefits animals, farmers and consumers is to be advocated from our perspective. The abolition of the battery cages and the dignified handling of the animals associated with them, a shorter and more comfortable transport and slaughter under anesthesia with the least possible stress are those points that were particularly important to us for animal welfare reasons and which were also met by the report. The report benefits the consumers because, on the one hand, the need for antibiotics would decrease through a switch from cage breeding to enclosure systems.

As many of you know, equidae have and still do play a vital role in many EU Member States. Sometimes this is out of necessity, as forms of transportation and agricultural assistance, but other newer roles have also emerged such as in research, therapy and rehabilitation. For example, in Bristol, in my constituency in the UK, Spiritus Equis offers equine-assisted therapy to help young people with substance misuse and offending behaviour. Equidae – horses in particular – are also prominent in the betting and sporting world, and for many owners, myself included, equidae are kept for leisure and more recreational purposes. Through such versatility, equidae have come to possess vast economic potential. Today the equine sector adds over EUR 100 billion to the EU’s economy each year and is a leading rural employer in many EU Member States. However, despite the varied roles, close relationship and at times dependency we share with these animals, in too many cases equidae are faced with a number of severe welfare concerns that serve to adversely impact the entire sector. Such concerns include neglect, overwork and inappropriate living conditions. These problems can be found across the breadth of the equid sector and occur due to a multitude of reasons: ignorance, lack of education, over-breeding and economic hardship. Europe’s citizens want to see more action on animal welfare. With this report I believe that we have a golden opportunity to not only substantially improve the lives of the seven million equidae currently living within the EU, but also by better caring for these animals we have a chance to unlock the full economic potential of this sector and provide a much-needed boost to the rural economy. It is a win-win for all involved. I would like to emphasise at this point that this report does not intend to call for additional legislation but rather to improve existing provisions, particularly their enforcement. In fact, equidae are broadly covered by a number of legislative acts pertaining to their health and welfare, and whilst better implementation and enforcement of existing law would help remedy some of these problems, it is not clear within the scope of the existing treaties where added European legislation could, or should, add value. Rather, I firmly believe – and this is a belief that fundamentally shapes the nature of this report – that value can be added by tackling ignorance and by encouraging and facilitating the spread of best practice and good guidance. This will provide both commercial and recreational equidae owners with the tools and knowledge to better meet the needs of their animals. For example, knowledge transfer schemes as we see in Ireland are one tool Member States could utilise to share best practices, as well as business models and to foster innovation and new ideas. This is especially important in light of the added emphasis on the need – and, in fact, urgency – to become more environmentally-friendly, a development that the equid sector is not immune to. Such schemes could therefore safeguard the welfare needs of equidae while, at the same time, ensure businesses are viable and are able to adapt to changes in regulation elsewhere. The development of animal welfare indicators will provide the guidance needed to make compliance and consistent enforcement more achievable. An increased number of educational resources will tackle ignorance and thereby correct the current lack of understanding surrounding the care and ownership of equidae. The establishment of animal welfare reference centres will provide a much-needed avenue for the dissemination of guidance. A recommitment from the Commission to the development of a European charter for sustainable and responsible tourism would also be hugely beneficial. Tourists would be empowered to make choices, which will not only reward those enterprises which properly care for their equidae but will also inform and provide peace of mind.

The rapporteur has also touched on the problematic area, such as the transport of these animals.

I will deal with a slightly different aspect from that of animal welfare, which has already been well related: the issue of labeling and traceability, which is also fundamental for horse meat. Although horse meat is considered of particular value, in some countries it is sold at much lower prices than beef, resulting in favorable conditions for fraud to the detriment of European consumers. The same can be said for horse milk as well; often the conditions of the farms where horse milk is produced vary enormously and the levels of control are by no means comparable to those of farms producing other types of milk. Furthermore, the rules governing the treatment of horse milk are unclear and there are no common standards in the Union for inspections and supervision. We must not forget the horse meat scandal and other cases of food fraud that we have already recorded.

After all, the World Organization for Animal Health has already issued guidelines on equidae in May 2016. It is therefore necessary to set up reference centers for animal welfare with a view to improving compliance rates and consistent enforcement. disseminating information and best practices on animal welfare, in particular equidae. In addition, equine owners should have a minimum level of knowledge about equine animal husbandry, while ownership implies personal responsibility for the level of health and well-being of the animals they care for.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 182, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I wish to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and in particular its chairman, Mr Siekierski, and the rapporteur, Mrs Girling, for the report on responsible ownership and care of equidae. This report provides an overview of the role of equidae, mainly horses, in today’s society and the importance of the equid sector in the EU economy. The Commission agrees with the authors of the report that the risk to equine welfare needs to be effectively and specifically addressed by Member States, relevant organisations and, of course, keepers of horses and other equidae. The existing animal welfare legislation concerning the keeping, transport and slaughter of animals provides a solid base for Member States to protect the welfare of horses. The Commission for its part will continue to audit the systems in place in Member States to protect the welfare of animals and will act on its findings as and when necessary. As the honourable Members will know, last year saw the adoption of the Animal Health Law, a milestone in the development of EU animal health legislation, which provides for the responsible ownership of animals and requires keepers of animals to have a minimum knowledge of animal health and welfare. With the adoption of the regulation on animal breeding, specific measures have also been introduced, including for the preservation of the genetic diversity in livestock and equidae. I must also mention the proposal for a regulation on official controls, which we hope to conclude during this week’s plenary. The implementation of this new regulation will provide an opportunity to review the rules on traces and the collection and publication of data on the movements of animals and their products. In addition, a crucial role will be played by the future animal welfare reference centres. The discussion on end-of-life horses and imports of horsemeat from non-EU countries was also very important. In this context, I would remind the honourable Members of the ongoing negotiation on the Commission’s proposal on veterinary medicinal products, which is the suitable forum to address the relevant recommendations of the report as regards the administration of veterinary medicinal products to horses. As rightly pointed out in the report, guidance and education are variable supplements to legislation. In this regard, the Commission actively promotes the exchange of best practices, in particular in the field of animal welfare, and has engaged in an enhanced stakeholder dialogue on relevant welfare issues. The recommended preparation of guidelines on good practices in the equine sector can be considered after the legal framework has been established. However, given the wealth of available advice for keepers of horses and other equidae in almost all Member States, I would say that the EU added value of having such guidelines is not so apparent. Let me be clear: the rising number of cases of compromised equine welfare is primarily caused by economics-related choices rather than a lack of accessible information. As regards the international dimension of the report, the Commission would refer to various international agreements to which the EU and the Member States are party, such as the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. Meeting our international obligations should not prevent us from adopting higher standards where necessary to protect animal and public health and animal welfare, but such higher standards should, first and foremost, be applied within Member States. The Commission will continue to actively promote EU and international animal welfare standards in third countries. Overall, I consider the report to be a balanced overview of the current challenges of the equid sector and note that most of the recommendations to the Commission have already been broadly addressed and will be followed up, together with Member States, relevant organisations and the equid sector. This report will no doubt assist the Commission, Member States and relevant organisations to keep a focus on equine health and welfare.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 183, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "Der Präsident. –", "mepid": "2323", "text": "The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow, Tuesday 14 March 2017.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 184, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "Der Präsident. –", "mepid": "2323", "text": "The next item on the agenda is the one-minute remarks on important political issues (Rule 163).", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 185, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "György Hölvényi (PPE).", "mepid": "124715", "text": "- President!

Only education, dear colleagues, can give young people in Europe opportunities and opportunities for a better life. Investing in education, especially in the digital age, which requires employees to acquire new knowledge, is the European Union's chance to become more inclusive, fairer, more open, but also more effective for its young citizens.

It also notes that the authorities are obstructing the use of minority symbols, including the Szekler flag, that, despite existing laws, there are problems with the use of the mother tongue in the administration and judiciary, but also in healthcare, and complains that an association has not been registered with the court because it contains the word Szeklerland, which does not exist legally, in its name. Numerous other criticisms support this: the problems of the national minorities living in Romania, the 1,200,000-strong Hungarian community, still deserve attention.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 208, "date": "2017-03-13.json", "name": "Nicola Caputo (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124851", "text": "- (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, agri-food is constantly growing and often represents a privileged ground for investment by the underworld, with dangerous impacts also on the health of citizens and on the environment. In Italy the agromafia represents a turnover of about 150 billion per year: parallel production channels, apparently legal, pollute the supply chain with mafia methods, from the appropriation of land and livestock to the control of transport, up to the point of imposing brands and products, studying the orientation of tastes and draining national and European public resources and funding. I wanted to draw attention to this issue to remind you, on the eve of the presentation of the fifth report on agri-food crimes in Italy, that all institutions are called upon to raise the threshold of attention on this phenomenon. Legislation must be in step with the times, taking into account rapidly growing phenomena, such as online sales and the current international export system.

The cases look the same on the hair. Migrants try to enter the UK illegally, enter the cargo hold without the drivers' knowledge, and are then exposed on the British side. Unfortunately, fines are imposed even when drivers have confirmed security checks from French police officers. In addition to drivers, carriers are also financially penalized, which is directly liquidation for many companies. Ultimately, the most affected are honest drivers who lose the desire to work in their field, and some companies are even considering leaving the market.

In an extensive report among the victims, the serious abuses to which these people are subjected, who are in a desperate situation, were presented. As a Romanian who has lived abroad for many years, I cannot accept this situation and see that only one farmer has been convicted so far for abuse, and the only solution found by the authorities was to open a motel for people fleeing by violent employers. I wonder why there is no reaction from the European authorities, especially since these situations have been presented to the European Parliament before. Is this a multi-speed Europe, in which certain citizens are considered second-class citizens, in which their exploitation becomes normal, in which no one speaks and in which there are no solutions to ensure a decent life?

I have spoken to a number of consumers whose mobile providers have informed them that they are planning to change their terms and conditions in order to offer unlimited data to home users while charging an additional price for, and capping, data when users are roaming in the EU. I believe that this is an attempt to circumvent EU law and the roam-like-at-home principle. We need to be tough on these operators. It must be made clear that there is no loophole whereby part of the domestic data allowance could be regarded as a gift or a side benefit and would not count when travelling abroad. The end of the roaming charge, as we all know, was a hugely popular consumer initiative that took many years to complete.
