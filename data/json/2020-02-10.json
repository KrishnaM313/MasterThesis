The defence of democracy and tolerance and our daily commitment to European values are the best tribute to all those who are victims of these tragedies. The transition from opposing power blocs to a union for peace shows how important it is to continue working together for a Europe that puts values and respect for all its citizens in first place.

Since 1 January, the members of the European Commission have been illegal, but no one seems to be moved by it. Article 3 of the Commissioners' Code of Conduct requires them to publish their updated declaration of financial interest every 1 January, but none have done so. This oversight is not anecdotal. Several months ago, our Parliament demanded that several commissioners resign from boards of directors and sell shares that are sources of conflict of interest with their duties. However, if we look at the statement available online for the Commissioner in charge of digital taxation, this statement still indicates, for example, that he owns more than 100,000 euros of shares at Amazon. To fail to give evidence that this commitment, among others, has been kept, is to maintain an unacceptable doubt about the independence of the Commission.

While his words were closer to vulgar lyrics by rappers than to Victor Hugo's prose, they are the freedom of expression, the freedom to criticize a religion. Under no circumstances can these words justify death threats. Very few voices rose in France to defend Mila. For the dominant doxa, everything is criticised, we can make fun of everything except Islam. Some are prepared to reintroduce a crime of blasphemy in France, but on the condition that it applies only to Islam. This story illustrates, once again, the intellectual inconsistency and cowardice of our so-called elites. We reject this submission to an Islamo-leftism, to a communitarianism that has settled in our country, to a great cowardice that makes that politicians no longer want to impose a French way of life, an identity, a history.

The Spanish government, after denying the facts, has given more than six different versions, the last of which acknowledged that one of its ministers met about half an hour with Maduro's number two. This breach of EU law also occurred days after this Parliament recognised Juan Guaidó and urged the Council to tighten sanctions against the Maduro regime. In the face of this, we request that this Parliament debate this situation so that the Commission and the Council can report on the explanations received by the Spanish Government and assume, as it implies, whether it considers them sufficient or not. Because it is the Member States that are responsible for enforcing the sanctions determined by the Council and this Parliament, and if they did not, they would be turning these sanctions into wet paper by losing their full effectiveness. Because how effective can sanctions be when any government can breach them with impunity and without any consequence?

This is the first free trade agreement (FTA) that will come with the Commission’s mandate.

Also in January, this House voted on a report calling for streamlining human rights into all its policies. However, unfortunately, they’re not being streamlined into the FTA with Vietnam, because we have seen a lot of human rights violations – also just recently with the crackdown of a peaceful protest in January – and we’ve been asking for a firm and sanctionable commitment from the Vietnamese Government to improving the human rights situation.

The rules were created as a response to a deep economic and financial crisis and, after ten years, I think we can give a clear picture of how these rules have been functioning.  I think we had good results, first of all, in better coordination of fiscal policies, both on timing and on their content, among Member States, through the Semester and the whole surveillance process. Second, we were able to reduce our deficit—to—GDP ratio. I remember that in 2011, only three countries were respecting the rules on deficit—to—GDP. In the last assessment, not a single country was not respecting these rules. Third, I should say that all Member States that received financial assistance were able to return to the market, with enormous difficulties from a social point of view, but they have, at least, returned to the market. After good results, we have also had mixed results in our ten years’ functioning. First of all, I would say, on the reduction of debt, yes, debt was reduced from an average of 90% to an average of 80%, and this could be a satisfactory level if we consider other global economic players. The United States has 115% debt and Japan has 240% debt. But we know that, in this average reduction, we were not able to reduce high debt in several countries, so the discussion is still open. There were also mixed results because of the complexity of these rules. Complexity could also be an intelligent way to deal with problems but, if complexity is too complicated, in the end, it reduces ownership and confidence from Member States and stakeholders towards our rules.  Finally, we had clear shortcomings, first of all, because we were reducing our public investments. Our public investments are not yet at the level they were 20 years ago. Second, because we were not able to reduce surpluses in countries with a high level of surpluses, and, third, because, in general, we had pro—cyclical fiscal policies during this period and monetary policy is now at its lower bound. If we are not able to have anti—cyclical policies, this creates constraints in our general economic situation. So, good results, mixed results and shortcomings. What next?  I think we live in a very different economic world from the one from ten years ago. We were able to overcome the deep crisis and we had several years of stable growth in all Member States. We have now been in a period of slower growth for a couple of years. The picture for the next months, and perhaps a few years, is characterised by uncertainty, uncertainty for internal reasons – I think we all saw the bad results in the last quarter of last year in some important European economies – and uncertainty due to external factors: trade relations that are not solved, Brexit, which is an open debate, and the consequences of the coronavirus. It is obviously too early to assess them, but for sure they contribute to this uncertainty. In these uncertain times, I think we need a framework capable of avoiding what economists call a ‘low for long’ situation: a long situation of low growth, low inflation, low interest rate. This could be inconsistent with the strategy that we have in the green transition and in the digital transition. For this reason, the debate we are opening is very important, and we will define the scope and the conclusions of this debate during the next months in this process. In conclusion, I would particularly underline two key words. One is ‘investments’. We have to find ways to facilitate investments, especially those connected to the strategy of the Green Deal, which President von der Leyen rightly calls our new growth strategy. Second is ‘simplification’. To promote simplification of these rules is also to promote their ownership. I think that to facilitate investment and make our rules simpler is something that should not divide our discussion into different camps, but is something on which we should work together to find a solution.

The rules are very complex, they are non-transparent, they are sometimes pro-cyclical in their effect, and even in good times – you said that we have now had a period of growth – they have not contributed to a sufficient reduction in deficits and total debt levels. However, the conclusions drawn by the Commission in its key questions and comments for the consultation from these findings have relatively little to do with the problems described. The Stability and Growth Pact does not have a problem of flexibility – the last Commission has already extended what is possible in terms of flexibility; the Stability and Growth Pact has an enforcement problem. The rules do not need to be made more flexible, but they must be applied! And if we want to tackle the problem of excessive indebtedness effectively, then of course there is no point in excluding certain types of expenditure from the debt rules, and that will even have the opposite effect. Let me be clear: debt is debt. Any kind of new debt affects a country's debt sustainability, whether it finances sustainable investment or not. In the end, the question of whether the debts can be serviced and repaid is the only issue of interest to the financial markets, namely those that lend money to the Member States. Before the financial markets turn the tap on money, they will not ask whether or not they have been financed and invested sustainably here.

A Dutch folk wisdom reads: \"Good example does good follow\". But that is disappointing in this respect. Several countries have not used favourable economic time or have not used enough to implement reforms and reduce budget deficits. I would therefore like to give you a few points for this review.  First of all, for the effectiveness of the budgetary rules and the credibility of the European Commission, it is crucial to me that the rules are transparent and can be enforced. Secondly, the rules should be made simpler and less complex. The review should ensure sufficient countercyclical fiscal policy. Thirdly, the rules should not be more flexible or interpreted more broadly, as far as I am concerned. Appointment is just an appointment.  I am therefore also very critical of the European Budget Committee's proposal to place investment outside the scope of the Pact. As far as I am concerned, this is an open invitation to a kind of creative accounting that has already led to quite a bit of drama. Finally, a European stabilisation function is really unnecessary. As far as I am concerned, Member States must absorb the shocks themselves. That is why each Member State must have its own house in order.

Madam President, for the past three months, the French have been demonstrating in the streets in songs, in dances, against pension reform. For the past three months, they have been fighting against a reform that will make them work longer for pensions of misery. This reform does not come out of nowhere, it is directly inspired by the recommendations of the European Commission and its budgetary control procedure. I have here the recommendations made by the European Commission to France, and it is written in black and white, page 6: the reform of the pension system could alleviate the public debt. Understand: we need to save money on our pension system - and that is exactly the ambition of the French system. But the Commission does not stop there. Page 5 reads: the reduction in public debt will depend on the government's ability to meet the spending targets set for the pension system. Understand: Public health is too expensive. The result: 17,500 beds closed in six years and carers on strike for a year, who are crying out for despair at the abandonment of the public hospital. In the Commission's recommendations, this is the case for all of our public services: social protection, the minimum wage level... Savings, more and more savings. And of course tax cuts for the richest and big corporations. Exactly what Emmanuel Macron's French government is zealously applying. This whole European Semester procedure is based on a single objective: the sacrosanct limit of 3% deficit - a rule fixed one day on a corner of the table, which has no economic basis and which is criticised even by the most liberal economists. The European Commission is now questioning the relevance of these rules. It's about time! But if the revision only sticks - as seems to be the forthment - to the integration of the Un Sustainable Development Goals, we might as well pee in a fiddle.

Budget policy, as an essential instrument of economic management, has an important role to play in a balanced, well-being-oriented economic policy, and any future reorientation of economic governance must therefore primarily aim at socio-political progress and at strengthening social and environmental infrastructure. In the fight against climate change, but also for digital change, we need more European Union to have a Europe-wide coordinated investment offensive, and we need more state for public investment.

This has made the rulebook a policy instrument which, on balance, has had little effect. Worse still, European fiscal rules have brought widespread underinvestment in our public goods. Education, railways, the Internet – everyone suffers from it. Between 2009 and 2018, the government investment ratio actually fell – from 3.7% to 2.9%.

I mean, you’re actually proud of the fact that you have reduced excessive deficits, as you call it, but no attention paid to the impact that that has had on citizens: the debts of bankers foisted onto citizens. And the result of that was seen in the election in Ireland over the weekend, where the citizens rose up against economic austerity, against the rules which have prevented investment in social and public housing, with rising homelessness and people’s inability to put a roof over their heads. The Commission says they’re interested in what could be done better regarding economic governance. Well I put it to you: how about changing the EU debt and deficit rules so that they don’t apply, for example, to investment in social housing. You’ve no problem doing it with arms expenditure.

Second, that we should change the fact that they are too procyclical. And third, that we should try to make them less complex. This is a limited base, but it is a base of bridging differences. We have to avoid the idea of the fact that we have two different ideological positions – pro—stability against pro—growth – paralysing all the chance that we have to review our rules in the right direction. I think that the Parliament can give a strong contribution to bridge these ideological differences. There are strong differences that I perfectly understand, but if we are working on reducing complexity, fighting against procyclicality and changing these rules, I think we will work in the right direction. My last point is this: is all this exercise connected to the main defining objective that the new Commission with the Parliament decided, which is the green transition? My answer is definitely ‘yes’, because it’s very difficult to understand how we will be able to lead this transition without having a strong commitment from the point of view of public investment.

Commission proposals on this issue are worthwhile and should be followed up on. But I’m afraid they will not get us far. Stalemate on economic governance results from the incapacity of the eurozone to balance measures which dictate austerity to regions that systemically record structural financial deficits – with measures which have remained soft on regions that show an equally systemic propensity to accumulate surpluses. A monetary zone that functions properly needs to achieve such balance. Clearly current rules in the eurozone are not achieving it.

This is a good opportunity here to present our idea, how to enhance the accession process and how to give a credible EU perspective for the Western Balkans. Let me emphasise that for our geopolitical Commission, the full engagement with our neighbours is a top priority. Europe needs to have a strong united voice in the world and it needs to play its geopolitical role to the fore, especially when it comes to its neighbourhood. This is especially valid where we must engage strongly in pursuit of peace, stability and prosperity. This is in our own interest. It is also a question of credibility. The priority of this Commission is to accelerate progress in the Western Balkans, keeping a credible perspective for future accession. Therefore, we are working on three tracks. The first of these is the communication on the revised enlargement methodology, which I will outline for you in more detail shortly. The second track is opening discussion negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania, before the Western Balkans summit in Zagreb. Ahead of the Zagreb Summit, we will complete the picture with the third track by presenting a major economic and investment development plan for the region. The objective will be to speed up the building of a solid and resilient economy and bring these countries faster and closer to our own standards. When it comes to the first track, the revised enlargement methodology is based on four main principles, four principles that should work both for the accession countries and also for our own Member States. First, the process has to be more credible. Countries need to deliver on the reforms they promised, and the EU needs to deliver when they do so. To help credibility, you will see an ever-stronger focus on the fundamental freedoms and reforms, as this is the core for real transformation. This means the rule of law, but also functioning of democratic institutions, public administration reform and economic criteria. The second principle is about putting the political nature of the process front and centre. We intend to ensure top-level engagement with the candidate countries through regular EU-Western Balkans summits and ministerial meetings. We want to involve Member States more strongly and give them better opportunities to monitor and review the process, to support and keep track of the fundamental reforms needed. The third principle addresses the need to make the whole process more dynamic, with a stronger focus on core sectors. Clustering chapters by policy fields will allow for more thorough political discussions on thematic areas. It will also allow us to identify opportunities for early alignment and involvement in EU policies, such as our digital agenda or our trans-European networks in transport and energy. I also want to highlight that when important reforms have been implemented already before the opening, then the timeframe between opening the cluster and closing individual chapters should be limited, preferably within a year, fully dependent on the progress of the reforms. This is an important political offer from our side to the whole region. If they deliver, we will also be ready to deliver. The cluster on fundamentals, rule of law, economic criteria and public administration reform will of course take a central role. It will be the first chapter to be opened and it will be the last to be closed. And sufficient progress will be needed in these areas before other clusters can be closed. The fourth principle is about making the process more predictable for both sides. This will mean ensuring that candidate countries have greater clarity on the conditions they need to meet and what is the positive impact when there is progress, and what are the negative consequences in case of non-delivery. We need clear and tangible incentives to encourage reforms. If countries move on agreed reform priorities sufficiently, citizens should see the benefits of accelerated integration and phasing into EU policies, markets and programmes, combined with increased funding and investments. At the same time, Member States need to be confident that there is reversibility and corrective measures will be taken where reforms go off track. This will be done through more decisive measures, sanctioning and serious or prolonged stagnation or backsliding. Finally, I have to reiterate that while we are strengthening and improving the process, the goal remains the same: accession and full EU membership. In parallel to this, as the second strand, the Commission stands by the recommendations to open accession negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania, and we hope that these can be opened before the Western Balkans summit in Zagreb. Both countries have delivered on what they were asked. During my recent visit to Skopje and Tirana I underlined the importance of reforms and called for their implementation to continue. Both countries have engaged in further reform efforts. At the same time, to be a credible partner, the EU needs to deliver on its promises as well. The Commission will give detailed information on the progress made by these two countries still in February, in order to prepare the ground for the Council for the decision. We are convinced that any further postponement would entail a strong risk, undermining the stability of the entire region. We would also risk further manipulation by third country actors and others offering false alternative narratives. Finally, on the third track, these substantially transformative reforms that the Western Balkan countries need to carry out can be best supported by solid and accelerated economic growth and developing functioning market economies. Therefore, as input to the Zagreb Summit, the Commission would propose a new economic-based policy approach as the cornerstone of a forward-looking agenda for the region. Our objective is to intensify our presence in the Western Balkans, to increase investment and to help to close the economic development gap between us. We have to look at what concrete measures we can take to bring forward investments in the Western Balkans, to enhance access to the EU single market, create jobs and entrepreneur opportunities, improve the business and the investment climate and stop the brain drain from the region. As you can see, this is an ambitious agenda for the region. We will need the very strong political support of this House to deliver it. We collectively have to regain trust and credibility. This means we have to treat our Western Balkans partners more and more as future Member States, which is our commonly agreed destiny.

I welcome the Commission's procedural proposal, which is capable of moving the issue of enlargement in the Western Balkans from its deadlock. It could form a bridge between member states that support the start of accession negotiations and those that are sceptical of enlargement. The new enlargement methodology is effective, results-oriented and sufficiently flexible to benefit Montenegro and Serbia, and has also accelerated negotiations with this key country for enlargement in the Western Balkans. Commissioner Várhelyi should be commended for come up with a well-established solution in a very short period of time, just in time to break the deadlock at the EU summit in March and to start accession negotiations with Western Macedonia and Albania before the EU-Western Balkans summit in Zagreb. Both countries have delivered, and now it is time for the Union to deliver on its promises so that it does not lose its credibility.

The new methodologies were set only three months after the European Council meeting at which two Western Balkans countries were denied the possibility of starting negotiations. This demonstrates how European Union institutions can still respond at times of crisis. It goes without saying that the primacy of democracy and the rule of law should be placed at the very centre of the enlargement process by opening first and closing last chapters related to the judiciary, corruption and organised crime, as well as respect for human rights and media freedom.  I agree that the new approach introduces some better elements. Above all, it allows negotiating countries to use European Union programmes before accession, such as the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) or the European Green Deal. In essence, the new approach does not differ much in substance from the existing negotiation framework, which became more complex with every new enlargement. It’s also welcome that negotiating countries can already decide for themselves whether they want to negotiate according to the new methodology or not. For example, Montenegro has been negotiating for eight years, and only one chapter remains to be opened. Member States are invited to participate more systematically in the accession process then has previously been the case.  That’s why I hope this document will convince more sceptical Members to open negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania, hopefully at the March Council meeting. It’s clear that the decision to postpone the opening of negotiations directly called into question reform processes in these countries, which have been required for years. That was directly denying support for those who implemented them. The new methodology offers a sustainable model, in that it is now up to Member States to deliver on their promises and thus to restore credibility to the enlargement process as such.

In my opinion, we cannot afford another failure in March. I am in agreement with you when you say that we have to learn our lesson and not promise something that we cannot deliver. But today, we have to see how we can go forward together and deliver on the European aspirations of the people of the Western Balkans, and I hope this time we will not see any last—minute surprises. It is too early to come to a general conclusion on how the new methodology will work, but in order to enhance the effectiveness of the accession process, it should provide dynamism rather than complicating the enlargement process and this must mean a stronger focus on fundamental reforms, the organisation of the chapters in thematic clusters and clear conditionality. I am very much in favour of this new process, but I do not want to see this new idea turn into a new condition that will again leave the region in the backyard of the EU for a long time.  This is what we have tried to propose in our political group. We recently adopted the Renew Europe policy paper on the Western Balkans, which is based on our values and understanding of enlargement. We want the citizens and the societies of the candidate countries to be more closely associated with and benefit from the accession process. We want to integrate our partners there at an earlier stage in key policies, like the Green Deal, digital policies and connectivity, and to give them the chance to reform and benefit long before actual accession. The European perspective is a strong driving force for the reforms of the region. Realising that our group has always pursued a clear and consistent enlargement policy, we believe that reforms related to the EU should go hand in hand with the enlargement process.

Indeed, unemployment, economic deficits, internal and external imbalances expose the region to adverse economic shocks. But is the rule of law just a parameter, or is it rather a guarantee of the stability of inclusion and coexistence in an enlarged system between us? Is it enough for the peculiarities of Albania? At war with itself, between non-existent corruption, secularism and democratic culture, sophisticated criminal organisations, gaps that are currently unbridgeable. Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the Commission persists in proposing a method but fails to deal with the substance of the issues. It was precisely the method that was the apparent reason why the negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia were interrupted a few months ago, but we all know that the future prospects for the accession of these states were worrying. In all this, in the Commission's proposal, the issue of security is only mentioned, given a clear mandate that the citizens of Europe have given us to protect and defend this Europe. In conclusion, Commissioner, I believe that it is insufficient to support the mere promotion of reforms, because the European Union will not be able to face the many uncertainties of the Western Balkans in the course of its work.

Rule of law and media pluralism have been declining since Serbia started negotiations in 2014, yet we pretend as if nothing has happened and continue the negotiations and other chapters, but without the fundamentals we cannot progress in other fields either. With a new approach, we can move forward when we see progress. The more ambitious countries need to be included in as many EU policies as possible. With this, we could gain back credibility and work on real changes in every citizen’s life in the region.  The southeast of Europe needs to become part of our Green Deal if we want to see Europe climate—neutral by 2050. However, we should keep our promises.

It will come as a surprise not to see clusters addressing issues such as security, terrorism, illegal immigration, seconded workers — all of these key issues being referred to the background. On the method, this consolidation of the chapters will only strengthen the power of the Commission.

When we were designing the whole structure of the new methodology, we were very clear that there are no new conditions. This is a question that I received from many of you. We’re still working with the Copenhagen criteria and those are unchanged. They are unchanged, but they are going to be enforced better, more inclusively and more effectively through the better participation not only of our Member States, but also of our public.

I also received a question on how it is possible to start accession negotiations – the Member is no longer here – with countries that have high unemployment.

For our committee, it is of utmost importance that in any future initiative on the matter, we do guarantee not only the free movement of AI-enabled goods and services, but also the trust of the consumer in these new goods and services because the applications are numerous and encompass virtually all sectors of the internal market. We are witnessing rapid development of AI technology. Consumers are being confronted on a daily basis with systems that use automated decision making, such as virtual assistance and chat—bots on websites, and as is the case with all technological advancements, this provides us with opportunities as well as challenges.  AI and automated decision making offers great potential in terms of innovative and higher quality products and services, but at the same time, various challenges need to be addressed in order to realise this potential. First and foremost, services and goods using AI and automated decision making create the risk of consumers being misled or discriminated against, for example, in relation to differentiated pricing. Will consumers be aware of the fact that the price displayed on their screen was adapted to their estimated purchasing power? The same goes for professional services. If important decisions are automated and thus carried out without sufficient human oversight by highly skilled professionals, are consumers aware that decisions affecting their professional, financial or personal lives are in fact not made by humans, and if they feel wronged, will they be able to demand a human review? Will a human, ultimately, be responsible for final decisions or will they be able to reverse them? So my first question to you is: how is the Commission planning to ensure that consumers are protected from unfair or discriminatory commercial practices or from potential risks entailed by AI—driven professional services?  Secondly, we risk that the existing EU product safety and liability frameworks do not adequately cover new AI—enabled products and services. Do concepts such as defective products and the legal provisions built around these adequately cover situations in which harm is caused by products operating under automated decision making? As is the case with other products and services, we should ensure that businesses and consumers are protected from harm and receive compensation if it occurs. This is important in order to ensure secured free movement throughout the single market. Therefore, our second question is: what initiatives may we expect from the Commission side to ensure that the EU safety and liability frameworks are fit for purpose? In that respect, we should ensure that market—surveillance authorities and other competent authorities possess adequate means and powers to act. This is especially important when competent authorities, businesses and consumers do not have access to clear information on how the decision was taken. How will the Commission ensure greater transparency in this respect?  Lastly, talking about biased or unlawfully obtained data sets, the IMCO Committee stresses the importance of respecting regulations such as GDPR when it comes to the collection of data, but also looking at non-personal data use, barriers and requirements. This is something we can and should address at this stage of the design. We should build in these safeguards – privacy by design. So I want to ask: how is the Commission planning to ensure that only high quality and unbiased data set are used in automated decision—making processes?  Dear Commissioner, as I said at the beginning, AI offers great potential in many aspects of our daily lives and many fields of the internal market, yet it confronts us with many new and unknown risks. We should address these risks in an adequate and timely manner because the trust of the consumer will be crucial for the acceptance of these new technologies in our society and economy. I thank you in advance for your answers on these very topical and societally important questions and I, and with me the whole IMCO Committee, look forward to the presentation of your plans next week.

Mr President De Sutter, thank you for your question, which is more than a question, since in fact it covers the whole panorama of what we have been working on for several weeks and even months in the Commission for several weeks and even months, concerning the issues you have raised, and in particular, of course, behind, underlying it, everything about artificial intelligence , data management in a digital economy that will radically change our internal market. The question you are asking, in fact, is how this evolution - this revolution, some will say - will actually change consumer behaviour, but also allow us, and that is what we are working on, to consolidate our entire internal market. For this, of course, the first word, the key word which was, moreover, quite present in your speech, Madam President, is obviously to create a climate of trust. It is true that today there is distrust of artificial intelligence. Our citizens are asking questions, often legitimate, and we are here to try to provide answers — effective answers. It is in this spirit that, as you have pointed out, the Commission will present on 19 February a white paper which will be a kind of targeted consultation, on which we will obviously express our positions, but which is also the way to continue the debate we have this evening and to extend it to listen to all of you, but also to be able to bring solutions together to this absolutely essential development which is now marking our time. First of all, it is obviously a question of properly framing the rules for the development of artificial intelligence in Europe.  On the other hand, it is also a question of ensuring that these rules allow us to foster the emergence of a European artificial intelligence industry.  We have worked a lot, with my colleagues, with all my colleagues, over the last few weeks, and together we really need to ask ourselves the question - as you mentioned earlier - of course, algorithms, when it comes to artificial intelligence, but also the question of data. It is obviously the data that is, I was going to say, the fuel that will allow us precisely, by training them through specific algorithms, to develop specific applications that will obviously intervene in the lives of our fellow citizens. So the interest we're going to have in data, on value-added data, is going to be very important in the communication we're going to do. I would still like to point out, in particular in response to a number of your questions, Madam President, that, of course, we are not starting from scratch. A lot of work has been done, including legislative work, including in this Parliament, of course. First, consumer protection legislation. It also covers business practices, as you referred to, using automated decision-making processes, which can also be invoked in the case of discrimination. Similarly, the regulatory framework now requires professionals to inform consumers, when the price is personalized - as you mentioned earlier - on the basis of an automated decision-making system.  I would also like to mention, of course, the RGPD, which has been rightly talked about and which requires that an impact assessment be carried out when the processing of personal data is likely to pose a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. There are still other requirements that apply to automated decisions made in the context of, for example, e-recruitment. It is obvious that we will have to ensure that there is no discrimination, and therefore understand how these algorithms work, simply so that they respect the whole corpus of European values to which we are so attached. And of course, everything about human interventions that must, once again, allow us to eventually challenge the decision, allow our citizens to challenge the decision if they consider that they are entitled to do so. Finally, I recall the so-called Platform to Business regulation, which was adopted last year and imposes transparency obligations on the ranking carried out by the algorithms of online platforms and search engines. There are a lot of things, but of course we will have to move forward and I would like to say that we will obviously use all of this. We will also reflect together on the adaptation of the General Product Safety Directive, the Directive on machines, as well as the Radio Equipment Directive. The automotive sector is also going to be a very important topic in terms of artificial intelligence and automatic decision-making. Legislators, as you know, have already instructed the Commission to look into the issue of the approval of connected autonomous cars, so we will continue to do so. It may also be necessary to make some clarifications to the Directive on General Product Responsibility in light of the development of emerging technologies and the circular economy. Finally, as you know, the preparation of the Digital Services Act, which we are working on, will allow us to examine with greater attention a series of algorithmic processes, for example recommendation systems, moderation algorithms, or, of course, a very important subject which has been extensively debated in this Parliament, online advertising. There is also a point, if I may, about professional services. The proposed expertise must not only be based on traditional qualifications, but also on a new kind of combination of skills combining information technology, knowledge and, of course, expertise in each sector. I would also like to point out that the white paper on which we are going to be working, which will be brought to your attention, will be followed by action in the fourth quarter, as envisaged in the Commission's work programme, and that, of course, it is from this perspective that we really want to be able to work with you. I know that many of you, ladies and gentlemen, have been working on these issues for several months or even years now.

As we all know, artificial intelligence has multiple practical applications with enormous potential to improve the functioning of our societies and economies. To do this, and that is why I am the first supporter to prioritise it in the European Union, but we have to be vigilant.  We already lost the train digitally when in its anteroom we led the technological market with brands like Nokia, which saw how they lay behind for not paying attention and above all for not looking from the right perspective. Europe was left off the hook. Today we cannot afford to return to the same thing with artificial intelligence. To address this challenge, we must ensure the trust of our consumers. We Europeans are not like Americans or Asians, here we put privacy and transparency before any digital experience.  We must ask ourselves: What does the European Union want to achieve from artificial intelligence? How does the European Union intend to achieve this? And, above all, for what purposes? From here, we ask the European Commission to ask these three questions before starting any initiative and to find the right answers.  Transparency should be the cornerstone of any initiative related to this technology. Without it, consumers will not trust and will not achieve their development or therefore the competitive advantage it can give us over our competitors.

For example, a neural network whose purpose was to distinguish between dogs and wolves learned to differentiate them, not by what normally distinguishes these two animals, but only through their environment. Thus, the images that had grass were classified as dogs and those that had snow like wolves. This example may seem harmless, but it is based on the same learning mechanisms that are implemented on digital platforms and that make decisions in an automated manner. They are the ones who recommend certain products or services to us, make one more visible and hide others. These mechanisms, of course, can also be used with collective benefits, including to improve our public services, if we have some ethical, regulatory and governance precautions. In this resolution, we therefore advocate the need to ensure greater transparency to the algorithms that feed that learning, in order to provide security in the choices of consumers and, above all, trust when they interact with automated systems knowing, for example, whether they are talking to a ChatBot or a human behind that system. We also warn of the impact these systems can have on product safety, as the Commissioner has already said, and on the rules on liability in the event of a defect. And finally, we stress the need for the data, the databases used to train these algorithms, the crucial point, as you mentioned, to be of due quality and to be auditable, with clear governance rules to ensure, as far as is technically possible, the removal of any bias.

If done correctly, they also have the possibility to reduce human bias and human errors in the decision—making process.  But as with any new technology, there will inevitably be legal and ethical questions raised that we must be aware of. Most of these issues can be addressed with the current rules; others may need to be adopted, but we need a measured approach. We need to resist the temptation of over—legislating too quickly for these fast—evolving technologies. This would not only hinder innovation and developments in Europe, but also create more problems than it would solve. Equally, we must not generalise our approach. The rules governing algorithms should be proportionate to the risk taken in using that algorithm. There is a difference between the algorithm of a power grid and the algorithm in a video game.

Because we know that every record collected in an unequal society has a discriminatory effect. For example, women are currently paid less and do more caring work. This fact feeds into the data and leads, if not corrected, to women's incomes, which will continue to be poorly or even less paid. We must resolutely oppose such cases of injustice by law. In the European Union, we have the right to safe products and services. But this right is only worth something if we can enforce it.

Thus, artificial intelligence and automatic decision-making may not lead so much to some flawless society of rationality, but perhaps rather to anchoring the current unjust social state. A state in which greed, deception, and bending of the law win.  We should therefore work to protect consumers from unfair or discriminatory commercial practices or from the risks associated with professional services using artificial intelligence.

Council Directive 85/374 has been providing consumer protection against damage caused by defective products for 35 years and, in view of new automated processes, it is essential to redefine terms such as damage, product, defect, product defect. It should be borne in mind that when making online purchases, the consumer does not communicate directly with the service supplier. The damage is closely linked to liability for damage and, in particular, to the question of the burden of proof, where liability should be objective on the part of the supplier and the supplier should always bear the burden of proof. Updating these concepts is necessary, skut.. the updating of these concepts really needs to be given due, professionally qualified attention and not subject to possible lobbying pressures. This is very important for consumer protection as an entity always in a weaker position.

I, though I belong to the younger generation, sometimes I can't really believe what things are possible today and which weren't before.  In particular, this applies to artificial intelligence. While, of course, it brings a number of benefits in the field of science and technology, which is primarily to reduce the possibility of human error, it also leads to various new possibilities of manipulation and misuse of collected information about consumers. Voice, fingerprint and facial recognition, automatic text translation, autonomous vehicles and home robotics are all benefits we have today from the development of technology and artificial intelligence.  However, there are many problems already mentioned here in the debate, which legislation at EUROPEAN Union level should be addressed. In doing so, we must note that it is always the right and legal system that is casking for the development of technology and this should be taken into account. Of course, there is a need for balance, on the one hand not to present additional and too great restrictions on the development of entrepreneurship, especially when we see how far Europe lags behind the United States and some other parts of the world, but at the same time ensure full consumer protection.  In this regard, I would certainly emphasise the principle of prohibiting aggressive advertising, as it must not happen that analyses of individual consumers' personal data, such as gambling addicts, offer new opportunities to access sites with similar content or offer unfavourable loans to indebted citizens. These are things that are certainly inadmissible and that we have to fight.  Of course, personalized prices that are also made according to someone's profile are also dangerous and represent a form of abuse that needs to be combated. In the end, one must always maintain control over the autonomous decisions of the system, especially in the field of law and medicine.

The point is that, indeed, for the first time in the history of our industrial revolutions, artificial intelligence was not thought out with its regulations and innovation came from the private sector, unlike the great industrial revolutions where the state had a great deal of control over infrastructure and where the cost of building infrastructure was high. Ai has therefore developed, which raises the question for us, the legislators, to get to the bottom of legislation that, year after year, needs to be reviewed according to the uses of this artificial intelligence. This is what, in my opinion, raises the question of trust, in particular, since usages are developing, that, paradoxically, the public power puts a lot of money into innovation and that, paradoxically, we are chasing regulation, behind uses and innovation. I would add on this point, because perhaps that is what drives this European Parliament resolution, that we need to find the right balance between the competitiveness of our companies, public confidence in new technologies and our ability to be forerunners, not followers in globalisation.

I believe that consumers should be properly informed about how it is possible to make the right decision without human intervention. To give just one example, it is increasingly the case that in the medical, legal or technical field, decisions are not made exclusively by specialists, but are taken in an automated form without human intervention. Ultimately, all consumers should have the opportunity to contact specialists who will review the correctness of the decision. It is therefore important that technological progress alone can never fully trigger the human factor.

That is why it is important that the framework we now set applies to all the technology we are going to see, and not just the buzzword of our day: artificial intelligence. Why do we have to do that? We have to do so because a decision does not become infallible from being taken by a computer. Technology is shaped by the same fallacies and prejudices that we humans ourselves are subject to. That is why the technology must be artificial. Maybe it's a bit vintage to talk about code, but we should remember that the responsibility for a code's decisions never lies with the code itself. A decision taken by a code must still be accountable to a person. When a decision is made by a computer, it still has to meet the same requirements as a decision made by humans.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, quite honestly, I do not know many parliaments in the world where we can have a debate of this quality on these subjects today. Beyond our partisan differences, we have all shared, basically, the same questions, the same feelings, the same wills, the same wishes. Deep down, I'm holding one thing back. In this evolution - this evolution that will last, I am not afraid to say, years or even decades, I remember that what the whole of your Parliament shares, and with it the Commission, is the place of man, the place of the human being, respect for our values, respect for who we are, the integrity of our decisions, the understanding of the phenomena that surround us , the intelligence of situations: what happens? Who makes the decisions? Will it change my life? Can I continue to intervene? Can I still turn against a body that has made a decision that is not right for me? All of these questions, ladies and gentlemen, are indeed included in this white paper. I say it again, it is called the white paper on artificial intelligence, but this is only the beginning of our reflection on what I myself have called reflection, the structuring of a new space in which we now work, in which we form, in which we are distracted, in which we exchange, which is the information space. It is superimposed, at the bottom, on the three other spaces that have gradually contributed to forming what we are today, to also organize our life in society: territorial space, first, of course, and then, with conquests, maritime space and airspace. And today, the information space. So yes, artificial intelligence is one of the first elements. I share a second observation, which you all share, and which I am delighted about because it was a fight that I also fought myself. Through the applications that we are going to have to manage, which will shape our decisions and our lives, artificial intelligence applications, or, as you yourself, Madam President, automated decision-making, there is data. We all share this too: no data, no artificial intelligence.  We've been a little too inclined to focus on algorithms, those lines of code, as you said. It's not vintage, the lines of code (maybe tomorrow, moreover, it will no longer be lines of code, when we are in quantum computing, it will be different processes). Today, this is what allows us to work, with this intimate relationship between modeling our environment in the form of 1 and 0 (soon, it will be qubits) and, precisely, the decisions we are ready to make. But behind that, of course, there is data - it has been evoked, by some of you, with the parable or metaphor of the wolf and the dog in the forest. But what did you mean by that? You obviously meant that when you take data that characterizes an animal in its natural environment, if you take the same animal in another environment, obviously, you are going to have differences in the application of the algorithm and therefore the process of what is called the learning phase, machine learning, which will integrate all this data. Yes, data is essential, and that is also the fight we want to fight with the Commission, with you, to define how to characterize this data and our European data. Some people say, I have heard it on the benches of your assembly, that we must not miss this turn. We may have been late, but I don't think so. I do not think we are behind in terms of technology. But in any case, this shift, of this data, we must not miss it. You are right, because the data that is before us and that will allow us precisely to feed intelligently, with data that contains our values, is obviously all the new processes before us, the industrial data, the so-called 'B2B', the public data, the data that will obviously come from the world of health - so important for all of us - , transport... All this data is in front of us. Every 18 months, the number of data that now constitutes the world's information portfolio doubles. So, of course, we must not miss this wave. That wave is precisely what we want to do in the Commission. Several elements: first, of course, do not regulate too much at the exit. It's too early. Today, we are talking about artificial intelligence, an exploitation data, tomorrow we'll talk about something else. On the other hand, we must be careful that everything that comes out is totally compatible with our values and gives citizens the freedom to choose. Remember what I just said: choose. Freedom of choice. Don't be trapped in an algorithm, a system, a data manager, a platform. Having the opportunity to maintain this choice is a fundamental value in the information world. We have to work on it. To have the opportunity to find, in these solutions, what we are attached to. Finally, of course, having the opportunity to do so in complete security - legal security of course, ethical security, but also information security, cybersecurity. These topics are absolutely essential. Through the reflection we propose, there will also be a reflection on infrastructure. We need infrastructure to store this data, to house applications - selective applications, smart applications. We also need to have control over our information systems, supercomputers, learning machines that will drive this data month after month. We must also have the capacity to project ourselves into the technologies of tomorrow to maintain this sovereignty and maintain what makes our difference, that is, the ability to choose, throughout the chain, what will increasingly condition a part of our lives, while being extraordinarily attentive to what shaping the fourth information space , which I was talking about earlier, is superimposed entirely on the foundation of values that make up our European continent.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 127, "date": "2020-02-10.json", "name": "Presidente. –", "mepid": "124747", "text": "  I would like to inform you that I have received a motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Article 136(5) of the Rules of Procedure.

Mr President, without transition from the world of data to the world of SMEs , but there is a transition, in fact, because the data world will shape many of the economic activities on our continent and will, I am absolutely convinced, inspire many of our small businesses, so important for our entire economic fabric.  President von der Leyen reminded us here, moreover, in this Chamber, not so long ago: SMEs represent all that is essential and all that is good in our economy. We know the numbers; you know them like I do. It is an extraordinarily dense fabric, extraordinarily important, made up of women and men entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs who, for almost all of them, have created their business and work night and day fighting to develop it - also fighting against the barriers, whose role it is to us to make them diminish.  Ninety-nine per cent of European businesses are SMEs, accounting for two thirds of our jobs. It is clear that SMEs must therefore take our full attention. That is why, in the context of my responsibility, since I am in charge of the internal market, it is absolutely essential to ensure that our SMEs can precisely benefit also from some of what we have just talked about, but also from the major issues that will shape the evolution of our continent, in particular the European Green Pact which will change many of our behaviour and the way we act. , to produce and consume. So, to help all SMEs, first of all there is an important element: the President of the Commission has asked me to appoint an EMS envoy - I am not sure how to translate this into French - a representative of SMEs who will allow me, precisely, to be the link between SMEs and the whole portfolio for which I am responsible, by being constantly on the ground and by bringing us up to all the problems that exist on the ground and that could perhaps be easily eliminated to ensure that energies move forward.  To do this, of course, we will have to legislate a little better for SMEs; there are still too many constraints that enclose them and hold them back, which in turn limit the fluidity of the internal market as SMEs in their ability to use this internal market. So better regulation also means applying the one-in, one-out principle to any new regulation: making sure that when you propose new regulations, you get one. The aim, of course, is not to deregulate, but to make our laws more flexible, more agile, better adapt to the current environment of SMEs, especially in the digital age, so that SMEs can benefit from all that this evolution will bring in terms of change in the way they work, but also to produce and establish a relationship with their own customers. SME tests are already part of the regular evaluation, impact assessments; we must continue them: again, we must move forward by looking at what is working well, correcting what can be done, and this is something that I intend to develop precisely with the help of this famous representative of SMEs. The new strategy we are working on for SMEs must give them a stronger voice in the Better Legislation initiative, and we want to propose a number of actions in this regard. I would like to say, moreover, that we are working closely with Vice-President Eef-ovi in this regard.  Our overall objective is to ensure that all of the Commission's proposals are designed on the basis of the principle of 'think first in small', starting from where value is created on the ground, at the SME level, and then going up, not the other way around. As I said, we really need to give a much bigger role, a much greater focus to the cumulative impact of legislation when introducing new obligations. I've been through it myself — it wasn't yesterday, but I was a small business creator and I know what it's like to be the loads that often make you feel like you're strangling, putting yourself - I've experienced it physically — with your head under water. Now we really need to help businesses, and digital is going to help us change that. We are extraordinarily fortunate to have a single market of 450 million consumers, a single market which is in fact governed, as was said in the previous debate, by common values, by common passions and also, of course, by common rules, common standards. That's our deal. Many envy us, for that most of the thing; that's what that makes our difference. It is because there are, too, that we know how to respond to those who knock on our doors, or to talk with those who want to leave us. This market is our base. It's our common good. It must also, of course, be the instrument available to SMEs.  Too many barriers still exist today, far too many. It is difficult for a small business to sell its products outside the borders, I know that. We must therefore work very hard in this area to ensure that this extraordinary opportunity represented by the internal market is open to all of our SMEs. It is true that digital technology will help us considerably. We can already see that some very large players benefit from what digital can bring to platforms for the sale of their products or services in a cross-border way. Here it is: this transposition, I want to lead it for European SMEs. I would like to conclude by saying that it is essential, with regard to the quality of our legislation, to also mention the regulatory review committee, which is responsible for monitoring the quality of impact assessments. This is very important for the SME world. Major assessments and quality assessments accompany the Commission's proposals. So it's an essential instrument. Again, as a former SME entrepreneur, I know that it is very important to be able to be listened to and, when new legislation is created, to be able to say, \"Wait! Now it's fine. There, it's not okay; Well, why don't we change that a little bit?\" It will be an obviously independent body, listening to its stakeholders, not an advisory committee. I believe it will be essential to have a positive or consistent opinion of this body in order for an initiative to be presented to the Commission for decision. It is a very important and, I believe, quite innovative instrument, which will help SMEs to tell us about the problems they face and parliamentarians and the Commission to solve them. So that's what I wanted to tell you to introduce this debate. This is an absolutely crucial issue. Many opportunities in the world that are open to us, many challenges too, and I look forward to the terms of your debate so that I can then provide some answers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 130, "date": "2020-02-10.json", "name": "Henna Virkkunen", "mepid": "124726", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Breton for presenting the views of the Commission. SMEs are really the backbone of our economy. They represent 99% of all businesses in the European Union, so their role is crucial when we speak about jobs and growth or innovations or competitiveness of Europe. I’m very happy that the new Commission has now many excellent goals to improve the position of SMEs in Europe. EU regulation needs to better help our SMEs to scale up, drive and expand. I would like to stress three points here. First of all, better regulation, which is the main topic of today’s discussion. I would like to put a very specific question to the Commission: how will the Commission measure implementation costs of European Union legislation ex ante and ex post so that the compliance costs for SMEs are reduced, while at the same time safeguarding environmental, labour and social standards? And because I know that Vice-President Šefčovič is responsible for this – better regulation, I would like to ask if it’s possible to receive a written answer to this specific question. But then two other points related to your portfolio, Commissioner Breton. First of all, I am very happy at the introduction of an SME envoy, which has been Parliament’s request for a long time, and it would also be good to hear where the Commission is planning to locate the announced SME envoy in order to oversee all relevant DGs and services. The third point is more for the preparation of the SME strategy, and it’s about late payments, because this is something that we are now hearing very much from the SMEs and stakeholders: that they have bigger and bigger problems with late payments, and that often the big companies – big customers – do not respect the timelines. I hope that the Commission will address the problem of late payments when preparing the SME strategy, because better enforcement of the Late Payments Directive is needed so that SMEs too can benefit from the Directive.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 131, "date": "2020-02-10.json", "name": "Patrizia Toia", "mepid": "28340", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the programme you have brought here for a strategy for SMEs can only be attended and welcomed. On the contrary, I would say to you that we look forward to starting work on these issues, after years in which we have called for a strategy for businesses and SMEs without having any results. I must tell you that the first point for creating good regulation is also to reassess the issue of criteria for defining SMEs. I would remind you, Commissioner, that Parliament recently gave its opinion on this point, before consultation, and confirmed the current criteria, especially the number of employees, and all those elements that must not weigh down the reality of small and medium-sized enterprises, bearing in mind that in some countries the company is even very small, even micro and even familiar. On the strategy in general, I would like to remind you, also as cosme's rapporteur, of a number of points. Firstly, the work you are doing on value chains is very important; as many small and medium-sized enterprises as possible must be integrated into these strategies in order to strengthen their structure, to qualify their work and to involve them in the issue of neutrality and transition. Secondly, the dialogue between business, research, schools and universities to promote appropriate training is now too weak, especially in some countries. There is also this point in the strategy, because good legislative instruments do, but content to promote skills and training to support SME staff. Finally, innovation, digitalisation and scale-ups are essential points of this strategy and we are sure that it will take them into account.  I don't see good standards separated from good content. Good rules and good legislative procedures, good preventive and impact assessments cannot ignore the content that we will put as the focal content of the strategy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 132, "date": "2020-02-10.json", "name": "Martina Dlabajová", "mepid": "124709", "text": "  for renew. – Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for the positive that has been said. It's a good thing we're holding the bar so high and we have such big ambitions. It is with great tension that we all expect the European Commission to present its vision for a European industrial policy that will bring a new impetus for economic growth, go hand in hand with innovation, stand firm and face the challenges before us. I understand we're still looking for the best way to do this. For example, we have devoted countless discussions to the role of multinational companies, we have also addressed what needs to be done to create successful and dynamically developing companies in the EU. Some colleagues here in the EP see it as the need to adapt the competition rules in order to allow the expansion of really large European firms, the so-called European champions, who would be able to compete with players in global markets. But beware, but let me remind you and emphasise one important thing: no large company has emerged as a large one. She always had to work her way up, she always had to start somewhere. Europe has one important advantage in this regard, and that is the enormous potential that our small and medium-sized enterprises hide. The figures are clear, these firms have shown positive trends in recent years, whether in creating added value or creating jobs.  I wonder, therefore, how the European Commission wants to address the call for the need to have really big players capable of global competition in the European market, but at the same time not to forget small and medium-sized enterprises, which undoubtedly deserve genuine support to prosper and grow, both in the internal market and in the international market. Once again, I would like to say that I welcome the efforts of the European Commission and you personally to focus on small and medium-sized enterprises.

This is all the more important because the rise of digital and artificial intelligence is an opportunity for them. Let's help them take advantage of this opportunity to enable the most inventive of them to become the economic giants of tomorrow. The European Union must therefore put its economic policy in order. It should facilitate their access to finance by encouraging banks to lend to them, including by providing them with loan guarantees. It must also create the conditions for fair competition in the European market, but also renegotiate free trade treaties that place too much importance on large companies. Finally, it must simplify the allocation of financial aid, the complexity of which often discourages companies that might be eligible.

But I also see, like my colleague from Renew, quite a boring trend: that we want to weaken competition, or at least, as the governments in Poland and Germany (my own country) and France and Italy have said, and that is exactly the opposite of innovation and competitiveness.

Firstly, on the SME filter: the Commission is currently voluntarily applying the existing SME test in its impact assessments. What is the specific way in which this test will be converted into the announced actual SME filter, and how do you intend to remedy and improve the current shortcomings of the SME test so that the SME filter becomes an effective tool? Will the specific impact on small and medium-sized enterprises actually be assessed in the future when carrying out comprehensive impact assessments on planned legislation? And the SME filter should be binding and truly independent. I have the following question here: what about the European Green Deal, will it be included? I certainly believe that the legislation on the European Green Deal will have a significant impact on small and medium-sized enterprises. On the question of 'regulatory control committee': so far we have three independent experts – here we need to strengthen this committee and actually see that we are coming to an independent review body. Finally, on the third point: gold plating – things are often tightened nationally, regionally, and we have to see that this gold plating does not take place.

SME policy is therefore much more than financial support. Finally, two points: firstly, we want a Commission that thinks more of small and medium-sized enterprises in a cross-sectional way. Mr Breton, thank you very much, but that is not enough for us to do so. We want it to be Mrs von der Leyen, it must be a staff office directly with the President of the Commission; otherwise, it will remain fragmented. Secondly, we want a redefinition of SMEs. Owner-managed mid caps are the backbone of the European economy. Here, however, there is no staff department as in large corporations; mid-caps also need deregulation. This, too, is an issue for the Commission not just to link small and medium-sized enterprises with subsidies.

Creating a business-friendly regulatory environment is a long-term goal of the European Union.  But what does it look like in practice? In practice, however, the Union is creating a mobility package which kills competition between companies in the transport sector and causes the collapse of thousands of transport companies, e.g. from my home country of Polish, while increasing transport costs between Member States. EU regulations are market-driven, restrictive and dictated by the particular interests of member states.

I repeat a few words that have been shared on all the benches of this Chamber: late payments; Integrating SMEs into value chains Financial assistance too much bureaucracy Access to credit need for more specific training, particularly in the area of digital developments. You all share, indeed, the same concerns. I will try to respond quickly to all these subjects that you have mentioned and which will obviously be part, for many of them, of the plan that we will propose with regard to industrial policy, as it is true that the value chains on which an industrial policy is based worthy of the name must integrate, from start to finish, , our entire SME fabric.  Firstly, a question on the assessment of costs, which we are talking about, of course, with my colleague, Commissioner 'Ef-ovi'. The guidelines already explain the methodology and the next communication \"Better Regulation\" (which, I remind you, will be presented in April) develops precisely the principle one in, one out. Above all, I emphasize one point: what needs to be assessed is the cumulative costs. obviously, this must feed into our impact analysis, but we have to be clear: a lot of the burden comes from national laws, as we all know. With regard to the SME emissary, who will be an emissary, I have not yet decided, the exact framework has not yet been decided and I have several solutions, which I am thinking about today. One thing is certain: I very much hope that this person is close to me, with access, of course, to a specific team. At the same time, this person will have to be fully available on the ground, as I said earlier, to meet and listen to all SMEs on the continent. Moreover, as soon as I have decided on the choice of the person, I will come, if you agree, ladies and gentlemen, to present to you the architecture of this operation.  Delays in payment are an absolutely essential subject, which you have talked about a lot, both of you. It's a subject I'm looking at closely, of course. It must be integrated into the full understanding of the value chain. There are, of course, delays in payment, and there is also the increasing reliance of SMEs on larger contractors. That's all you have to look at very carefully.  To go quickly, some have mentioned it, it is true that an arbitration solution can be interesting. It can be examined; I do not know if the mechanisms that were proposed can work. But it is a subject, indeed, that I have known myself. It is true that many SMEs do not dare to go to court because they know that it is too long, too expensive and that, in the end, it is done to their detriment. Arbitration procedures are often interesting solutions, which I will consider.  Important point on over-regulation, or gold plating. We have to be very careful with the fact, again - as I said earlier, but I repeat - that a lot of the burden on SMEs comes from national laws, especially when they transpose European directives. They must be identified and notified. At the moment, only three countries are doing this, which is obviously very little, and I want to do more on this point. I will come back to you on that, but, yes, we have to move much faster on that. Access to funding is an absolutely essential issue. It will be even more so in the context of the digital transitions and the green pact, which has also been much talked about in this debate. We obviously have regional funds, I would remind you anyway, because it is very important: COSME, with 30 billion mobilized to support 500,000 SMEs over seven years, is quite important. But also InvestEU, which guarantees loans and improves access to finance. The SME window is 11.2 billion, or one third of InvestEU's guarantee instrument. of course, that is not enough, but we still have important instruments for the development of our SMEs. A question about the SME filter: the SME test that already exists is part of the impact analysis, so it only comes at a certain point in the decision. But, again, it does not affect the choice of the supported option in the impact analysis. Responsibility for the SME test is decentralized. The future SME filter is thought to intervene at all stages of the procedure, in order to identify proposals that could be barriers for SMEs. The aim is also to involve all the Commission's services, in connection, of course, with the future SME emissary.  Very important remarks were also made on access to public contracts and public procurement. This is obviously a very important lever - 14% of the economy. It is therefore a lever that needs to be used more and I absolutely agree that more should be done to allow SMEs to have privileged access to public procurement. When I talk about SMEs, this is also true for start-ups, so it is an area that I look at carefully, particularly with regard to the legal framework for public procurement, in order to determine what more can be done and how.  One last point, but one of which I have also mentioned a lot in my opening remarks, concerns the internal market. Our SMEs must be able to benefit from this internal market. It is really absolutely essential. As I said today, unfortunately, it is clear that they often have to rely on one or two platforms, which are not, moreover, of European origin, and which become for them a kind of gate keepers for access to the internal market. This is really something that needs to get our full attention.  We must therefore ensure that digital transformation enables our SMEs to find new markets beyond their national borders. I also noted some interesting ideas about the fact that our administrations need to digitize, particularly with respect to Form A1. It's an important topic. We have done that in a lot of states for automated tax levies, which is much more complex, so we should be able to do that at the national level.  Finally, a topic that has mobilized a lot of debates tonight: the one in, one out. I would remind you that the principle should not be mechanical. We are looking closely, of course, at what will be removed. It is not a question of using this instrument to deregulate, of course, much less to compromise the protection of workers. It is simply a question of seeing what has evolved. As we said earlier, we are in a rapidly changing world, particularly under the pressure of digital technology, but also under the impetus we want to give our continent on the green pact. In all this context, in an equally more geopolitical evolution of the balance of power that binds us to other continents, it is something that must be looked at, and therefore must be modernized. That, ladies and gentlemen, is what I could tell you tonight, at the conclusion of our work. I see that there is a lot of interest.

It also identifies projects of common interest needed to implement those priorities.  The TEN—E regulation sets priority corridors and thematic areas of trans—European energy infrastructure and provides guidelines for the selection of Projects of Common Interest (PCI). The first list of PCIs was established by a delegated act in 2013. Now we are on the fourth PCI list, which was adopted by the Commission on 31 October 2019 with 151 PCIs. As reflected in Parliament’s first reading position of 17 April 2019 on the proposal for a regulation on the Connecting Europe Facility for the period 2021—2027, the co—legislators provisionally agreed that the Commission should evaluate the effectiveness and policy coherence of the TEN—E regulation. For that evaluation, I would like to remind you that the Commission should consider inter alia the Union energy and climate targets for 2030, the EU long—term decarbonisation commitment and energy efficiency as a first principle.  I’d also like to stress that the TEN—E regulation was adopted before the adoption of the Paris Agreement. Energy plays a central role in the transition to a net—zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions economy, and therefore efforts to continue decarbonising the energy systems are necessary to enable the Union to reach its ambitious target and be world leader, while at the same time ensuring a coherent and inclusive transition of other sectors, maintaining the security of energy supply in the Union and coping with an increased demand for electricity.  With the aim of achieving its climate and energy goals and enhancing innovation, sustainability and growth, it is at the same time very important to remain competitive worldwide. The Union needs an up-to-date, high—performance energy infrastructure that is future-proof, cost-efficient and can provide a security of energy supply, including diversification of root sources and suppliers. Priority corridor scenarios, as well as eligibility criteria, should follow the evolution of the energy system and continue to be consistent with Union policy priorities, in particular in the context of long—term decarbonisation pathways. Adequate infrastructure, deployment and energy efficiency projects and policies should be used in a complementary way to help reach the Union’s objectives and targets. Building on the success of the Energy Union, we need to strengthen our efforts to improve energy efficiency, speed up deployment of clean energy and technologies, increase interconnectivity, and also of course further integrate our energy single market. In its resolution of January on the European Green Deal, Parliament called on the Commission to revise the TEN-E guidelines before the adoption of the next PCI list. The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) welcomes the announcement in the European Green Deal Communication that the revision of the TEN—E guidelines will take place in 2020 and asks for a clear timetable.  As regards the fourth PCI list, new gas infrastructure under the fourth PCI list is designed to last at least 40 to 50 years, and in some cases even longer. May I remind you that the very same infrastructure will be able to be used in not so many years from now to transport biogas and hydrogen, and also – during the transition phase – gas pipelines and interconnections, which play an important role in ensuring the energy security supply, affordability and sustainability. We need a balanced and realistic approach to achieve our common goal of carbon neutrality, and I would like to remind you that we still have 41 coal regions to support and sustain in a just and inclusive transition.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, something is wrong. The planet is dying and, report after report, experts remind us that we must give up fossil fuels to stop the climate runaway. However, far from its ecological commitments and in total contradiction with its declarations of good intentions, the Union is preparing to declare a priority list of energy projects, more than a third of which are fossil gas projects. There are 103 of us today asking you to review the copy. This list is scientific nonsense, an economic error and, above all, a political fault. This is scientific nonsense, because it has long been known that 84% of the fossil resources known today should not be used. This is an economic mistake, because continuing to invest in extremely expensive fossil projects hinders our ability to focus our investment efforts where the need for financing is so great. No, really, something is wrong when the Union wants to inject almost 29 billion euros into climate projects. Accepting this list would be a political fault, finally, because the list proposed to us is dangerous for the planet, and therefore for the people who inhabit it. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we must review the TEN-E guidelines and the criteria that accompany them as soon as possible, so that Europe can never again invest in fossil fuels. But we already need a new list of projects excluding fossil fuels for the next two years. Colleagues, let us make no mistake about the meaning of history. In the aftermath of the war, Europe was built around steel and coal and wanted to build peace on growth. It is now around green industries and the exit of fossil fuels that we must build Europe. Our prosperity must necessarily combine sobriety and justice.

This evening I have the opportunity to address this important issue before this plenary.  In the Green Deal Resolution adopted in January, Parliament stressed the importance of modern, clean, secure and smart new energy infrastructure for delivering the European Green Deal. I share the same vision. Turning this vision into reality requires making the TEN-E Regulation adopted in 2013 fit for Europe’s future energy system and fully aligned with the European Green Deal.  If we want to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050, we have no time to lose. As you know, the Commission was due to carry out an evaluation on TEN-E this year. I have decided to accelerate this evaluation and in parallel to start work on a revision of the TEN-E Regulation in order to present a legislative proposal in December 2020.  The overarching objective is to design a future-proof framework that will allow us to fund the infrastructure we need for the European Green Deal. The focus will clearly shift to deploying clean energy across the whole economy in the most efficient way. By 2050, the share of electricity in the total energy consumption is expected to be more than double. We need electricity infrastructures and innovative technologies such as smart grids, offshore wind and hydrogen that works. Also carbon capture, storage and utilisation and energy storage.  The new framework should in particular look at promoting sector integration, and I will consult widely stakeholders in the preparation of the proposal. And of course I will involve Parliament early on.  I commit to speed up work as much as possible, but we cannot risk cutting corners. That’s why December is our targeted date for adoption. I hope Council and Parliament will be able to process this proposal quickly, as they have done for other priority proposals in the past. But it is possible that the new regulation will not be in force in time for the adoption of the 5th projects of common interest (PCI) list in fall 2021. In this case, I intend to already ensure that the process for the selection of the 5th list of projects of common interest will already reflect the European Green Deal priorities. That means, firstly, that the sustainability criteria for all candidate projects will be strengthened to take better into account for each project its CO2 and methane emissions.  Secondly, I will strive to integrate more energy transition projects in the 5th PCI process, in particular smart clean CO2 infrastructure projects. I commit to work closely with the Member States and project promoters to help bring forward these projects. And, thirdly, I will strengthen the involvement of Parliament during key steps in the selection process, including the regional groups. I intend to establish a continuous political dialogue with you and the ITRE Committee. I will be guided by the objective to include more innovative projects enabling the transmission of renewable and decarbonised gases and projects enabling the smart integration of electricity and gas networks.  Finally, the oral question asks how we will approach the funding from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) of the projects in the 4th PCI list. The PCI label is a precondition for CEF funding, but not a guarantee.  While respecting the current rules and procedures, the Commission will ensure that the European Green deal will provide the background against which the selection process for PCI funding will be assessed. I note that already the CEF Regulation governing the financing of PCIs gives priority to electricity projects over gas. Honourable Members, I have set out my views for the future of TEN-E. In this light, I hope that Parliament will vote in favour of the 4th PCI list. The list includes key infrastructure projects that sustain the increasing share of renewables, address the remaining energy security challenges and underpin the modernisation of an integrated infrastructure. Electricity projects make up three quarters of the 4th PCI list. An objection to the 4th PCI list would mean that the 3rd PCI list remains in force, a list with 40% more gas projects than the new list. As a consequence, key electricity interconnectors and energy transition projects such as the North Sea wind-power hub, new smart green projects and new CO2 network projects would not be eligible for funding under the Connecting Europe Facility.  I have set out how I intend to work on an energy infrastructure policy fit for the future. I will work closely together with Parliament.

The European Commission has recently published the fourth list of projects of common interest. This list is based on the current guidelines, not taking into account the new climate ambition. On Wednesday we are voting on an objection to this list, but we must not forget that if the fourth list is rejected, we will fall back on the third.

We can do this with the full understanding that different parts of the EU have different realities, but at the same time also understanding that investments need to be made in cleaner sources and not locking countries’ reliance on fossil fuels. In the full list of energy projects that we are discussing, there are still fossil fuel projects, including oil—supply projects. I understand that interconnection projects are necessary to ensure security of supply and solidarity among Member States, which until today are still disconnected; however, this 4th list goes further and opens the door to heavy investments in completely new fossil fuel pipelines and infrastructures. Things have changed drastically since the fourth Projects of Common Interest (PCI) list was drafted, including in the formation of Member States that makes the European Union as a whole, and this has to be taken into account, something which is clearly lacking in the formulation of this list. Now, going back to the 3rd PCI list is not what we need, but money should be invested in projects that can really help us move forward in the right direction. It is for these reasons that the European Commission needs to carry out all the sustainability assessments required to ensure that money is invested in projects that can really make the European Union carbon neutral by 2050.

What really matters to the citizens are essentially two factors: firstly, a cheap and, secondly, a secure energy supply. An essential objective must be to guarantee security of supply, and this is clearly about diversification. Dependencies on individual players should be avoided. Security of supply must rest on several pillars, and Nord Stream 2 could make a significant contribution to this. Together, of course, with LNG terminals and better connections to other projects for gas supply from abroad. When I hear that too many gas projects are being included in the TEN-E programme by the Greens, but that the same group is also calling for the closure of coal-fired power stations and that nuclear power is also on the verge of being phased out in countries such as Germany, I wonder whether you want to leave the supply to consumers solely to the whims of nature. At the same time, however, we also need cost reductions, especially in the electricity sector. It is unacceptable for private companies to turn over past investment failures to the taxpayer by jumping on the funding opportunities of the TEN-E programme. Moreover, one thing must be quite clear: gas and electricity supply is a highly sensitive, indeed strategic, area of our infrastructure, where we must not allow it to become a mass of blackmail – neither by foreign states, as in the last case of China in Germany, nor by companies such as 50Hertz.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 191, "date": "2020-02-10.json", "name": "Bas Eickhout", "mepid": "96725", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, thank you Commissioner.

From my point of view, this is outrageous, because this practice casts doubt on the impartiality of public decision-makers.  Last year, Romania was sponsored by Coca-Cola. This American multinational paid him more than 40,000 euros and, in return, was given the right to offer invitations to public events organized by the Romanian Presidency. The mix of the public and private interests was at its height. This year, Croatia pledged to be exemplary. Alas, it failed, since this country was sponsored by the INA group, an oil company. To say the least, this does not fit very well with the draft green pact which is the priority of the von der Leyen Commission.

We acknowledge that President Sassoli has accepted this request. A minute's silence and a dry message of remembrance. It remains regrettable that, even on this occasion, it has not been found the courage to clearly indicate the historical responsibilities of the Slavic-Communist partisans of Marshal Tito, often aided by Italian ones, in that heinous ethnic cleansing against the Italians. Those Italians died or fled exiles, yes, but they are never said to be killed by whom or to escape from whom.

It was a direct response from the people to incredible unfairness in how the country is governed. So many people have been left behind by the so-called ‘economic recovery’, and sadly, the government have failed to deal with serious problems that were affecting the people. We have a homelessness crisis. We have a housing crisis. They failed to deal with them. We bailed out the banks. We borrowed billions, and we loaded the burden on the ordinary people. We set up a bad bank called NAMA to deal with distressed assets – they cost the state over EUR 20 billion, and nobody blinks an eyelid.

The Democrats supressed the result. Mr Buttigieg himself comes out, announces himself the winner and happy days. Now, if this was a reality TV show, we’d be laughing.
