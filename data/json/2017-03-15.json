Before the speakers' speeches, I want to thank on behalf of the European Parliament the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, the Italian Prime Minister, Paolo Gentiloni, and the Maltese Deputy Prime Minister, Louis Grech , for accepting the invitation to participate in this discussion on the future of Europe. First of all, I want to remind you that today the Netherlands go to the polls and no one can offend a democratic country that goes to elections, thus offending all European citizens and the values ​​in which we recognize ourselves. We are much more than a market and a currency and we must start again from here. For this reason today's discussion is particularly important: we cannot limit ourselves to a formal ceremony to remember what were the best 60 years in the history of free Europe and the anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome must be, first of all, an opportunity to bring Europe closer to its citizens. We must give concrete answers on unemployment, especially youth unemployment, terrorism and immigration, promoting our values ​​in the world. Parliament opened this debate with the approval of the Verhofstadt, Bresso-Brok, Berès-Böge reports in the last part-session in Strasbourg. Two weeks ago the Commission presented its White Paper and at the last European Council, the Heads of State and Government held a broad discussion on this issue. A solemn declaration is also expected to be signed in Rome on 25 March by the leaders of the European institutions. Today more than ever we need European unity: of course, the Union must be changed but not weakened.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 1, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Donald Tusk", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the European Council. – Mr President, Prime Minister Gentiloni, deputy Prime Minister Grech, President Juncker, Members of the European Parliament, leaders met last Thursday for the March European Council, and, a day later, 27 leaders met to discuss the future of the European Union before the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome. Our discussions were constructive and focused, despite a little drama at the beginning. I will start with the European Council meeting itself. Following an implementation report from Prime Minister Muscat, we discussed the progress on our migration priorities as set down by leaders in the Malta Declaration of 3 February. Work has begun but now needs to accelerate in order to start delivering results ahead of what we know will be a challenging summer. Secondly, leaders discussed the prospects for the EU and euro area economies, together with the President of the European Central Bank. Things are getting better, and they are getting better in every Member State of the Union. This proves that our economic strategies are on the right track. Although unemployment is at its lowest level since 2009, leaders were clear on the need to get it down further, particularly in the most affected regions. Job creation will remain our priority. It is the best means to tackle inequality and social injustice. Leaders confirmed the EU’s position as the champion of open, rules-based free and fair trade. Trade is central to European economic success and as I mentioned several weeks ago, Europe needs to intensify trade talks with our partners around the world, not least due to signs of protectionism emerging elsewhere. We agreed to swiftly advance ongoing negotiations, such as with Japan, which are most advanced, with Mercosur and Mexico. Already next week we will discuss with President Juncker how to progress in our trade deal with Japan when we host Prime Minister Abe in Brussels. Our sincere hope is to finalise these talks this year. Leaders expressed their will to strengthen trade relations with China. At the same time, we will not hesitate to defend ourselves against unfair trading practices, wherever necessary. We welcome the European Parliament’s strong commitment to making quick progress on the relevant legislation. It will help Europe set the global standard for free and fair trade. In the evening, we discussed the tense situation in the Western Balkans. It was clear to all that forces inside and outside are working vigorously to destabilise the region. That is why leaders reaffirmed their unequivocal support for the Western Balkans, and its European perspective. We also expressed our full commitment to support EU-oriented reforms and ongoing projects. The European Union remains faithful to the promise of Thessaloniki and fully committed to the region’s stability and prosperity. I hope this positive signal from Europe will be heard. Leaders also reviewed progress made in the area of security and defence cooperation, where the European Council gave a new impetus last December as a strategic priority. Leaders agreed to come back to this again in June. Dear Members, on Friday, we met informally as 27 ahead of the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome. There was an honest and constructive discussion about our common future. It focused on what should be the main elements of the Rome Declaration and our agenda going forward. It was clear from the debate that the unity of the 27 will be our most precious asset. At our last meeting in Malta, subsequent opinions voiced by some Member States as well as the European Commission’s White Paper leave us in no doubt that the idea of a multi-speed Europe will be one of the discussions ahead of the Rome anniversary, and I understand the reasons for this. Some expect systemic changes that would loosen intra-EU ties and strengthen the role of nations in relation to the Community. Others, quite the opposite, are looking for new, deeper dimensions of integration, even if they would apply only to some Member States. Such a possibility is indeed foreseen in the Treaties currently in force. However, considering the interests of the community of 27 countries in the context of the upcoming Brexit negotiations as well as the long-term strategic interests of the EU, I will be urging everyone to strive towards maintaining political unity among the 27. This is why, when discussing the various scenarios for Europe, our main objective should be to strengthen mutual trust and unity among 27. After last week’s debate, I can openly say that all 27 leaders agree with this objective. It was a relatively optimistic discussion about our common future, with a positive approach from all sides, without any exception. As I said after the meeting itself, ‘If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together’. It is our collective intention to mark the 60th anniversary with the sense of celebration and sober reflection that it deserves. Jean-Claude and I continue to work closely with Prime Ministers Gentiloni and Muscat on this, and I want to thank them both for their efforts and dedication. Finally, on my re-appointment as President of the European Council, I have nothing further to say except to reiterate that I am really grateful for the trust that has been placed in me and absolutely determined to work with all Member States and institutions to make the EU better and more united. Dear Members, Brexit was not on our agenda last week, but let me share two remarks, given that this is our last meeting before the UK triggers Article 50. I will do everything in my power to make sure that the EU and the UK will be close friends in the future. Britain will be dearly missed as an EU Member State. At the same time, I would like to stress again that the EU’s door will always remain open for our British friends. When it comes to negotiations, we will have no choice but to start the withdrawal talks once the UK notifies. We are carefully preparing for these negotiations, in close consultation with Member States and the European Parliament. It is our wish to make this process constructive, and conducted in an orderly manner. However, the claims, increasingly taking the form of threats, that no agreement will be good for the UK, and bad for the EU, need to be addressed. I want to be clear that a ‘no deal scenario’ would be bad for everyone, but above all for the UK, because it would leave a number of issues unresolved. We will not be intimidated by threats, and I can assure you they simply will not work. Our goal is to have a smooth divorce and a good framework for the future, and it is good to know that Prime Minister Theresa May shares this view. There is one final thing I would like to say about the Netherlands, after what happened over the weekend. The Netherlands is Europe, and today I want to say that Europe is the Netherlands. A place of freedom and democracy. And for sure Rotterdam, the city of Erasmus, brutally destroyed by the Nazis, which today has a Mayor born in Morocco. If anyone sees fascism in Rotterdam, they are completely detached from reality.  (Applause) We all show solidarity with the Netherlands. Out of respect for our friends in the Netherlands, let me repeat this in Dutch. Nederland is Europa en Europa is Nederland, plaats van vrijheid en democratie. Zeker Rotterdam, stad van Erasmus, door de nazi’s kapotgeschoten, vandaag met een in Marokko geboren burgemeester. Dat heeft met fascisme niets te maken. We zijn allen solidair met Nederland. Yes, we are Europeans and we are proud.

I have a good passive understanding of Dutch, and when I speak Dutch it is better than that spoken by the President of the Council, but I recognise that he made a huge effort to address the Dutch nation. By the way, following your assessment, I was scandalised by what was said by Turkey about the Netherlands, Germany and others. I will never accept this comparison between the Nazis and governments now.  (Applause) My home country, Luxembourg, was occupied by the Nazis. Our people suffered. My father was forced into the German army, together with his three brothers. If you are drawing a comparison between that period and the present time, this is totally unacceptable. The one doing this is distancing himself from Europe, not trying to enter the European Union. The European Union is not joining Turkey. Turkey is joining the European Union.  (Applause) I would like to congratulate my good friend Donald on his re-election. (Applause) It was the first meeting the European Council had in its new building. I refer to this new building as the Tusk Tower. I prefer the Tusk Tower to the other one. I am happy that Donald has been re—elected because not only do we have excellent personal relations, but we also have good interinstitutional relations. I am very grateful for that. Things could have happened differently, because my first ambition was to become President of the European Council. Now you are there, I am here and it is excellent like that. I am the best President of the Commission in comparison to you, and you are a better President of the European Council in comparison to me, so everything is OK. (Murmurs) I am happy that I have woken up the extreme right of the Parliament.  Lors du Conseil européen de la semaine passée, nous avons eu un débat intense sur les Balkans occidentaux. Je voudrais dire ici, au nom de la Commission et au nom de la Haute Représentante, qui est aussi Vice-présidente de la Commission – donc une personnalité obligatoirement schizophrène – qu’en tant que Commission, nous voulons offrir aux pays des Balkans occidentaux, une perspective européenne non équivoque. Je sais que lorsque j’ai dit au début de notre mandat qu’il n’y aurait pas de nouvelles adhésions avant 2019, cette phrase a créé la confusion dans les Balkans. Or, nous continuons nos débats, nos négociations d’adhésion avec les pays des Balkans. C’est la région la plus compliquée d’Europe et nous devons apporter à nos relations avec les pays des Balkans occidentaux tous les soins requis. Les conclusions que nous avons adoptées à 27 – parce que la Pologne, pour des raisons inexplicables, n’a pas pu se joindre aux conclusions du Conseil européen –, disent très clairement quelles sont nos ambitions et nos intentions en ce qui concerne les Balkans occidentaux. Nous avons évoqué, entre nous, la situation économique de l’Union européenne et de la zone euro en particulier. Nous nous sommes félicités du fait que le chômage baisse, que la croissance augmente, que le taux d’emploi ne cesse d’augmenter, qu’il y a une création d’emplois tout à fait remarquable, mais cela ne devrait pas nous induire en erreur: l’Europe n’est pas sortie de la crise économique qui est la sienne. La crise sociale perdure et nous devons donc apporter à toutes ces questions gravitant autour du sujet économico-social, toute notre attention. Je voudrais que nous soyons prêts en avril, en tant que Commission, pour adopter nos propositions concernant la mise en place d’un pilier des droits sociaux. Au mois de novembre, en Suède, nous aurons tous ensemble un débat sur la poursuite de la politique sociale en Europe. Je veux dire par là, un meilleur «ameublement» de la dimension sociale insuffisamment «meublée» jusqu’à ce jour. Je voudrais qu’en novembre, nous puissions terminer ce débat. La raison pour laquelle la politique sociale n’a pas eu toute l’attention que certains d’entre vous auraient voulu qu’elle ait lors de la présentation du livre blanc, réside dans le fait qu’en matière de politique sociale, nous sommes sur le court terme, nous voulons mener à bon port le débat social au cours de cette année, alors que le livre blanc porte sur une durée plus longue puisqu’il vise, en termes d’accomplissement de nos ambitions, l’année 2025. Il ne faut donc pas lire le livre blanc comme prenant congé, et prenant de la distance, par rapport aux ambitions sociales de l’Europe. C’est pour tout de suite: l’Europe sociale ne peut plus attendre, il faut la faire maintenant et pas seulement en 2025. (Applaudissements) Je suis tout de même toujours impressionné que lorsqu’on fait des blagues, lorsqu’on attaque les autres, les applaudissements du Parlement sont nourris mais lorsqu’on parle de la politique sociale, vous êtes d’une timidité qui m’impressionne. (Applaudissements) Wir haben, Herr Präsident, anlässlich des Rates der letzten Woche auch über unsere Handelsbeziehungen mit anderen Teilen der Welt gesprochen. Ich möchte hier noch einmal zum Ausdruck bringen – ich, der ich kein free trader bin – passt nicht zu mir –, dass wir als Europäische Union unsere Chancen nützen müssen. Die Amerikaner gehen – so, wie es aussieht – auf Distanz zu multilateralen Handelsverträgen. Das ist bedauernswert, aber es ist eine Chance für uns, denn je mehr Menschen ich aus Asien, Afrika und von sonst woher empfange, umso deutlicher wird mir klar, dass andere in der Welt von uns erwarten, dass wir die Führung in internationalen Handelsfragen übernehmen. Das sollten wir auch tun! Die Welt wartet auf Europa, und wir müssen da sein, wenn die Welt auf uns wartet. Deshalb werden wir so schnell wie möglich – Donald hat dies erwähnt – mit Japan zum Abschluss der Freihandelsverhandlungen kommen. Nicht zu den Bedingungen, die uns nicht passen, sondern zu den Bedingungen, Wünschen, Herausforderungen, Bedürfnissen, die wir uns selbst geschrieben haben. Wir – Herr Tusk und ich – werden den japanischen Premierminister am 21. März, glaube ich, in Brüssel empfangen. Und wir werden dies so schnell wie nur irgendwie möglich in die richtige Richtung bewegen. Und ich hätte gerne – Ist Frau Malmström da? –, dass Frau Malmström sich vor Abschluss der Verhandlungen mit Japan noch einmal mit den Sozialpartnern zusammensetzt, weil ich strikt der Auffassung bin, dass wir nicht alleine – so aus Gottes Gewalt heraus – Handelsverträge abschließen können. Wir müssen auch mit anderen darüber reden: mit der Zivilgesellschaft, mit den Sozialpartnern und mit anderen. Zu Verteidigungsfragen sage ich nichts, weil Federica da führend ist. Only one sentence on defence: I think that the point the US is making is right. We have to take care of our own defence and we have to increase our defence budget. Mr Trump is not the first one to say this. Mr Trump is the fourth President of the United States I have had to deal with. George W Bush, Clinton and Obama were saying exactly the same, and we made a commitment. I think in Wales – which is part of Britain – we signed a commitment, and we have to respect that commitment, but I am strictly against this restricted concept of defence. International – planetary – stability is more than defence expenditure. Aid development, money for humanitarian action by our countries, is as important as military expenditure, and I would like to insist on that. Was das Weißbuch der Kommission anbelangt, haben wir – obwohl das nicht auf der Tagesordnung stand – uns damit beschäftigen müssen. Ich werde dazu nichts weiter sagen, als dass ich hier noch einmal wiederhole, dass es eine Verkürzung der Lektüre des Weißbuches ist, diese Lektüre ausschließlich auf das Europa der zwei oder mehreren Geschwindigkeiten zu begrenzen. Hätte Frau Merkel nicht in einer Pressekonferenz nach dem vormaligen Europäischen Rat davon gesprochen, dann hätte dies überhaupt nicht die Bedeutung gekriegt, die es gekriegt hat.  Ich möchte noch einmal deutlich machen: Es geht uns nicht darum, einen neuen Eisernen Vorhang zwischen Ost und West in Europa zu ziehen. Es geht uns darum, dass wir deutlich machen, dass, wenn nicht alle können oder wollen, wir in Sachen Vertiefung der Europäischen Integration nicht weitergehen können. Und im Übrigen, wenn Sie sich das mal im Detail ansehen: Dort, wo es bis jetzt verstärkte Zusammenarbeit gegeben hat, werden Sie unschwer feststellen können, dass in allen Fällen alle sogenannten neuen Mitgliedstaaten – ich mag diesen Ausdruck nicht – bei verstärkter Zusammenarbeit mitmachen, aber einige Gründungsmitglieder nicht mitmachen. Beispiel Europäische Staatsanwaltschaft: Wer macht nicht mit? Die Niederlande. Wer macht mit? Alle 2004 beigetretenen Mitgliedstaaten der Europäischen Union. Also diese Vorstellung, dass dies ein Entwurf wäre, um Europa wiederum in zwei Teile aufzuteilen, ist ein Vorwurf, der die Wirklichkeit nicht trifft. Ich wäre froh, wenn jetzt alle in Europa – Europaparlament, nationale Parlamente, whosoever – sich an dieser breit angelegten Debatte über die europäische Zukunft beteiligen würden. Die Kommission wollte nicht ein Diktat vorlegen. Wir wollten nicht sagen: So muss es sein, und so darf es nicht sein – obwohl ich das Szenario 2 hier im Parlament ausgeschlossen habe. Europa ist mehr als Binnenmarkt, als Macht, als Geld und als Warenaustausch! Europa ist zuvorderst das Europa der Menschen! Deshalb erhält dieses kleine Szenario, das nur einen europäischen Binnenmarkt vorsieht, nicht meine Zustimmung. Aber ich hätte gerne, dass wir alle diese Optionen diskutieren. Das sind nicht die Optionen der Kommission, das sind die Optionen, die sich zurzeit in der Debatte befinden. Und ich hätte gerne, dass wir uns bei dieser Debatte nicht ducken, sondern dass wir alle Elemente in Betracht ziehen, auch die Berichte, die das Europäische Parlament im letzten Monat angenommen hat.  Ich bedanke mich für die Aufmerksamkeit.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Paolo Gentiloni", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "Italian Prime Minister. - Thank you Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the President of the European Parliament for this opportunity to address you ten days after the sixty anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome. I believe that it must first of all be an occasion to remind our public opinions, our fellow European citizens of the results that have been achieved in these sixty years: peace, freedom, the levels of social protection that, despite all the difficulties, we have achieved, the single market, a success story that has led to the definition of the European Union as a \"quiet\" superpower and, finally, the work we have done in the field of culture, values, sharing our common ways of life. Remembering these results serves, I believe, to reflect on the future. If we did not do the first thing we would be in difficulty in imagining the next years of the European Union and we must do so above all because we are aware that we are going through one of the difficult moments of the European construction, perhaps one of the most uncertain moments of these sixty years, which somehow the years preceding that signing of the treaties of Rome, in which there were difficulties, different attempts, but we lived in a world very, very far from today's. Today the difficulties come from the legitimate choice made on 23 June by a large European country to leave the Union, deriving from the fact that the effects of the economic crisis are not at all behind us and as well as from the difficulties we are encountering in finding a common response on migratory flows. These are difficulties that we must not underestimate: someone even spoke of the risk of a sort of \"1989 upside down\", in which Europe is characterized by rebuilding walls, while 27 years ago it was characterized by breaking down walls. It is a risk that we can and must prevent. Looking to the future, I believe whereas we are all aware that a fundamental contribution can come from the European Parliament; first of all a contribution to the discussion that has opened on the future of the Union. An important contribution to this reflection has been made through the Böge-Berès, Bresso-Brok and Verhofstadt reports, which goes somewhat in parallel with the work that Jean-Claude Juncker and the Commission have prepared with their White Paper and that we have much appreciated, because it is a useful tool to set up this discussion. But it is not only the contribution to reflection: it is the awareness that there is at least on the part of the Italian government, that only from a stronger democratic legitimacy can an answer to the difficulties of the European Union come. It could be said, in a sense, that the co-decision powers of the European Parliament were the most important achievement of these ten years after Lisbon and that in the next ten years the European Parliament, this House, can be one of the driving forces of the future of Europe. I hope that there is a common awareness on this part of all of us. The Rome Declaration wants to give a message in this context of trust in the Union and in its next ten years. The Italian government is in favor of the relaunch of the Union, of its integration: as always, the declaration will be the compromise between different needs, drives, aspirations, ambitions. But I believe that some choices need to be clearly and strongly indicated, and we discussed them first in Malta and then in Brussels a few days ago. First, to respond to the demand for growth, investment and jobs. If we do not come out of the crisis, if we do not reduce the levels of unemployment, especially among young people, in our Union and in particular in some countries, we will not have confidence in the future of the Union. Secondly, sharing the commitment for the security of our borders and for a common strategy to manage migratory flows. If the countries that they are at the forefront of managing migratory flows are left alone there will be no confidence in the future of the European Union. (Applause) Thirdly, to strengthen our role in the world, including through concrete steps towards a common defense - the President of the Commission has now spoken. If we give in to nationalisms, to the opposition between individual states, even in the European Union, there will be no confidence in the future of the Union. And finally, putting social Europe at the center, the protection of the weakest, dialogue with the social partners, as advocated by the rapporteur Maria João Rodrigues: if we leave the weakest behind, there will be no confidence in the future of the European Union . (Applause) Ladies and gentlemen, these are principles on which we must work step by step: the conditions are not there today to make enormous institutional leaps forward, but we must get back on track now. A firm Europe is a Europe destined to turn back. Some progress can be made with enhanced cooperation, as provided for in the treaties. This, I want to say very clearly in the hall of the European Parliament, will never lead to a Europe of Serie A and a Europe of Serie B; it will never lead to a Europe of the small and a Europe of large countries; to an Eastern Europe and a Western Europe. But everyone has their own level of ambition; everyone can choose to participate - they can do it now and they can do it in the future - in forms of enhanced cooperation and everyone will be involved in the common project. Having said all this, Europe cannot stand still and has a duty towards its citizens to respond to the emergencies and challenges we face. More democracy, with citizens and their elected representatives at the center, is basically the strongest guarantee for this common project to go on over the next ten years. As Jean Monnet said: \"We do not combine states, we unite men\". For this we count on you and for this thank you.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Louis Grech", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – President Tajani, President Tusk, President Juncker, Prime Minister Gentiloni, dear Members, dear colleagues, as pointed out by previous speakers, the European Union is not about Brussels, it is not about Strasbourg, nor is it about the institutions to which many of us involved in today’s debate belong. The European Union is about its 500 million citizens and about their hopes, their fears and their aspirations.  Malta’s Presidency is taking place within the context of the major political and economic upheavals that we have witnessed in recent years, including Britain’s decision to leave. Brexit is an unfortunate reality, but we have to move on. We cannot allow Brexit, no matter how much it may be in the headlines and how complex and delicate an issue it is, to distract us from, and create wedges in, our central mission. Talk of an existential crisis has become the norm. Yes, we are living in times of extraordinary unpredictability and it would be a big mistake to underestimate the major setbacks and challenges, but it would be an even bigger mistake to fall into a negative mind-set and resign ourselves to doing nothing. The buck stops with us.  Never has there been a more important time for Member States and the institutions to remain united, never has there been such a crucial time for all of us to focus on the big picture and shut out potentially distracting, unnecessarily divisive issues. We must face up to the reality that Europeans’ horizons have shifted. Many feel disenfranchised or disillusioned. It is up to us to show why European added value can be tangibly translated into citizen added value. As Presidency, our overarching theme is reunion – a reunion which fosters a climate in which the Union can once again regain the trust and confidence in the European project and secure its strong and viable existence. At this critical moment, we have to avoid unnecessary divisions and internal strife, and we have deliberately steered the debate on Europe’s future in this direction. We must rethink our priorities, rethink what resources we put into various policies, and usher in reform where necessary.  Having said that, reform does not mean a whole redesign of Europe. We have the Commission’s White Paper, as well as a number of Parliament reports on Europe’s future. Some options, to me, seem to be more attractive than others and, who knows, there may be other options which have not yet been brought to the table. However, I also believe that, whichever way we eventually choose to go, it will not create first and second-class citizens or result in kneejerk reactions or quick-fix solutions which foster unnecessary tensions and distrust. This could pave the way for the eventual erosion of unity. Irrespective of whether Member States opt to drive in second, third or fourth gear, neutral is not an option. We must use as a basic platform the established principles: respect for human rights and dignity, freedom, equality and rule of law. These are the values that reflect the soul of the Union and form the core of any future Europe.  We – I think I should rephrase that – most of us believe in a future Europe that upholds the fundamental value of solidarity on issues like migration, and in a Europe that strives to guarantee the safety and security of its citizens. We believe in creating better conditions for growth, jobs and higher living standards through the Union’s single market. Current indicators show that we have, once again, started to register successes. We believe that the Union should be should be robustly positioned to shape and manage better globalisation, not merely react to it. A strong Europe is needed to bring about the right balance in a world order which is shifting.  We believe in a Europe that fights for a healthy environment, yet Europe will only be viable if it is socially responsible, equitable and just, and if it is significantly moulded from the bottom up, not from the top down. Make no mistake: Europe will only be credible if it delivers on its decisions. In Rome, Member States will reaffirm our commitment to a united Europe, but the declaration is not an end in itself: far from it. Any progress registered on the future of Europe must be followed up and translated into action. A coordinated action by the institutions is absolutely vital. Having spent almost nine years myself in this institution, I know how crucial and meaningful Parliament’s continuous role and participation is in this defining moment for the future shaping of the European project.  Colleagues, we need to draw on this momentum and galvanise and energise our forces to forge a stronger, better Union. We have a fragile balancing act to perform: a balance between flexibility, which is not so loose as to threaten the meaning of a real Union, and intransigent rigidity which would undermine the whole process of the European project. We believe that success belongs to those who can harness positive forces that unite rather than divide. We believe in a better Europe, our young people believe in a better Europe, and we believe that the Union has what it takes to move forward. ", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Manfred Weber", "mepid": "28229", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen! Thanks to Prime Minister Gentiloni for taking the time to come to the European Parliament and listen before the Rome celebrations. That is a very good sign of the partnership. But first I would like to congratulate Donald Tusk on his re-election. Two and a half years of excellent work are behind you. It was a time of merging and not of division. It was a time when you tried to show the ability to act and not to accept blockade. It was a strong two years in your presidency. We are therefore happy to be re-elected. Congratulations! Ladies and gentlemen! I will not comment on the first hour of the Council meeting on Thursday, because otherwise some Polish media might say again that the German would speak here at the lectern. That's why I don't want to give propaganda in Poland a present. I think the development is self-directed. And I would like to thank the socialists because President Hollande said in the European Council that he appreciates the work of Donald Tusk, that Muscat, as President of the Council, was also very, very much the management of Thursday's session did well. The socialists in the European Council have shown that now is not the time to practice party politics, but now is the time for us to stand together and defend the European idea together. Thanks for that! Today it is about the Council, but of course above all about the Future of Europe, the Rome Declaration. For us as the EPP Group, the first issue is the question of competencies. Yes, the ideas that Jean-Claude Juncker put forward are good. The openness of the debate is good, we are balanced and, to a certain extent, pragmatic. We see new areas of responsibility in some areas - defense and foreign policy - but there are many cases where we as the EPP Group also say: Europe has to withdraw more. Jean-Claude Juncker has already achieved a great deal in the detailed regulations that we as a European level withdraw and trust the nation states more. Finding the balance is an important task. But in all honesty, I think that is not necessarily the most central debate - it is an important debate, but not necessarily the most important. Because what is much more important is how we succeed in ensuring that the people in Europe finally perceive the European level - Strasbourg, Brussels - as a normal political level and not as an external force that tells them something that they have to suffer from, that they are supposed to have carried out and have no feeling of doing it. What is necessary for this? The first thing that is necessary for this: We have to take responsibility. I'll tie this to my own country: in the last few years, the German federal government has approved 148 legislative decisions in the European Council 140 times - and 140 times approved 148 decisions. But I rarely see a German minister who then explains why he agrees here in Berlin. That goes for Italy, that goes for the Czech Republic, that goes for France. Therefore: take responsibility! If we decide something in Europe, please explain it to the people at home too. The second: we must allow Europe to achieve success, not just here in the European Parliament when we sometimes give Sunday speeches - let's be honest with what we sometimes hear here. We need to talk at home about what we have achieved. Even the right-wing extremists, the right-wing populists that we have in our house, must see that Croatia and Slovenia, for example, have developed much better economically than Macedonia or Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is also the former Yugoslav region, in the last few years and decades since the fall of the Wall was. It's for everyone Obviously, the parts that are members of the European Union are today in a much better economic position than those that are not members of the European Union. Poland / Ukraine - that's obvious. That is why we should grant Europe these successes, which we have in common, and explain them to people in everyday life and not only record them nationally, which unfortunately is the case with God today. Of course, we also have to consider how Europe can become more assertive, how Europe reaches people in everyday life. That means that we also need a debate about the executive power of Europe. Since then there are not only Greek officials at the Greek border, but Frontex officials with the European symbol, there are many people in Greece who feel better protected than in earlier times. It is good that Europe has an independent presence there. Finally, I would like to say that Europe must also talk about borders. We are currently discussing the Western Balkans. My group fully supports the prospect of EU accession for these states. You belong to Europe, there is no question about that. But we are also discussing Turkey. I thank our leading presidents for expressing solidarity with the Netherlands. The Netherlands deserves the support of all of us, they deserve the support. But with regard to the Turkey question, we have to clarify now how things will go in the long term. Everyone can see that Turkey is moving away from Europe, whether we like it or not. And that's why we have to put the question of whether full membership is realistic after the referendum is over. My group wants us to develop a close partnership - in economic areas, on visas, on student exchanges - but we have to be honest that full membership for Turkey in the European Union is not a realistic position for the foreseeable future. And We should honestly say that to the European citizens.As I said, it is about more than just the question of the division of competencies between the European and national levels.It is more about emotions, about taking responsibility, about being honest.And that's where we want Rome to leave.Prime Minister, we wish you all the best!(Applause)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Gianni Pittella", "mepid": "4436", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, best wishes to President Tusk. I thank President Juncker, Prime Minister Gentiloni and Deputy Prime Minister Grech for the important speeches they made. In particular, I thank Prime Minister Gentiloni for his strong recognition of the essential role of the European Parliament. I draw from your words the urgency of strong action to relaunch the European project and we socialists are there. If there is one thing we cannot afford in Rome, it is to speak in vain or to use rhetoric or slogans. President Tajani, you know you can count on the trust of our group: but if the final declaration of Rome is too weak, does not contain significant references to social Europe and to the governance of the eurozone, we will ask you not to sign it. We would have liked the whole of Parliament to be more involved in drafting this declaration, through an ad hoc resolution, even though it is true that there have been three important reports and resolutions in which we recognize ourselves. We socialists do not resign ourselves to the status quo. Populists are strong, not only when we don't know how to explain our successes; they are strong even when we appear weak or resigned. United and brave we can defeat them. The magic word of these days - it was also recalled today - is \"speed\". But a multi-speed Europe is not the panacea for all evils: it is a method, it is not the substance, nor the strategy. Gentiloni said wise things today. I recognize that this method has served Europe in the past because it is inadmissible for one Member State to veto it if others want to move forward: but it would still be a mistake to focus solely on speed. The problem of Europe today is not one, two, three, four speeds, but the direction of travel, the substance; let's agree on the direction: where do we want to go? What is the landing place? And I me I hope that all the Member States and all the pro-European political families will move in this direction and, if someone does not agree, it is his responsibility to call himself out and he cannot prevent the others from moving forward. If the direction is austerity, for example, we are going to crash. That is why the problem is the content, it is substance and not the method. First comes the substance, then the method. In Rome we have three major challenges to face. The first concerns the unity of Europe: our social and territorial cohesion. We need common social standards, better living conditions. This means a strong social pillar, a European investment strategy that creates jobs through the energy transition, the circular economy, digital connectivity for all. And to those who ask where we will find the resources to do these things, I reply that tax evasion steals billions of euros from European citizens every year. There are resources there, we must give them back to our citizens. The second major priority concerns collective defense and foreign borders. It is impossible to have a market without internal borders without sharing responsibility for managing the external borders and without having a European asylum system. The third priority concerns the projection of Europe into the world: while Trump isolates America and threatens the international order, while important countries - you said so and I fully agree with President Juncker's reaction - while Turkey is pushing towards an illiberal, authoritarian and personal dimension of power, Europe must be the reference point for those who believe in democracy and human rights. Dear President, the dream that animated the constituents sixty years ago has experienced alternating phases: peaks of enthusiasm and periods of stagnation or decline. It may seem strange but the more the European Union is threatened, the more I believe in Europe; the darker the times, the more I understand the meaning and the need for European integration.And I realized that only if we really believe in that project can we change and save it.Half sentences, compromises on words, shyness and ambiguities are no longer needed: in Rome everyone can freely choose the field in which they are located and then let's move on to change Europe and save the European project.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Raffaele Fitto", "mepid": "4465", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Presidents Tusk, Juncker, Gentiloni, politicians are generally divided into two basic categories, those which come to light in one particular circumstance, namely when their recipes are contradicted by reality. Here comes the difference: there are politicians guided by reasonableness, who know how to humbly recognize their mistakes and try to change their recipes; and then there are the politicians obsessed with ideology, who instead think they can keep the recipes and change reality. Here, unfortunately, there is a risk of belonging to the second category. The boat sinks and the cruising speed is taken care of. And if someone points to the approaching iceberg they are told to shut up, because he is not an expert or he is not a pro-European. If there is a wave of rejection throughout Europe, some questions should be asked about the reasons for this phenomenon. Blaming the voters is never wise: rather, wondering about the inefficiency of the European Union might be more appropriate. The current European Union has shown that it does not know how to cope with emergencies of medium gravity, such as the case of Greece, nor emergencies of maximum gravity, such as the case of immigration, nor the ordinary challenge of exiting the economic crisis and returning to sustained and strong growth. But the Union has gone further: it has become too centralized and too distant from the citizens. The push towards a closer Union is not a hope for citizens to work together; it has become a dogma to justify the creation of a centralized state with less and less respect for the rights of its member states. But the cause, the origin, are always the wrong policies that unfortunately continue to be defended. For these reasons, on the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaties, we recall some clear choices: the first, to promote a new process of true renegotiation, which invests all existing European rules and treaties and which concerns all Member States of the European Union; to exclude further transfers of sovereignty in favor of the current institutions of the European Union, even more so in the absence of democratic guarantees and full control by citizens; to say no to the prospect of a single European finance minister. Today Europe does not need a final cage but, on the contrary, of competition between different models and systems, so that the countries and territories capable of cutting taxes, spending and public debt, and therefore of promoting growth, are to be example and stimulus for others; promote a mechanism for strengthening national parliaments that allows joint action to question and propose Union policies. European hope and the great dream of the founders will not be saved by continuing on the wrong path of recent years, traveled at greater or lesser speed. You can go more or less quickly but unfortunately the direction remains wrong. Instead, we need a change in the sense of flexibility, of more open and transparent rules, of institutional geometries that are adequate to recognize diversity rather than aimed at imposing a forced and unnatural homogeneity. These are our proposals that we will strongly support. The choice is clear: on the one hand a weak and rhetorical celebration; on the other, a strong and credible celebration. We will support this second option because a real future for Europe and for our children can be played on this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 9, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Guy Verhofstadt", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Tusk on his reappointment. Fortunately a right of veto no longer exists on the matter of the nomination of the President of the European Council. President Tusk, I would like to thank you very much for your strong condemnation of the provocation by President Erdoğan towards our Dutch friends. It is quite cynical that the man who wants to install an authoritarian system in Turkey is at the same time pointing the finger and using the term ‘fascism’ in relation to a number of countries in the European Union. It is quite cynical. It is also quite cynical that he has asked for freedom of speech for his ministers in our countries, while in the meantime there are European journalists in prison in Turkey. We have to make the case that a German journalist from Die Welt newspaper, Deniz Yücel, is still in prison, and I think the first thing that we have to do with all the European leaders is to call again for his release as soon as possible before President Erdoğan can ask to have freedom of speech in another country. I think we have to be realistic and I am in full agreement with what Manfred Weber has said. It is good that we are condemning everything that is happening in Turkey, but at a certain point, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President of the Council, let us be honest, let us freeze the accession negotiations now. That is the only serious action that we can take to condemn what Mr Erdoğan is doing at the moment. That is the only serious way to do it. When he comes back to reason – I don’t know when – then we can return to the negotiation table, but to negotiate at the moment with somebody who is using that language towards our democratic societies in Europe is unacceptable. I would like to thank Mr Gentiloni for being here as President of the Italian Council of Ministers. I will be in Rome on 25 March, but not in the beautiful Palazzo dei Conservatori at Campidoglio. I will be in another beautiful place in Rome, the Piazza di Spagna, because with the European Movement, with my friend Elmar Brok, with Jo Leinen of the European Federalists, with the Spinelli Group, and with the Stand Up for Europe movement, we will be gathering there, in the Piazza di Spagna, which is perhaps as beautiful as Campidoglio, because we want to recall, not the Europe we have got and that we had in the past, but in fact we want to prepare the Europe we will need in the future. The question about what kind of Europe we will need in the future has been there for weeks, months, and I should say, already for years. Do we need more Europe or do we need less Europe? Do we need more or less? I think it is a stupid question. In some cases and in some fields we need less Europe. We need less bureaucracy, we need less regulation, for example in our internal market. Maybe we will need less Commissioners in the future and a small European government. We need no regulation on toilet bowls, vacuum cleaners, bananas or cucumbers. There we need less Europe.  But at the same time we are all aware of the fact that we need more Europe on a number of other issues. We need a European border and coast guard to manage our borders and not to outsource this task to Erdoğan. For example, we need a European government for our single currency and a Minister of Finance and a Treasury, because a state can maybe exist without a currency, but a currency cannot exist without a state. That is the reality that we have to see. I think we need a European investigation and an intelligence capacity to fight against terrorism, not only depending on coordination between national authorities, and finally I think we also need a European defence community and a European army to stabilise our neighbourhood and to be capable of doing something in our neighbourhood. So the question is not whether we need less or we need more. We need less in some fields and we certainly need more in other fields. I hope that in Rome we will not produce hot air again because, let us be honest, Mr Tusk, we have had Valletta, we have had Bratislava, and now we are going to Rome. It is now time to start a process. We are not going to rewrite the Treaties in Rome 60 years later. That is not possible, but what we could do is start a process, finally, and not just make declarations, like the new declaration we are now preparing. My proposal – the proposal of the European Parliament – is to start an interinstitutional exercise with the three institutions together based on what we did with Mario Monti’s report, where we created a new blueprint for the future budget of the European Union. We did this together – the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament – and my request to you, Mr Tusk, is that, together with Prime Minister Gentiloni, you launch such a process in Rome. We are not going to wait for the outcome of all these elections in 2017 because there are going to be new elections in 2018 and 2019 in other countries. So, if you can do something, it is to launch that process. We know that Rome was the first republic, we know it was the first empire, we know it was the birthplace, with Florence, of the Renaissance, and we know it was the start of the European Union. Well, I hope that on the 25th it can also be city of the rebirth of the European Union.

The first thing I have to say is that the state of the European Union is also reflected in the fact that there is not a single woman among you. Maybe we should think about it again. That could also be a corresponding approach to the question: How should the European Union actually reinvent itself so that it really reflects the wishes, the demands, the hopes and also the expectations in something that unites us together, what unites us, what does not let us fall back again into a Europe, into a patchwork of nations? Mr President Tajani, last week at the COP, in the Conference of Presidents, you asked us to give you the mandate to co-sign the Rome Declaration - at a time when we, with the exception of a few, are not in the hand could still say whether this Rome Declaration will really give the signal that is needed. And so far I have my doubts that this Rome Declaration will actually be a signal of departure. Because then she would have to - and I would like to say to Mr Juncker, whom I hate to contradict, but again and again on this issue: we need a signal in this declaration that points to a social Europe. I understand, yes, when you say: we need immediate action. I support that too! Immediate measures for a social Europe - there are whole programs. Catalogs of measures are available. Thankfully, Parliament also adopted a report on the social pillar and made it clear what is necessary. But what you could do, for example - and I turn to the Presidents, to everyone gathered here: advertise among the Member States! Make a statement in Rome that, for example, the European Union accedes to the enlarged European Social Charter. That would be something. That would be a signal, a very first signal. And say at the same time: We are working on a social pillar. Your declaration, your promise, Mr. Juncker, will have a half-life. It ends in April. At the end of April, when you will submit the proposal on the social pillar. You say we want to come to an agreement by November. Yes, I hope so, because there is no time to lose, because that is the question that many people keep asking. And especially in connection with the Brexit discussion, this will be all the more serious if we don't finally ask ourselves the question and answer the cause. The reason why a large number of unemployed people, including precarious workers in Great Britain, opted for Brexit was also because they had the feeling that they are not getting the answers they need from the European Union, not the support they need, which they need. I would therefore like to say again: It is nice when 27 heads of state have agreed on the election of Mr Tusk as President of the European Council at the summit. That made it clear: There are ways to come to an agreement, but it is not enough for the heads of state to agree, for a brief moment. What we need is that the people, the people who live in our member countries, are united. And in that sense I always have the feeling: Please don't celebrate so much on the 60th anniversary! Take the 60th anniversary as an occasion to fight, to fight for a European Union in which we can all find ourselves, in which we feel good, in which we want to defend, because the living conditions for everyone - for all people within the European Union - will improve. Make sure that the Brexit discussion does not subsequently lead to the rights in particular of people living in the UK are massively injured by EU citizens in the UK. Make sure that the rights of people in the north of Ireland are not violated, that they are not cut off from the Republic of Ireland, that we do not have a new external border there. Let us fight for this together, but always with the aspect that it must be about rights, about enforceable rights for all citizens, for all people who also come to the European Union. And please also reconsider the Dublin regulations, which are planned because this - especially for the Member States of the European Union at the external borders - entails burdens that cannot be dealt with in this way and that will exacerbate their situation. Let's discuss this together. Let's change that. Let us change the European Union into a social, democratic union that is peaceful, then you will have us on your side.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 11, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Philippe Lamberts", "mepid": "96648", "text": "on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group. - Mr President, Mr Tusk, you are a lucky man, because indeed Jarosław Kaczyński - your sworn enemy - wanted your head so badly that he managed to unite the 27 other heads of state and government, none of which - I mean none - wanted to give him this gift. You are therefore renewed in your functions. However, I must say that your first mandate did not impress us, because one wonders, faced with the unprecedented crisis facing the European Union, if you are the man for the job, if you have the leadership and the vision that will bring Europe out of the rut. To judge, I refer to the letter you wrote to the heads of state and government before the summit in Bratislava on September 13th. You seem to take the measure of the disenchantment of many Europeans with regard to European construction, citizens who - to quote you - want to know whether the political elites are capable of regaining control of events and processes that go beyond them, disorient and, at times, terrify them. As the first challenge, you cite the challenge of migration and you are right. There is cause for concern when we see that the causes of migration - whether tyrannies, wars, resource depletion or climate change - are not going to go away. And your answer is Fortress Europe, or how to hold off and push back those fleeing hell. On top of that, in your letter you call those who oppose this concept of Fortress Europe as \"politically correct\". Is it politically correct, Mr Tusk, to consider that it is not normal that Turkey, which is six times less populated than the European Union, twenty times less rich than the European Union, receives twice as many refugees than the European Union? Is it politically correct to denounce the imprisonment of asylum seekers by your friend Orbán's Hungary, without Europe saying anything, in defiance of international law? Is it politically correct to refuse that 2017 sees once again more people die in the Mediterranean after the 2016 record? Where are you, Mr Tusk, when the Member States have to be reminded of their humanitarian responsibility and respect for the law? The second challenge you face is terrorism, and again you are right. I find what you are saying very correct. When you say 'Member States need to cooperate much more, especially in the collection and use of intelligence', you are right. But you cannot ignore that a number of countries see widespread surveillance of our citizens as the one and only response to terrorism. You know that in a democracy there are at least two basic principles. The first is the separation of powers. It is the fact, in particular, that the judiciary must be able to control the executive. The second basic principle is the proportionality between the restrictions applied to the liberty of people and the objective pursued. However, these two principles are increasingly undermined in a number of our Member States, and this time I am going to quote France and Belgium, not always to quote the same ones. Where are you, Mr Tusk, to denounce these abuses in the Member States? The third challenge that you take up is that of globalization and, again, you are right, but I do not understand you anymore. Your speech is incomprehensible, because, once again - to quote you - you reaffirm that free trade and competition serve the interests of Europeans. When this free trade and competition weakens public services and our social security systems, when they level wages and working conditions down, when they destroy tax justice, tell me in whose interests this neoliberal globalization works. I'm telling you, the only Europeans to benefit from this are the owners of capital. The others foot the bill. Where are you, Mr Tusk, when, instead of encouraging this insane logic, you should remind heads of state and government that the ambition of the European Union is shared prosperity? Next week you will be in Rome to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the treaty. This meeting could legitimately be the celebration of 70 years of peace on this continent, with the exception of the former Yugoslavia. I think it’s something to remember and it’s a success. My grandparents went through two world wars, and I am fortunate not to have known those heartbreaks. But if you want this meeting to be the new starting point of European enthusiasm, the meeting in Rome must be the one where a change of course is initiated. We need a fairer Europe, which sets social minimums in all Member States and which organizes, not tax and social competition, but upward fiscal and social convergence. We need a Europe that puts the energy transition at the heart of its investment. Why? Of course, this is a climate imperative, everyone knows that, but we also know that it responds to social needs, to energy poverty, to health needs. More and more people are sick on our continent because of fossil fuels. This meets the economic imperative, because every year we pay hundreds of billions of euros outside of Europe to buy things that we burn, fossil fuels. It is, finally, a strategic imperative, because to whom do we pay these fossil fuels? First and foremost to Vladimir Putin, who is our third-party supplier. We finally need of a Europe which knows how to orient globalization towards social, fiscal, environmental and democratic convergence upwards.Mr. Tusk, I have just one question for you: will you be the man for this situation?Will you be the man who will rise to these challenges?", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 12, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Rosa D'Amato", "mepid": "124835", "text": "on behalf of the EFDD Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President Gentiloni, it is quite impressive to me to note that the guiding star of Europe today is the Prime Minister of yet another Italian government which does not arise from the electoral consultation of citizens. The legitimacy crisis that has hit Italy in recent years concerns the whole of Europe and we have seen it with Brexit; crisis that you have caused, the same ones who spoke at the summit last week of priorities for the new Europe and who are now frightened by the advance of populisms. There is talk of structural reforms but the reality is that they are devices to subject European countries to the diktats of those who do not have the faintest idea of ​​what it means to survive the crisis. There is talk of reforms to modernize European economies: but in reality there are Member States that are the lion's share and States that are their prey. We are ready to whip up any state that tries to breathe in the suffocating grip of the fiscal compact, but don't move a finger if the multinationals evade the tax authorities within Europe itself. And on the social side? With austerity we have left our citizens without work, the sick without drugs, the poor without social assistance. What will the recipe be for employment? Will you replicate the precarious and unprotected formulas that were used in Italy with the jobs act? What happened to the Commission's intentions on European citizenship income? But we also talk about immigration. It is no longer possible for one or two countries to become the refugee camp of Europe, but it is a duty that each one takes on its own responsibility. You say that it is necessary to prevent the phenomenon of landings: well, what does that mean? That we will once and for all stop participating in the wars that cause the surge in migratory flows? What kind of economic development do you have in mind, then? With what impact on the environment, health and climate? With what tools intends to achieve it?With the EFSI?The plan that winks at the banks, with financial engineering products that will create yet another speculative bubble, which has financed projects related to fossil fuels and finances industries such as Ilva that cause death?The truth is that a two-speed Europe already exists, President: we have it under our eyes in Greece and Portugal.There is a Europe of banks, multinationals, lobbies, and a Europe of citizens, of those who have lost their jobs and those who have no rights.In Rome we will propose to the citizens the \"five-star book\", the latest attempt to create a home that is the Europe of citizens.Are you going to give answers to the people out there, their problems and their needs?Stop building armored fortresses, similar to prisons, because otherwise we will either find ourselves having to face ghosts of the past or we will end up overwhelmed by the rubble of the mistakes made so far.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 13, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Matteo Salvini", "mepid": "28404", "text": "on behalf of the ENF Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking to those outside this building, to those in the House, to those who follow us from home, not to those who govern this European Union because they are complicit, hypocritical, false, incapable or naive. You mumble about the threats of the Turkish leader Erdogan: at the moment we are giving him EUR ten and a half billion. If you have any pride and dignity, stop paying these billions of EUR to the Turkish regime. It is not possible to finance people who come to give us lessons in democracy in Europe, who say that there are entire countries in the hands of fascists and racists. But does it seem normal to you? Between one coffee and another, between one aperitif and another, can you suspend this river of public money that goes from the pockets of Italians and Europeans to finance the Turkish regime, yes or no? If you have time, you should also suspend the accession negotiations, which should never have started, because Turkey is not, will not be and will never be Europe, unless someone agrees to do business there. You can't do anything about immigration: record of deaths, record of landings. The euro is a disastrous currency: in fifteen years it has brought four million poor people to Italy, record unemployment and a public debt that has increased by € 800 billion. Someone is raving about removing the duties that protect Italian and European goods from unfair Chinese competition: either you are paid by others or you are crazy! You have renewed the economic sanctions against Russia, the only one that has had the courage to go and set foot in Syria to fight Islamic terrorism. If we had to wait for the European governments or the European Commission to fight ISIS, we would have sat here today, with burqa and machine gun, to give us lessons in democracy.

I demand that the food, the sea and the land that the good Lord left to the European peoples before the arrival of this Commission that is devastating everything arrived.

I am referring to a sentence in the communiqué, which Mr Tusk and Commission President Juncker also referred to, that unemployment in the euro zone is bad, but that it has improved because unemployment was lower in 2016 than in 2009. That is a blockage of reality. If you take Germany out of the numbers, it looks very different. Unemployment in Germany fell from 7.6% to 4.1%, and in the euro zone it rose from 10.2% to 12.2% between 2009 and 2012. That's the reality. And if we imagine what the European Central Bank's projections are for growth - 1.8% this year, 1.7% next year, 1.6% in 2019 - and if we then factor out the autonomous productivity gains, nothing changes unemployment in the distressed southern states. That's the reality. Why has unemployment decreased in our country? Quite simply: the foreign trade surplus of our country has increased from 1% to 9%. Our euro is undervalued, so exports are subsidized. In all other states, in the distressed southern states, the euro is overvalued. That is why the export is cut.

National law in Europe is usually structured in Kelsenian terms, meaning that when Hans Kelsen wrote about national law, he spoke about Stufenordnung : you have certain levels of law in every country. This level of law is actually then turned slightly upside down by the Treaty, because the Treaty follows a different logic, and this is the problem we are running into with every question and every discussion in this House. We need to be able to find compromises between the Kelsenian structure and the structure of the Treaty, and this is the challenge we actually have in front of us. I was the shadow rapporteur of the Berès and Böge report, and I can say that this problem was the problem we ran into every single day. It is the problem you are running into every single day in the Commission and in the Council.

Europe was born to ensure well-being and solidarity for its citizens and today, in a world that has become smaller and smaller with globalization, we would need Europe more than ever to ensure well-being, growth and work. If we do not reduce unemployment, the Prime Minister Gentiloni said just now, there will be no confidence in the future. I say that if we do not reduce youth unemployment, we will have no future. The debate on the future of the European Union should be the debate of young people who today feel excluded, who are excluded today. The European average of youth unemployment is around 22%; in my country it reaches 40% but there are countries where it reaches 46 and 48%. It is certainly the greatest concern of our fellow citizens, a concern that in European families becomes anxiety, anguish. And immigration is also at the top of the list of European concerns. Today the Italian media are sounding the alarm: it is estimated that 250,000 migrants will land on the Italian coasts in 2017, 70,000 more than last year, which was a record year. So, dear President Tusk, your quote \"if you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together\" is nice. But the anger that is felt growing in our communities can give way to hope only if the European Union manages to accelerate and give concrete answers.

I recommend just taking a look back. When we talk about the successes of the last 60 years, it means peace, freedom, prosperity. That has been said several times. But then we can please think about whether we are doing our job well enough when it comes to the question of “securing prosperity”. I don't think the answers have to be: more social services or assuming responsibilities where one is not responsible at all. I don't think the answer is unemployment insurance either. The answer has to be: design the conditions so that jobs are created. And that is the homework for the Commission, but also for us. What are we actually doing to secure jobs in Europe? What are we doing to secure industry in Europe? It is a pity that the President of the Commission is gone and so is the Commissioner responsible for Industry. I would like to know: What suggestions are there actually? How should the share of industry be expanded in Europe? I know an industrial commissioner from previous years. He once suggested that 20% should come from the industrial sector, and we decided that. Does anyone actually care? Are we making the conditions so favorable? Because when industry works, when growth works, jobs are created. If there are jobs, people are good, and you will credit the European project with that.That was a strong qualifier for us in the past.People also thought Europe was great because people are doing well here.And when they are doing well, when they have income, the state has income.If the state has income, one can also pay social benefits.The calculation is that simple.Why are people doing better in countries with strong economic power?Well, to cut a long story short: the Commission should now deliver something, not just on social union, but also on industrial policy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 50, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Jeppe Kofod (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124870", "text": "   – Mr President, I would like to thank the Council, the Commission and others here who have mentioned the importance of celebrating the 60 years of the Treaty of Rome and the fact that we have had peace in Europe for a long time now.

That is why it is important, as the European Union, to maintain a leading active role. Two examples: the agreement with Algeria will allow us to deepen our strategic cooperation in order to overcome our common challenges and provide concrete answers. The Western Balkans are very important. We now need to show unity and consolidate unequivocal support for the region's European perspective. We need to increase the visibility of our actions through concrete initiatives and projects, not just through political declarations. The second aspect is related to migration. Reaching an agreement on the proposal for an entry and exit system by June 2017 is an essential element, but it is important not to allow security fragmentation by excluding from the scope of countries such as Bulgaria, which, although not part of Schengen, have a key important for safeguarding the security of the Union's external borders.

Firstly, the President and you mentioned the White Paper on the Future of Europe. The starting point for each scenario is that the 27 Member States move forward together as a union. If a Member State wants to integrate itself more with others it can already do so today, but nobody who has a willingness to go ahead will be left behind. Building a stronger Europe has been, and will be, an inclusive process.  Secondly, concerning the Western Balkans, the European perspective and enlargement of the European Union: when we prepared our country for EU membership, our people knew that everything we were doing we did for ourselves. All the reforms we made in Estonia were for ourselves, not for Brussels or anybody else, and this is my message also to candidate countries. Enlargement of the European Union is a question of conditionality. If candidate countries fulfil all the criteria, they will be welcome to the Union; if not, they have to try harder.  Thirdly, I would like to stress the economic dimension of the conclusions. In line with the joint declaration of the leaders of the institutions, the European Council stressed the importance of advancing all files related to the single market strategies by 2018. A digital single market will bring tangible benefits to citizens, such as the end of roaming surcharges and unjustified geo-blocking, allowing cross-border portability.  It is only with concrete action that we will create the EU of the future. I thank you all for your continued work and efforts, which will make this happen.

It gives me the greatest satisfaction to hear them here in the European Parliament.  Secondly, I share the views of those who want us not to celebrate in Rome, but to set a clear course for the future. Rome will be one of the stages, not the grand finale, of this discussion. If this discussion is to be effective, there must be cooperation between States and between the institutions. I am declaring this unequivocally and with the deepest conviction.  Thirdly, the White Paper – and especially the multi-speed scenario as one of the forecasts – has sparked a lot of controversy, not only here in Parliament. But, at the same time, it has a sobering affect as a warning to those who have the weakening of the EU in mind. It is my hope that Rome will be a turning point in the reintegration of the Union. I am aware that not all politicians will be our allies, but, as paradoxical as it may sound, the majority of citizens of the countries governed by the Eurosceptics will be on our side.  Fourthly and lastly, Mr Lamberts has said that I owe my re-election mainly to the fact that Mr Kaczyński was against it and that his attack on me helped me.

Anyone who, like many of us here, thinks of Brussels as a home from home, will never forget the moments of panic, of anger, of helplessness and of grief for the victims of those attacks. But since the horrific events of last year, our shock has given way to a grim resolve to counter this terrorist threat and to address both the immediate danger of more attacks and the causes of radicalisation that plague our societies. Nothing is more important to our citizens than the basic right for them to feel safe doing the things that they have always done and living the lives that they choose. Freedom and security are not simple buzzwords that look good on our Twitter feed or in press releases. They are the very core concepts that underpin our way of life, because without them, there can be nothing else. We must do everything we can to keep Europe safe. We can look to the citizens we represent and we can be proud of the work we have done so far to boost the fight against terrorism. But it must continue. And that is why it is so important for the EPP that we are having this debate today. Keeping Europe safer is at the top of our agenda and will remain there. Now in this Parliament we have worked hard to speed up efforts on common EU rules on better information about passengers travelling from and to the EU with our PNR system. We have introduced systematic checks at our external borders. We have pushed forward strategies against radicalisation, against those who preach hate and incite terror. We have gone after the money and tackled terrorism financing and, crucially, we have moved forward towards better support for the victims of terrorism. Terrorism leaves so many hidden victims that its mark stains for generations. We have to give those people a voice, support to return to life, and we have to remember those we have lost. We have done a lot, but there is much, much more that needs to be done if we are to continue to address people’s security concerns in Europe. We will not cease in our efforts until we secure a Europe that is safer. Information-sharing between Member States must be improved and we have to ensure that our law enforcement agencies have all the tools and the resources that they need to respond and to remain one step ahead of the terrorists and their networks. Our IT systems must be able to operate in tandem with each other, and we need to look at what law enforcement controls need improving.  Prevention and prosecution of criminal behaviour must be made more efficient by having a fully-functioning EU criminal record system in place, and at the same time it is essential that we have a coordinated approach to stop the trafficking of illegal arms so often used by terrorists during terrorist attacks in Europe. We need to improve our use of biometric data. The loopholes that were exposed by the Berlin attacker, for example, who had 14 different identities, must be closed.  The EU is not alone in its fight, because terrorism is a global threat that requires a global response. Cooperation with third countries in listing and implementing anti-terror measures needs to remain on the EU’s agenda, and I am convinced that we will get there. But it is true that apprehension remains. My children still get scared when they realise that we still need soldiers outside many public events, and it is true that every time we hear a police siren, a part of us goes back to that fateful day a year ago. But the people of Europe will not cower. Our way of life will go on despite the fear that we must all sometimes feel.   I shall conclude. When our continent came under attack we did not shy away from the challenge. We identified where we need to do more. We stood up and we gave a European response. Our fear did not define us: determination did, and it will continue to do so.

All citizens have the right to live free from fear, whatever their opinions or beliefs. Putting in place measures to prevent and fight terrorism whilst maintaining an open and free society is a delicate balance. While stepping up our counter—terrorism tools, we should preserve our values and fundamental rights. Looking back at where we were before 2015, I think we can safely say that we have come a long way. Together we have adopted a number of legislative instruments and other measures to prevent and fight terrorism. In 2016 together we successfully concluded the negotiations on the Directive on Combating Terrorism within a very tight schedule so that it could be signed today. One of the keys to ensuring the security of our union is better information exchange and better information management. We are therefore working hard to implement the 2016 roadmap on information exchange and information management containing 50 actions for improving information exchange. The high—level expert group on information systems and interoperability set up by the Commission last year is equally important. We are confident that these efforts contribute to enhancing trust amongst Member States and Europol and to increasing information exchange. The figures are quite promising, for example regarding Europol’s databases. The content of the Europol information system increased by 34% between 2016 and 2017 and the number of data on foreign fighters increased by 11%. A record number of 1.4 million searches were performed in the Europol information system in 2016, an increase of 127%. The use of Secure Information Exchange Network Application (SIENA) messaging, which was upgraded to the level ‘EU Confidential’ in 2016 and now better suits the needs of intelligence services, has also increased by 19%. As regards information-sharing by security services, Europol has created the possibility for counter—terrorism units to communicate bilaterally using the Secure Information Exchange Network. The European Counter—Terrorism Centre, operational since January last year, is more and more fulfilling its role as an information and cooperation hub in support of Member States. The Firearms Directive is another important achievement in the fight against terror. Yesterday you approved the compromise text, and this will allow the Council to vote and successfully close the legislative procedure at first reading. The new directive will enhance the traceability of firearms. It will provide more stringent rules in terms of deactivation of firearms. This is particularly important since it was precisely poorly-deactivated and reactivated firearms that were used in some of the recent terrorist attacks. Finally, the new directive also prohibits some dangerous semi-automatic firearms. Radicalisation is something that obviously must be addressed, primarily by Member States but also by a coordinated and broad approach at EU level. We have started updating the set of guidelines agreed in December 2014 to complement the revised EU Strategy for Combating Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism to bring it into line with the current developments. This complements the efforts undertaken by the Commission in relation to the recently-launched network of national prevention coordinators. Focusing on online initiatives, the work of the Internet Referral Unit at Europol is crucial. Cooperation with service providers has proved successful, and approximately 90% of the content considered illegal is taken down by service providers. At the EU Internet Forum Ministerial meeting in December last year, the internet companies involved announced the creation of a new shared database to facilitate identification of potential terrorist content on their platforms. Another important part of our joint endeavours concerns the rights of victims of terrorism, which have been significantly strengthened by last week’s adoption of the Directive on Combating Terrorism. This directive includes a catalogue of specific measures and services for the victims of terrorism. It also introduces a coordination mechanism in case of a terrorist attack. In relation to external borders, an additional safeguard will be provided as of next month, when the amendment to the Schengen Borders Code to reinforce checks against relevant databases at external borders in light of the increased terrorist threats will enter into force. Member States will have to carry out systematic checks on all persons – also those enjoying the right of free movement under EU law – when they cross the external border, both at entry and exit, against databases and in order to verify that those persons do not represent a threat to public order and internal security. Allow me to say a few words on the external security and defence aspects. In the present international environment, Europe must do more to protect its citizens and contribute to peace and stability in its neighbourhood and beyond, including by committing sufficient additional resources. After the endorsement of the EU Global Strategy by the Council in December 2016, the European Council addressed this topic at its meeting last week. It welcomed the real progress made in a number of key areas. Building on that momentum, work will be taken further and the European Council will revert to this issue in June to provide further strategic guidance. I use this opportunity to highlight the fact that last week the European Council reiterated the call it made last December for us, as co-legislators, to agree on the proposal for an entry and exit system by June of this year. We have also been called upon to speed up work on the proposal for the European Travel Information and Authorisation System. I hope that together we will be able to meet this call. Finally, I can assure you that we are continuously striving to improve, to close gaps and to enhance our security, including by assessing our structures and policy, which can contribute to ensuring the EU policies are fit for purpose. I thank you for this opportunity and look forward to hearing both the Commissioners and honourable Members in this debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 117, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, Minister Borg, today we are commemorating a tragic anniversary. Almost one year to the day, terror struck Brussels. We are here, united, to pay our respects to the memory of the victims of terrorist attacks. We remember and honour those who died unnecessarily – innocent citizens. We remember and recognise the suffering of their families, and the survivors of the attacks. They have to live forever with the memory of the atrocities. We all know that terrorism is brutality, an act of inhumanity and of callousness. That is why today is also a day of resolve, of resilience, of determination, to do everything in our power to prevent such terrorist attacks from happening again. This is a duty we all share here in this room, and it is ultimately our duty towards our citizens, who increasingly look towards Europe to feel safe against terrorism. Almost one year ago, we said that the only way to fight terrorism decisively is together, through a genuine and effective Security Union in Europe, where the security of one Member State is the security of all. Starting from our external borders, where we put in place a European Border and Coast Guard, proposed an EU Entry-Exit System, and ETIAS, our Travel Information and Authorisation System for visa-free travellers. Ensuring systematic checks on everybody crossing our borders; working with our strategic partners like the United States of America, but also our neighbours – the Western Balkan countries, Lebanon, Jordan, Tunisia and Turkey; improving the way we exchange information: interconnecting our information systems to make sure we connect all the dots; establishing our European PNR system to track the movements of dangerous persons; criminalising all aspects of terrorism with our new Counter-Terrorism Directive; strengthening our agencies, starting from Europol, where we set up our Counter-Terrorism Centre to help Member States in their operations; cutting the access of terrorists to explosives and firearms (you actually voted on our new Firearms Directive this morning); going after the money of terrorists, with a series of proposals targeting money laundering, asset-freezing, cash movements and suspicious financial flows from third countries; strengthening the security of all modes of transport, which are often the main targets of terrorists. We do this through stepped-up intelligence-sharing, local risk assessments, innovative methods and technologies, and the key role of operators for a successful implementation of measures. And finally, working to counter radicalisation in our communities, schools, prisons, and especially on the internet. Now that Daesh is losing all its territory on the ground, the internet is where they will focus. I have just returned from Silicon Valley, where I went to meet the major internet companies working with us in the EU Internet Forum, an initiative we took two years ago, and it has proved itself very successful. What I confirmed in this visit is that we managed to build a solid relationship of trust and partnership with these companies. Our goals are shared. They want to clean up their platforms from all terrorist content. We want to keep our citizens – their users – safe. Concrete results from this partnership are already visible. The referral mechanism we set up with Europol last year resulted in almost 90% removal rate of the content we refer to the companies. I have seen in action their new project to eliminate terrorist propaganda – a shared database between them to ensure removed terrorist content stays offline. I heard how they want to work with us to bring the smaller, more vulnerable platforms into our partnership. And it is not just about removing terrorist content; it is also about creating content with positive narratives. Today, as I said, we launched the Civil Society Empowerment Programme, with a EUR 10-million financial envelope attached, to help NGOs pass positive counter-messages online. Things are moving forward, but we still have a lot of work ahead of us. We have put important proposals on the table that you need to adopt swiftly to make a difference for the security of our citizens: Entry-Exit; ETIAS; the Schengen Information System, on which work should be completed this year. What we agree should be fully and correctly implemented: PNR; the Counter-Terrorism Directive; our new rules on firearms have entered the crucial stage of implementation, and as you understand, we cannot afford to fail.

Brussels will always remain Brussels. \"Brussels, my beauty\" as Dick Annegarn sang, European Brussels, Brussels with its happy melting pot, symbol of openness and diversity.

Several terrorist attacks have taken lives. What are the lessons we have learned from more than a decade of the fight against terrorism? It is a mistake to say all terrorism is inspired by religion. Terrorist acts are first and foremost criminal acts. Terrorism is difficult to predict, especially when it goes for lone wolf terrorism cases such as Breivik in Norway. We have taken actions. The S&amp;D Group has been a constructive partner in adopting key security measures, but some do not work properly or are not implemented. Let me first stress the most important thing. There can be no freedom without security, but security without respect of fundamental rights is unacceptable. In the S&amp;D Group today we call on the Commission and Member States for concrete actions. We need full analysis of all the measures currently in place at national and EU level. We need to know which are implemented and whether they are efficient, also why some are not working and what is still missing or can be improved. What is certainly missing is the lack of cooperation and information intelligence exchange between countries. We need to better address and tackle the root causes of terrorism around the world. We have to do more on bridging Europe’s social divide. Deradicalisation, social inclusion and education should be at the core of the counter-terrorism strategy. It is wrong to believe we do nothing. In the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs most of the legislation currently deals with security, but security means also human rights, and security also means less social inequalities in Europe.

In the light of this horror, we have voted several very concrete European laws to prevent such attacks in the future. I am thinking of the PNR Directive, which allows intelligence agencies to thoroughly screen passenger data entered when booking an airline ticket. Suspicious travelers now come into their sights much faster. I am also thinking of the recent changes to the Schengen Border Code, which allow us to control all EU citizens at our external borders, including at our international airports.

This terrible toll comes on top of other attacks: Madrid, London, Paris, Nice, Berlin, and I forget some. In total, several hundred dead and nearly ten thousand injured. All of Europe was upset and stunned, bruised, but it immediately pulled itself together to face the threat. In the process, the European Union took a series of measures to prevent and combat the terrorist threat. The Minister and the Commissioner have made an exhaustive list, I will not come back to it. I would like to salute these initiatives, which we have supported, and those which still have to be taken and which we will support. But that is not the gist of my point today. I want to devote my time to the victims. I learned from the press that the last victim hospitalized following the attacks which hit Brussels was able to return to her home on February 15, 2017. The press does not say in what state she is. This press briefing leads me to question whether we have taken the exact measure of the suffering and needs of the victims, and whether our compassion goes beyond words of circumstance. I know that the affected Member States - including mine - have taken more or less rapid and comprehensive measures in favor of the victims. I also know, and the Minister reiterated this, that the European Union, in the new directive aimed at combating terrorist attacks, expressly provides in Article 24 that Member States must support and assist victims. But what about European solidarity? We all proclaim that terrorist attacks are a criminal aggression against the values ​​that we all share, that every attack perpetrated in a country is an aggression directed against all others and against all Europeans, but my question remains the same.We have created a device, the Solidarity Fund, to show our solidarity when one of our countries is the victim of a natural disaster.We are united in the face of nature's failures, but we are not, in the current state of affairs, in the face of the attacks that threaten us all.We intervene for destroyed goods, but we do not do so for bruised families or damaged people.This is a wonderful thing for us ...

And of course they also know that there is nowhere absolute security. But if you look at the Commission's long catalogs, they unfortunately contain everything. Everything that is somehow related to safety is activated according to the principle a lot helps a lot. But that is exactly what is wrong. They lump everything together, stir according to the motto: Let's see. It is similar with the data: you said 34% more data at Europol. Yes, but if all the data that is available to all police authorities is packed into a huge database or several, then the targeted investigation will not be any easier! And the grain of important information that is needed to prevent the next attack is lost in the mass of data. So what we have been asking for in the last few years, like a mantelpiece, is a factual discussion about which data we really need, which measures are suitable and which are not.

I believe that nothing can ever erase their suffering caused by acts that should never have happened. But since these attacks, what have we been doing? I note that the priority, almost everywhere in Europe, is the placing under general surveillance, by technological means, of the whole of society. However, to date, no one has ever been able to establish if and how this generalized surveillance - in place for a long time, especially in Anglo-Saxon countries - has prevented a single attack. At the same time, in Belgium and France, we are going so far as to criminalize, not acts, but intentions. All this seems to me to pose a double democratic problem. First of all in terms of the separation of powers, the laws adopted in many European states give police services powers without any oversight by the judiciary. In a democracy, however, judicial oversight of the executive is important. Then there is always this principle of proportionality: any restriction of liberty must be proportionate to the objective that can be achieved: who can consider reasonable the placing under general surveillance of society and the fact of considering any citizen as a suspect? potential? So what to do? I think the priority for Europeans is simple. Most of the perpetrators of the attacks were known, so it is necessary to collect information in a targeted manner, share this information between the services - we know that the sharing of information remains the weak link in the chain - and finally exploit the information. , and for that we need human resources.

It was just one in a very long list of tragic and pointless acts of violence by religiously-motivated fanatics. They carry out their senseless violence in the name of Allah and Islam. More accurately, they act in the name of Mohammedanism – the cult of Mohammed – which has always fed on blood for the 1 400 years of its existence, and Mohammedans kill their fellow Muslims just as much, if not more, than they kill non-Muslims. If you want to address the problem, you first have to understand and confront its fundamental cause. A minority of Mohammedans take literally some passages in the Qur’an. They read the bits that say ‘make war on infidels, strike terror into the hearts of infidels, and kill infidels wherever you find them’, and they act accordingly. They take literally the passage in the Hadith that says: ‘Judgement day will not come until the Muslims fight the Jews’. It is true that most Muslims are law-abiding, decent people, but all Muslims are followers of the cult of Mohammed. That cult is an ideology of blood-soaked regressive nonsense. Only a tiny minority of Muslims are fundamentalists and fanatics and literalists, but it only takes a tiny minority to plunge our societies into endless terror. All Muslims are not fundamentalists and terrorists, but the more Muslims you have in a population, the more Islam you will get, and the more Islam you have, the more terrorism you will get.

I certainly welcome what the Commissioner is going to do on money laundering, drugs and areas like that because this is, to a large extent, what many terrorists use to actively fund their programmes.

These are essential questions: harmonization of European legislation, strengthening of external border controls, exchange of information or even the fight against terrorist propaganda. Of course, there is still a long way to go. The new Terrorism Directive, which we adopted last month, is an important step. We are in the process of creating a common legal framework, but also and above all a common culture. Building trust between our various intelligence services will not happen overnight, but the idea that a European struggle represents real added value is taking hold. In this sense, I would like to support the establishment of a parliamentary committee on terrorism, as it would be an extremely useful platform for dialogue. Our practices are not always similar, but our objective remains the same: the protection of European citizens. The top priority is file interoperability, as we can no longer afford to let known intelligence terrorists slip through the cracks.

And, it is clear that the commitments made by the Member States have yet to be translated into concrete actions. Parliament invests heavily in the fight against terrorism and ensures that the fragile balance between security and respect for freedoms is respected. One does not go without the other. This is why, for us, the idea of ​​setting up a commission to investigate terrorism is not acceptable. Strengthening security should not come at the expense of freedoms.

The last two years in particular have been marked by too many attacks and by too many victims. Our thoughts go out to them and to their loved ones. As Minister Borg said, last weekend we were with some of those victims, including some of the victims of the Brussels attacks, I was struck again – as I am each time I have the privilege of meeting victims – by their bravery and by the power of their testimony. However, on this occasion I was also struck by the welcome that they gave to the just-adopted Counter-Terrorism Directive, and, in particular, to the elements – not least those introduced by this House and reinforced by this House – on the rights of victims. They welcomed the fact that we were requiring Member States to make sure that victims have access to the support they need not only immediately after an attack, but also for as long as necessary thereafter. That was an important piece of work that we did together. These attacks across Europe display a common factor: many aspects of their preparation and execution are transnational. As a number of you have said, that is why it is so important that we work together to ensure the most appropriate response and increase our collective resilience. I would like to salute the commitment that this House has shown on security dossiers over the recent discussions. It is crucial that we maintain this momentum and continue to work for their rapid and effective implementation. As many of you have said, we have done a lot, but there is still a lot to do.  Many of you have mentioned the importance of information-sharing. As we discussed in plenary last month, I believe we are moving in the right direction; there is a clear increase in the use by Member States of the Schengen Information System and the Europol information system, but there is still a long way to go. I hope that this House will move quickly now to support the proposals that we have brought forward for the reform of the Schengen Information System, including, for the first time, a provision to oblige Member States to share information on terrorism. Step by step, we need to continue our work to build trust. Improving information exchange is also at the heart of our work on interoperability that a number of you have mentioned. Overcoming the current shortcomings in information management is a key priority for the Commission. The process we initiated last year, with the strategy presented in April and the High Level Working Group, will allow us to address these shortcomings in an inclusive and transparent way with you here and with the Council. The Group will present a final report in early May, and that will be a basis for further discussions with Parliament and the Council to look at how best to take this work forward. A number of you have also underlined the importance of operational police cooperation. The Commission has encouraged Member States to make use of the possibility of carrying out police checks in internal border areas. At the same time, and in answer to one of your colleagues, we are considering practical steps to strengthen police cooperation across internal borders. Our objective is to enhance security within the Schengen area, including internal border areas, as part of the work that we are doing to use Schengen to get back to the normal functioning of Schengen. But we will not defeat terrorism with databases and legal frameworks alone.  We also need to continue our work, as many of you underlined, on implementation. We need to tackle radicalisation online and in our communities and prevent the hatemongers from inciting people, often young people, to go down the route of violence. We also need to continue to build our collective resilience and starve the terrorists, and others who seek to do us harm, of the means they use, whether that is arms, explosives or funding. As has been mentioned, while we are focusing on the threats related to terrorism today, quite properly we should not lose sight of the continuing work that we are doing to reinforce our security against serious and organised crime and the threats that come from cyber criminals and others who operate in cyberspace. In all of these challenges, there are no quick fixes. We need to continue to work to ensure the security of European citizens, recognising that this is a long-term challenge requiring the engagement of all of us. For our part, the Commission will continue our efforts to build an effective and sustainable Security Union, and I sincerely hope that we can continue to count on your support in this work.

First, we have been able to speak with one voice and, second, we have been able to achieve the majority of Parliament’s objectives. The vicious circle has now been broken. The importers of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold will have to carry out mandatory due diligence in order to check their suppliers and prevent armed rebels or human rights violations being financed by illegal revenue. The interests of communities and people caught in wars and conflict were our priority. The new regulation has the power to improve reality on the ground in conflict areas. We followed two principles in our work: first to help the people affected by illegal mining and trade conducted by armed groups and, second, to increase the responsibility of all stakeholders, including European industry, in a common effort towards transparency.  The recognition of due diligence schemes proposed by industry associations and responsible sourcing partnerships has become the central element of the regulation. All industry initiatives have to fully comply with the international OECD due diligence guidelines elaborated to help companies respect human rights and avoid contributing to conflict financing. It is important that all companies, including those from downstream in the supply chain whose products contain 3TG, will be encouraged to monitor their sources. Compulsory checks for the importers will ensure that minerals or metals sold on the European market are not used to illegally finance conflicts, particularly in mineral-rich countries affected by conflicts or war.  Educating the stakeholders and achieving long-term sustainable effects is only possible through an approach based on shared responsibility. The regulation proposed to you today will be very important in creating good premises for more prosperity in the conflict areas, and this will lead to more stability. Stability in Africa and all other conflict areas means fewer migration flows to the European Union. To protect SMEs and to minimise bureaucracy and red tape, the regulation offers an exemption for the smallest importers, based on a threshold system designed to cover at least 95% of all imports to the European Union. Through delegated acts Parliament will be able to keep control of the implementation. Parliament also ensured that the Commission will regularly report on the accompanying measures meant to make the regulation more effective. Our aim was to create an efficient and workable regulation and we fully succeeded. Now we will carefully monitor the update by the European companies and, if necessary, we will adjust the system, making use of the powerful review clause included in the provisions of the regulation.  Finally I wish to express my sincerest thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs, the negotiating team members, and all the experts, advisers and staff members involved in this highly technical and very complicated process.

It has been a long work. We passed many hours together in trilogues, etc., but it has been worth it. Today we have a proposal that I hope you will endorse with a big majority tomorrow morning. We have an ambitious and a workable instrument to eliminate conflict minerals from supply chains. It will contribute to addressing the challenges of conflict linked to natural resources, hardship of entire communities and human rights abuses that have for too long accompanied this kind of trade. I am convinced that trade must be based on values, and the conflict mineral regulation is a key element in that approach. The global market-based trade in raw materials can provide a vital source of a stable income to the people and countries who need it the most, but that development needs to be sustainable. Therefore, transparent and responsible supply chains means revenues would not go into the hands of rebel groups but to investment in schools, in hospitals, supporting a well governed state underpinned by the rule of law. It can mean improving people’s lives from conflict and terror to opportunity and hope. It means encouraging the economic growth that helps the poorest regions grow sustainably. In short, this means doing what trade does best – not contributing to war and instability but delivering sustainable jobs and real opportunities. The most obvious example of the conflict linked to minerals is around the great lakes of Africa. Millions have been killed, millions more injured since the first Congo war broke out some 20 years ago, but it is certainly not the only example, so that is why this regulation takes a global approach. The United Nations, the G-8, honourable Members of this House have called for an integrated approach combining trade, development and other policies. That is good. We need to use all the tools we have. And we have responded to your call. We have worked across the Commission services with the External Action Service, basing ourselves on the work done by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as the main actor in this field, and the regulation you will vote on tomorrow is just one of the components of our action, and I would like to remind you of some of the others. We are fully on track with the EUR 20 million development aid package announced in 2015, and this will include financial support via the OECD Secretariat, helping the responsible production of gold, peace-building and stabilisation in Central and West Africa. It will help assistance and training for those on the ground; it will help vulnerable women and children affected by the conflict; it will be a support for the International Conference for the great lakes region and a Dutch-led private-public European partnership for responsible minerals. It will help EU small and medium-sized and micro-enterprises to understand their due diligence on conflict minerals and, picking up on the very important suggestion by this House, we will also have the OECD due diligence guidance translated into all the EU official languages. We are also reaching out to other governments to encourage them to source responsibly – this month to China and India, last month to the United Arab Emirates and many African countries including Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia and the African Union. This is what I mean by shaping globalisation. Unfortunately, some of the vibes we are picking up from Washington on this matter are not encouraging. We do not know yet for certain the approach by the new US administration, but this should certainly not alter our results. On the contrary, it underlines all the more the importance of European leadership here.

After long and difficult discussions, we have managed to reach an agreement which is a great success for all three EU institutions. As rapporteur for the opinion in the Committee on Development, I believe that this regulation is the cornerstone of an effective tool to break the link between conflict, human rights violations and our use of everyday goods. The interests of the community, people for whom wars and conflicts are destroying their lives, must be our priority. Under the regulation, due diligence checks in line with the OECD guidelines will be mandatory for importers of tin, tungsten, tantalum, gold and their ores from conflict and high risk areas.

If you take the example of the Congo and look at how bad the situation is in countries where raw materials are exploited, you will see that we definitely need regulation in the European Union too. With this regulation we want to ensure that as far as possible no more raw materials enter the European Union which, on the one hand, help to finance armed conflicts and, on the other hand, where workers are in really intolerable conditions - and that is what happens to us Example in the Congo instead - the raw materials have to be exposed accordingly. That is why it is good that we are making this regulation. But we should always consider: Do we have a good intention, or how do we make sure that we put a good answer after a good intention and respond with a good prescription? For example, what the Americans achieved with the Dodd Frank Act was well intended, but the result is not particularly great. Many companies in America are currently avoiding the Congo, for example, and no longer purchase any raw materials from there. This also means that the many mines that work properly and cleanly, some of the family businesses that work properly and cleanly, no longer have any prospects for the future and had to submit orders. That was a de facto embargo against the Congo. That is why it was very important to us that we make the regulation in such a way that the companies there have a perspective, that the young people can find jobs there, that we do not impose an embargo, but that we enable companies in Europe to do so to be able to buy raw materials in this country in the future with a clear conscience. That is why my appeal to European companies is: Please take part in these certification procedures! Please continue to take raw materials from the conflict regions! You can be sure now that these raw materials are not stained with blood, but that they are clean.With this in mind, congratulations to our colleague Iuliu Winkler, who, in cooperation with the rapporteurs and with the Commission and the Council, delivered a very good result.We really have created something to help our consumers, but especially those affected in the states where they work.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 183, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Maria Arena", "mepid": "124936", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D group. - Madam President, Commissioner, tomorrow we will finally vote on a regulation which will make it possible to exclude so-called \"blood minerals\" from the European Union market.

All these minerals are currently used in our daily lives: in our mobile phones, in our tablets, in our refrigerators, in our cars, etc. The vast majority of them come from regions that are in conflict, but also from regions that do not respect human rights in the exploitation of these minerals. We have talked a lot about the Great Lakes region, but I think that this regulation also aims - and this is what is interesting - not to target regions in particular, but to target all the regions in which these rights humans are not respected today. Women, children exploited, raped, murdered at the altar for the simple profit of certain companies. The initial Commission proposal, - you will agree - was based on a voluntary approach, which seemed to us, here in the European Parliament, not very ambitious.

Thank you, Mr Rapporteur, for the constructive cooperation. But let's remember why we are here today. War conflicts are often about enrichment. Warlords lead armed gangs with whom they want to gain or defend control over raw material areas and mines. To gain access to gold, coltan, tungsten or tin, people are murdered. A large part of the find is extorted as protection money from small mines, in which children often toil. The raw materials are turned into money. The money is used to buy weapons. More fighters can be equipped with more weapons. Whoever has more fighters has more power. Whoever has more power can control a larger area and steal more raw materials and regain more wealth. The spiral turns and is far too often an endless military loop. But, colleagues, this business model works because, in the interests of the value chain, some unscrupulous companies have been buying raw materials from the warlords for a long time. Such companies also operate in Europe. With this new European law, we are now thwarting them. So today is a good day! For the first time, companies are required to exercise due diligence for the supply chains of their raw materials. Companies at the beginning of the supply chain - these are metal smelters and refineries - have to prove the origin of their raw materials. But unfortunately only in three years! How many more victims will there be during this time? Commissioner, you should take a proactive approach to companies now and urge them to introduce supply chain controls quickly. I ask you to take action early on with the accompanying measures and to go beyond the ongoing projects in an innovative way. Then we are on the right track with this legislation.

Those who deal in the four metals – tin, tanatalum, tungsten and gold – will need to check that their supply chain has no links to human rights abuses or armed conflicts. It should also be noted that, although Parliament does not have formal powers to initiate legislation, this process began with the work of my colleague Judith Sargentini here in Parliament, with the Commission following up her own-initiative report with its own proposal. Parliament refused to accept the Commission and Council’s preference for a voluntary code, which is why we now have these important binding rules for the imports of conflict minerals. We are disappointed that the final deal includes some important loopholes, particularly the fact that while Parliament’s proposal included mandatory due diligence for manufacturers of products such as computers, mobile phones or laptops, this was watered down during the trilogues so that imported goods using the metals identified will not now be subject to the same binding rules. But overall, we are pleased with these binding rules on conflict minerals.

Three years ago we said enough and we started working on a law that would stem this phenomenon. Thus, after long negotiations, hundreds of amendments and thousands of hours of work, the first European regulation that puts an end to the supply of conflict minerals is about to come to light. Those who want to import them now must first verify their origin and carry out all the necessary checks to prevent the minerals from being stained with blood.

Metallurgy and refining facilities are an important point in the global mineral supply chains and are the last stage in which the verification of information on the origin of minerals and the surveillance chain can be effectively ensured. After this stage of change it is often considered impossible to trace the origin of the minerals.

As is well known, all labor and human rights are violated during mining.

You probably know that a year ago the Presidents of three European political parties – the European People’s Party, the Party of European Socialists and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – asked the Commission in a letter to present a legislative proposal amending this regulation. Since the beginning of this year, this regulation is now fully applicable. The Presidents requested the Commission to examine and initiate a review of the regulation on three substantial provisions related to efficiency, credibility and legitimacy. Those are the reduction to 7.5% of the 15% co—financing obligation, the increase of the minimum representation in the European Parliament to three members to qualify for receiving public funding, and the prevention of cross—party membership. In the reply the President of the Commission, though giving preference to first gathering some experience on the implementation of the regulation, also stated that the Commission was open to discussing the issues raised by the three co-signatories representing the main existing European political parties. In the meantime, Parliament’s Secretary—General also presented the report to the Bureau of the Parliament. We proposed three amendments, but there are many more issues that require reflection, for example  the possibility of limiting contributions in kind, allowing for the possibility to finance referendum campaigns or to provide for an assessment of the financial capacity of the parties before any application for funding, to mention just a few. After intense discussions, my committee, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, decided to present this oral question in order to raise awareness of this important issue. Let me say that we see that the new regulation ensures greater transparency and accountability of European political parties. However, there are shortcomings that need to be addressed. Let us be clear about one thing: this oral question is not about asking for more money, but for the money to be spent efficiently, correctly and with respect for the values of the European Union.  This is not about banning parties with critical opinions on the Union. We believe in democracy, and in a democratic system every person is entitled to freedom of speech and opinion. However, those who do not respect European values as they are stated in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union, and engage in clear racist, undemocratic and discriminatory actions and behaviour, should not fund their actions with European funds.  We may understand the Commission’s reluctance to initiate a revision of a regulation whose implementation has just started. However, I would also like to remind the Commission that, on a number of occasions, it stated very clearly that incentives for speculative behaviour should under no circumstances be granted. In our view it is becoming more and more evident from cases brought to our attention by the press that abuses with, and also misuse of, European funds are happening far too often. The shortcomings that have been signalled in the oral question should be swiftly addressed, in our view, in order to guarantee that the highest standards of probity are respected. We should indeed reflect whether one—man parties really contribute to forming European political awareness and expressing the political will of citizens of the Union.  But, besides elections, referenda are also an important instrument to express the will of the population in a democratic, organised and well—informed way. The current regulation prohibits any funding linked to referendums. It makes it impossible for parties and foundations to take positions in public on issues of fundamental importance for the future of citizens. This is in clear contradiction with the European Parliament’s position expressed in its resolution of 6 April 2011 on the European political parties’ participation in referendum campaigns when the referendums concerned are directly linked to issues relating to the European Union. We could reflect whether it would not be advisable to allow funding referendum campaigns on issues relating to the European Union where political parties can help form European political awareness. We would therefore like to hear from the Commission about its intentions, and we also urge it to react quickly to our request if this possible revision is to be, preferably, adopted before the next European elections in 2019. This regulation falls under the codecision procedure, so I would also like to ask the Commission whether it could inform Parliament on any exchanges it has undertaken with the Council in order to evaluate the openness of the other co—legislator towards this possible revision. I regret that we cannot ask the Council this question directly.

The Commission is a strong supporter of a vibrant, dynamic system of political parties active in a European-level public space. This is important in our European Union based on democracy, as we have just heard. It contributes to the democratic foundations of our work together, including some of the bases for the election of the Commission President and the appointment of the Commission. We therefore welcome the opportunity to discuss the question of European political parties and foundations today, in particular – as has just been noted – the regulation adopted by Parliament and the Council in November 2014 is now coming into effect. The new regulation brings into play important innovations. These include a European-level legal personality for parties and foundations, and a more robust set of governance arrangements, including a new authority for European political parties and foundations, and enhanced safeguards to ensure respect for fundamental European values by all parties registered under the scheme. On this last point, it is now a condition for registration as a European party or foundation that the entity concerned respects, both in its programme and in its activities, the values on which the European Union is founded: respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law, and respect for human rights, including the right of people belonging to minorities. This clarity is most welcome.  Furthermore, at any time after registration, Parliament, the Council or the Commission may ask the new authority to verify whether a particular party or foundation continues to comply with these requirements. After consulting a new permanent committee of independent eminent persons, the authority can decide to deregister a party or foundation which is found not to comply, unless Parliament or the Council disagrees. This is an important standing safeguard. So the new regulation is a welcome and substantive improvement to the rules governing political parties and a good defence instrument for our European values. Beyond this, the Commission has taken good note of the suggestions for further possible changes to the regulation, which are outlined in the oral question in front of us today (the initiative of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs). We take these suggestions very seriously. Even good rules can be further improved. The Commission is fully prepared to assist Parliament with well-reflected initiatives and proposals. Of course, in line with our better regulation principles, our normal practice – as you know – is to evaluate existing legislation before proposing changes, and to assess fully the potential impact of such changes. As President Tajani always says, quality is often as important as speed. I am pleased that the regulation includes a very early review clause with first Parliament and then the Commission being obliged to report on its implementation in the coming months. The Commission’s report will be accompanied by proposals for any legislative changes that appear necessary. The Commission is more than willing to engage, in depth, with Parliament and the Council to monitor closely the early stages of implementing the new regulation and to reflect together on whether early proposals for change might be justified.  The Commission will be very open, if you agree, to setting up quickly an interinstitutional process – perhaps under the auspices of the new authority – to review developments, assess suggestions from stakeholders, and hopefully converge on a common approach. This would also help pave the way for the formal reviews that must in any case take place next year.  Turning to the specific suggestions, I would like to share some initial comments while stressing again that the Commission rules nothing out at this stage. First, on reducing the co-financing requirement. In 2012, the Commission, taking up a request from Parliament, proposed just such a change. Unfortunately, this met with strong opposition in the Council and was not included in the final text adopted by the co-legislators. As things stand, it is not clear that a new proposal on these lines would meet a different fate. Second, on increasing the level of representation required in this House before applying for EU funding. We need to consider carefully the principles of proportionality and equal treatment, since the rules on party funding should not tilt the balance in favour of incumbents, compared with new political movements, provided of course these new movements also uphold European values. Third, on cross-membership. The issue here is whether MEPs from a national party which is affiliated to a European party should be able to be members, on an individual basis, of different European parties. The new regulation already makes clear that in such circumstances, the individual membership does not count towards the representation threshold for funding of a European party. Could a similar restriction apply to the threshold for registration? We can think about it and examine the potential consequences. On the other hand, we are not aware of an objective basis for limiting choices of MEPs in this regard when their national party is not affiliated to a European one. Fourth, is the question of whether European parties should be able to finance campaigns for national referendums on EU issues. The Commission would like to hear the views of Parliament and Member States on this important but sensitive matter. As concerns several more technical issues such as a financial capacity criterion, we are happy to take a closer look. Parliament could also see how far its own implementing rules could be adjusted to help within the framework of the existing regulation.  Finally, we see many arguments against allowing reserve-building by parties and foundations. This would seem to go against the budgetary principles of annuality and sound financial management, and would increase risks to the control of EU contributions by making it more difficult to identify and correct possible irregularities. It would make it more likely that, should there be irregular spending, it would have to be recovered after European elections rather than before, which could prove sensitive for reasons we can all imagine. So at this stage, we continue to think the existing n+2 rule strikes the right balance. As I said, the Commission is keen to engage on all these issues with Parliament and with the Council, so we look forward to hearing all of your views in today’s debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 216, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "György Schöpflin", "mepid": "28135", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, I would particularly like to thank the Commissioner for a very thorough exposition of the Commission’s position. I think we can all agree on two things: without political parties democracy as we currently understand it is inconceivable. The running of political parties requires ever greater outlays in order to ensure that voters are properly informed of their choices. So if politics is a costly pastime, say, at the Member State level, how much more expensive is it at the European level? And as far as this Parliament is affected it is this European level that matters.  What we are focusing on today is the statute and funding of European political parties and European political foundations. When it comes to funding, the European political parties are currently required to secure 15% of their financing from their own resources. In the light of experience, this 15% should be reduced and the appropriate regulation be amended accordingly.  Then the definition of a European political party should be looked at again. Currently such a party can claim support from Parliament on the basis of having one elected MEP. This seems too low a threshold and should well be increased.  Finally, there is the perplexing situation where the European Parliament ends up financing parties or foundations that proclaim values entirely at variance with those of the European Union and indeed European integration. In a democracy the voicing of such views, repellent or otherwise, can be acceptable but it really is hard to see why the European Parliament should be subsidising political forces that are trying to ensure that it is eliminated. So, turkeys voting for an early Christmas? Well, not exactly, but I can see a certain family resemblance.

The regulation on the status and funding of European political parties and foundations needs to be revised and I am glad that the largest groups in the European Parliament have decided to ask the Commission to correct some problematic issues. To begin with, I am referring to the 15% of the obligation to finance the budget of European parties and foundations, which must be reduced. Maintaining this requirement will lead to budgetary constraints for European parties and foundations at a time when they should be active in countering growing Euroscepticism. In general, European parties receive this amount either from the parties in the national states, through the contributions of their own members, or from the national governments. However, it must be borne in mind that the number of party members across Europe is declining and funding from national governments has been reduced in most Member States. One argument for which we cannot postpone the revision of the regulation is also the approach of the European election in 2019, and a large-scale campaign can ensure the increase of interest and turnout of citizens. This also implies the need to fund the campaign of the candidates proposed for the post of President of the European Commission. The funding of other campaigns and referendums with an impact at European level must also be considered. In conclusion, although they are in great need of funding, European parties do not have sufficient funds. In addition, in order to increase transparency and prevent abuses, a Member of the European Parliament should be a member of a single European political party. Last but not least, the requirement for representation in the European Parliament a parties receiving funding.In order to prevent the fragmentation of the European political scene, the number of representatives in Parliament of a European party must be increased to a minimum of three.It is obvious that the resources that parties and foundations have to share under this regulation are limited, and hence the following situation: the more parties and foundations we have, the less funds each will receive.Dear colleagues, we need to make sure that parties and foundations will be able to finance their activities, while respecting all the rules of transparency in spending public funds.We therefore call for a revision of the existing regulation in the interests of both the European parties and the European Union as a whole.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 218, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Kazimierz Michał Ujazdowski", "mepid": "23791", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group.- Madam President!I am also glad that the regulations governing the financing of political parties and European foundations will be reviewed.I would like this review to be based on the right, reliable criteria.In short, we have the right and even a duty to fight pathology, but under the pretext of fighting pathology, we must not violate the political freedom of political parties and their independence.If the facts of corruption are known - they should be revealed, if the facts about the existence of fictitious European parties are known - they should be revealed and we should consider how to counteract it.But the whole regulation should be conducive to freedom and political pluralism, and parties with a positive mission, functioning without any problems, without pathology should enjoy unhindered freedom and support from European institutions.Fighting pathology - yes, but protecting freedom.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 219, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "António Marinho e Pinto", "mepid": "124742", "text": "on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, public funding for European political parties is of the utmost importance for the rule of law, but it generates conflicting tensions within the democratic system. On the one hand, public subsidies to parties lessen the need for their private financing, and, consequently, the propensity for corruption, that is to say for the making of public decisions in exchange for payments or private advantages. But, on the other hand, the public financing of the parties generates an enormous aptitude to transform the political struggle into a professional activity, which becomes attractive because of its remunerations and personal benefits and not for its intrinsic purposes of public service and citizenship. The professionalization of political activity has the most damaging consequence of the overlap or prevalence of the professional interests of political agents over the collective interests of the citizens they represent. In addition, this professionalization favors cloudiness and opacity and not transference. Transparency not only in the allocation of funds, but also in the way in which political parties spend these funds. The best answer to prevent these dangers is more in the creation of mechanisms that effectively guarantee this transparency, as well as the effective public scrutiny of party spending, than in giving in to populist pressures or drives to reduce or hinder access to public funding by European democratic parties. European taxpayers' money will only be well spent if it is used only to achieve the public ends that determined the collection of taxes from citizens.

It is an unusual occurrence that European political parties want to have a regulation changed that is supposed to regulate their work, but has not yet come into force at the time of the complaint.

On the other hand, the framework conditions for the action of the European political parties are currently changing significantly, and new objectives are also emerging. It would be natural for the European Parliament to work out a position here. But there is still no such common opinion. The following questions therefore also remain unanswered: Do we really want European political parties to intervene in open political processes in member states? Do we really want parties that have been granted substantial funds to claim even more, on the assumption that they cannot raise their own funds? What new political requirement has arisen to allow the latter to be defined with regard to the prohibition of the profit purpose?

We are very reluctant to initiate a revision of a regulation which just entered into force two months ago and without a proper assessment. In fact the review clause is foreseen for the new regulation in 2018; there is no need for a revision now. 2. The main concern of some colleagues is to prevent the misuse of European funds, which has been detected as a practice of some extreme right wing parties; we completely agree with that. Mainly, we have to make it impossible for cross membership of MEPs belonging to the same party. We have to avoid being cheated by them. However, some of the proposals may put at risk the existence and funding of small pro-European parties; not to count members of the regional parliaments as elected members of a European party would also be negative as a representation contagion. We have to include them, since some measures would harm the political diversity and representation of citizens.  3. We agree with the reduction of the cofinancing obligation under 15%.

The true test of the strength of your commitment to democracy is what happens when people start expressing views that you do not like. We have heard some pretty awful examples, frankly, of the expression of freedom of speech right here. This House contains everything from communists to fascists – vile views from far-right to far-left. When we hear things like Korwin-Mikke’s views on women and equal rights, I do not want to defeat them through suppression and penalties. I want them to be defeated at the ballot box. When we hear communism or fascism expressed in this Chamber, or frankly anywhere else, I want it defeated in public democratic debate.  And so it is, I think with the European political parties. Weber wants to state-fund them, but only if he likes their views of the European Union. Well, state-funding views that you like and suppressing those that you do not that is not Voltaire. That is Orwell.  I think a lot of people who are pro-EU fear eurosceptic views and fear the popularity of eurosceptic views. But you cannot stop an idea whose time has come, and our time came on 23 June last year. I always try to take a broader perspective, to ask what it would be like if the boot was on the other foot. I just wonder, from the UK, I am a unionist, but could you imagine the uproar if the British government had treated the Scottish nationalists in this way? I do not agree with their secessionist mantra, but is the right of the people of Scotland to decide their own future, as they recently did in a referendum. If we in the UK treated the Scottish nationalists in the way that this place treats eurosceptics, then the people would be up in arms. It is a testament to how ineffective those European political parties are that nobody even notices. I would rather scrap them altogether, stop pouring taxpayers’ money at it.

There are two points: one is that this institution, and the Council and the Commission, have shown themselves to be completely incapable of considering a change of direction or of invoking any change. That frustration and irritation leads to a eurosceptic voice that seeks representation in this Parliament. This Parliament has no right to start redrawing a map in terms of funding and resourcing just because it wants to shut down euroscepticism across the European continent.

To comment briefly on the previous speaker: I hope that all of what the previous speaker understands by eurosceptic oxygen will not have to be experienced as nationalistic nitrogen that is coming our way. In the present debate we will certainly continue to have long discussions about what the requirements for a party should be from an immaterial point of view. I advocate that we eliminate the serious manual errors that Mr. Scholz correctly pointed out. The point is that we should no longer allow MEPs who have run and been elected for a national party and who are not part of any European structure to cheerfully set up one structure after the other. It has already been shown that this is being done, and we have to put a stop to it. In future, it should no longer be possible for a single MP from the second or third national level to be sufficient to found a party who just claims they will run in the next European elections. These are undesirable developments that we should not tolerate. We should also make it clear that those who use the money incorrectly - I do not mean to say fraudulently - must also be able to claim the money back, and that we do not then find out that the party is no longer there or is insolvent. It was therefore an important step today that the European Court of Justice considered it permissible for this House to demand bank guarantees in the given case, and in the justified case, in order to ensure that we get back money that was misused. And finally, one last thought: in the referendums, I do not believe that we should pretend that we are aseptic beings and that we can use a scalpel to tear apart party activities at the political level like a filet.

One is that I think we have to prevent cross-party membership. It has been said already. There have been MEPs from one Member State party who have been supporting two different European parties, getting funding for both of them. This has to stop.  On another [matter you raised], I think, and I am not alone in this, that we have to publish the names of those elected members, of the European Parliament – that is [already] published – but also of national and regional ones who are members of the European political parties, because we are elected people and we are public. It is not about privacy. This is about knowing who makes up the European parties.  You asked about national referendums.

We cannot allow that. European referendums, yes, but not national. And the last one, I think we have to stick to one MEP making up a European party, that is not...

I am pleased that we are having this security and defense debate as part of our report. I would like to thank my colleague Gonzáles Pons and the shadow rapporteurs - thank you for the constructive cooperation. Given the deterioration in our security situation, it is imperative that we go boldly on the path to a European Defense Union. We must do more to better ensure the security and defense of our citizens and the EU as a whole. Russia's war in Ukraine, tensions in the Balkans and crumbling states in the southern neighborhood require it. Our transatlantic partners will only stand by their obligations to us if we do our part. The decision-making situation in the NATO framework is very ambitious. We cannot avoid additional spending, but at EU level better spending means using European procedures and also the EU budget intelligently. Even with more joint planning and procurement, a European Defense Union as a European pillar will strengthen the transatlantic alliance. Especially in our immediate neighborhood - in the Western Balkans or in North Africa - NATO is not necessarily the instrument with which our transatlantic partners want to be involved in these problem areas. With this report we are setting a new milestone on the way to common defense and a defense union. For years, the Commission and the Member States failed to make use of the security and defense policy possibilities of the Lisbon Treaty. We have pointed this out in the EP since the Treaty entered into force. For example, we are now looking forward to concrete proposals to implement the European Defense Action Plan and the Defense Fund. We want a reformed European Defense Agency and the one to be launched Establish permanent structured cooperation as EU institutions sui generis. This means nothing more than that we want to give these institutions access to EU procedures and funding. We are not militarizing the EU with this. What we are doing, however, is to improve the protection of our citizens and the Union by improving existing military capabilities with the help of EU instruments. Not we are waging a war in Ukraine, but Russia. We are not destabilizing the Sahel, Iraq and Syria, but Islamist terrorists. It is not us who play dangerous games in the Western Balkans - but we have to react if necessary. The Dayton Agreement with Bosnia-Herzegovina will not be guaranteed by the USA, if anyone questions it, we have to do it ourselves. We must finally put an end to the fact that the European Council and the Member States have decided that business as usual is simply going on. By this I mean parts of the summit resolutions on defense of 2013 and 2015 that have not yet been implemented. I ask you: where is the EU-wide system of security of supply? Where are the civil-military standards or common or at least mutually recognized certification rules for armaments? Why did the EP have to take action on defense research? And when does the Commission dare to put an end to the abusive application of Article 346 when Member States are undermining the internal market for defense equipment and bypassing the Europe-wide tender with the reference to a “requirement to safeguard essential security interests”? Most of the time, it is a matter of placing orders with one's own company despite higher costs at the expense of the taxpayer. There is an urgent need to start common defense, European capability and arms policy, as well as permanent structured cooperation and the Defense Agency to make it fit for future tasks with a reform.The Lisbon Treaty enables us to do this.

Europe - including the UK - faces an uncertain and confusing international scene in the area of ​​security and defense. Fortunately, we seem to finally realize that taking on more responsibility is no longer a task of the future, but a requirement of the present. It seems that we have finally assumed that Europe has to be able to defend and protect itself - because they will not always come from outside to defend us - that we have to guarantee the permanence of our values ​​and the safety of our citizens. The report that we present today expresses the position of this Parliament to advance in the construction of a Europe of security and defense and reminds us that we cannot start the house with the roof. The Lisbon Treaty is a coherent and sufficient institutional framework to make our way. No new Treaties are needed. The problem is that, until now, we have not used it. Because - make no mistake - the little progress that has been made in European common defense to date depends only on the lack of political will of the States and not on the lack of legal instruments. That is why we ask the States to participate in the mechanisms of permanent structured cooperation and in the creation of an integrated European force, as provided for in the Protocol. We welcome the Commission's announcement of the launch of the first joint planning military barracks, which is also a demand of this report and which should serve as the embryo of the future European Union headquarters for its military operations. This report makes it very clear - and we also wanted it to make it very clear - that the Europe of common defense is not incompatible with NATO. What we analyze it's how we can better cooperate and complement NATO to be more efficient. The point is that we must consider how to participate in NATO, united or divided into twenty-seven parts. Uniting our defensive capacities instead of adding twenty-seven national policies would also suppose a great economic saving, because we are buying or investigating twenty-seven times the same thing. A saving that a report by this Parliament estimates between 26 and 130 billion euros. If we can spend together, shop together, and invest to research together, we will spend much less. More defense integration will also bring operational advantages, improve the competitiveness and functioning of the European defense industry, create jobs - this is important - and allow States to implement projects that they could not on their own, especially those that could not. they are the biggest. And coordination and information sharing will be improved, which are some of the most important pending tasks we have. In this report, we also claim that the European Defense Agency has full political, economic and operational support. I therefore ask for a vote in favor of this report, so that it can serve as a roadmap for the European Commission and also for the Rome Declaration next week, which has made security and defense one of its priorities. . The European Parliament must lead the search for a common defense and security project. We cannot move forward without all countries making a real commitment to do so; there are no excuses. Because there is no greater respect for national sovereignty, for the territorial integrity of each of our countries, than being able to defend jointly, each contributing the best it has. Common European defense is already an urgent matter on which the future of the Union also depends. No one is going to come back to defend us. We will have to defend ourselves from now on and, for that, the first thing is organize ourselves.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 258, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Ian Borg", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Madam President, today I am here speaking on behalf of High Representative Mogherini as she could not be in the Chamber for this debate. However, allow me to remark that the High Representative appreciates the work of Mr Gahler and Mr González Pons on the report, and her views and those of Parliament coincide in many areas. The report addresses critical issues that you have been working on during the implementation of the security and defence aspects of the EU Global Strategy (EUGS). The conclusions reached on the EUGS implementation define common strategic priorities and a common vision in security and defence and has set out how CSDP, as part of wider EU efforts, can contribute to tackling today’s and tomorrow’s multifaceted security challenges and protect European citizens. I know that High Representative Mogherini would like to underline, at the very beginning, that she attaches critical importance to working together with the European Parliament on defence issues as natural allies in this effort. As you know, on 6 March, High Representative Mogherini presented the progress achieved in the security and defence implementation of the EUGS to the Foreign Affairs Council. The Council conclusions adopted served as the first progress report to the March European Council according to the tasking received in December last year. On 9 March, the Heads of State and Government welcomed the work done and asked to continue with even greater determination and speed.  The High Representative is pleased to report that, despite very tight timelines, significant progress has been made since December. Currently there is work being done on the three pillars of the package: not only on the global strategic implementation of security and defence, but also on the European defence action plan from the Commission, EU-NATO cooperation and the follow-up to the Warsaw Joint Declaration. This work is even more important at a time when expectations and questions are raised more or less openly inside the European Union, as well as outside, about the EU’s commitment and ability to act as a security provider. There is no better answer to such expectations and questions than real, tangible progress on concrete issues. On military planning and conduct capability, the Foreign Affairs Council last week agreed to establish a permanent military planning and conduct capability for the European Union’s non-executive military missions. It will be established within the European Military Staff (EUMS) and will operate under the responsibility and command of the Director-General of the military staff. At present, there are three such missions: in Mali, Central African Republic and Somalia, which are currently only led by headquarters in the field. This decision will also contribute to enhanced civilian or military cooperation. Experts from the Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC) and its civilian counterpart, the CPCC, will form a joint support coordination cell to facilitate mutual assistance and coordination. The new structure will be operational in the coming weeks. On defence cooperation: the European External Action Service also has a clear mandate from the European Council to strengthen defence cooperation. Ambitions need to be underpinned by sufficient resources, both nationally and at EU level. It is equally important to make more effective use of the defence budgets by reducing fragmentations. The 28 Member States, for example, have 154 weapons systems in use. The United States has only 27. Moreover, around 80% of defence investment in Europe is still spent on a national basis. In the report, reference is also made to the costs of non-European defence. The European Defence Agency is working hard to strengthen defence cooperation, and the Commission is also mobilising its instruments. It is clear that defence capabilities will remain Member State-owned. Progress in this field, through EU instruments, will also benefit NATO, as there will be a single set of forces. Therefore, these efforts will be pursued further in a way that ensures coherence with parallel work within NATO. It is important to note as well that any success will have an impact on transatlantic burden-sharing. But let us be clear: Europeans have to do this for themselves. This is about protecting our citizens. The main current efforts to deepen defence cooperation in developing capabilities are centred on the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence, permanent structured cooperation, as well as the European Defence Action Plan. The Coordinated Annual Review on Defence should be a Member States-driven mechanism. It will contribute to the increased transparency of national defence plans and help make cooperation the norm. Based on Member States’ guidance, a set of concrete modalities will be prepared. The Council has also been tasked with further work on the permanent structured cooperation, an important tool also highlighted in your report. Permanent structured cooperation is about enabling those Member States who are willing to undertake more binding commitments towards one another to do so. Countries wishing to be part of it will need to make concrete commitments and join concrete cooperation projects. While it is open to all Member States and maximum inclusiveness is pursued, there is no automaticity or a free ride. Permanent structured cooperation can help develop defence capabilities but also to pool and share existing military assets so that we can make more efficient use of them in our operations. Member States will work on the common commitments as well as the projects and initiatives they can provide to the permanent structured cooperation. These projects need to be ambitious and support the overarching aim of preparing the most demanding missions. On the European Defence Action Plan, it proposes actions to support Member States’ efforts in delivering capabilities through greater cooperation and fostering a strong, competitive and innovative European defence industrial base, including by setting up a European Defence Fund. These are very important initiatives that also show the added value of the European Union to enhance the effectiveness and the performance of our defence sector. Once again, on behalf of High Representative Mogherini, I would like to reiterate that further work on the EU battle groups will be undertaken, as these are key military assets. Yet the European Union has never deployed a battle group, despite the fact that it could have been useful on several occasions. This will be referred back to Council in May. There is also work to be done to improve situational awareness, reinforcing the structures that sustain these efforts, in particular the Intelligence and Situation Centre (INTCEN). On the capacity-building and support of security and development, a proactive approach is being promoted to identify concrete projects while supporting a positive outcome on the legislative process including the European Parliament. The report also highlights the importance of providing appropriate equipment to the forces that the EU trains. It is important to work together across the nexus security or development to achieve peaceful societies protected by armed forces under civilian control.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 259, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Jean Arthuis", "mepid": "124773", "text": "draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, not being able to establish a Europe of defense, the six founding countries opted for the common market. Sixty years after the signing of the Treaty of Rome, the time has come to put the defense project back on the table. In a world that has become dangerous, we expect Europe to protect us, in particular through military capacity. Our colleagues Gahler and Gonzáles Pons have brilliantly demonstrated that the advent of a common defense depends on the political will of our heads of state or government, and not on legal considerations. Now, what do we see? States which, for the most part, have neither the critical size nor the military tool adapted to the threats of the 21st century, but which are reluctant to choose efficiency and pooling, which are reluctant to make the choice from Europe. As proof of this, the preparatory action on defense research, for which we have budgeted for 2017 25 million, nibbled at the expense of other programs and pilot projects, 25 million where the Americans spend more than 60 billion.

Unfortunately, it takes Mr. Trump's statements for Europeans to wake up when all the parameters of the strategic equation already existed before Trump's election to warn us that if we don't do this job, for our own safety, no one will do it for us. So it really is time to wake up. However, I regret that the Member States are still dragging their feet. Obviously, the progress of the last few years has been so weak that we are now happy to see any progress even if it is very modest. So indeed - as you have pointed out - a military planning and conduct capacity will emerge: thirty officers to supervise non-executive missions, that is to say modest training missions in Mali, in the CAR. and Somalia. They are useful, but they are not decisive. I have just returned from Mali and it is not our training mission - unfortunately, however professional it is - that will make the difference in the instability that this country is experiencing. On the other hand, what I do know is that it is the French troops - once again - who are on the front line and that European solidarity is expressed very timidly, and that the European countries which send contingents in Mali assign them mostly non-combatant functions, with the fewest possible problems. This is not European solidarity and this is not how we will move forward. So the qualitative leap, especially operational, that we have to make, does not exist. Industrially, I hear about the costs of non-Europe, but the cost of non-Europe to our own defense industry is when the equipment exists in Europe and some countries continue to buy off the shelf from the United States.It is also a blow from non-Europe that must one day be highlighted.Let us not forget that security is the first of European solidarities.(The speaker agrees to answer a \"blue card\" question (Rule 162 (8) of the Rules of Procedure)", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 261, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Doru-Claudian Frunzulică (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "124790", "text": "question \"blue card\".- Madam President, dear colleague, you know that I appreciate you very much.Let me ask you if you are in favor of the idea of establishing an independent European anti-terrorism agency, with its own intelligence service, to better protect our citizens.After all that has happened in Europe, don't you think it is time to strengthen our security and defense and to cooperate more on security and defense?", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 262, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Arnaud Danjean (PPE)", "mepid": "96747", "text": "answer \"blue card\".- It is not precisely a subject covered by the report, but if you ask me my opinion, I do not believe in a European intelligence superagency.This is not what we need.What we need is to strengthen information exchange platforms.A full-fledged agency would be a new bureaucratic monster, with no guarantee of operational efficiency.What we need is that our national agencies, which are good, efficient and professional, cooperate more with each other, exchange more with each other, but certainly not a new European superstructure with very limited usefulness in terms ofoperational.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 263, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Enrique Guerrero Salom", "mepid": "96768", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - Madam President, I would like, first of all, to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mr Gahler and Mr González Pons, for the report and for the openness they have had with the shadow rapporteurs, among whom I am. Security and defense policy has been, from the beginning, a weak link in the European Union. There was an initial period where there was neither ambition nor means. Then there was an intermediate period when there were means, but there was no ambition. And today we need both, ambition and means. It has been necessary for the devastating effects of foreign wars to reach our borders, in our neighborhood, for us to be aware of the close link between internal security and external security. It has been necessary for terrorist attacks to take place in Madrid, in Berlin, in Paris, in London and in many other cities of the European Union, in Brussels, so that we are aware that we need to share intelligence, share operational means and share, too, judicial cooperation. It has been necessary for Russia to rekindle its hegemonic ambition and for the United States to reinforce the part of its isolationist soul so that we are aware that the European Union has to be a global actor, and it can only be if it has a security and defense policy common. Therefore, more European ambition? Definitely. More European agency or European Defense Agency? Definitely. More commitment to NATO? Yes, but already in a European dimension; united, as pointed out by Mr. González Pons. More budget? Yes, but not at the cost of other budget lines that are necessary for the daily well-being of European citizens. More democratic control of Parliament? Definitely.

The European Union has a right to think about its own defense efforts, as long as it bases them on good, healthy principles. First of all - on real solidarity.

Secondly - responsibility, i.e. respecting the 2% GDP criterion for defense spending by states. Only a few European countries use this, and I am very surprised that some are in favor of a common defense policy and, at the same time, against increasing spending.

Joint military projects are supposed to form the cement of the crumbling EU, and there are loud and vehement calls for military independence. A special focus of the report is the activation of constant structured cooperation. Certain aspects of EU military policy could be withdrawn from the consensus principle here. The demand that both the permanent structured cooperation and the EU defense agency should be treated as an institution sui generis, which means that they are largely removed from parliamentary control, is particularly explosive. It is true that the report also contains statements about the greater involvement of Parliament and the strengthening of its rights, but that remains vague. One looks in vain for demands for a parliamentary reservation, for example. Even now, the military EU is hardly controlled by parliament. Mr Borg said control was up to the Member States.

It would be an agency without transparency, parliamentary oversight, let alone control. We are in full support of centralisation; it makes sense in this field, but not in this way, without any accountability whatsoever. Secondly, we believe that, before committing large amounts of fresh money to defence and security, we should explore the full potential of efficiency gains through cooperation, and only after this should we consider additional funding that might be available through the European Union budget or from Member States.

In fact, even as someone who has campaigned vigorously for Britain to leave the European Union, I have still acknowledged that, for a time after the Second World War, having France and Germany engaged in a joint political project was indeed a useful support to NATO in maintaining peace. But I would hope everyone in this Chamber would equally acknowledge that, in cold hard terms of armies and military hardware and nuclear deterrence, it was indeed NATO that shielded Western Europe from the threat of external attack. So what a shame that now, in the second decade of the 21st century, NATO seems to be out of fashion with European politicians. Most governments do not honour their commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence, and the US has grown tired of bearing a disproportionate burden. So I am afraid the opportunists of Brussels are seeking to acquire another element of nationhood: an EU army to add to the flag, the Parliament, the anthem and the currency.  This idea of a common defence identity is pure folly. You do not have sufficient social solidarity, nor commonality of interest, to support the financial bailouts necessitated by the euro, let alone the shedding of blood in military combat under an EU cap badge.

No one in the European Parliament, having underground political aspirations, has the political and moral legitimacy to change the Treaty as they see fit. The Treaty may be revised, as provided for in the constitutional order of the Member States, solely by ratification by national parliaments or by referendum. However, if it is put to the citizens' judgment, the decision for more Europe and less homeland and nation will be voted against, as the European Constitution was voted against in similar referendums. It would be wrong to equate or attempt to further unite national needs and challenges. There is no room for further compromise on national priorities. No Member State will place its army as a consumable pawn on the world geopolitical chessboard. A common security and defense policy does not exist and will not exist as long as Turkey disputes sovereign rights and threatens Greece with casus belli, illegally occupies 1/3 of the territory of Cyprus and does not recognize the Republic of Cyprus. The proposed nominal, constitutional, legal and institutional implications will not bend those who provocatively raise redemptive claims. Example: the country of Skopje, which steals the history of Greece and talks about Macedonian identity, nation and language.

The developments of the last few years tell us why we need to change: the ongoing crisis in the Middle East, terrorism, the rule of Russia, and more recently the demand by Washington that Europe must play a significantly more active role in its own defence are the key factors in this respect.  Yet the possible defence structures of the European Union are already in place, notably in Article 42 of the Treaty. This article is fairly clear in mentioning operational capacity at the European level, common defence, and an undertaking by Member States progressively to improve their military capabilities. It could not be clearer. So the scope for change is considerable. To the above, one can usefully add: improvement in security and counterterrorism cooperation – a sensitive area of course. Major cost benefits can be expected from joint military procurement. Having a shared defence objective can also mean much greater investment in military technology, bringing spill-over with it and the transfer of innovation into the civilian sector.  It is clear enough that the private sector is generally risk-averse where blue sky research is concerned, but the state can transform this, precisely because the state can focus on the long term rather than on short-run profitability.

And it has something to do with more responsibility - also in our neighborhood. Whether we want it or not, we have to be prepared for it. However, four things also need to be clear. First: Territorial defense is a matter for NATO and not a mini-NATO called the EU. Second: New tasks cost money. We need to talk to the Member States about how these new tasks are going to cost them, and how they are going to be covered. Thirdly, we are in favor of parliamentary scrutiny for purely military missions; this has to be discussed in the course of the proceedings.

One set of EU forces? Or national forces under national control? You seem to think it’s both. I mean it’s all smoke and mirrors. God help us if we have to rely on the European Union for our defence. Where’s all this money going to come from, I wonder? I have to say one of the many objections we had to the Treaty of Lisbon was the licence it gave to those pursuing this sort of mirage of an autonomous EU defence policy.  The report we are discussing confirms our misgivings. The Euro-federalists seem to inhabit a curious bleak and empty space where no one else is doing anything to address the security challenges that we all face, and where their answer to every problem is more EU. Of course the reality is quite different. As has been pointed out, the defence of our democracies against the threat of aggression is carried out by NATO. Twenty-two of the 28 EU Member States are NATO members, four of the remainder work closely with NATO, and just a month ago Finland, for instance, agreed a cyber defence cooperation arrangement with NATO.  NATO harnesses the overwhelming military power of the United States to that of the European nations for their mutual defence, and we have the vital Article 5 guarantee. So I just wonder what on earth the EU is up to with its ambitions for an autonomous defence capability.

It's quite paradoxical, but in reviving the spirit that prevailed in 1954, when the EDC - the European Defense Community - was on the verge of success, our citizens are, of course, more than a half a century on ambitions, but ahead of politics, which remains too passive in this area. The current context, in addition to the various types of shortcomings in European defense, further complicates the debate. Military defense is an ultimate means that can be engaged when all other means have failed. Let us remember, in the midst of the Cold War, the former German foreign minister Genscher made a bet on the future: Frieden schaffen mit weniger Waffen (ensuring peace with less armament). Genscher won his bet thanks to a vast diplomatic offensive and also thanks to the agreement of the United States. Today, since Trump's election, transatlantic relations are in such a state that even a very substantial increase in European defense spending would still leave the question of European security open, unless Trump put an end to his ambivalent speech. One of the priorities at the moment is therefore to provide some clarification in this area and to test the solidity of relations within NATO. This in no way undermines the value of the report by our colleague Gahler, whose proposals are useful for the future, but only a coherent approach would be able to produce satisfactory results in terms of safety. In this context, very effective diplomacy should also be promoted. A face for European politics could be a French personality. Why a French personality? Because France is everywhere where others don't want to go, it is the first and it is rarely followed by others, who only have \"via cases\" to offer it.Thirdly, respect for our European institutions and our treaties: an external policy and not 28 parallel policies, which make us lose all benchmarks in the matter, this to remind us that the credibility of our security and defense policy requiresmastery of all policy aggregates relating to security and defense.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 275, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Κώστας Χρυσόγονος (GUE/NGL).", "mepid": "125061", "text": "- Mr President, the report on the common European security and defense policy we are discussing today contains some positive elements on a verbal level.

However, this should not be a general wish list, but should be specialized at the present time, since there are such Member States today and specifically Greece and Cyprus. The Turkish Air Force almost daily violates Greek airspace and overflights over Greek islands, forcing the Greek Air Force to spend large sums on fuel and spare parts for interceptor flights. In fact, this is happening while the Greek budget is being dramatically burdened with the service of a huge public debt and the Greek people are suffering the heavy consequences of austerity policies. In fact, the fiscal situation in Greece has reached the levels of the last seven years and the three memoranda to a large extent due to the huge equipment to deal with the aggression of Turkey, a country with seven times the population and four times the economic size.

And there is a qualitative social leap from the condition of consumer to the condition of citizen. Mr. Gahler, in his presentation you told us that citizens demand from us not only higher levels of well-being and progress, but higher levels of security. There are colleagues in this House who think that the European Union is in a kind of post-historical paradise, where wars, the military and conflicts are someone else's business. At this moment we have serious threats that weigh on the European Union and, today, we have armies that have no apparent enemies and we have enemies that do not have an army. The European Union must make it through to adulthood once and for all. And although the transatlantic code is somehow inscribed in the genes of the European Union, we have to start developing our defense capabilities. That is why we must congratulate ourselves on the progress that has been made and that has been promoted by the High Representative since the December European Council and congratulate the rapporteurs. And I am convinced that there will be no future for the European Union if, together with our economic, commercial, financial or industrial capacities, we do not develop - as the co-rapporteur, Mr. González Pons, told us - a mobilization of the political will to equip ourselves with capacities in the field of security and defense that allow us to face the new configuration of threats.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 279, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Jo Leinen (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "4262", "text": "- Mister President! At the beginning of European unification, over 70 years ago, there was already the idea of ​​a community for security and defense. After more than 70 years, this idea is back on our agenda, and many colleagues have also said why: because the geopolitical situation has changed dramatically. There are uncertainties ranging from Vladimir Putin's policy in Moscow to - very likely - Donald's policy in Washington, not to mention the crisis belt around the EU. The EU is a soft power, and it will stay that way because the Lisbon Treaty states that all EU missions to maintain peace are carried out with the approval of the international community. The militarization of the EU or the EU as world police cannot happen with the existing treaty. We all know that our capabilities are very limited and that a lot of money is wasted because of duplication and mismanagement. It cannot be forbidden to create a single market for armaments, as it is in the treaty. It cannot be forbidden to establish a common headquarters for the missions and the better equipment of these missions. Of course, finances are also necessary. And I think that the EU budget must go hand in hand with the reform of the EU's own revenues. I think diplomacy has priority, but we also need military capabilities under the control of parliaments.

We need to work together with NATO, complement it where possible, and not see NATO as a reason for not having a stronger European defence policy. The Member States that are ready to undertake more binding commitments would set up a permanent structured cooperation so that it would be possible to establish multinational forces.

I consider the part of the report where money is clearly mentioned to be particularly important. Vain glory, it is difficult for Europe to increase its defense in the future if it does not raise money from individual national budgets and, if necessary, does not debate whether money from the European budget should not be used for defense. So, several times, the 2% of the GDP budgets of the individual Member States here are, in my opinion, the basis. We should do everything we can to ensure that the individual EU countries really increase their defense money significantly. Only four EU countries account for 2% of GDP, an absolute minority. Without money, it is difficult to raise your defenses in the future. The report states a very interesting figure that, if defense spending could really be raised in the future, we could raise up to EUR 100 billion, an admirable amount that, if invested in the European defense industry, if invested in joint research, I think that this would have a significant multiplier effect not only on greater defense, but also on creating new jobs, strengthening European businesses and, of course, military research always has positive results for the civilian population and has other positive benefits. I agree with the thesis that has been expressed here, cooperation with NATO is necessary.

Second, a key target is a European Defence Union, based on permanent structured cooperation and ending hopefully in establishing European integrated forces.

Third, the other key to enhanced security is information-sharing – that is compulsory information-sharing between national intelligence bodies, with adequate cooperation structures.

With the appearance of new threats and new geostrategic and geopolitical challenges - especially on our European soil - it has become obvious that Europe, in order to protect its own citizens and to have influence on the global diplomatic level, must organize itself in defense.

There is the establishment of a military capacity for planning and conduct of operations which has been refused for too long by one of the member countries of Europe, there is also the improvement of cooperation with the 'NATO or improving research and development.

As the report clearly points out, the Treaties already contain the necessary elements to gradually equip us with that autonomous defense and security capacity that we desire; Take, for example, permanent structured cooperation. Now, what is involved is the political will to take advantage of and develop these articles of the Treaty. In this sense, I welcome the steps taken by the European Council, without going any further last week, and by the Foreign Affairs Council, and also the measures that the Commission is taking. We are, as we all know, in a delicate moment for the European Union and, at the same time, I believe that our citizens are asking us for more Europe in terms of security and defense.

I would like to briefly reflect on a few points that have been raised by colleagues. First of all, thank you very much for the broad support that I believe this report deserves. We will organize a good majority for it. Secondly, I agree with all of my colleagues who have said that we need all aspects of foreign policy in this context, that is, from soft skills to strong diplomacy, and that includes development cooperation. I always try to sum it up: we must be able to use everything credibly in our external dealings with the Union, from verbal notes to battle tanks, and of course we must try to achieve this with the most peaceful means possible. I also believe that we have to seek solidarity with the United Nations, although I do not see ourselves as being completely dependent. If I now think of the Western Balkans, for example, or Bosnia and Herzegovina in particular: When it comes to defending Dayton, I could also imagine that Russia might veto it if we prevent Banja Luka from going there a referendum is taking place. Therefore we should reserve ourselves in our immediate surroundings to do what is necessary. I find it interesting when there is a broad range of opinions in some groups. In the ECR you can see that there are some who will stay in the EU and others who will leave the EU, and accordingly the opinion is somewhat different. However, I did not understand that if you are not in NATO yourself, that you are betting on NATO and not wanting the EU to become active in the field of defense. Turkey is actually also an argument for moving out of dependence on NATO - if necessary. Because if we have to fall back on NATO resources, a Turkish veto can block everything.

If we are divided, we are weak in all areas. If we stand up for ourselves together, we are strong and they will respect us more. The problem of each European, regardless of the nation they belong to, has to be the problem of all Europeans and that can only be achieved with a common defense that, indeed - as Mr. Jáuregui said - does not have and should not cost more . On the contrary, if instead of twenty-seven budgets we have a single budget, it is evident that we will save money. Because we will buy together, because we will investigate together, because we will create units together. I think it is obvious that we have to create the European internal defense market, which will serve small and medium-sized enterprises and which will serve European research.

The climate change effects and growing competition for access to the Arctic natural resources and increasing economic activities have brought opportunities but also risks to the region. This also includes challenges to security. The Arctic has long been an area of constructive international cooperation and it has remained a low-tension cooperative regional order in the world. We want to keep it that way. We need to keep the Arctic a low-tension area. There is a need to avoid the militarisation of the Arctic. The EU has a long-standing engagement in the Arctic. Three EU Member States are full members of the Arctic Council and seven others are observers. Considering that the EU is the world’s leading funder in the Arctic, it should finally be able to become an observer as well. All of the EU Arctic Member States, as well as some other states, have their own national Arctic strategies, which include a security dimension, but the EU does not have such a strategy. Our report foresees the need for a more coherent EU internal and external policy, an Arctic strategy and a concrete action plan on the EU’s engagement in the Arctic taking into account all the aspects. That includes the foreign and security dimension. The geopolitical developments in the Arctic region affect the security situation in northern Europe and globally. Cooperation in the Arctic has been good between countries, but we cannot bury our heads in the sand. We need to acknowledge the increased activities of Russia in the Arctic, the opening of military bases and their increased military presence in the Russian Arctic. The report acknowledges the fact that Russia is more and more active in the Arctic region and that cooperation with Russia in this area must be continued with the aim of keeping the Arctic a low-tension area. The European Union should contribute in building civilian security mechanisms as well as in enhancing crisis and disaster management capacities, search and rescue infrastructure and support the development of infrastructure in the European Arctic, including infotechnology, and communications. There are three paragraphs in this report that were introduced during the Committee on Foreign Affairs/Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety joint committee votes that have caused concern in the Arctic Member States. These paragraphs talk about the ban on the oil and gas extraction in the Arctic that has an important energy security dimension for the European Union. First and foremost, oil and gas extraction in the Arctic is a sovereign decision of the Arctic states, as manifested in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Article 77. The EU should not call for a ban on something that is a sovereign right of a state under international law. Secondly, it is important for the energy security of the EU. Gas accounts for about 25% of Europe’s primary energy demand. Norwegian gas covers more than 20% of the European consumption. More than half of the remaining resources are expected to be located north of the Arctic Circle. If we propose to ban the oil and gas extraction for the EU and EEA Arctic states, as proposed by these paragraphs, then we are deliberately putting ourselves in a more vulnerable position. What we do want is to have oil and gas extraction in the Arctic that these in line with safety regulations in the strongest terms, which is also already the case as regards EU and EEA Arctic countries. I would also like to thank my co-rapporteur, all the shadow rapporteurs and all of my colleagues for good cooperation in preparation of this report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 316, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Sirpa Pietikäinen", "mepid": "40599", "text": "demonstrator. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Urmas Paet, for his very good cooperation, as well as all my colleagues in the ENVI and AFET committees. I believe that our common message is clear, as we have already heard here: it is high time for the European Union to steel its Arctic policy. Firstly, the European Union is an Arctic player, as three of its Member States are located in the Arctic. Secondly, as with security policy, changes and challenges in the Arctic will be our challenges throughout the EU, and we have a special obligation and responsibility to take into account the specificities of the Arctic in terms of our own climate policy and our own use of natural resources. We all know that climate change in the Arctic is progressing about two degrees faster than in other regions. We know, for example, that the melting of ice over the last decade has exceeded all forecasts, and the same seems to continue. We know that the Arctic is a particularly vulnerable region where the effects, measured in terms of both time span and multiplier effects, are manifold: much longer, often more irreversible, such as deforestation or fish stock pollution, and reflected in a variety of ecosystems and livelihood opportunities. If we ruin the sustainable use of the resources of this vulnerable region, we will not only destroy the unique Arctic, but we will, for our part, accelerate climate change, destroy and threaten access to clean water, and the effects on global fish stocks will be permanent and dramatic. This eleventh moment is highlighted for the European Union because, sadly, paradoxically, it is precisely because of climate change that the race for natural resources in the northern and arctic regions is accelerating. The clear message in this report is therefore that the EU must have a strong responsibility and a strong role in the Arctic Council as an actor, to make peaceful co-operation based on the principles of research co-operation and peaceful co-operation a guiding principle, and to implement an Arctic environmental impact assessment that takes into account both multiple time spans, permanent damage and multiple multiplier effects in the case of major resource use projects such as energy industry. It is also absolutely essential to take into account the rights of indigenous peoples. The only indigenous peoples in Europe are in the Arctic, and so the report also calls for their own representation and financial support for representation in EU politics. It also emphasizes support for sustainable investment, especially those based on clean technology, better use of information technology and sustainable investment. Last but not least, we need more and more information.

Our joint communication sets out an integrated policy framework for dealing with the challenges and the opportunities in the Arctic and for enhancing the EU’s already substantial presence in in the region. Such a framework is needed because developments in the EU and the Arctic are interlinked in many ways, as we have just heard. The impact of the EU on the Arctic, and indeed of the Arctic on the EU, is becoming increasingly clear and pressing. Our communication focuses on three priorities. First, we must address the challenges facing the Arctic by responding to climate change and protecting the Arctic environment. The Arctic is warming, as we have heard, twice as fast as the rest of the world, but that affects not just the region itself, but also the rest of the world. The Arctic is home to 4 million people. Our second priority must therefore be to support its sustainable development, so that it is a place where people can continue to live, study and work. Our joint communication highlights that safeguarding the Arctic’s fragile environment and the sustainable development of the region can and must go hand in hand. It is not sustainable to only consider the economic development without due regard to the rich biodiversity and the consequences of climate change in the region, and it is not possible to aim to protect the fragile environment without considering the needs of the local communities and the potential for developing a vibrant economy in a sustainable way. This balancing effort is at the centre of everyone’s attention on Arctic matters, including national and local authorities of the Arctic States and also in multilateral fora. So it is no surprise that the draft resolution before you today shows that it has also been discussed extensively in this House. Our third priority is to strengthen cooperation with our Arctic partners, to address the challenges and opportunities we are discussing. Challenges like climate change are on a scale too big for any one state tackle alone, so international cooperation is, obviously, key. Across all these areas we have sought to emphasise the crucial role of science, research and innovation, and we have stressed the role of those who inhabit the Arctic, including indigenous peoples, in this process. We have included the Arctic within our recent initiative for better international ocean governance. The challenges that our oceans face today do not recognise national boundaries, therefore stronger efforts are needed globally to address governance issues in this context.

The right to fish, in fact the right to equal access to natural resources of the archipelago of Spitsbergen, is guaranteed by a non-discrimination clause of the Spitsbergen Treaty which was signed by all major European countries.

Just a couple of comments on that if I may. The EU-Arctic stakeholder forum has now been set up and has met on a number of occasions. We are also continuing to engage with Arctic indigenous people and local communities. The next Arctic stakeholder forum session and annual dialogue meeting will be organised in the context of the EU high-level event on Arctic policy, which is being organised together with Vice-President Mogherini in Finland in mid-June.  In terms of international ocean governance, and in particular the ongoing work on an international agreement to prevent unregulated fisheries in the central Arctic Ocean, the Commission hopes a deal on such an agreement might be reached in Reykjavik as early as next week.  Another point I would like to draw attention to is the International Polar Code which entered into force in January. It creates mandatory provisions covering safety and pollution prevention measures that apply to ships navigating through polar waters, and also includes guidance on implementation, design, construction, environmental protection, equipment, training and operational matters.  We are making progress on environmental policies that will contribute to the protection of the Arctic environment. We have just allocated funding to a project to address the problem of black carbon in the Arctic. On oil and gas, there is not, of course, any oil and gas exploration in the EU Arctic.

While overall we have reached, I guess, a good agreement on this report, there is still, as we all realise, one open question on oil and gas extraction that we need to vote on tomorrow. I would just like to mention that the EU has outlined energy security as one of the cornerstones of the Energy Union strategy and as a key political priority, and this means less dependency on non-European countries and sources and also diversifying our own energy sources here in Europe. Also in 2014, the European Parliament itself underlined that the EU will be a main consumer of Arctic natural gas.  The second remark I want to make is that it should be very clear that the EU has to stick very strongly to international law whatever the developments in the Arctic area. Finally, I would like to conclude my statement by saying that we have worked long and hard with the co-rapporteur Sirpa Pietikäinen on this paper to take into account both the concrete environmental and security aspects. However, hopefully the report will give an impetus for a real EU-Arctic strategy that takes into account the realities on the ground, with a sustainable, environmental and conflict-free future in mind.

Thank you to the Commission for taking some affirmative actions on this side. We are quite eager, as we should be, to tell third countries how to deal with their minorities and indigenous peoples, and indeed, this is something we should take better into account in our own activities. Then of course there is the question of Russia and other Arctic areas and the run for natural resources threatening their livelihoods and their right to land very seriously. My second point would be the role of the EU in the Arctic. Tuna fish is not only a property and issue concerning Italy and Greece, and this is the point of our common fisheries policy and debate in general. So the Arctic itself is not the property of any country willing to claim so; it is a common heritage, like the fish, and this is, of course, underlined with the abundance of international agreements and conventions such as anglers or the role of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), and so on. This is exactly why we need the EU to be stronger in the Arctic policy, in the Arctic Council and international negotiations. I welcome the Commission’s announcement being very strong here. The EU is not the third party in the area; it is an Arctic actor, and this is something, I think, that the Commission, the Council and the EU as a whole should very clearly have in mind.

With regard to fishing in particular, the EU will have to defend in international bodies the precautionary approach and sustainable development that 'it applies to its waters.

In this area, EU investment and structural funds play a vital role in the development of the European Arctic, promoting sustainable economic growth and the creation of quality jobs in future-oriented sectors.

Having now opened 26 of the 33 chapters, with two of these provisionally closed already, the country’s strong progress as an EU candidate is clear to all. In the key areas of chapters 23 and 24 concerning justice and home affairs, genuine reform by the government of Montenegro in these areas is evident. Of course tackling organised crime and corruption remains a priority, but it is important we recognise that at the political level reforms have been implemented, and so it is now the time to give the support that is needed for these changes to take root.  Last year was an important one for Montenegro. Parliamentary elections took place in October. There has been a change of prime minister – I was delighted to meet the new prime minister Marković earlier this year in Brussels – and the accession protocol to join NATO was signed. The elections were held under a new regulatory framework with individual voter registration and an electronic identification system in place. A government of electoral trust was formed in the few months preceding the election, which saw opposition parties in charge of over a dozen state organisations and several ministries, to ensure a level playing field before the election.  This followed concerns from some members of the opposition parties about the possibility of undue influence from the governing parties who could abuse or use administrative resources of the state. I believe that the solution was a pragmatic one, a fair one, and welcomed by all, and I was particularly pleased to see this resolved internally within Montenegro. International observers of the elections reported them to be free and fair, with fundamental freedoms generally respected by all. I am aware that there were some concerns about the closure of certain social media platforms on the day of the election, but this must be seen in the wider context of the allegations of a coup and assassination attempt against the then prime minister Đukanović and a backdrop of attempts to influence events by external parties. Indeed the closures in question were implemented by the Agency for Electronic Communication and lasted for a mere hour and a half.  With regard to the planned coup and assassination, judicial investigations continue, but there is a growing consensus amongst both the Montenegrin authorities and EU governments that the planned attack on the then prime minister was a real and credible threat. I remain deeply concerned about the situation and I believe that it is illustrative of the growing presence that Russia is seeking on the ground to exert on Montenegro, and other countries for that matter in the Western Balkans region. Intelligence linking Eduard Shishmakov, a Russian national and a known GRU agent, to the plot, supports claims of Russian participation. It is clear that there is an attempt now to prevent Montenegrin accession to NATO in May, and also to disrupt its EU trajectory. It is for this reason that it is more important than ever for all the political parties to engage fully and properly in the parliamentary democratic process. The continued boycott of the parliament by the opposition is therefore very disappointing to friends of Montenegro, and extremely damaging to the long-term credibility of Montenegro’s democratic processes and institutions. I am increasingly concerned by the motives of some regarding the parliamentary boycott, and I now call from this House on all of those taking part in the boycott to consider the effects of their actions and the forces that they are helping to legitimise by their continued participation in not going to parliament.  As Montenegro now seeks to join NATO later this year, I think it is key that we in this House demonstrate our support for that decision. NATO and the EU are of course two very separate institutions, but from the perspective of Montenegro the two together represent a Euro-Atlanticist pivot. For reasons discussed earlier in my speech it is an important time now to support that agenda and I hope that when we all vote tomorrow we will all feel minded to support the text as it is currently present in the resolution.  I have always described Montenegro, for the last seven years as the standing rapporteur, as a good news story of the Western Balkans, and I believe that this is still the case today. At the moment, however, we are hearing less and less good news stories from other countries in the region. I therefore welcome the recent visit of the High Representative Federica Mogherini to the region and wholeheartedly support her message that the door remains open to all countries of the Western Balkans towards EU membership. It is vital that we ensure this message gets across. Montenegro has shown how this can work, and I hope this will continue to be so for itself and all its neighbours.

You have been here all day since 9.00 in the morning, not least to discuss the 2016 report on Montenegro. As you know, the Western Balkans featured on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council and the European Council last week, and on both occasions Member States reconfirmed the European Union’s engagement with the region, including through deepening political and the economic ties. Last week the European Council conclusions clearly reaffirmed the unequivocal support for the European perspective of the Western Balkans. In this spirit, the Presidency is committed to advancing the enlargement process in full respect of the basic principles of conditionality and on merit.  Montenegro remains the frontrunner in the accession process and it made further progress last year. We welcome, in particular, the latest accession conference of 13 December, where it was possible to open two further negotiating chapters: Chapter 11 on Agriculture and Rural Development and Chapter 19 on Social Policy and Employment. With a view to advancing negotiations, the Council continues to pay close attention to Montenegro’s progress in the rule of law, which, as per the negotiating framework, determines the overall pace of Montenegro’s negotiation process. As the report rightly points out, the legal framework and institutional set-up in this area are largely complete. Progress has been registered, but further implementation remains key, building on the results achieved so far and also leading to a strengthened and sustainable track record, in particular in the fight against corruption and organised crime.  The need for a continued focus on fundamental reforms is also something clearly expressed in your draft resolution and in the Commission’s report. They spell out important challenges for Montenegro to ensure freedom of expression and media freedom, to pursue public administration reform, and to strengthen the independence of institutions. On the economic side, Montenegro needs to take measures to ensure fiscal sustainability, to control public, and to improve the trade balance and the business environment. Advances on the rule of law can make a significant contribution in this regard.  Whilst progress has been made, there are still a number of reforms which Montenegro needs to carry out. 2017 will be an important year for Montenegro’s Euro-Atlantic integration, and we encourage the country to build on the progress already made and to take the reform process forward.  The process should not be considered merely as being an accession requirement, but a means leading to a more stable, prosperous and fair country. In this respect, one cannot over emphasise the importance of taking ownership of these reforms, which first and foremost are in the interest of, and to, the Montenegrin people.  We are well aware that Montenegro is currently facing a difficult political situation. It remains important for the government to maintain political commitment to the reform process and for all political parties to re-engage in a constructive dialogue, notably within the Parliament. The Council also closely followed Montenegro’s parliamentary elections in October and took good note of the overall positive assessment by the OSCE. Alleged irregularities in the elections need to be investigated, along with follow-up to the recommendations by international election observers. The clear messages in your draft resolution are well appreciated. I would also like to highlight two points regarding Montenegro’s external relations. In the area of foreign policy, the country remains a reliable partner to the European Union. Let me use this opportunity to strongly commend Montenegro for its consistent cooperation in this regard and in particular for its full alignment with the EU common foreign and security policy. Montenegro also continues to play a positive role in further developing regional cooperation and in advancing good neighbourly relations. In light of the overall situation in the Western Balkans, we should continue to highlight this point, as it actively contributes to the stabilisation of the very same region. In summary, Montenegro continues to make steady progress in the EU accession negotiations and maintains its good cooperation with the EU and its neighbours in the region. Looking ahead, we hope to move the accession negotiations forward under our presidency by opening and provisionally closing those negotiating chapters which are technically ready with Montenegro.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 357, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Julian King", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, I would like to start, in particular on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Hahn, by extending thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Tannock, for this very well-balanced report. Indeed, may I extend my thanks to all here who contributed to this important work. As we have been hearing, Montenegro has made steady progress on its EU path. Rule of Law is the fundamental element that will continue to determine the pace of the accession negotiations. The revised legal and institutional framework is largely in place and now needs to deliver further results. Montenegro is strongly committed to regional cooperation, as ministers noted, and has good relations with its neighbouring countries. In the Western Balkan context that is no minor achievement. Let me also reiterate our praise for Montenegro’s complete alignment with the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy, as Mr Borg said. Montenegro is a country with a clear EU perspective and, undoubtedly, the front-runner in the EU integration process with, as we have heard, 26 chapters open for negotiation, two of which are provisionally closed. Opinion polls show overwhelming support for EU membership, so in many ways Montenegro is, indeed, the good news story in the region, if the rapporteur will forgive me for pinching his expression. There are, of course, certain challenges, and it is fitting to discuss these with you here this evening in a parliamentary setting. Unfortunately, in Montenegro, parliament is half empty, as the opposition is boycotting the work of this key institution. We share the concerns already expressed over this, and the Commission’s repeated message to all the political parties has been to work out a compromise and to return the political debate to parliament, where it belongs. A boycott is not a sustainable solution, even less for a negotiating country. As Montenegro stands at the doorstep of NATO, the external pressure on it is mounting, but we trust that the Montenegrin leaders in government and in opposition will be wise enough to put their differences aside and to work together to preserve the progress made in Euro-Atlantic integration over the years – in fact, since their independence. The October 2016 parliamentary elections were held under a substantially revised legal framework, and our assessment is based on the OSCE/ODIHR report. We now expect all political groups to return to constructive engagement and to work together to implement the ODIHR recommendations on further election reforms. Inclusive dialogue is crucial for elections and EU-related reforms, as well as the overall modernisation of the country. Furthermore, we expect the relevant domestic authorities swiftly and transparently to conclude the investigation of the election day events, in accordance with domestic laws and international standards. We all, I am sure, look forward to the easing of political tensions and the continuation of the EU integration process, most notably the creation of a sustainable track record in the fight against corruption and organised crime. Fiscal imbalances should also be addressed in a determined way by implementing the approved budget and adopting a fiscal consolidation plan. Last week’s European Council unequivocally reaffirmed the European perspective of the Western Balkans, so this is a good moment to build momentum. A balanced economic environment and strong sense of rule of law will bring the necessary business opportunities and investment to Montenegro. The EU is assisting with technical advice and financial investment, so that the journey towards EU membership can already bring benefits to Montenegrin citizens, ranging from students to entrepreneurs, from farmers to consumers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 358, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Андрей Ковачев", "mepid": "97968", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - With the European Union turning to its own internal problems and the recent changes in Washington, a political vacuum has arisen in the Western Balkans, which has allowed Russia to increase its influence in the region. This influence has strengthened Russia's geopolitical presence and called into question the Euro-Atlantic orientation of the countries in the region. On the other hand, corruption, dependent media and an inefficient judiciary in a number of countries in the region allow certain leaders to escalate tensions through nationalist talk and inter-ethnic opposition, posing as saviors of the nation, while this rhetoric is a cover for economic crimes. and illegal activities. In the Balkan vacuum, such nationalist sparks as the Bosnian referendum, the attempted coup in Montenegro, nationalist speeches in Serbia against EU member states such as Bulgaria, and the situation in Macedonia are not harmless. On the one hand, we must send a strong signal that the countries of the region have their own European perspective, with a specific time frame. On the other hand, we must encourage them to limit nationalist rhetoric, anti-democratic abuses and corruption and to pursue reforms in various sectors to meet the criteria for membership. In this regard, it is no less important to continue supporting the Euro-Atlantic integration of the Western Balkans, as this is crucial for the stability and progress of the region.

The issue of election day has already been raised. I have to say that, as Greens, although we have no doubt about Russian influence – not just in Montenegro but also in other parts of the region – we would have liked to separate the language on Russian influence and on the coup attempt on election day, because this is still under investigation. We do not yet have any independent information about what really happened. We would also have liked to separate the EU and NATO, because this is about EU accession and not NATO accession.

To wonder if implicating Russia and surrounding it, via NATO, does not interest you, in reality, more than the democratic process in Montenegro.

I also hope that this example will inspire other countries in the region, candidates or potential candidates. That being said, Montenegro still has a number of important steps to take. One of the most important is overcoming the culture of boycott and fierce opposition. Negotiation and compromise are as necessary ingredients as confrontation in a democracy. The fight against corruption and excessive politicization of public administration seems to me to be a priority. It is also important to strengthen the freedom of the press, because, unfortunately, it continues to lack the necessary independence. As far as we are concerned, I hope that we will be able to respond correctly to the progress and, in particular, to the expectations of the candidate and potential candidate countries in the region.

The EU is a peace project, a project that aims to end frequent and bloody wars between neighbours, horrible experiences that the Western Balkans know only too well.

The rapporteur tells us that the context is worrying and the European Council tells us, in its conclusions this weekend, that the situation is very fragile. That is why the rapporteur reminds us of what happened around the electoral process and what happened after the elections that have been held recently. I think it is a mistake, Madam President, the analysis made by some to consider Russia, a country that extends its borders from Alaska to Poland, as a regional actor. Russia is a global power that, by the way, challenges the West on almost every board and almost always with success.

It may seem like a strange equation, but it is not. The idea behind the report tries to establish the improvements that our democracy could acquire by virtue of communication technologies, understanding that our democracy, indeed, is suffering, in recent years in particular - I would say with the economic crisis more specifically -, a disaffection; I do not know if it is a discredit, but a certain distance of the citizens from the public institutions. This worries us, and the idea is to know if, indeed, the networks, the communication technologies, could help us to improve that relationship, understanding that this gap, that distance between citizens and politics has become increasingly greater, depending on the complexity of the issues that governance raises; by virtue of the economic crisis, which has transferred to certain economic institutions, outside of democracy itself, the ability to decide on the lives of the people; and, in general, due to the phenomena of political discredit that the parties and some representatives in some countries, by virtue of corruption, for example, have been generating. This state of things worries us and the reflection that brought us in return was the idea that it was necessary to take advantage of communication technologies to give meaning, I would not say new, but more positive to that relationship between citizenship and democracy. The balance of the report, logically, starts from considering that this is possible, that technologies are there to help us, not the opposite. And, in that sense, we highlight the importance that, for example, communication technologies could have, and already have in electronic governance, in relation to what is the relationship between citizen and public administration, when it comes to - let's put - establish their fiscal relationship, when accessing public services. There is an entire electronic governance that has to serve to improve that relationship. There is an opportunity for electronic participation to help citizens participate more in the deliberation of democratic processes, in the consultations that government officials can ask citizens about the impacts of certain measures, in e-voting —the possibility of voting online - in political parties and their relationship with their affiliates, with their supporters and with their citizens. Therefore, there is a positive approach to the idea that technologies can help us enrich democracy and bring it closer to citizens. But there is also a cautious look at these effects. It is not an alternative democracy, the report says. We cannot be so naive to believe that we are going to invent a new democracy on the basis of direct democracy, since technologies, although they facilitate this possibility, do not really substitute for the system of representative democracy. It is prudent, because the report warns that there are risks. There is risk in digital access to participation platforms, which have to be fair so that everyone can access; It is the risk of privacy, of ensuring the rights of individuals so that their rights are guaranteed. All this set of situations demands from us, therefore, a report that has been approved by the majority of the entire Chamber.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 383, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Julian King", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, this is another very important subject. On behalf of Vice—President Ansip, I would like to thank Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Jáuregui Atondo, for this report on the subject of e-Democracy. It concerns issues that are fundamental to how we evolve as democratic and innovative societies, and it recognises the strategic role that new digital technologies play in shaping public policy and public services. Vice-President Ansip has asked me to make a number of comments, so I hope you will bear with me. Citizens and businesses expect better services from public authorities, greater transparency and less administrative burden. Despite many EU projects over the years to develop concepts, tools and solutions for participatory democracy, the pace of modernisation is still too slow. We need to accelerate the transformation of government and improve people’s participation in decision-making processes. If we can use digital technology to support an increased public involvement, that is good for legitimacy, accountability and ultimately trust in government.  The new e-government Action Plan will contribute to this digital transformation. It is part of our broader vision for creating a digital single market. It aims to promote open and transparent government, as well as to improve the interaction of government and individual citizens. Governments and administrations need to be open, transparent and collaborative. This means open data, open services and open processes. ICT is a great tool to engage people, to improve transparency and to increase the accountability and relevance of public administration. That is why the Commission recognises the importance of e-Democracy and e-participation. It helps us to make sure our policies respond to individual and business needs and so increases trust in our political systems. The EU citizenship report 2017 underlined the Commission’s commitment to promoting best practices to help people vote and stand in EU elections. With European elections in 2019, the aim is to support turnout and broad democratic participation.  These best practices should also address e-Democracy, remote voting arrangements like e-voting, and cross-border access to political information. They will also focus on improving the low voter turnout. In its report, Parliament highlights the importance of all of this and calls for greater EU-wide cooperation, but we also need to recognise the challenges. Political parties and elections increasingly attract the attention of cyber criminals and other cyber activists. This risk to our democratic processes is, unfortunately, real and we need to take it very seriously. For the DSM to work, our digital networks have to be protected. That is why cyber security needs to be a top political priority for us all, and it certainly is for the Commission. E-Democracy also requires equal, open and neutral access to the internet. The Commission has always been committed to the internet as a single unfragmented space. Our approach continues to be one where the internet is anchored in the defence of human rights and democratic values, where the same rights that apply offline are also protected online. We also need to ensure that everyone can benefit from new opportunities that are presented by the new technologies. Recently the Web Accessibility Directive entered into force. This means making the internet accessible for everyone, including the elderly and people with disabilities. But to make the most of internet access and for people to engage digitally, we need wide availability and take-up of high-speed broadband connectivity. That is why the Commission has proposed connectivity targets for 2025. One of these is for all European households to have access to download speeds of at least 100 Mbps. In addition, given the investment challenge ahead, especially in less densely populated areas, EU cohesion policies complement private investment and support broadband deployment to the tune of some EUR 6 billion up to 2020, with a particular focus on under-served and rural areas.  For e-Democracy to be efficient and thrive, people must also have access to information as well as the necessary skills. At the same time, people who do not have the full means or skills to participate should not be excluded, which is an essential part of building trust. In its communication last year ‘A new skills agenda for Europe’, the Commission proposed a skills guarantee to help Europeans to get more access to basic literacy, numeracy and digital skills training. We also work with Member States under the Education and Training 2020 Initiative to bring more digital skills to students and into school and university curricula.  Lastly, let us remember the importance of media pluralism and freedom of expression, values that are enshrined in the Charter. They are the backbone of our democratic societies whether people are online or offline. Media literacy is a key factor for people to make the most of the unprecedented amount of data information and views that they can now access thanks to digital technologies.

We, spokesmen in the European Parliament, are living proof of this, because we are ordinary citizens who have come into contact on the Internet who have given birth to a new and revolutionary political community. The 5 Star Movement was born anticipating the future. We practice direct and e-democracy, allowing citizens to choose their representatives online and empowering citizens to choose and amend bills. We are convinced that only through a healthy use of the Internet can we revive this European democracy which today is increasingly hostage to lobbies and multinationals. This is one of our main battles: it is our mission. You have finally understood it too and this e-democracy report proves it. Finally, even here in Europe we are starting to talk about how to bring citizens closer to the institutions and how to reduce the so-called democratic deficit. The report presents several interesting passages: for example, when the European Parliament is invited to take a strong role in the implementation of e-democracy and to develop online platforms to put citizens in direct contact with the legislator. We of the 5 Star Movement already use our platform, which is called Rousseau, and we are very happy that the European Parliament also feels the need to use a similar tool. Or, again, when the Member States of the European Union are urged to provide dignified media literacy and eradicate the digital divide. Lastly, I am pleased that my suggestion to draw up a European Charter of Internet Rights has been accepted which formally establishes Internet access and net neutrality as fundamental rights. I therefore urge my colleagues to keep this up reference.Today we are writing a beautiful page of democracy: I cannot therefore be happy about this report, which represents a first important step in the accomplished realization of e-democracy also at the European level.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 385, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Cristian Dan Preda", "mepid": "96838", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate my Socialist colleague on his report and, in particular, on his availability to work with the other political groups. I believe that indeed, we need broad agreement on this issue, because we have a large number of recommendations that are contained in the text, since online democracy concerns us all. It is indeed a question of reflecting together on how to integrate into our political life this inevitable development that constitutes information technologies, but it is not at all a question of replacing our good old representative democracy by e -democracy. That is a utopia, it is for revolutionaries and we are far from being revolutionaries, at least in my political group. The EPP group has also supported all the compromises drawn up within the AFCO committee, with the exception of the one relating to the development of a European charter of rights relating to the Internet, taking as a basis the declaration Italian from 2015. We are against that. I think we need careful thought and we have instruments to protect these rights with our current European framework for the protection of fundamental rights. Another issue I would like to mention is that of online voting. I am delighted that the references to this subject which now appear in the text are realistic and in line with what we already voted in November 2015, as part of the reform of European electoral law. In particular, I fully support the Estonian experience. I believe that we have lessons to learn from it and that we can eventually transfer this magnificent experience to other European companies.

I would also like to thank the Commissioner, who gave a very concise overview of the technological conditions. Without those, we cannot have any kind of new developments in democracy.  I am also glad that we are now speaking, not only about the digital single market, but also about digital Europe, digital society and digital democracy. Coming from Estonia, which has already been mentioned as a laboratory of e-Democracy, I have to say that our experience shows not only how far we are already capable of going, but also how technology itself does not really give us better democracy when we do not complement that with a proper education. It is not only digital skills in the narrow sense: what I really want to stress is that we need to think about what it will mean to have civic education, not only for young people and children, but also for older people so that they will not only be capable of using technological devices, but will be capable of using all the information which is available in this digital world. For example, our experience with digital voting or e—Elections shows that new quality comes only when parties provide new digital content. Instead of a kind of commercial approach to elections, there should be an information- and knowledge—based approach, so that voters not only vote digitally but also have basic information and analytical information. However, to do that they also need analytical skills. Young people are really no longer interested in traditional forms of democracy. They are interested in democracy, but in the e-Environment. They can also use totally different methods, so I suppose that we have to think much more about education, not only digital, but education in general in the digital world.

Estonia introduced online voting as early as the 2005 election, and my country is often cited as a positive example, as we have just heard now, and also in this report. Indeed, these days Estonia is the only EU country where you can choose to vote online rather than go to a traditional polling station to vote on paper. Online voting is available during the advance voting period. In the 2014 European elections, every third Estonian voter used this opportunity. It should be stressed that in Estonia there is no unanimous support for i-voting. International IT experts have presented proof to the public that our most advanced and internationally praised Estonian system is vulnerable to service side and client side attacks. We are improving this at the moment. Today, e-Democracy offers us plenty of opportunities and we cannot imagine contemporary life without IT. Regretfully, we also cannot imagine our lives without cyber—attacks and internet fraud. Democracy is a keystone of European identity and European values. The results of electoral procedures cannot be suspect, unclear or questionable. In several European countries, e-Vote and i-Vote are still not in use because of security considerations. Why? So far we do not have all the necessary data to use technical solutions to organise i-Vote in a safe and reliable manner. We first need to solve all technical and security problems, and only then will we call on Member States to implement i-Vote in practice.

I also think that e-democracy is an instrument that can strengthen citizen participation and prevent the oligarchic risks of democracy. I am less convinced by the analysis that is made of the disaffection of citizens: I do not think it is apathy, as it is written in the report, because there is a lot of passion in today's waste. In them there is a demand for change to listen to. E-democracy has proven to work: the rewriting of the Icelandic Constitution was partly done with citizens, online. At the same time, I invite you to be careful in building this tool which adds to the perilous representative democracy. E-democracy is not synonymous with e-government, I would not want it to be adopted, lowering it from above, in order to better disseminate government opinions and sell them, giving life to a democracy that is even more protective than the one we already know. I believe that this report avoids this obstacle and is very positive, because it contains important and valuable elements, not least the proposal for the drafting of a European Charter of Internet Rights on the model of the one adopted by the Italian Parliament in 2015.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 389, "date": "2017-03-15.json", "name": "Max Andersson", "mepid": "124994", "text": "for the Verts / ALE Group. - Madam President!

However, there is one weakness with this report, namely that it may be a little too positive for e-voting. It was even more positive at the draft level, but we have managed to get compromises that calm down the e-voting enthusiasts and hopefully make them realize that if you use e-voting, you must have data security so that the voting secret is kept. You must also make sure that you can trust the result of the vote. In today's system, it's terribly, terribly difficult. Therefore, we must be very careful with e-voting.

There is no question in my mind that e-democracy is already happening and will assume ever greater importance in the years to come. Various aspects of governance are already structured electronically, so this report is not only timely, but is equally highly cogent. There is an ideal typical model of e—democracy, something along the lines of each and every citizen participating in political decision-making thanks to their computer or smartphone This sounds a little bit like a futuristic version of the classical Athenian agora. Reality will be different; it usually is.  In the first place, not everyone has easy and inexpensive access to the cyber world; there are cost factors that have to be taken into account. Second, there are cognitive impediments. Some citizens will simply find it difficult to follow the protocols. Whether we like it or not, cyber literacy is not universal. Equally, the enabling software has to be designed with special care. My own recent experience illustrates this, when I was trying to complete the Hungarian interim census form and failing so that I had to deal with a human enumerator.  Finally, cyber security. The provision of this is a constant struggle, but the technological leap that quantum technology promises in ensuring complete security is not that far away.

Technological acceleration cannot undermine the fundamental values ​​of representative democracy. On the contrary, technology must be used to strengthen it. I would like to highlight three dimensions, as long as I can, that are fundamental: the qualification of citizens for the digital society, transparency and equity in access to relevant information and, finally, the possibility of disseminating the possibility of live electronic voting.

There is indeed significant contrast in broadband speeds in rural and urban areas in many Member States, and this presents a severe disadvantage to rural areas and puts at risk the social, cultural and economic life in the communities there.

It is about empowering people and developing a digital public sphere.  In the Commission, we are trying to do our bit. We are promoting the use of online participatory platforms, for example the European Citizens’ Initiative, which allows direct participation in the development of EU policies. The REFIT exercise and the e-Government Action Plan have created participatory platforms that engage European citizens directly in the decision-making process. Projects such as D-CENT demonstrate clearly that citizen-led organisations can transform democracy and help them to develop the next generation of open source, distributed, privacy-aware tools. The Commission is looking at a pilot project, funded by the European Parliament, on making the best use of modern technologies for more active and democratic voting procedures.  But, as I think we have recognised in this discussion, for all of this to work you need digital skills and digital inclusion. In fact, if Mr Schöpflin had still been here, I would have been tempted to say that cyber-literacy could be a barrier to turkeys voting for Christmas. One of the main challenges we face, therefore, is to bridge the digital divide that exists in some of our societies.
