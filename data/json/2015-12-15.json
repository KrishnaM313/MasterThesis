Another EU policy area is becoming a bit more democratic today as a means of this debate. For the first time, the President of the Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, is taking part in a debate here in plenary to discuss with the directly elected Members the way forward in economic and monetary union. This debate is a decisive step towards greater democratic accountability and more parliamentary control in economic and monetary union. This improvement in democratic legitimacy is also a central demand of the five-president report, which both President Juncker and President Dijsselbloem have co-authored with me and Mr Draghi. With today's debate, Parliament is showing that it is prepared to assume its responsibilities in this area and to comply with it. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which This debate is a first- and I said it is a first-time one, but it is also needed, because the impression that important decisions in Brussels are, above all, taken behind closed doors is a very big problem for many people in Europe. To counteract this and to create as much transparency and publicity as possible is the objective of this debate as well. However, this debate is only one step. Until now, the President of the Eurogroup has regularly addressed the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.  However, today's debate is not meant to be a one-off step, as we have already discussed it, Mr Dijsselbloem.  The European Parliament – and I also tabled this in the debate on the Five Presidents' Report – wants a full say in order to be able to make economic and monetary union truly democratic.  The European Commission – and I warmly welcome President Juncker – has for the first time presented the recommendations for the euro area, together with the annual growth report. This is also a move in the right direction. To look at the situation in the eurozone as a whole, and not always broken down into individual countries, can help to better address interrelationships and transnational developments. I am glad that the debate is taking place and I hope that this discussion between Parliament and you, Mr Dijsselbloem, will soon be repeated. I am pleased that you have come today and I would also like to express my thanks to you personally for your willingness to speak in Parliament today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1, "date": "2015-12-15.json", "name": "Jeroen Dijsselbloem", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the Eurogroup. – Mr President, thank you for inviting me to this plenary session of Parliament. It is the first time I have had the honour to be here. I find it quite intimidating. You, of course, are very much used to this arena, but to me it is still a new experience. It is a sincere pleasure for me to take part in today’s exchange of views on the euro area recommendation. I am sure President Juncker will explain the Commission’s proposal of 26 November. He is best placed for this, so I will not go into the details.  As the Eurogroup President, I support a timely discussion of the euro area recommendation which gives a more prominent role to the euro area dimension in the context of a revamped European Semester. This fits into a necessary push towards a closer coordination of Member States’ economic policies. One lesson learned from the crisis is that Member States that are sharing a single currency need to be particularly mindful of the possible spillovers, both positive and negative, of their domestic policies.  In that sense, I believe, broadly speaking, that the Commission’s draft recommendation raises the right issues. The gradual economic recovery is ongoing and is relatively broadly based across Member States. This shows that the work we have done together over the last couple of years is starting to pay off and bolster confidence. However, since we will not be able to count on several supportive factors, such as low oil prices and a very accommodative monetary policy, forever, we need to ensure that the recovery becomes self-sustained, in particular given the weaker external environment. Therefore it is essential that policy agendas remain focused on investment, structural reforms and, obviously, sustainable and growth-friendly fiscal policies. This is needed to improve competitiveness, in particular by unlocking the euro area’s productive capacity, and thereby fostering higher sustainable and inclusive growth. It is the surest way to address the still unacceptably high unemployment rates and legacy debt in many countries. It is crucial if we want a thriving euro area in a globalised world, and it is also the only way to preserve our European social model.  Although the euro area recommendation and the country-specific recommendations by and large address the right issues, effective economic policy coordination requires attention for implementation at Member State level. Going forward, it will be important to regularly monitor the progress made in implementing the recommendations and enhancing national ownership. This is why the issues I have just mentioned have figured and will continue to figure prominently in the Eurogroup’s work programme, notably in the context of our thematic discussions on growth and jobs.  These discussions are a follow-up to the euro area recommendation, working on best practices and benchmarking, for example on the tax wedge on labour, or pension reforms. And this brings me to the so-called Five Presidents’ Report on completing Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union, which the President of the European Parliament and I co-authored, together with Presidents Juncker, Tusk and Draghi.  The report pointed out that despite significant improvements in recent years, more work is needed to make the EMU more resilient and its institutional architecture more complete in order to maximise the benefits of participating in the single currency to its members. We aimed to strike the right balance between realism and vision, which is reflected in a stage-based approach. Until mid-2017 it proposes short-term measures to make the euro area more resilient, while making the best possible use of the current legal framework. These are intended to pave the way for more far-reaching measures for completing the EMU in the second stage.  Pursuing convergence is a key theme in the report. Over the last years, Member States have made significant steps, but the smooth functioning of a monetary union requires further efforts to reduce divergence in economic and fiscal performance, financial market fragmentation, as well as differences in national institutional architecture. All these aspects are interlinked, and simultaneous progress is needed. It is indisputable in my mind that participation in a monetary union comes with the sharing of sovereignty. The key question is, however, how much sovereignty should be shared under which conditions. In other words, we need to be clear on what we want to achieve, and then determine how to go about it.  The process of deepening the EMU is indeed also about risk sharing, but in order to make progress on this front, Member States need to make progress in further reducing risks. This entails repairing economic and fiscal imbalances through a consistent and faithful application of instruments like the Stability and Growth Pact and the macroeconomic imbalance procedure.  Between risk reduction and risk sharing, we need to work on our economic risk absorption capacity. It will not surprise you that I am convinced that private risk sharing is as important as public risk sharing. The experience in the US has shown that integrated financial markets account for the largest part of the absorption of asymmetric economic shocks. Developing the Capital Markets Union, therefore, should be a priority.  Similarly, we need a comprehensive approach to completing the Banking Union in order to decisively break the vicious sovereign banking nexus. The key element in building the Banking Union was the paradigm shift from bail-out to bail-in. This is a fundamental shift in our approach, where risks will be pushed back to where they belong. But more needs to be done to strengthen the resilience of our banking system. For example, dealing with over 150 national options and discretions left to date, reducing sovereign risks, and applying the bail-in rules in full to ensure a level playing field. This is as important as decisive progress towards a European deposit insurance scheme or a credible backstop to the Single Resolution Fund. The three will have to be brought forward together.  It is essential that we join efforts to build dynamic, flexible and upward converging economies that are supported by a well-integrated financial market with private risk sharing and by sound public finances with fiscal buffers for difficult times.  My plea for further integration at euro area level should go hand in hand with greater accountability, legitimacy and institutional strengthening. This affects national and European policy makers, as well as national parliaments and the European Parliament. As far as the European Parliament is concerned, I believe it should be able to fully exploit its prerogatives under the current treaties and secondary legislation when it comes to the European Semester.  The preparatory work for moving to the second stage of completing the EMU should include a debate on the role and competences of the different institutional actors in a deep and genuine monetary union.  The measures outlined in the Five Presidents’ Report and the recent Commission initiatives to operationalise them are given careful consideration in different fora. I will assume my responsibility and facilitate the non-legislative and legislative procedures, both from the perspective of the Eurogroup Presidency and of the next Presidency of the ECOFIN Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2015-12-15.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Präsident der Kommission. – Sehr verehrter Herr Präsident, Herr Präsident der Euro-Gruppe, Herr Vizepräsident der Kommission, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren, liebe Kollegen! Dies ist eine wichtige Debatte, wie der Präsident zu Recht ausgeführt hat, was ja auch die massive Präsenz in diesem Plenarsaal zur Genüge belegt. (Beifall) I have always said that the European Parliament is the Parliament of the euro, and I say it again today. The euro is a political project, and that means that it requires political supervision and democratic accountability. You are the Parliament of the European Union, but you are also the Parliament of the euro. This is why I wanted President Schulz to contribute to our roadmap for Economic and Monetary Union – the Five Presidents’ Report, which we presented last June and to which Jeroen was referring. Our report makes it clear that the legitimacy of the euro is paramount, at least as important as its economic significance and its stability on the financial markets. In the years to come, as we will need to develop and strengthen the common institutions that the single currency demands, that legitimacy will acquire only greater importance. This has nothing to do with institutional power grabs or federal dreams. This has to do with the pressing reality of the European Union, where so many people are still unemployed, and where our economic recovery is still fragile. From my perspective, the crisis is not over and there should be no complacency. Even if we are helped by the action of the European Central Bank, we only have a short window of opportunity to press ahead with our agenda for reforms, investment and responsible public finances, with social fairness at its core. The crisis has also been a crisis of legitimacy – at all levels. Economic governance is not about legal rules or numerical percentages: it is about people and it is about the political decisions that affect them. It is about political responsibility and political accountability. The Five Presidents’ Report makes clear that Parliament should play a central role, starting with its power to legislate, but also its power to hold accountable. The Commission is the natural ally of this House in making sure this is the case, even more so in the future. We are not starting from a blank sheet. Today Parliament is playing a new and growing role in the economic governance of the EU and the euro area, and that is how it should be. The European Semester of economic policy coordination is more transparent and more accountable now that Parliament is more involved. When Parliament organises its economic dialogues with Member States and with the Commission, the President of the Eurogroup – who is present here and I greet him with the deepest respect – and the President of the ECB, it helps to shape the agenda and delivers parliamentary oversight, and that is vital for our democracy. Vice-President Dombrovskis, sitting beside me today, was once a Member of this Parliament. As you know, he was also a Prime Minister of his country, where he pursued a successful programme of national reform. If there is one person here who understands why the euro demands democratic legitimacy, it is he. This is why I entrusted him with this particular job. And for the conduct of the European Semester, he is working closely with Marianne Thyssen and Pierre Moscovici, who are also two former Members of this House. This year, Vice-President Dombrovskis came to debate with you during the preparation of the Annual Growth Survey. I remember that this was a request both from the President of this House and by some Party and Group leaders, like Philippe. He put this forward years ago, but he had to wait until this Commission to have the chance to participate in these kinds of debates. But it was the first time that the Commission had discussed and debated with the Parliament the Annual Growth Survey before the adoption of that important document. Together with Commissioner Moscovici, Valdis Dombrovskis came to debate and report on the Greek programme to you. Again last week, the two of them – together with Commissioner Thyssen – attended a joint meeting of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL) to present the priorities we see for 2016. When you invite us, we come. And by doing so, we keep improving the way our economic and fiscal surveillance works – making it more predictable and more transparent, giving more time for discussions and debates, and creating more opportunities for engagement at all levels.  For countries that are experiencing financial instability, I also believe that monitoring is now stronger with this Parliament’s participation. It is this Parliament that can host an open political debate on a country’s adjustment programme. Before I took office last year, I made it clear that I recognised the shortcomings of the so-called ‘Troika’. I was determined to do things differently, and under this Commission, we have done – and are doing –precisely that. We have also made a new start in that respect together with the President of the Eurogroup. Today, if a country needs to pursue an adjustment programme, we will see more transparency and more accountability. The Commission is, for instance, conducting social impact assessments so that we can, from the outset, design measures to support the most vulnerable and ensure a fair adjustment. We will report to this House on progress with the programme. We are implementing these new methods in the new programme with Greece, which for the first time is being done under the European Stability Mechanism – our European financial firewall. This is the first programme for which a full social impact assessment was published, as promised, and presented to the Committees of this Parliament. I know that – for some of you – all these various innovations do not go far enough, and some of you wanted to re-open and revise the six-pack and the two-pack legislation before the ink was dry. However, if the Five Presidents adopted the approach you find in our report, it is because we were convinced – and I know the large majority of you are equally convinced – that our first task is to implement what was agreed by Parliament and Council and focus on what we have just put in place. Rather than create new uncertainty, let us fully use our newly agreed tools and make them work to the best effect. We know that the provisions of the six-pack and two-pack legislation, which have been in force for just a few years, are both far-reaching and useful in terms of Parliament’s involvement. All this is part of our pragmatic, yet ambitious, approach to completing Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union. As we promised in the Five Presidents’ Report, we have already launched Stage 1 of the roadmap, which is expected to last until mid-2017. We are ‘deepening by doing’, which means that we are using existing powers and tools to work towards Economic Union, Financial Union, Banking Union and Political Union. It is pragmatic, but it is ambitious. It is at this stage where we, the Five Presidents, have said that we will make use of all possibilities, including legislative ones, within the existing Treaties. This is why I associated your President with this report. We need this Parliament as our strong partner during this phase. One concrete example is the recommendation for the economic policy of the euro area that we issued for the first time in November, as promised, at the start of the new European Semester. This is something I had committed to in my State of the Union speech: to create scope and time for an in-depth debate, including in this House, of the priorities for the euro area as a whole, before discussing priorities for individual Member States later in spring.  We are also already coming forward with legislation wherever this is needed, for instance to complete our Banking Union or deepen our Capital Market Union. Just think of our proposal for a European Deposit Insurance Scheme. What could be more urgent than protecting the savings of our citizens and reinforcing their trust in the banking system? It is not for the Commission to say how Parliament wishes to organise itself, but let me share today a few thoughts on how we might deepen the cooperation between our institutions under Stage 1, now, as we are moving towards Stage 2, which we plan to initiate in spring 2017 on the basis of a white paper. Firstly, it is good practice for the Commission to seek the views of the European Parliament before we adopt our Annual Growth Survey, as we did this year. I would also hope that priorities for the next European Semester could be debated in as many committees as possible. Secondly, the Commission is fully committed to making the European Parliamentary Week – which is organised under your guidance, Mr President – a key moment in our economic governance, and to bringing national Parliaments into the process. In our view, these exchanges would best take place at the start of each year in order to shape the European Union and euro area priorities ahead of national discussions on our Member States’ programmes. Thirdly, when a Member State is pursuing an adjustment programme, we should make full use of the practice of the Commission reporting to Parliament after each review of the programme’s implementation. I know there are further reflections ongoing within this House as to how this could best be done, and I will be happy to consider these in due course.  These arrangements should be part of a new practice between our two institutions, based on reinforced political dialogue. Our two institutions have a common interest to succeed for our citizens. I believe everything which strengthens Parliament will also strengthen the Commission. And I believe Parliament should be vigilant to preserve the role of the Commission in all these discussions. As you know, there are some who want to weaken the role of the Commission in the management of our common economic and fiscal rules. Some even call for transferring the tasks we have under the Treaty to an agency of technocrats. I am sure I can count on this Parliament to agree with me that decisions on budgetary priorities, the balance between revenues and expenditures, the level of taxation, the performance of public administrations and social systems are all political decisions which require a political Commission which can account for its role and action before this Parliament.  As foreseen in the Five Presidents’ Report, I believe that we should test and improve these new practices which we are now developing in order to progressively agree upon a broader interinstitutional agreement among our institutions in full respect of their distinctive roles. The practical and institutional steps that we are discussing today are all necessary to complete our Economic and Monetary Union. They are a means to an end: jobs and growth, fairness and democratic change. This is what we have been focusing our minds and energy on and what we should remain focused on. The ideas I presented to you this morning are faithful to the Political Guidelines I presented for this Commission, as well as to the Five Presidents’ Report I co-authored with the President of this House. I put them to you in a spirit of good will and with an open mind. I hope they will produce an honest and useful debate.

Discussing and adopting a recommendation on the economic and budgetary policy of the euro area, conceiving it as an organic entity and doing so before the debate on the different countries taken individually, is a change not only procedural, but also conceptual and political; it is a change that is consistent with a conception of the euro area as an economic union and not as a mere monetary union.  Parliament therefore appreciates this innovation, which we consider to be the most positive and significant element of the communication of 21 October, and with this debate we intend to contribute to enriching this innovation politically and democratically, aware as we are of the responsibilities arising from being – as you, even now, have rightly acknowledged in this House – the Parliament of the euro. That is also why we believe that the modalities and nature of our contribution to the six months of the euro area, if we want to call it that, must also be strengthened and formalised by means of an interinstitutional agreement which should also cover Parliament's role of democratic control over the implementation of macroeconomic adjustment programmes linked to the provision of financial assistance through the European Stability Mechanism.  But let us come to the substance of these recommendations. Thanks to the European Central Bank's accommodative monetary policy, but also thanks to a more balanced and growth-conscious policy mix that your Commission, Mr Juncker, rightly pursued in its first year, the economic recovery is underway, supported by increased domestic consumption that is also offsetting the weakening foreign demand of emerging countries. And yet the recovery remains fragile, weighed down also by geopolitical factors. It is no coincidence that the ECB, as soon as it has adjusted rates and extended its programme of buying assets, has declared itself ready to step it up if price developments do not improve.  But monetary policy alone is not enough to solve the fundamental problems underlying the anemic nature of the recovery. Firstly, the low growth potential of our economy, which requires us to continue resolutely along the path of structural reforms and to strengthen their coordination and convergence, but also the cyclical dimension of recovery, without which we will have no structural recovery, is still too modest and requires stronger action to strengthen domestic demand and private sector expectations. On both fronts, the decisive factor is investment, which both acts on the demand and supply side.  The Commission has rightly sounded the alarm about the unprecedented current account surplus and the extraordinary gap between savings and investment. That is our main problem, which we must tackle with determination. We are rightly committed to increasing the capacity of our financial system to support the economy; Parliament is committed to supporting the capital markets union and the completion of the banking union. Also because full financial integration, primarily of the euro area, is essential not only for growth, but also to strengthen our ability to share risks and absorb shocks, and therefore the legislative proposal on the European deposit insurance system is an essential element.  Of course, there is also the issue of risk reduction, on which, moreover, much has already been done with the first two pillars of the banking union, but every further step must be examined with caution, responsibility and graduality, because we need everything but to create problems where fortunately there are none, and then to discover that rash actions dictated by domestic policy reasons end up increasing the risk and not reducing it.  With regard to private financing of financial integration, it is very positive that one of the four recommendations is devoted to the issue of non-performing loans. I also see it as a recommendation to the Member States, but also as a recommendation that the Commission makes to itself, given, as you know, that, from the point of view of the state aid framework, many obstacles have so far been placed in the way of effective and reasonable solutions to this problem.  Another key piece to relaunch investment is the plan that bears his name, Mr Juncker, Parliament strongly supports this and hopes that all its potential will be exploited to the full. It is very positive that the recommendations recognise that all these measures are necessary, but not sufficient without proper fiscal policy on the part of the Member States. From this point of view, the first recommendation is central. , if necessary.  Of course, the best use of the instruments at our disposal to boost growth must be accompanied by a strengthening of our governance, by a clear vision for the future. Parliament is asking for ambition, Parliament has made useful proposals, convergence guidelines, fiscal capacity, which can also be achieved by constant treaties, and we are naturally ready for an active dialogue with the Commission in the run-up to phase two of the deepening of EMU.  Mr Juncker, we are counting on you to give the necessary impetus and ambition that are essential in the debate on growth and governance, demonstrating that Europe when it thinks of itself as a unit, and when it equips itself with an appropriate democratic dimension, is stronger than the obstacles that are before it and is equal to the great challenges, not only economic but also political, that the complex world , terrible, difficult but also full of opportunities puts us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2015-12-15.json", "name": "Dariusz Rosati", "mepid": "28394", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I welcome the communication by the Commission on completing the European Economic and Monetary Union. The document sets a very ambitious agenda for the future. It builds on the Five Presidents’ Report and it proposes a set of measures that focus on four strategic fronts: building an economic union, a financial union, a fiscal union and a political union. I see this document as a proposal to fill the gaps that have been left in the European construction of economic governance and the gaps that have been made apparent by the recent crisis. These reforms are definitely necessary. The project is very ambitious, but it is necessary if the euro area is to survive and to flourish. It is necessary if integration and convergence are to continue to strengthen. We all know the status quo cannot continue because it is too prone to crisis. I think that the choice which is ahead of us is: either we go forward and build a genuine union, or we simply have to go back and return probably to national currencies. Now, the key question here is: to what extent is this politically feasible? To what extent are all actors of this process – including this Parliament and the Commission, but above all the national governments – ready to go ahead under the current difficult political circumstances? This current political climate in Europe is not very prone to far-reaching integration projects, but we are all convinced that this is absolutely necessary to move forward. In order to complete the EMU, we all need more political ambition and more political determination. Our political group is ready to cooperate on this front.

That is why Parliament needs to have a strong say in all these matters, and that is why this dialogue today is so relevant.  I would like to welcome the President of the Eurogroup, the President of the Commission, and the Vice—President of the Commission in charge of the eurozone. The eurozone is confronted with three major problems: a clear output gap, macroeconomic imbalances and worrying economic and social divergences. These problems are there. I believe there is a key word to respond to these problems, which is investment: investment turned to the future, and investment on a European scale.  We need to have much more investment to raise domestic demand in Europe. Success in exports is positive, of course, but we cannot only rely on exports. That is why we believe that this aggregate fiscal stance should be used to identify clearly the investment gap we have in Europe, and to organise Member States to share their efforts to address this investment gap. When it comes to macroeconomic imbalances, we need to ask those Member States that have a current account surplus to make more effort to invest for their own benefit. Otherwise, the macro imbalances will rely only on the efforts made by Member States which have a deficit. That means that they have to reduce wages, demand and jobs. We need a joint effort from surplus and deficit countries to reduce macroeconomic imbalances. Then we have the problem of divergences. Again, we need to have investment in all members of the eurozone to push for upward convergence. This is necessary. And while Member States do need to make their own catching-up efforts, these should be complemented by the necessary European instruments: completing the banking union and building up fiscal capacity. These are issues where Parliament will remain very active. We plan to be active on the road to completing economic and monetary union and in the key moments of the European Semester.

What is even more interesting is what answers are given to them by the majority groups in this House – from the Christian Democrats, from the Social Democrats, from the Greens, from the Liberals, from the Liberals, from the Liberals, from the Liberals. Questions arise, such as: why do we have an investment gap in the eurozone? Why do we have so little private investment despite the lowest interest rates? The answers are essentially given in such a way that they say: we do not know for sure, but it is not the euro. The question arises: why do we not have inflation in the eurozone despite the European Central Bank's extremely expansionary monetary policy? The answer is that we do not know, but it is not the euro. The question arises: why do we in Europe have rising public debt, for five years still rising public debt, since we have really tried to limit, limit and return public debt to sustainable levels? The answer is that we do not know, but it is certainly not the euro. The question arises: why does the eurozone have the weakest growth of all the world's major economic regions, despite structural reforms, despite falling oil prices, despite a depreciating euro? The answer is essentially: we do not know, but it is not the euro. Ladies and gentlemen! It is time we looked back at what we wanted to achieve with the euro. We wanted to have a zone of growth and stability. What we have received is a zone in which public debt is now doubled, or sometimes even triple, in many countries, where unemployment is alarmingly high in many eurozone countries – including youth unemployment – where banks are sitting on bad loans, where the ECB is printing money in bulk and is unwilling to announce an end where savers fear for their pensions. because they no longer receive interest on their assets.

Mr President, I wanted first of all to welcome Mr Dijsselbloem's presence among us. I think it is important that we have these debates, which are democratic, cross-border and public. Mr Dijsselbloem, you come to the ECON committee on a regular basis, and we are grateful for that, but it is even better that you also come to the plenary. I thank Mr Juncker and Mr Dombrovskis for being here as well. You have rightly pointed out the levels of unemployment, which I believe should be at the centre of all our discussions on the future of economic and monetary union.  I would also like to make one point: you have spoken about legitimacy and paid tribute to economic dialogue. So I'm going to, for once, be totally immodest. Having been at the origin of the introduction of economic dialogue in the six-pack, I would say that it encourages me because at the time - colleagues present, such as Elisa Ferreira, and others who are no longer there certainly remember it - the Member States did not want it at all. The idea that we could introduce this horrible thing that would be a public discussion between the Community institutions, the states and Parliament, we did not want to hear about it. So you see that when you face an opposition, it is sometimes worth trying to overcome because after the fact, you find yourself happy to have innovated. The report of the five presidents was timely, since at the date it was delivered, we were still in a very difficult moment of the crisis on Greece. However, I do not think we should be too self-centered. Outside the European sphere, people barely know that there is a report from the five presidents; in fact, they do not know that there was one of the four presidents. It is better because they would wonder if the next one would be that of the six presidents.  In the report of the five chairs, we announced the creation of a working group. I think all of this is a bit of a public eye and a little more needs to be actioned. As Mr Rosati said very well earlier, the real question is whether we are doing everything we can to ensure that economic and monetary union continues, prospers, brings work and competitiveness. From that point of view - and it is not a reproach; I am just stressing the effort that we must make collectively, we cannot go to the opinion of the 'capital markets union'. People don't know what it is, Mr. President! Call it a \"financing union\" or an \"innovation union\"; it is the goal that counts, not the instrument. I would still like to make one final point on one issue. You said that this Parliament is the one of the eurozone, the Parliament of the euro. Yes, but why? Because, in the current institutional framework, as the treaties establish, there is a currency for the whole of the European Union, with a Parliament in which Members from all countries make decisions. But if we are going towards a multi-currency union, what should we do? Would it be legitimate to continue to have a Parliament that speaks for people who tell us that they do not want to be part of the same system anyway? I would also say to colleagues that many criticise Europe and the euro, but if their country is doing well, it is also because there are transfers of 4% of the GDP of their own country. In conclusion, I just wanted to say, Mr President, that we have to pay attention to stowaways. This Parliament is indeed the Parliament of the euro area, and it intends to remain so as long as everyone wants to be part of the common project. However, we are likely to have to clarify things in the months and years to come.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 14, "date": "2015-12-15.json", "name": "Fabio De Masi", "mepid": "124858", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to sanendour sto -- on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Mr President, I would like to thank the Presidents for their excellent work and for their excellent work. French star economist Piketty says the architecture of the euro is a monster. I am afraid that, after reading the Five Presidents' Report, he has not changed his mind. Wage developments in Germany have been too weak for many years, and Germany's export surpluses and capital exports have driven southern Europe into private debt. The cuts in government spending, wages, pensions have been a fiasco, they have deepened the depression. The stronger the eurozone's competitiveness, the deeper the depression became. Germany has an export surplus of 8% of GDP. That is against all the rules of the game of a monetary union. Now, trade unions are also to be disempowered through competition committees. The left, like the German Trade Union Confederation, rejects this. The Stability of Growth Pact is holding back investment despite low interest rates. We need investment right now in the refugee crisis to end the state's failure in housing, in education, in health. We need public investment, because the Fed may raise interest rates tomorrow, because the ECB's cheap money ends up in financial markets, but not for business and household investment.

Mr President, the euro is a federal currency, it is not an intergovernmental currency. That is why I welcome you, Mr Dijsselbloem, as President of the Eurogroup, because you are right, the members of the Eurogroup, as finance ministers, are accountable to their national parliaments, but it is quite normal for the President of the Eurogroup to be accountable to the European Parliament. You do it regularly in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I think it is only fair that you do it in plenary, and therefore be welcome. Are the revenues that have been used today - for the last five or six years - in Europe to preserve this federal currency, which we also care about, work? In any case, if I take your favourite indicator, namely growth, I find that it is, at best, evanescent.  And if we look a little more specifically at what is happening in the countries - and I am not going to talk about Greece because it is such a complicated case that it would blur the message, but spain, a country that has applied with conviction the revenues that you are advocating, namely the reduction of the role of the state, the reduction of direct and indirect wages, what do we see? Yes, growth is coming back to Spain, but at what cost? When employment increases, it is unskilled employment, it is part-time employment. This is what creates this new category of working poor. In Spain, the eurozone's flagship country, one in three children faces poverty. So if you call it success, let me have some doubts. Your recipes are actually deflatory. They are countercyclical: they compress public demand and private demand. As a result, there is no growth. So if you care so much about it, it's not the right solution.  By the time COP 21 concludes, we should actually put the whole package on investment in the energy transition. It is obviously a climate requirement, but it is also a geostrategic requirement if we want to stop defending people like Putin or Saudi Arabia. This is a macroeconomic requirement if we want to stop spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year on fossil fuels. This is a demand in terms of jobs since everyone knows that renewable energy is much more job intensive than traditional energy. Second message: 150 years after its unification, 25 years after its reunification, Germany, which is a monetary union and a customs union, is still not homogeneous. It is not tomorrow the day before that the European Union and the euro area will be homogeneous, and therefore there is no euro that holds without powerful rebalancing mechanisms within the euro area. These mechanisms must go through the private sector, namely the banking union, which we know remains incomplete - we know that it will be difficult to bring out the third pillar, the common deposit guarantee - but also by the public sector. These include a common tax system, a euro area budget and also a common social security embryo. However, of all this, it is only very vaguely discussed in the report of the five presidents, and it is well known that today there is no political will to do so. If we do not go through these rebalancing mechanisms, the euro area is doomed. I do not want it to disappear, and therefore these rebalancing mechanisms will have to be put in place.

Your text is nothing more than the will written by those who wanted you there, in those positions that you held; it is certainly not democracy, but a different design that frees citizens from the possibility of choosing an economic alternative to that imposed by your vision. Budgetary stability, private investment, structural reforms, the banking union and, above all, the monetary union, the euro: the recipe for failure for years? It serves private capital to strategically share the rights and public property of sovereign states, that is to tell the citizens and, above all, to deprive us of the dream, of the union of peaceful and democratic peoples.  To date, the roadmap has as your priority a union of banks that has already failed at launch and with its first two pillars. The first pillar, single supervision, is not in a position to assess the real weight of systemic risk in the banking system, not considering derivatives, for example, and is full of conflicts of interest between private shareholders, managers and politicians. The rescue in Italy these days is a clear example of this.  The second pillar, the crisis resolution system, is already having victims among savers and has already proved largely unsuccessful. Who has to pay for the greed of the unsustainable financial system, savers or taxpayers? We propose that banks should once again become banks, with a real separation between those who use money for the real economy and those who use it to bet, that central banks guarantee systemic risk as lenders of last resort for the healthy system. We are telling you this before the bomb goes off in your hand, because under these conditions the financial paper castle will fall ruinously sending so many people to the ground. Our proposal is on the table in banking structural reform, take it and make it yours.  I now turn to monetary union, the means by which you are staring at us and terrorising us. As a currency area with major imbalances – as you admit in your report – we have built the house from the roof without foundations. You have taken away our monetary sovereignty and therefore democracy is rebelling against this, because you can no longer decide on the type of economic policy. We only have this strategy, which is that of the Commission, which has failed and then we are heading for those extremisms; extremism is not right, we must have a post-ideological ideology and therefore good ideas must be put before us, not extremism.  So the rules apply only to the weak and not to the strong, and the current-account surplus in Germany is an example of this. We must sanction these behaviours or monetary union makes no sense, the only solution here too, before everything breaks out in your hands, is an agreed dissolution of the eurozone and only in this way will we be able to lay the foundations for a different Union, in solidarity, that puts fiscal justice at the centre, the transparency of bank flows and a certainly brighter future for all, but to do so we will need people other than Juncker. , Dijsselbloem and you, I'm sorry, Mr President.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 19, "date": "2015-12-15.json", "name": "Gerolf Annemans", "mepid": "124973", "text": "  on behalf of the ENF Group.

Mr President, we are talking about deepening EMU, which means enlarging and strengthening The European Union's unpopular structures, further consolidating and scaling up anti-labour policy in all countries and not just the over-indebted, with a view to the profitability of capital. Through competition, the supervision and role of the Eurogroup is strengthened and a European Council and National Fiscal Councils are set up with the sole aim of automatic cuts in wages, pensions, social expenditure sacrificed to monopolistic profits. The integration of markets, such as energy, digital and banking capital markets, without removing the divisions of the Member States, aims to raise capital and upgrade European monopolies, with a view to the signing of the Transatlantic Agreement. In Greece, the SYRIZA-ANEL government intensifies the unpopular offensive and, with the aim of extracting the consent of the people, attempts to deceive it. It invokes, like many here, the supposed democratic control of the European Semester and the Memorandum by the European Parliament, a reactionary tool of the Union that has voted and ratified anti-labour policy.

Now, I have been a member of a national parliament for 12 years and I always think that it is a good thing that parliaments are divided, for the obvious reason that we have to represent different political ideas in our society. The real question is whether we can share common goals, whether we can find an agreement on the way forward, on the choice of instruments. I think, listening also to the different contributions from Parliament, that there is quite a large agreement on the way forward, and it is about the right policy mix. Those of you have said that we have made mistakes over the course of the crisis are right. We went into unknown territory at the beginning of the financial crisis, in the eurozone crisis, and we developed our instruments and we developed new frameworks for policy. We set up emergency mechanisms, we created new institutions to strengthen our economic cooperation, and we have come a long way, so there is no reason for cynicism. There is reason for optimism, for example if you see at what pace we have designed and set up the Banking Union, and yes, everyone who says we need to complete it now is right.  One of the lessons that we should learn over the course of the history of the European Union is that we should finish our projects and not set up a framework and leave it half finished. So let us finish the Banking Union. I am convinced that setting up and finishing the Banking Union will be more important for economic recovery than any other project at the moment. So that is what we should do and we know what we need to do. We need to fight the risks that are remaining in our banks and we need to make sure that it becomes more solid. As President Juncker said, it protects the deposits, which is key for our citizens. Let us get it done.  Part of that mix of instruments should also be strengthening investments. The Commission has taken a strong initiative with the EFSI. Let us get it up and running. Let us expand it if necessary. Let us see that we get the investments going. Completing the Banking Union will be crucial to get a stronger credit flow back to our SMEs, companies wanting to reinvest again and others opening for business. A lot of young people all over Europe want to start businesses. Can they get their hands on credit? That is what the Capital Markets Union is about, that is what completing the Banking Union is about. And yes, part of that policy mix also has to be growth-friendly fiscal policy. One of the key issues that is holding us back, holding back our economic recovery, is the indebtedness of our societies – governments with high debt, households with high debt, SMEs sometimes with high levels of debt, which is holding back our recovery. But there is no quick fix. Anyone who believes that with a snap of one’s fingers one can get rid of those high levels of debt is mistaken. It will take time, but we have to get through it and we have to get financing and credits for our economies. That is key, and fiscal policy will support that. Demand is returning in many of our eurozone countries. Growth has returned to all of our countries except for Greece, and I am sure that working with Greece as we are now in a very constructive mode, and taking difficult measures that will help get the Greek economy back on track, is the way forward. Yes, there are issues of balance – political balance, economic balance – within our eurozone, but do not be negative about what we have accomplished. We have come out of a deep crisis, we have strengthened our cooperation, we have strengthened our monetary union in many respects and let us continue to do that, but let us do it in a way that sticks and not in a way that brings us new problems. So if we take new steps forward, and we will do in the second phase of the Five Presidents’ Report, let us design it well.

I am pleased that he mentioned, among other things, the semester week as one of the key points when it comes to setting the priorities in that European discussion. This semester week, of course, takes place with the national parliaments and is about who has what responsibility. I found it interesting in that context that our President said that the EP would stand for a 'full Duty of A Mitsprache' - something I have not often come across in our texts, I must honestly say - and that the President of the Eurogroup came up with the unambitious 'the European Parliament can make full use of its prerogatives according to the Treaty'.

We cannot pretend that we can only do that here at European level.  I have two key points in terms of content. One point is about the eurozone. This debate must be about what the Germans so beautifully call 'Standort Europa'. And yes, ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Group, which has to do with investment, but then say that this cannot be public investment, which is based on even more debt. The second point concerns the completion of the banking union and the relationship between risk sharing and risk reduction. In this context, the President of the Eurogroup has said that both must go hand in hand. My question is whether there is not also a timing difference, whether the one, namely that reduction and proof that this reduction works in Europe, is not a prerequisite for being able to take that next step in that risk-sharing?

The three Presidents who co-signed the Five Presidents’ Report are here and we are, for the first time, discussing in plenary the stance and functioning of the eurozone. So this moment is very welcome indeed.  The truth is that, more than seven years after the 2008 crisis, in spite of the welcome massive quantitative easing by the European Central Bank and also in spite of a more intelligent application of the governance rules by the Commission, the eurozone economy is stagnant. It is basically flat with strong internal divergences and alarming levels of poverty and unemployment. The reality confirms what we have repeatedly been saying here and what President Draghi said in 2014, which is that in a recessive economic environment, monetary union alone is not enough to boost the economy. In a zero lower bound interest rate and stagnant economy, investment projects are hardly viable, thus limiting the potential to increase competitiveness and create new jobs, while non-performing loans jeopardise the viability of banks and other lenders.  So the Commission and Council urgently need to acknowledge that the policies which have been imposed until now need urgent change. In 2015, GDP per head and the level of productive investment in the euro area remain below the levels in 2007. The future of the EU – and in particular the future of the eurozone and its acceptance by its citizens – depends on this policy change. Change means that the eurozone cannot, in 2016, pursue a neutral aggregate fiscal stance as, once again, is being proposed by the Commission and the Council. It is suicidal to ignore the facts and to persist in this neutral stance. The aggregate fiscal stance should instead be expansionist, clearly countercyclical, protect productive investment and limit internal divergent trends. But what instruments do we have? Until now, only pre-crisis external deficit countries have adjusted, whereas external surplus countries continue to increase their current account surpluses. The surplus largely reflects excess domestic savings over investment, which leaves the eurozone without a stimulus. This asymmetric adjustment, incapable of generating internal investment or conception, is further reducing the viability of the common currency. Apart from interpreting the existing rules in a wiser way, we need immediately to prepare for the next phase of the 2015 Five Presidents’ report, which is already a diluted version of the 2012 Van Rompuy report. But we need to prepare immediately for the establishment of conditions to create a fiscal capacity for the eurozone. Without a reinforced budget, monetary union cannot function. European institutions also need to respect and comply with all the promises made, on the banking union in particular, by urgently providing an indispensable permanent credible backstop to the single resolution mechanism, by accelerating the common guarantee of deposits, and by allowing the ESM to directly recapitalise banks. I recall that this element is included in the first phase of the Five Presidents’ Report. I do not think that this can be a trade—off for anything else. It is just finishing what has been promised.

The performance of the euro area shows that this austerity is not paying off, as we have anemic and weak growth, high unemployment, low investment and an increase in poverty and inequality. The power of the far right is also threatening the eurozone itself with disintegration and so the eurozone, if it wants to live and not break up, must move faster to more substantial changes.

There must be partial reciprocity in response to the debt problem which is unsustainable for several European countries. There must be a European deposit guarantee which is the third pillar of the Commission's proposal, despite the reactions of Mr. Schäuble hastened to disagree and there must be transfer payments and stronger convergence policies within the euro area, and all this must not be postponed until two years later.

On the one hand, like the statements of right-wing Eurosceptics, on the other hand, members of the Left Group, who are basically describing the drama, have the fact that the euro is to blame for everything, and that is why we in Europe do not get out of social problems on the one hand and economic problems on the other. On the other hand, we hear the different variations of pro-Europeans making different reform proposals, each limited by their different taboos. Some people do not want to talk about social crises, others just want investment, others like to talk about reducing debt and so on, so it goes back and forth. The result is clear: there are proposals on the lowest common denominator. Likewise, in this form, the first step of the five-president paper has been laid out.  In other words, we actually see the major problems that we have within the euro area, but we do not dare to make these proposals, partly because there is another taboo to be added to fear, namely the taboo of many pro-Europeans: to share even more sovereignty. This maximisation of different taboos leads to political incompetence, and thus feeds the political dismay of those who believe anyway that the EU – and the euro in particular – is to blame for everything.  I believe that we are really in a critical situation, if we do not make it clear that the euro is to be launched with deep reform, then this euro will probably not be sustainable. The situation in the markets, at the long end of the yield curve, is so bad, the investment dynamics are so low despite the situation of low interest rates – we need a firm policy. In my view, the various actors must overcome their taboos. In other words, we must both make reforms to increase competitiveness and finally have a common tax policy that ensures that even the wealthy in the Union can no longer take a slender foot. We need a banking union that clarifies on both sides, shares risks, but also reduces risks accordingly, and because it also addresses difficult issues such as the valuation of government bonds. We also need a Capital Markets Union. But not one that leaves out the difficult issues from the outset and therefore will not produce their result. The drama now is that the actors involved, the chairman of the Eurogroup, perhaps the Germany-France axis, the European Parliament and the Commission alike, do not currently have the courage to make such large, broad-based pro-European proposals. This is exactly what the eurozone needs now: we need bold reforms, not despondency, not a retreat from Europe's opponents.

But we have to go back to basics, because the reality of the functioning of the euro area is that we have set up negative interdependencies and what is definitely missing is the reality of that solidarity. Today, even Germany, in order to manage the influx of refugees it faces, considers it to be an essential part of the functioning of the European Union. The Commission keeps saying that the European Parliament must be involved in the process, that we need Parliament to make the eurozone work democratically - I note that Jean-Claude Juncker has left us and that the package he put on the table on 21 October leaves no room for the European Parliament, as it sets up a Competitiveness Council to decide on structural reforms in the Member States , a Tax Council that will lead the Commission's analysis of the Member States' budget. It seems to me that there was a place for the European Parliament in all of this. Secondly, the recommendation of the euro area, which we are talking about today, is certainly an element, but we must make it a tool for debate on economic policy. Is a tax neutral stance satisfactory? I note that this recommendation mentions the existence of a current account surplus. So what do we do with it, at a time when, including the IMF, is concerned about the prospect of deflation exported by the euro area globally? This is the economic political debate that this recommendation from the euro area should allow. Mr Dijsselbloem, I hear you when you say that we need simultaneous progress, but when you set out your strategy, I do not feel that this is exactly what you are considering, since you are telling us that private capital must first be mobilised by setting up this famous capital markets union and completing this banking union. It seems to us that this cannot work without the famous budgetary capacity that we so desperately need because interest rates are at zero, because the incentive of the private sector to invest, in the current context, does not exist, and you will not have a strong capital union if you do not have a euro area budget.  That is the reality of the debate. However, the whole of history teaches us that by small steps, we are damaging the project of the euro area. He suffered a warning shot with the Greek affair.

This is also necessary for the credible change of the banking union. In the end, there will be no fiscal backstop without this. Unfortunately, the first part of the Five Presidents' Report on this issue is a cliffhanger, and the crucial questions about the future of the eurozone will not be answered until the second part. The questions that need to be answered are: what exactly should democratic decision-making in the eurozone look like? What should the fiscal capacity for the eurozone look like? How will it be financed? How should they be decided? Above all, however, how can proper macroeconomic insurance be offered in the euro area at the same time and the budgetary restrictions imposed by the individual Member States can finally be hardened?

First of all, I think building the monetary union – and the same goes for the banking union – is about solidarity and organising it in our social economic system. Therefore it is about reducing risks, becoming more resilient, becoming stronger and more flexible, and, at the same time, gradually sharing risks. That is the only way forward. That is the way we have built the banking union and must complete it, and that is the way we must strengthen the monetary union.  Ms de Lange asked me whether it was not first about reducing risk and then sharing risks. I think that is too simple. We are at the moment in a phase of building up the banking union. As of 1 January 2016, new rules will apply. We are starting to build up the Resolution Fund, which will be complete in eight years’ time, and gradually we will share the risks inside the resolution framework. So it will go hand in hand. Yes, we will start sharing risk in the banking union. We already do now, and in the coming eight years we will continue to do so until it is a fully common system. It is about the two approaches at the same time, and that is the only way to get it done – politically as well. Ms Ferreira was absolutely right when she said that you cannot leave economic policy up to the ECB. The ECB is already far beyond what can reasonably be expected from monetary policy with a very accommodative stance.  So it is now up to politicians at national and European level. It is for both national and European levels to take their responsibilities, and that is also about applying what has been agreed. How can you build a common system and how can you build a union if you cannot apply the rules, and if you will not stick to the rules and the agreements that have been reached?  Ms Ferreira also asked me about the fiscal stance for the eurozone. At the moment a neutral stance for the eurozone as a whole is a reasonable approach, but there are big differences between countries. Some can do more, but there are limitations: there are few countries that actually have a fiscal surplus at the moment and could invest more. So there will be a different approach at national level in the fiscal stance and, overall, in the eurozone a neutral stance is, at this time, the right position to take.  For the future we need to have that debate about the fiscal capacity. We have put it in the second phase of the Five Presidents’ Report, but there is no reason why we should not debate it now, because there are many different ideas of what a fiscal capacity could mean. Some see it as a common backstop for our monetary union, some see it as an investment instrument, and some see it as a social security funding system. These are very different approaches. Let us debate that, because only if you have an agreement on the design of it do you know what size it has to have. Then you have to find agreement on where the funding is to come from. These are big questions that will touch upon our labour market policy, on our social security system and possibly even our pension systems. It depends very much on how you design this fiscal capacity, and there is no agreement as yet on what their instrument should look like. So let us do the work on that and let us not wait until 2017.  Many of you have spoken about the responsibilities of Member States and I fully agree. When you talk about structural reforms, part of it – a major part, I would say – is national responsibility and will probably be so for a very long time. The issues vary from one country to another, yet some are very much the same in all of our eurozone countries. The tax pressure on labour is much too high, forcing labour out of our economy. Let us reverse that process. We are working on that in the eurozone, and many countries are taking measures there. We need further work on the pension system to make it sustainable, also in Greece. Pensions systems need to be sustainable if we want to insure our pensioners, also in the future.  Part of the structural reforms will also have to come from the European side. We talked about the Capital Markets Union. Let me reassure Mr Woolfe that I do not dine with Goldman Sachs and, if I do dine with them, I certainly do not take their instructions. But I do believe that the Capital Markets Union is a way to open up financing needs to create more financing for our companies. We are still much too dependent on the banking system throughout Europe. Let us diversify that, become more resilient and strengthen economic recovery.  I have to react to Mr Eickhout who always, when I meet him in Brussels or here in Strasbourg, addresses me as a Dutch Minister. His point is that I say different things in the national parliament than I do in the European Parliament. I never do that. I always stress both the importance of this European dialogue and that of the national parliament. I strongly disagree with him that in national parliaments there is no serious debate about the European economy or European economic governance. He should come to the Dutch Parliament to participate in those debates. They are in depth, broad and serious, and I have to go to my parliament at least twice a month to discuss those issues.  Finally, Mrs Berès asked me about flexibility in the pact. Over the course of the crisis, the pact has proven to be flexible. A number of countries have been given more time to deal with their fiscal deficits. Fiscal targets have been adjusted over and over again. The real question is whether we can, in time, build fiscal buffers into our budgets again. That is my greatest concern: that we still have high sovereign debts, many countries still have high deficits, even though a lot of work has been done, and if a new economic setback were to occur, we do not have enough buffer capacity.  On the flexibility that the Commission has proposed: I strongly agree with that kind of flexibility, but it should be used well. The Commission should take the requests for flexibility of the Member States seriously and make sure that the credibility of the pact is not damaged. There is a balance between the flexibility in the pact and the credibility of the pact. Finally, we have a lot of work to do in the short term. So let us have a debate about long-term monetary union governance, let us start that debate now, but let us also work on the very short—term measures we can take. I have already mentioned the banking union, competitiveness, structural reforms and the Capital Markets Union, etc. There is work to be done.

It adds up national policies, framed by the Stability and Growth Pact, a pact regularly broken by many countries and which is merely a co-ownership regulation of the euro.  The euro area, unlike the United States of America, cannot practice the policy mix, that is, support for growth and jobs. There is an urgent need to equip it with the appropriate institutions so that it can finally be managed and governed: the appointment of a full-time finance minister, whose function is incompatible with the office of minister in one of the euro area Member States, the issue of availability and the issue of conflict of interest prevention; establishing a Treasury Directorate-General to coordinate the management of government borrowing, strengthen the banking union, stabilize financial markets and guarantee deposits; establishing a euro area budget to neutralise systemic shocks and encourage, by rewarding them, structural reforms and investment; and finally, the creation of a European Monetary Fund, probably by transferring the European Financial Stability Mechanism.

Helmut Kohl said the day after the conclusion of the negotiations on monetary union: now the European Union is irreversible. After all, a decision on a single currency is, in fact, the initial ignition for the creation of a political union. A common currency and a political union belong together. However, we are not yet a political union. The crucial point, therefore, is that we finally present an action plan, a plan for the operational implementation of all the proposals, a sanctions plan and a timetable for the creation of a political union. My second point is that we all agree today that the euro is a common currency that does not only refer to the euro area. In other words, this Parliament democratically legitimises the necessary political decisions for the single currency. The President of the Commission has said that Parliament and the Commission must be strengthened. Yes, all measures to develop the monetary union into economic and social union, to create a banking and capital markets, fiscal and investment union must be taken on the basis of Community law.

The same happened this year, with successive crises occurring on a wider front than that covered by the euro narrative. The fire-fighting has been successful. The collateral social costs have been high, but the structures set up under the Stability and Growth Pact might reflect too much the contingencies surrounding the euro crisis of that past. They are probably sufficient now to protect the euro from a recurrence of a crisis like that of 2008. Will they be adequate to face up to the challenges of the future, and to a new kind of crisis? Today's challenges arise from economic fragility and stagnation, from lack of job creation and competitiveness, and from low public and private investment. Success in dealing with them has been very limited. As we follow the liturgy of the European semester, has the time also come to reflect radically on the design of the Economic and Monetary Union? Do we need to think outside the box? Not to undermine the achievements, but to update them?

But the countries must also take responsibility in this story. Surely they cannot agree on structural reforms and then implement only 10 or 15% of these reforms at home. How can you pursue a common economic policy if it is the credibility and lack of ownership of different countries? So you will have to put more pressure there so that these structural reforms are implemented in those countries as well. A final point is democratic responsibility. Here too, I believe that we need to start a debate to ensure that this Parliament can play its part more than ever with national parliaments in order to ensure that these reforms and stability are achieved.

Our economic and monetary union is incomplete and certainly too fragile. Focused on the financial stability needed, it has abandoned growth, which is also essential for economic recovery. As such, I welcome the initiative of President Juncker, who, since his speech on the State of the European Union, has placed this subject at the heart of his priorities. I also welcome the consideration of the democratic framework in which these reforms are to take place, including the establishment of national competitiveness councils and a European budget committee. It is wise not to repeat the mistakes we have sometimes made to move faster, by not involving Europeans and their representatives enough in decision-making.

Our foundation is the budgetary stability anchor, which is laid down in the Treaties, our foundation is the Stability and Growth Pact, which commits each member State, and thus every euro state, to sustainable economic policy. A view of the eurozone must not distract from the fact that Member States have lived beyond their means for years and must be liable for them. A view of the eurozone must clearly show that the path to greater competitiveness lies first and foremost with the responsibility of the individual states themselves. If the Commission uses the European Fiscal Council to disclose the shortcomings in the Member States, if the Commission ensures that the European Fiscal Council will operate independently, then it certainly has our support for it. And if the Commission addresses structural weaknesses in the Member States and strengthens the principle of liability, we also give our full support. And when the Commission criticises the reciprocal links between sovereign debt and banking risks, focusing on targeted measures to reduce risk and reduce debt, we are certainly on their side as well.

The Commission has proposed concrete steps and we value very highly the debates we have held on these matters with Parliament and the feedback we have received. As President Juncker has stressed, the Commission thinks that Parliament has a key role to play in ensuring the democratic legitimacy and accountability of economic governance. We need to build on the stronger involvement of Parliament, which has happened in recent years, for instance via the economic dialogue. The Commissioners concerned and I will continue to be available for discussions on economic matters. We are already listening to Members’ calls, for instance by giving more attention to the euro area dimension and to social considerations in the European Semester. We must work together to fine tune the best way forward.  I have also carefully taken note of Members’ remarks on the euro area recommendation.

It is absolutely necessary for the eurozone, in addition to supporting demand, to address the issue of debt and fragile confidence. The European Central Bank must put in place monetary policy measures that can actually help support the economic recovery of the euro area.  The second point concerns a proposal recently adopted by the College of European Commissioners to review the approach to the European Semester and improve the economic governance of the euro area. Euro area Member States should have unified representation in international financial institutions, in particular in the International Monetary Fund. If every Member State of the euro area speaks for itself, or worse if they contradict each other, the eurozone will never have the weight that it should be given To complete economic and monetary union much depends on how it is implemented and whether the coordination mechanism will be created to prepare the unified positions that the President of the Eurogroup could and should present to the International Monetary Fund on behalf of all eurozone Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 104, "date": "2015-12-15.json", "name": "Matt Carthy (GUE/NGL)", "mepid": "124986", "text": "  in writing. – The completion of Europe’s economic and monetary union raises a number of serious concerns and is a matter which all Member State governments should be very attentive to.  On a wide scale it is designed to undermine the principle of subsidiarity and to strip Member States of their decision-making competencies in key economic areas.  As part of this package, Member States are required to set up National Competitiveness Boards.  However, Competitiveness Boards are a dangerous solution addressing the wrong issue. With euro-area exports exceeding imports by more than 3% of GDP, the euro area is not suffering from a lack of competitiveness. The euro area’s main problem is the (private) debt overhang inherited from a financial market-driven boom that went bust. This cannot be addressed by trying to export our problems to the rest of the world. Squeezing wages will make matters worse by undermining internal demand and by triggering deflation. Meanwhile, export market gains will eventually be neutralised by currency appreciation or by weakening of the euro area’s trading partners’ economies. The focus on (cost) competitiveness is short-sighted. Establishing a system of Competitiveness Boards will contribute to further imbalances at the expense of social cohesion.

The architecture of the union has key deficits which some of the Member States do not want to admit and much more to deal with. Economic and monetary union without harmonisation of tax policies, such as that currently in force in the euro area, leads to transnational competition to attract businesses through preferential tax treatment and results in tax immunity of large multinational capital. A single currency without a pan-European deposit guarantee scheme, which is now proposed by the Commission but it is unknown when it can be implemented, means credit suffocation for the heavily indebted Mediterranean countries and the inability of their small and medium-sized enterprises in particular to survive, due to the resulting prohibitive borrowing costs for them. A single currency without a common border guarantee entails a long-term burden on public debt at unsustainable levels from extremely high defence spending for geopolitically exposed Member States such as Greece, which has faced a decades-long officially formulated war threat from its neighbour Turkey.

This is indeed a crisis of legitimacy, as President Juncker noted, so evident in the ongoing race into the bottom on tax dumping among Member States, aggravating tax injustice.  Look at my country, Portugal: a former Tax Authority director just stated that 1 000 of the wealthiest families who should pay for 25% of the national revenue in personal income tax actually only pay 0.5%. And that, under the Troika’s noses, the Tax Authority Unit set to make these families pay their dues was dismantled.

The agreement was signed in Brussels on 6 May 2015 and has now been approved by the European Parliament. The agreement signed provides for visa-free travel for citizens of the European Union and for UAE nationals for a maximum of 90 days within any 180-day period of travel to the territory of the other Contracting Party. The UAE is the first Arab country with which the European Union is signing a visa waiver agreement.  More than 150,000 European citizens have settled in the United Arab Emirates, and around 1.6 million Europeans visit the country each year. In 2014, about 230,000 UAE citizens travelled to Europe, mainly for business or luxury tourism.

The vote in favour, however, does not hide the view that such measures are 'bread for today and hunger for tomorrow', whereas the issue of employment and relocations should have another approach to action.

Secondly, such an alternative should be to invest in future activities, especially a change in the productive and energy model, and not mechanisms that ultimately facilitate applicants (Member States and derived from the undertakings concerned) to dismantle sectors, without considering measures such as the repayment of subsidies received by companies, or the reporting of possible reopening in new territories that may contribute to the competitive devaluation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2153, "date": "2015-12-15.json", "name": "Theresa Griffin (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "124961", "text": "  in writing. ‒ There were 1 603 redundancies in 69 enterprises operating in the area of computer programming and consultancy in many Finnish regions.

It is clear that, in order to maintain marine fish stocks, the European Union is being forced to impose appropriate restrictions on sea fishing. 30% of the earth's seas are overfished and marine fish stocks are at risk. Justified steps to maintain them will result in a continuous and significant reduction in the amount of marine fish fish fished. Therefore, the common fisheries policy should pay much more attention to sustainable fish farming, i.e. aquaculture, and in particular freshwater fish farming. A significant number of fish ponds in Hungary are located in Natura 2000 sites. These farms do not pose any threat to the natural assets of these areas. Moreover, in many cases it is precisely because of our closed-system fish ponds that they have created or preserved individual wetland associations.

The Commission is currently proposing three main amendments to the agreement by extending the current preferences in order to provide time to align preferences with those provided for in the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, the introduction into the agreement of the 'human rights' clause, which allows the suspension of preferences in the event of serious violations and the possible suspension of the agreement from 1 January 2016, if the agreement is not adapted for the inclusion of Croatia in preferential practices. The current report accepts these amendments, which it nuances to make the agreement conditional on respect for the principles of democracy and the rule of law, effective economic reforms, regional cooperation with other Western Balkan countries and the strengthening of the administrative institutions of the Bosnian state.

This is a prerequisite for \"profitable\" renewable energy production facilities, whether industrial or from consumers/producers. This is a necessity to ensure the energy security of the European continent.  This is why financial incentives must be given to limit investment risks (The Juncker Plan and EFSI, dedicated taxation) in sustainable, \"smart\" and connected technologies. In doing so, the competences of national authorities must also be respected; not to destabilize existing networks by wanting to co-exist two principles that are difficult to reconcile - energy independence and openness to competition.

He wants the agency to become a supervisory body and be able to make binding decisions for these regulators, such as a ban on favouring domestic consumers in the event of a supply problem.

Indeed, microfinance has proved to be a useful tool in promoting self-employment among people who have lost their jobs as well as in helping micro-enterprises to have access to credit in times of crises. However, the microfinance market is still very fragmented in the EU with very different regulations. In many European countries, such as my country Greece, microfinance is the monopoly of banks. Only regulated banks may engage in micro-lending and there is no specific regulation for the sector. So banks have the monopoly but target groups of microfinance —unemployed, disadvantaged people—differ from those of banks. Moreover, as the report highlights, micro-credits are linked to the provision of support services to beneficiaries, again something that it is not usually within the remit of a bank. This has led to a strange situation where microfinance and the EU tools –Progress and the new EaSI- are not fully working in a country, Greece, where —with an unemployed rate above 25%— is so badly needed.

It is clear that, in order to maintain marine fish stocks, the European Union is being forced to impose appropriate restrictions on sea fishing. 30% of the earth's seas are overfished and marine fish stocks are at risk. Justified steps to maintain them will result in a continuous and significant reduction in the amount of marine fish fish fished. Therefore, the common fisheries policy should pay much more attention to sustainable fish farming, i.e. aquaculture, and in particular freshwater fish farming. A significant number of fish ponds in Hungary are located in Natura 2000 sites. These farms do not pose any threat to the natural assets of these areas. Moreover, in many cases it is precisely because of our closed-system fish ponds that they have created or preserved individual wetland associations.

The co-legislators must find a pragmatic solution to make rapid progress on multiannual plans in the light of the case-law of the European Court of Justice.

That is almost double the total of the last five years. It clearly reveals a significant failure in how we manage and protect our external border. Large-scale irregular flows have repercussions all across the EU. Several Member States have reintroduced internal border controls. What started as a problem at our external borders has come to put into question Schengen itself. If we want to preserve Schengen, we have to improve our common external border management. Our biannual report on Schengen adopted today could not be clearer on this. The current security risks, so tragically illustrated by the Paris attacks, make action even more urgent. It is simply wrong to mix up refugees and terrorists. But we must be clear that external border controls are essential for our security. The growing number of Europeans leaving, and returning, for terrorist purposes is just one of the many reasons why we cannot do without proper checks at the external borders.  Therefore, among the Commission’s proposals today is an amendment to the Schengen Border Code, so that everyone crossing the external border, including EU citizens, is systematically checked against common databases. This will help ensure that someone who is a security threat will be stopped at the external border, upon arrival or leaving. In this plenary in September, President Juncker announced that the Commission would bring forward proposals for a European Border and Coast Guard. We have done so today, responding to calls from this House and the European Council to strengthen the protection of our external borders, which is an integral part of the European Agenda on Migration. The common European Border and Coast Guard will ensure the integrated management of the Union’s external borders, in line with the objective set out in Article 77 of the Treaty. The principle underlying our proposal is one of shared responsibility. In an area without internal borders, managing external borders effectively is a matter of common interest. Under our proposals, national border guards will remain the key actors in managing their section of the borders and in the day-to-day work. But they will work within a stronger European framework, with higher standards, integrated risk assessment, proper information flows and a proactive system to address deficiencies before they become problems. The national border guards will be supported, monitored and – when necessary – reinforced by a European Border and Coast Guard Agency. The Agency will be able to deploy equipment and a standing reserve of at least 1 500 border guards from Member States, instead of relying on ad hoc calls for voluntary contributions. All this should help correct many of the weaknesses that have hindered Frontex over the years.  The aim of this new integrated border management architecture is to prevent uncontrollable situations and to strengthen our collective ability to deal with crisis situations where a section of the external border suddenly comes under strong pressure. But we cannot exclude that there will still be exceptional situations where a Member State is, for whatever reason, unable to cope with the situation on its own. In such rare cases, the Agency itself must be able to quickly step in and assume the management of that specific part of the shared external border. This is a safety net, which like all safety nets, we hope will never need to be used. But it is essential if we are to restore the credibility of our border management system. In a way, it closes the loop.  Finally, the Agency will also have considerably strengthened powers in the field of return. Let me be very clear: Europe will provide protection for those who need it. But those who have no right to be here cannot stay. Today what we propose is an operational solution at EU level – a dedicated Return Office within the new Agency working with Member States and third countries to organise return operations and flights. I hope for the support of this House for these important proposals, and I hope that we can make progress quickly. In the meantime, we need to continue to work to improve the situation as it is today. Much still remains to be done in Italy and Greece. All Member States need to comply fully with their legal obligations. Last week we initiated a number of infringement proceedings on the application of Eurodac by Greece, Italy and Croatia, and on asylum and migration in Hungary. The Commission has also discussed other aspects of the refugee crisis today, including progress following the Leaders’ Meeting on the Western Balkan route ahead of this week’s European Council, which will be discussed by your House tomorrow morning.  I have focused here on the proposals which are most relevant for this debate on the European Border and Coast Guard. But it is clear that this is only one element of a wide range of actions we need in order to tackle the challenge of migration. The Commission will continue to pursue work on all fronts, and we will come back early next year with further proposals, in particular, to review the operation of the Dublin system.

On the contrary, I would say that it is the substantial framework of what we have proposed so far and are proposing today. So I would like to express my thanks to the First Vice-President for his introduction.  I have repeatedly underlined that the Schengen framework is part of the solution to the current crisis. In recent months we have seen that sometimes the burden on the national border guard system of the frontline Member States has proved impossible for them to cope with. It is therefore important that the European Union can step in quickly to effectively support them.  That is precisely what we are doing today with our proposal. Now some elements of this proposal: we reinforce the obligations of cooperation and information sharing between the Agency and national authorities; we set up a monitoring and risk—analysis centre, which will go hand in hand with reliable and up—to—date risk analysis, including on relevant internal security threats.  Recent experience shows that the liaison officers can enhance dialogue and good cooperation between the Agency and the national authorities. Liaison should therefore be seconded by the Agency to specific Member States determined on the basis of risk analysis.  By also assessing the resources and equipment of the Member States, as well as their contingency planning, the Agency will determine whether they are well prepared to meet potential challenges and identify existing weaknesses. The Agency will be empowered to require Member States to take corrective measures. The decisions of the Agency will be binding upon the Member States.  The most important element of the new Agency is that it goes beyond what Frontex was able to do. But we do not replace Member States’ responsibilities and definitely not their sovereignty. Basically, where deficiencies persist and national action is not taken, the Commission – in cooperation with the Member States – will be able to adopt a decision determining that the situation at a particular section of the external borders requires urgent action and entrusting the Agency with the task of carrying out appropriate operational measures. The Executive Director will then have to submit an operational plan and will have to draw it up with the Member States within two working days. The Member State will have to facilitate the execution of the measures set out in the operational plan agreed with the Executive Director.  Let me emphasise here the strong preventive part of the regulation and the much stronger support it will provide to all Member States with external borders. The ultimate objective is that, through stronger preventive actions, we can precisely avoid emergency situations where such interventions would be necessary.  The management of the European borders will become a European responsibility in the true sense. For this, we also foresee adequate resources.  Currently, contributions of assets and expertise to Frontex are provided on a voluntary basis. For example, in the case of Greece, Frontex asked Member States to supply 743 guest officers, but only 447 have been provided so far. In the future, the Agency will have at its disposal a sufficient number of well-trained experts with the appropriate profiles, as well as the relevant technical equipment, through a standing corps.  As set out in the European Union’s action plan on return, the Agency should be able to initiate return operations and to assist Member States with the acquisition of travel documents. For these purposes, a dedicated return office will be created within the structure of the Agency. It will play a key role in return interventions.  European return intervention teams, composed of escorts and return specialists, will be able to be deployed to Member States subject to particular pressure on their return system. In urgent situations, rapid European return intervention teams could be deployed, either upon the request of a Member State, or at the Agency’s own initiative. Alongside this, we are proposing to establish a new European travel document for the return of third-country nationals that should be promoted in the context of readmission agreements. This should ensure a wider acceptance by third countries.  Since we are creating a stronger agency, it is equally important to have an adequate complaint mechanism in case a person considers that his or her fundamental rights have been violated in the course of operational engagements by the Agency. Both Parliament and the European Ombudsman have stressed the importance of such a mechanism. I refer here to the reports by Ms Metsola and Ms Keller, which we discussed, as you will remember, during the last plenary. Yes, this proposal includes sensitive parts. Member States will have to agree to transfer part of their responsibilities in the framework of the treaties, while of course keeping their sovereignty. They will be part of the scheme. Nothing – I repeat nothing – can happen without their cooperation. Our proposal is a European answer to a European issue. It is a proposal which will prevent our freedom of movement in the Schengen area from being put at stake. It is a proposal which proves that the current crisis does not divide us but, on the contrary, is becoming a catalyst for us to move ahead more united, more decided and more resolved. What we are proposing today is precisely what this Parliament has repeatedly asked for: more Europe. As always, I count on your support for this important step forward.

It's not the same to have an open-door house with open doors than to have a house without doors. In the last ten months, one and a half million people have entered the European Union irregularly. On an island of 30,000 inhabitants there have been days that flows of up to 15,000 people have arrived. Schengen is only feasible if external borders are secure. Without shared security there can be no shared trust. There are no countries without borders, as there are no houses without doors. Schengen does not mean that there are no borders, but that there are no borders between us.  Many of those who today are going to ask for a Europe without borders would never buy a house without a door; in fact, everyone who asks for a Europe without a border has a house with a door. If we want to continue without internal borders, we will have to strengthen external borders.  That is why I would like to support the plan proposed by the Commission today, to say that it is right and that it must be developed as soon as possible. Even if I may, let me say, it's about time! We've been waiting for you.  That is why I would like to stress what has been said: Europe's problems are solved with more Europe, whether they are economic problems, whether political problems or, as now, the need to provide a humanitarian response or security problems.  There are no more external borders. There is no longer a Greek border, an Italian border, a Spanish border. There are European borders. All borders are European and the border in Spain, Greece or Italy is also border of Germany, it is also border of France.

Since October, the promised 400 police officers to be deployed by the Union to our country have so far received only about half of them. I say this because I am concerned about how the newly established agency will actually work if it has already encountered resistance from a number of countries.  I agree with you that there is an urgent need to ensure common European border controls, but I must raise some concerns. Firstly, the issue of national sovereignty. What can we expect in the event of rapid intervention by newly established bodies if a country does not agree to it? The new European system will obviously replace FRONTEX, which did not have sufficient powers and capacities to help alleviate the chaos at the Union's external borders. But the additional question is, who will provide funding? It is also essential that the proposal include parliamentary scrutiny, as well as a mechanism to ensure that the functioning of these border authorities is consistent with data protection and with fundamental rights.  I would like to stress once again: I agree that the right response is European, including and especially at the external borders. In recent weeks, a number of European countries have temporarily introduced border controls. If it is to stand, there is a legitimate fear that the Schengen system will fall apart. I therefore support the European Commission in all efforts to stop undermining the foundations of freedom of movement and, ahead of this week's summit, I call on you to continue a series of measures and, above all, to put pressure on European governments to implement them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3692, "date": "2015-12-15.json", "name": "Timothy Kirkhope", "mepid": "4542", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, there are countries in the EU that seem unable to protect their borders. They need to ask for help, and at the moment some are failing to do so. The implications of this are being felt across the entire European Union. Those countries cannot continue to ignore offers of help while at the same time waving through refugees and migrants on to other countries.  Therefore, we certainly need a Frontex agency capable of helping those countries in need. That agency should have resources pooled voluntarily from the Member States so it can be deployed to assist. If a country is both failing to control its borders and refusing to ask for help, then we should offer them a choice: take the help or the rest of the EU will be within its rights to take action for the protection of the EU’s internal borders.  My message to the Commission is this. The EU has rules and too often we see countries flouting those rules with little consequence. The answer from the Commission is to demand more sovereignty, but why do they not enforce the rules we already have in place? Protecting external borders is something I support, but if a country cannot cope and will not ask for help, they should face the consequences. As Alexander Pope said, only fools rush in where angels fear to tread. So, before creating ever more compulsion and more sovereignty-sharing, we must have the courage to enforce what we already have in an effective and meaningful way. No one measure is going to solve the crisis. Whilst I welcome proposals to address the challenges we face at the borders, this must not be allowed to become another piece of legislation – much like the emergency relocation mechanism – which is welcomed with fanfares but which, when implemented, is met by either intransigence or a simple failure to respond.

I am convinced that the proposals do not go far enough and still need to be significantly strengthened. Knowing that there are Member States in the Council that still consider that these proposals go too far is to me quite depressing, to tell the truth.  I sometimes wonder if governments of Member States are living in a parallel universe. How else could they complain constantly about the lack of control of our common borders and then oppose measures to secure exactly this once they have been presented? This to me is utterly absurd.  Through Schengen we have agreed to have one external border of the EU and no internal borders, which means that Greece’s borders with Turkey are as much Swedish borders as are Sweden’s borders with Norway. How Member States can argue that Member States should police their own borders is simply absurd. Imagine the United States with fifty sets of coastguards and border guards, where the US Coast Guard does not have the right to have its own equipment, but has to ask if it may kindly borrow that of the state for a while. This is an absurdity, and yet in Europe it is upheld by governments of Member States as the only logical solution. Anyone who suggests that maybe a common border needs common border protection is portrayed as some kind of crazy federalist.

Not a word about the very people on the run or how this border control is linked to our international commitments to provide protection to people on the run or how Europe should assume its responsibilities.  Colleagues, the EU is not hanging on Schengen or whether or not we should show id cards. Europe's legitimacy depends on whether we can take responsibility for accepting people fleeing, and that is why the legitimacy of the European Union is now hanging by a thread.  When it becomes difficult, when some countries are bored, what do you do? Then you fall back on the only common denominator; apparently we're going to close the borders. We have no legal means, we have no shared responsibility, border control and terrorism are confused and refugees are defined as risks.  Common border controls should be had if we can at the same time agree on how to receive people on the run together.

Still, some colleagues already seem to be agreeing with it, and that is very nice obviously for them and the Commission. However, I would really like to see the proposals first and I have a couple of questions still.  It is very nice, Commissioner Avramopoulos, that you say the complaint mechanism will be included. I am very happy about that, but other issues that have been presented leave me with a bit more doubt. Especially, Mr Timmermans, you have been saying that the problem that we have is all the irregular entries into the European Union, but we all know that those people who entered irregularly have been finding asylum here, and have been granted protection. Those are people that we do not want to push away at the borders, I believe. So how exactly does this fit together with the proposal the Commission is making? Do you not think, Commissioner Avramopoulos, that a better answer to irregular entries would be to give refugees the possibility to enter regularly, legally and safely; then you could also have all your security checks at the external borders. Unfortunately, I do not see a proposal on that; maybe I am missing something. Neither have I heard any proposal on what you are proposing to do with Member States who are refusing to receive refugees, which seems to be more of an issue right now. I am not sure how you are going to address that issue. The proposal that you are making today does not really seem to be addressing the issues I think are most at hand.  So I do have a couple of questions. Will you agree that those Frontex mandatory actions will also happen at ports and airports when security fails? Do you agree that it is difficult to force Member States into good cooperation? And how will you solve the issue of jurisdiction? – because Member States are still responsible for whatever happens in their territorial waters.

So the Commission wants to deploy personnel from a new Border and Coast Guard Agency without, as currently required, the consent of the state concerned. Well I do not know how others might feel, but I do not like the idea of forces sent unbidden into a Member State to defend a common European frontier. Now what the European Union Commission obviously wants to do is a little bit more of what it is used to doing, which is to spend more taxpayers’ money, create another European Union institution and expand and extend its power base.  I do hope that European Union Member States’ citizens will see this for what it is, which is ceding border enforcement to an unanswerable, probably armed, but also unaccountable European Union body.

In other words, it is the right to interfere with globalists, the act of intervening with foreign forces on the territory of a State that has not asked for anything, or even opposed it, supposedly for its own good. Worse, to trigger this intervention decided by the Commission's bureaucrats alone, government approval would not even be required; they could only oppose it by painfully bringing together a strengthened majority. This rule, known as reverse qualified majority voting, is an additional scandal.  Schengen suffers from an original defect: it was negotiated in secret. French parliamentarians only discovered its existence by chance, by the publication of a decree in the middle of August 1986, six months after it came into force. Schengen allows uncontrolled movement between European countries - this is basically the cause of the problem - a call for air, and these replenishments will not change that.

If we, as 28 Member States, want to belong to each other, then it is not acceptable that if a problem arises in one country and we actually have freedom of movement within the European Union, then on the one hand we cannot help one country sufficiently, because the resources are not enough, because coordination is not enough, or because a Member State simply does not want to. We must then find solutions to this, rather than putting the entire Schengen area at risk. I think that this proposal, for the first time, provides a substantive response to this, in which it is really worth thinking about intensively and building it up for the future. I also think it is very positive that in future we will have a preventive system for the early monitoring of migration movements, that the Agency should also play a supervisory role by monitoring the extent to which we have particular vulnerability at our borders or within our Member States in the area of security, and also that we can intervene directly when it is absolutely necessary to have our own technical equipment. , that there should also be a role in the coordination of proper repatriation, that, even if we have rejected asylum seekers, we have a common coordinated approach here and that not a single Member State should do so for the remaining 28.

In crisis situations, they should also take action, if necessary, without the consent of the Member State concerned. The legal basis must be clarified: what exactly would be the tasks and powers of officials, what rules apply to their actions and how coordination with national authorities takes place.

In addition to the current poor use of European information systems, it is worth remembering the tough debates we had about law enforcement access to Eurodac – and now Frontex. Strengthening European border management must not be the cover for European isolation. We must therefore strengthen the fundamental rights dimension of border management. A complaint mechanism for human rights violations and a strong role for the Agency in maritime rescue are the right elements.

It must therefore be ensured that the vital interests of the Member States in protecting its territorial integrity, as well as the fundamental rights of people, are respected. The Commission proposes to assign an enhanced role to this new European College in terms of cooperation between Member States and their non-Union neighbouring countries, including joint ventures on the territory of either those States or the Member States of the Union.  Very close attention is needed here so that the powers and action of the European Border Guard Corps are in line with the requirements of Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union on respect for the principles of international law. This applies in particular to cooperation with the authorities of third States outside the Union, which in practice show a lack of respect for international law. Moreover, when it comes to maritime borders, it is clear that the ultimate good is the protection of life, in accordance with the announcements in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union on respect for human rights. Therefore, control of the Union's external borders must be carried out in such a way that the tragedies of the mass drownings we have seen in recent years in the Mediterranean stop and continue to increase.

We have not seen the detail in writing, but if we do not have credibility on the ‘hot spots’ and reception centres – and Commissioner, you have admitted this and said it clearly – then there is no holistic and comprehensive approach to this.  So when colleagues call for an external border force, they must also call for a comprehensive view of this. Frontex, to me, is not yet institutionally ready for this big task, but we still have to protect the external border.

Border guarding, especially for Greece, is a vital issue because of its proximity to Turkey but also Skopje and Albania, countries that have expressed doubts about our territorial integrity. Greece has no land border with Schengen countries. And yet, under the pretext of dealing with refugee flows, the European Border and Coast Guard now acquires the right to self-willing and autonomous action at the Greek border, even in the event of disagreement by the Greek government.

Firstly, why the need for a new agency? Mr Avramopoulos, I would like you to give me an answer, why a new agency and not to strengthen, to use Frontex, the agency that already exists?

I am resolutely opposed to the project she is proposing to us today. The EU has already taken control of their internal borders from states; it now wants to effectively take control of their external borders by giving an agency - super Frontex - the right to control them for them.

The number of refugees is increasing, Greece is being turned into a warehouse of impoverished people, fences are being erected in one country after another, border guarding is being passed on to The European Union without even the agreement of the Member States. For Greece, this means promoting co-management of the Aegean Sea with Turkey and challenging its sovereign rights under the seal of the European Union and NATO, amid competition and haggling between the urban classes and monopolistic groups. The European Union's smart borders are blinking to ensure hard work in the capital, to put downward pressure on all wages, to throw away all that is left over.

And it does so in a less complicated way than the full Community integration of border control would entail.  I support the effort of the capabilities and the role of the Frontex Agency until now, because only by better managing our external borders will we be able to guarantee more and better the freedom of internal transit. Cooperation and coordination with third States and agencies, the development of information systems or risk analyses are necessary, but, above all, rapid and urgent relief is important for those Member States suffering crises that pose a danger to effective border control.  I therefore support the subsidiary Community intervention mechanism and call on States not to see it as a limitation, but as a guarantee. I reiterate my commitment to those who come to Europe seeking asylum, but in the same way we must ensure the return with dignity of those who do not have the right to reside legally in our territory. The competencies in this field are articulated through the different return equipment.

Having said that, sincerely, how are you going to share this option with the various Member States who complain about the porousness of borders, but at the same time refuse to work together?  Secondly, you are telling us that better border management must require strengthening the Frontex agency. Why not, to the limit? But having said that, what will be the exact outlines of Frontex Plus? Are we finally going to put an end to the hidden-hidden game of responsibilities that states and the agency are engaged in? Will the respective responsibilities be clearly defined, or will Frontex Plus remain the wrong practical instrument of the Member States? I will not go any further on this package of proposals, and I will focus on a few more general observations. Whether it is the fight against terrorism or migration policies, the current context calls for ever more reactions. Summits are multiplying, ministers are writing, the Commission is making announcements. But shouldn't we, paradoxically, take a step back? This accumulation of proposals risks losing sight of the importance of achieving a comprehensive, coordinated and intelligible policy.  I will mention two examples here. First of all, when I hear that, in order to compensate for the lack of implementation of the emergency relocation mechanisms, some of the responsibilities are being sought through the resettlement mechanism from Turkey, I can only remain dubious about the general direction and legibility.

The EU's response leads to the abandonment of national sovereignty rights. It would be better to call on the participating States to enforce the Schengen Agreement. States such as Greece that fail to make it have the opportunity to ask the EU for help.  We are happy to strengthen the new Frontex mandate to this end. We should release those who do not make it on their own and who forgo EU aid. The Schengen borders must then be shifted further inwards.

I am not only talking about the border crossers who come to work in Luxembourg or Switzerland, or who cross the Swedish river every day to Denmark and vice versa, but also the millions of Europeans who take advantage every day of this opportunity and an entire economic system that operates on the basis of just in time deliveries and all that is attached to it; let us abolish it and we will struggle to regain a tiny bit of much-needed growth on this continent.

We can maintain an area without internal borders as long as external border protection is in place. This conviction guided the decision of the Visegrad Four when they recommitted themselves to the protection of the external borders under the name friends of Schengen.

But because I think immigration policy, as my colleagues from Moraes to the others have said, is one, it's comprehensive. And so, or you do it all together, but if you do only one part, it risks exploding contradictions, it is a policy that concerns security, control of those who enter Europe, certainty, knowledge of those who enter, but also reception, relocation, otherwise it happens that these contradictions pay a country, perhaps the one that has done the most , and not the others.

And so I want an answer to the question in your closing address, what can we do to speed up the entry of Croatia and these other countries into the Schengen area?

This proposal is important for maintaining Schengen, which is one of the pillars of the European Union.

It goes without saying that this system cannot be put in place without the Member States giving up part of their sovereignty.

I can tell you that I took note of what was said, but let me first say this: what we have presented here today is not about entirely closing or opening borders, because neither is realistic. So on the points you have made, the question of not going far enough, today you must all admit that it is a very important step forward. This is a gradual process as Europe moves forward. Some of you referred to the fact that rules need to be better enforced. I fully agree with you – be it the Schengen border code or asylum legislation, this Commission, I can tell you, does its job in fully enforcing EU law. We are launching infringement proceedings wherever it is necessary, but sometimes rules also need to be adapted to a new reality. That does not mean, as I said during my introductory remarks, that we substitute Member States’ responsibilities. I want to be clear on that. We do not touch Member States’ sovereignty.  What we have presented today has a strong preventive and supportive role to all Member States with external borders. The next pressure might be in a totally different part of Europe’s borders, so we must be well prepared. I think that you share with me the point of view that when the very first migratory refugee flows approached the European borders we were all caught by surprise – Member States and the European Union. The European Union did not have a migration policy, it was something fragmented, scattered around within the Commission, but now thanks to your support we have adopted the European Agenda on Migration and have taken many other decisions together: the relocation and resettlement scheme and the action plan against smugglers.  So we have made a step forward, but today we are moving ahead in a bold way. Let us be realistic and honest. The current crisis shows one thing, which is that no Member State can manage this complex situation alone and our solidarity measures have not brought the necessary support either. This is why this agency’s staffing capacities and budget will be considerably reinforced.  Let me also be clear about protection – some of you raised the point, including Ms Keller – and say that we are not creating a fortress Europe. The rights of people seeking international protection will never be put into question. We have a responsibility to offer protection to those in need and we will continue to do so.  That is why it is so crucial to see this proposal as part of a comprehensive strategy which started, as I said before, with the adoption of the European Agenda on Migration, continued with many other initiatives – the implementation measures such as relocation mechanisms and the hotspots – and will be continued with measures allowing resettlement and legal migration. That implementation and relocation mechanism remains a priority for us although it has not worked properly so far, for reasons you know as well as I do. All Member States must be part of the relocation scheme, and I would ask you to put pressure on your countries to do more, because if they all respond you will see spectacularly altered results on this.  That is also why we have presented a recommendation for humanitarian admission for Turkey, to offer legal and safe ways for people seeking protection to come to Europe. Je voudrais m'adresser à M. Deprez. Je suis vraiment honoré de votre soutien à cette proposition, soyez sûr que nous sommes conscients de votre initiative qui date déjà de quelques années. Vous avez également raison lorsque vous dites que, si cette agence avait existé aujourd'hui, nous aurions pu éviter que la pression migratoire ne se transforme en crise; tel est l'objectif pour l'avenir.  En ce qui concerne ce que vous venez de dire, Monsieur Engel, vous avez utilisé le terme approprié: notre proposition est avant tout logique. C'est la conséquence logique du fait que nous avons des frontières communes européennes et que notre première préoccupation est de préserver la libre circulation de nos citoyens, avec tous ses bienfaits, dans la zone Schengen.  Puisque certains députés m'ont posé quelques questions en grec, permettez-moi de leur répondre dans la même langue. Mr President, the MEPs who have raised the questions before are first and for all experienced lawyers and experienced politicians. I believe they will agree with me that nothing, but absolutely nothing, can happen in a Member State without its consent. No one can force him to cooperate with a third country if he does not wish to do so. This is clear from the legislative proposal we have put forward. The sovereignty of the Member States is not affected.  They will also agree with me that without genuine solidarity no Member State alone can cope with the challenges, let alone the greatest challenges that are certain to arise in the future. They will also agree, I hope, that it was time for something to finally change.  As far as Greece is concerned, the Agency we will set up in the future will substantially strengthen its capacity to prevent crises like today's and to manage its borders which are also legally identical to those of the European ones. There are two main objectives: to strengthen the Member States on the so-called 'front line' and, of course, to ensure the principle of free movement, for all citizens without exception, within the limits of the Schengen area. I want to make it clear that we do not have others guarding the Greek border, because the Greek borders are also European. Consequently, a European Agency, part of which, of course, Greece is, will strengthen the protection of the country's external borders and help to better organise migration flows, which will not stop. Let us not be naïve, nor over-optimistic. I believe that in the future they will increase. That is why we must, overall, be better organised. The conditions for the Agency's participation in each country presuppose the existence of an agreement between the country and the Agency. I think we all have to benefit from such a development, and in particular those countries that have the problem because of both their geographical and geopolitical positions. This initiative we have taken is on the basis of even more Europe and aims at greater security for Europe and a more effective functioning of our entire strategy and policy for managing refugee and migration flows.  I believe that, overall, Parliament, as it has done so far, will help us and support us. I would like to stress that nothing could have been achieved by our collective effort to deal with this situation in recent times if the European Parliament had not shown sensitivity, taken initiatives and consciously supported European vision policies.

Separately, a large proportion of immigrants coming to the EU are not registered by the border services of member states, who miss them freely to cross the border and leave the country.

The introduction of systematic controls on all European citizens crossing the external Schengen and European borders is of paramount importance.

This also means member states exchanging information on time and sharing it through these systems, something that has unfortunately not been done until recently.

It must have real instruments of action, which needs to be expanded by at least 2 000 people and equipped with its own specialised equipment, such as observation aircraft, vehicles, equipment for identifying persons.

Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, Commissioner, let me first apologise to the Luxembourg Environment Minister, Mrs Dieschbourg, who would have liked to be with you, but who is already in Brussels for the preparation of tomorrow's Environment Council. Ladies and gentlemen, even three days after the end of COP 21, which I had the chance to attend, together with our Minister of the Environment, I find it difficult to fully realize the miracle of Paris. I think you agree with me that this agreement is indeed a historic achievement. This is the first time that we have adopted a universal climate agreement that contains the architecture necessary to keep global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius and in which all the countries of the world are committed to doing their part. Such an agreement is the result of a political determination hitherto unmatched to tackle the challenge of climate change. I would like to welcome here the exceptional commitment of the French Presidency of the Conference of the Parties. Throughout the year, it has pushed the Climate Agenda in all for a, and it is with great patience, impeccable impartiality and great control of the situation during the COP that it has managed to present an agreement which not only gathers consensus, but is, moreover, ambitious, sustainable, dynamic and legally binding. Of course, the French Presidency was able to carry out its work thanks to the willingness of the parties to move forward. The European Union and its Member States have always led the way in adopting and defending an ambitious position. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the European Parliament for its own commitment and support in this area, calling for an ambitious agreement to phase out global CO2 emissions by 2050 or shortly thereafter. Other major emitters, such as China, India and the United States, have also shown a great willingness to bring the agreement to fruition, as have, of course, countless non-governmental actors, such as the cities and municipalities of part of the economic world and, of course, NGOs. I must also highlight the performance of the European Union in Paris. We spoke with one voice, from start to finish, and this has made us an indispensable partner in the negotiations. Several central features of the agreement, such as the ambition mechanism, have been developed from concepts put forward by the European Union. Our influence has been real because we have been able to forge new alliances, such as the one behind the High Coalition Ambition, because we have been able to present compromise solutions linking sometimes very divergent positions. Although the agreement is still very recent and further analysis needs to be developed, I would like to briefly communicate the key points. First, it was decided in Paris that global warming should be kept well below 2 degrees and that efforts should be made to limit it to 1.5 degrees. The Paris Agreement specifies that this implies that peak emissions must occur as quickly as possible and that climate neutrality must be achieved in the second half of this century.  Secondly, the Paris Agreement specifies that national emission reduction contributions - the INDCs - will be at the heart of this agreement. All parties will have to highlight their contributions, the vast majority have already done so, and they will have to maintain it by raising it every 5 years. Thirdly, the Paris Agreement contains elements of solidarity that are very important for developing countries, and especially for the poorest and most vulnerable among them, on adaptation, loss and damage, capacity building and, of course, also financing. On financing, we are committed as developed countries to establish a concrete roadmap to reach $100 billion by 2020. In addition, a new, more ambitious target must be set by 2025 at the latest.  Finally, agreement was reached in Paris on a transparency framework that will create the necessary confidence that all countries will live up to their commitments. The Paris agreement, as you can see, is therefore taking a big step forward. This is indeed the first global climate agreement, sending a very strong signal to all non-governmental actors, be they local authorities, businesses or civil society, which I welcome the growing commitment to - a signal that this transformation to a low-emissions economy is becoming a necessity Must. But let us not forget that the Paris Agreement is only a framework that has yet to be defined and clarified on several points. So there is still a lot of work to be done. That is the task we will have to tackle in the coming months and years, when the agreement comes into force in 2020.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3770, "date": "2015-12-15.json", "name": "Miguel Arias Cañete", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, this is a historic moment. Thanks, to a great extent, to the efforts of the European Union, the world has its first ever universal, legally binding global climate deal. This is a new chapter in global climate governance as we move from action by few to action by all. The Paris Agreement is important on many levels: first of all, in order to be efficient in our fight against climate change. But more generally, the deal reached over the weekend is a major win for the whole international community. It shows that multilateralism can still work when faced with a truly global challenge. This is a vital lesson for the years ahead of us.  Europe has gone through turbulent times over the last few years. Today, let me assure you of one thing: we should all be proud of Europe. Paris is the culmination of Europe’s efforts for a global agreement on climate change. After many years of relentless efforts, we got a deal. And not just any deal: the Paris Agreement is ambitious and balanced, and it includes our key objectives. I would like to thank the Members of the European Parliament delegation to COP21 – led by delegation Chair Giovanni La Via and Vice-Chair Matthias Groote – for their invaluable support throughout the Conference. I must also pay tribute to the French Presidency of COP21, and the remarkable way in which they managed a very delicate and challenging process. The cooperation between Member States, ministers, the European Parliament delegation and my fellow Commissioners was excellent throughout the negotiations. The European Union spoke always with a single voice under the excellent steering of the Luxembourg Presidency. When we do so, we succeed. We were instrumental as ambitious bridge builders, and we were instrumental in building a broad coalition of developed and developing countries in favour of high ambition – the High Ambition Coalition – which was critical in securing the global deal. All of a sudden, the debate was not about developed versus developing, as it was in Copenhagen. It was about the willing versus the unwilling. The result in Paris will decisively accelerate the transition from fossil to clean fuels. This trend is now irreversible. When I came to this House last October on the occasion of the debate on the Pargneaux report, I made it clear that Paris had to deliver an ambitious, robust and legally binding global agreement which puts the world on track to limit global warming to below 2°C. I set out then my three ‘essentials’ for a successful outcome: first, a long-term goal; second, a robust review cycle with the flexibility to strengthen ambition over time; and third, strong transparency and accountability rules. After two weeks of intense and sometimes exhausting negotiations, the Paris Agreement delivers on all these key essentials.  For the first time ever in a legal agreement, we reaffirmed our long-term goal to prevent the adverse effects of climate change. Governments agreed to the goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to ‘well below’ 2°C above pre-industrial levels. The Commission also welcomes the recognition in the agreement of the need to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C, a point which was crucial for many of our partners in our progressive alliance. The qualitative long-term goal aims for emissions to peak as soon as possible, with rapid reductions thereafter, towards achieving a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removal by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of the century. The direction of travel has been set. The agreement sends a clear signal to investors, businesses and policy makers that the global transition to clean energy is here to stay. As I said during the Conference, you can have the best long-term target in the world, but without a robust revision mechanism raising the level of ambition over time, you will never achieve it. That is why the European Union has always insisted on a five-year review cycle. In Paris, we agreed to come back every five years, to take stock, to look at the latest science, and to ramp up our commitments accordingly. We also fought hard for strong transparency and accountability rules. We know these are the foundations of a credible international regime. Without multilaterally agreed rules, there will be no trust or confidence that countries will deliver on their commitments. Under the Paris Agreement, countries have a legally binding obligation to pursue domestic mitigation measures with a view to achieving their contributions.  An enhanced transparency and accountability system is also set up, including the submission by all countries, every two years, of greenhouse gas inventories, an expert review and a facilitative, multilateral consideration of progress. These elements fully correspond with the European Union’s priorities and ensure a fit-for-purpose transparency and accountability framework for emission reduction commitments. The European Parliament has consistently recognised climate finance as a key issue in these negotiations. I am proud that the Paris Agreement includes a solidarity package which contains provisions on climate finance and on addressing needs linked to adaptation and to loss and damage. Developed countries will continue with their collective mobilisation goal of USD 100 billion per year until 2025, when a new collective goal will be set. Under all circumstances, the European Union is committed to enhancing its level of support. Other countries are encouraged to provide financial support. So, in addition to all countries taking on commitments to reduce emissions, there is also no longer a strict division between developed and developing countries with regard to the provision of public finance.  We must recognise this historic moment. But the hard work has just begun. Today we may celebrate. Tomorrow we must act. In early 2016, the Commission will work on implementing the Paris Agreement in the European Union, and I look forward to working with the European Parliament on this. The Commission will also continue its work to implement the 2030 climate and energy framework. Following this summer’s legislative proposal for the revision of the European Union Emissions Trading System for the post-2020 period, the next step is to address the sectors not covered by the ETS. The Commission will also make legislative proposals on Effort-Sharing, Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF). We will also bring forward a Communication on Decarbonising the Transport Sector. Also, our upcoming energy proposals – for renewables, market design and energy efficiency – will play an important role in making the energy market cleaner and more efficient.  Our wider climate diplomacy efforts will not stop. We will embark on further discussions and negotiations with our international partners on the detailed aspects of the Paris Agreement. It is crucial to build on the momentum of this historic agreement through our continued cooperation with stakeholders and with other countries on the implementation of INDCs, including capacity building for monitoring and reporting. When we meet again in Morocco, in a year’s time, we should all be able to report tangible progress. This is what the world expects from us. Dear Members, Paris is also a success for this Parliament.

I would like to thank Commissioner Arias Cañete and Minister Carole Dieschbourg for their work and commitment during the negotiations. Their presence, together with that of our colleagues in the European Parliament in the delegation that I was honoured to be able to chair, led us to the important result achieved thanks to the ambitious leadership of the European Union.  This is an historic agreement, because for the first time all the COP Member States have admitted that there is a global problem which had to be resolved as a whole by all, with shared sacrifices and certainly with a view to a better world. The agreement seemed almost impossible and I believe that it represents the best possible balance between the different needs of developed and developing countries, creating an ambitious path, destined to last until the end of the century with five-year reviews.  It is also an historic moment because the agreement was made in Paris, in Europe, in the same city mortally wounded a few days earlier by deadly attacks. Today, as President Fabius also mentioned, this agreement serves great causes, in addition to the environmental one.

It is the end of the year and I am not exaggerating when I say that 2015 was a terrible year; if you consider the war in the Middle East, the refugee crisis and the euro crisis. But what happened in Paris last week is a real game-changer, and very important, because it will give us reason to be optimistic for the future and that is what we need. It is very important. Paris, the city of light, is now also the city of hope. That is very good.  The most positive outcome of Paris is the fact that nearly all states – and all states means also developing countries and emerging economies – are committing themselves to the necessary efforts to tackle climate change. In that sense, this is the first universal climate agreement that we have. We can all be proud of that. The level of ambition shown in Paris, and the agreement on it, cannot be underestimated. We not only have the overall aim of holding global average temperatures steady, we need the 2°C target, and much more ambitious objectives as well. But the agreement is to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C, and that means that we around the world and in the EU need to ramp up our efforts. Because with the building blocks of the intended nationally determined contributions we will not build the climate-proof house we want, so extra effort will be necessary. Therefore I ask the Commissioner not to wait too long, and I propose continuing our work within the high-ambition coalition which you formed, Commissioner, in the run-up to Paris and which contributed to a large extent to the success in the COP21. We must present, together with our partners in the high-ambition coalition, timely, ambitious pledges, and that means more ambitious pledges in the EU. We have to prepare for that.

Let me begin by paying a tribute to Giovanni La Via, who led the European Parliament delegation. There is a particular proverb I think is appropriate here: ‘Between saying and doing, many a pair of shoes is worn out’. I’m sure that sounds better in Italian, but nonetheless it perhaps sums up the challenges which we face. A tribute to Laurent Fabius is also required, and the proverb there would be: ‘The first step binds one in the second step’ – we have to recognise what that will mean for us. But my greatest praise I leave again to Commissioner Arias Cañete, who has again been the centrepiece of the high ambition coalition. Yesterday I described him as rather like a Santa Claus character bringing gifts back from Paris; I will note that some of them are ticking, and I think that is perhaps the challenge which we here in this Chamber face, because so many of our targets – the 2020 and 2030 targets – are predicated upon a 2°C limit, and the ambition now within this wider Paris accord is greater than that. I think we need to recognise what that will mean for us all, both in this Chamber and beyond.  I am the UK Conservative spokesperson on energy, so I speak only for the Conservatives in this particular debate – I wish not to speak for the rest of my Group. I think it is important to stress that we need to understand what this will mean for all that we are going to try and achieve, going forward. Will we need again to revisit any of the EU’s climate and energy package? That must be answered. We also have to recognise what this might mean for the emissions trading scheme – perhaps not in this first phase 4 revision – but beyond that. We also need to know whether the 1.5°C target will appear as an operational or aspirational component of future legislation. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, what impact assessment is being conducted? – so that we understand the full implications of what this will mean for all that we here in this Chamber must commit to and must do in the future.

It is legally binding, in so far as international agreements can be. It has a strong long-term ambition of 2°C, but it actually mentions 1.5°C, not forgetting the five—year review mechanism and the strengthening action that comes with it. It is an irreversible step towards a low—carbon economy and – even more importantly – it is a huge signal to the financial world that only zero-carbon solutions will pay off. That is truly important.  Let me also congratulate both Minister Dieschbourg, through Mr Gira, and Commissioner Arias Cañete for their important role in Paris. The EU truly built a bridge between the developing world and the developed world, and that showed in the end. However, to draw attention to one negative point as well, I believe that Europe unnecessarily endangered the outcome by again being too reluctant on committing to financial donations. Again it showed how important it is that we have our own financial mechanisms through which donations from Europe do not depend on the mood of our Ministers of Finance. It is true that Paris is just paper. The real work starts today. The most important thing is that all 195 countries that are going to sign the agreement implement their national plans, and we have to monitor that implementation. This applies to the EU as well. Therefore my final question is what does Paris mean for the EU’s own policies in the future? I urge the Commission very rapidly to analyse the Paris outcome and to see what it means for our 2020 objectives, our 2030 objectives, and even what it means for 2050 because what we do know is that the figure of 1.5°C is linked to the upper limits of our 2050 target of 95%, and that has to be translated into all other policies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3775, "date": "2015-12-15.json", "name": "Anne-Marie Mineur", "mepid": "125037", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. – Last Saturday, the Paris climate agreement was adopted by consensus. The French Presidency deserves to be congratulated on this. Never before have 195 countries pledged to work on climate change. And the approach, that the countries themselves decide what contribution they can make, the INDC, is certainly helped. The treaty mentions \"2° and the aim of 1.5°\".  That's a good start, but let's not tell ourselves we're already there. I would remind you that we are already on a temperature rise of almost 1° Celsius. The Philippines is currently dealing with a hurricane. Small islands are worried about their survival. Mr President, I welcome this agreement, let it be clear. But I also think the fossil fuel industry lobbyists are getting a big Christmas bonus because of this climate agreement.  The agreement is not really binding and the rudder is not going to change. The fossil fuel industry can continue to make a profit from oil. We're not going to stop producing carbon, we're going to capture it and store it. Air and shipping are not included in this Convention. It is business as usual with all the risks that entails. And the lack of a compensation scheme for developing countries is also a missed opportunity and a disgrace to the Western world. This will continue to evade our historical responsibility.  This agreement should be a starting point for further action, not an endpoint. More ambition is needed. We must move definitively away from fossil fuels and towards alternative, sustainable energy sources. We need to be more sensible and economical with our energy. Isolating homes would be a good start, which also provides a lot of work. It is therefore a great pity that Commissioner Cañete has already said that he does not want to increase the targets for 2020. I call on the Commissioner to get on with it now, now that the momentum is there and everyone feels that something has been achieved. Don't listen too much to your friends in the oil industry.

Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Luxembourg's representative, we must of course welcome this agreement reached in Paris. This is excellent news, and we must congratulate - this has already been done - the French Presidency which has, I believe, invented a new form of presidency of the COP, managing both to have no declared opponents in a COP and to put itself at the centre of the game to create the right balance in Paris. We should also congratulate the European Union, the Commission, the Council, Minister Dieschbourg and Commissioner Arias Caete, particularly on the alliance games, which also facilitated this negotiation.  We now have a finish line, very clearly below 2 degrees, trying to get closer to a maximum of 1.5 degrees. For us, the conclusion is clear: we have to get out of carbon, we have to get out of fossil fuels, and we have to do it very quickly if we really want to get closer to 1.5 degrees.  It wasn't all good news in Paris. We have lost on the issue of shipping and international air transport. Having sectors that are completely beyond climate responsibility is also a failure of the Paris negotiations. The failure, under pressure from oil-rich countries, to include decarbonisation, the entry of fossil fuel prices and the price of carbon into the negotiations is also a failure.  What I remember is that, basically, if the path to this 1.5 to 2 degree finish line of warming is blurred, there are some extremely interesting tools, including this revision every 5 years - already hoping for a revision or, at least, a start of revision in 2018 - because it is a reflection of a new governance of climate policies. Indeed, civil society, companies that have understood the issue of climate and local authorities, which are often ahead of the states, will regularly be actors in new climate policies. I think this is really the good news of this negotiation: democratic public debates will be held regularly on climate policies and it will be up to us to rise to the challenge every time, to move from this moment of climate irresponsibility in which we are, with 3-degree commitments, to this responsibility at 1.5.  But it also implies a responsibility for the European Union: it is not the status quo, it is not a return to business as usual; 30% reduction in our emissions in 2020, Commissioner, that must be your goal. Revising the climate-energy package - as the European Parliament has again called for - with regard to emissions, efficiency and renewable energy is your programme.

The truth is probably in the middle as usual and in any case it is a historic agreement if only because we have sat around a table 195 different countries that have recognized a problem and have found the commitment and effort to try to solve it. We have set a goal that is to be well below 2 degrees of temperature, aiming if possible even at 1.5 degrees. We were happy with this goal and hailed it as a very ambitious target especially considering that the current INDCs take us to 2.7 degrees, so we really have a lot of work to do.

The reality is not really that, because the Paris agreement is not binding, and it boils down to declarations of intent that will prove insufficient to limit global warming, if it is still containable.  Indeed, it is not by declarations of intent that events are weighed, but by clear acts, respectful of the sovereignty of States, as well as their need to pursue their economic development. Limiting itself to poisoning the daily lives of millions of our compatriots, a certain form of punitive ecology has failed to meet the immense challenges facing our planet and our continent, and for good reason: what the European Union gives with one hand, it takes up with the other.  COP 21 and the EU now want to reduce carbon emissions, but the EU continues to advocate totally unbridled free trade by refusing, among other things, to implement a Community preference that would encourage the relocation of our production resources and thus avoid importing consumer products tens of thousands of kilometres. However, fewer kilometres travelled for a commodity is, of course, less greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. COP 21 and the Union also want to preserve biodiversity and encourage responsible agriculture, but at the same time the Union validates the transatlantic treaty, which will have the effect of importing into Europe products that do not meet any of our social or environmental standards, and which put hundreds of small family farms at serious risk of death.

It is unacceptable, at a time when large European states and their companies are part of the problem, to finally manage to get rich in the name of so-called Ecology by supposedly exporting clean technologies to developing countries. Another huge political inadequacy of the agreement is the lack of any reference to climate refugee status. At 166 million, their number is estimated for the period 2008-2013 alone, a figure which, unfortunately, will increase.

I do not intend to resign at this moment, because I have to keep on working to deliver all the legislation needed to fulfil our 40% target. But when we say that Paris is a historic moment, it is not only because we have a binding agreement. I will make some comments on that later on.  We have probably not acknowledged the importance of the 187 INDCs on the table, covering 97% of global emissions. What that shows is an unstoppable movement towards sustainable energy, towards renewables, and towards energy efficiency all over the world. If you examine the INDCs, most of them were renewables, energy efficiency and some forest management. That is a big amount. From the smallest island in the Pacific to the biggest developed country. That is a major change. In that context, we have very clear work to do: sustainable energy and the phasing-out of fossil fuel subsidies. It is very clear that this is what we have to do. We now have to implement the legislation within the European Union. We have a 40% target which is, by a long way, the most ambitious INDC on the table at the moment. You can analyse all of them. Ours is the most ambitious. We also have the right policies, so we have to implement them. Mr Eickhout, a good friend, told me now we have to raise the level of ambition. Firstly, I intend to implement the necessary legislation with ambition. In the impact assessments, we will introduce the 30-35-40% scenarios – for sure.  (Interjection from the floor) Is 35 not better? (Interjection from the floor)  I do not mind, let us go for it. We want to analyse where we are in terms of cost efficiency for reaching ambitious targets.  I am for transparency and ambition, but we should also know what is going to happen. In their decisions, the COP decided to convene a facilitative dialogue among parties in 2018 in order to take stock. I think that date is really important, not only for the stock-taking. On that day, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will provide a special report on the impact of 1.5°C and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways. Then we will have very clear steering from the IPCC Panel in their stock-taking exercise. That date is a crucial date because on that date, the entire world – including the European Union – must decide if they are going to raise the level of ambition.  We have to be prepared for that. So let us make a good impact assessment, let us implement better legislation and let us go to that stock-taking exercise with the necessary ambition. We have many COPs and we try to tell our friends that everybody must raise their level of ambition. But there must also be a level playing field. Some people said it here. We will be the leaders, but we want all the others to go along too. We also want China to be ambitious – not in 2030, but much sooner.  Secondly, the nature of the agreement: some people say this is not a binding agreement. This agreement has all the elements of a binding agreement: the long-term goal, the stock-taking process, and the transparency and accounting rules. The problem with this agreement was with the United States and binding commitments. We spent a whole year discussing them. We have two options: to take strictly binding commitments and the United States – 12% of global emissions – out of the agreement. That is one possibility. The other is to have a universal agreement. The formula that we have is that all parties have a legally binding obligation to prepare, communicate and maintain a mitigation contribution. That is absolutely binding.  Each party must also pursue domestic mitigation missions with the aim of achieving the objectives of the contribution. Combined with robust transparency and accountability provisions, this outcome will provide a solid basis for a fully inclusive regime. It will also address the need for internationally legally binding obligations and provide some flexibility to secure swift United States participation through an executive text. It is not perfect, for sure, but it is quite different from having an agreement without the United States. We need universal agreement. Let me say something about aviation. This was a very hard topic. We have established all kinds of alliances, but we did not find the same level of support in aviation as for these topics, and there was a lot of direct opposition from some parties.  We tried until Saturday in the morning to get aviation inside, but we did not succeed. In an international negotiation, you never get 100%, but I can assure you that we were trying until the last meeting. Nevertheless, even if there is not a reference to these two sectors, it is very clear that the ambitious global target we have – well below 1.5ºC – means that all sectors and all countries have to contribute. It is a certainty that they have to contribute. Now 2016 will be a key year for these two sectors to show leadership, and for the ICAO and IMO to deliver credible outcomes. We will remain very actively involved throughout the year in pressing for a solution in ICAO for a global marketplace. We will do our best, and we will try to win the same alliances and some other different alliances in order to reach this outcome, in  2016.  I take the comments made by Mr Eickhout on this topic very seriously. This is a complex topic, mainly because if you take aviation at the moment, when I say that INDCs cover 97% of emissions, 1.5 is international transport emissions. That is today, because they are rising exponentially. The other sectors are coming down, so the percentage in the future of the maritime and aviation sectors will be enormous, and we will establish clear rules on monitoring, verification and reducing emissions. The activity we do in other sectors will be meaningless. The Commission is very clear on this situation, and we will do our best.  Finally, I commend our local communities and regions. Within the mitigation and adaptation policies, acting at the local level is of the utmost importance. That is why the Covenant of Mayors, with Mayors Adapt, is an initiative the Commission is going to support. We are going to support the model internationally, because this is a history of success. We have to work with regions, communities and support the European model to the rest of the world. Mainly because the urbanisation process is unstoppable across the world, we have to work in the cities. From that, the Commission will be very clear when we design our policies. Thank you for all of your comments and now starts the real work.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, dear Commissioner, thank you first of all for these debates and for the many thanks you have given us as President. I would, of course, like to relay these thanks to Mrs Dieschbourg, who is very much involved in this process. I also thank you for the fact that we can continue to count on the support of most of this great Parliament. I will not answer those who always claim that there is no climate change and, above all, that it is not due to our activities. It is true that we are in a democracy and that, in a democracy, many things can be claimed. We can always say that the Earth is flat, but I think that those who make such remarks cannot demand that they be answered. So let's move on! With regard to what the European Union has managed to pass through paris, it is true that we are also not 100% satisfied, but - I will repeat what many of you have already said - you know better than I do how difficult it is to reach agreements at 28 and you can imagine how much more difficult it is to reach an agreement between 196 parties. I will quote Laurent Fabius, who said: \"If every party comes to Paris to get 100% of what it wants, we will have 0% for everyone\". We would have liked to have included aviation and the maritime sector, and I can confirm what the Commissioner said: we fought to the end, but the opposition was too strong. We also lack a mid-century target for 2050. We would have liked to have had a more concrete figure than the wording in the agreement, but on this point too, the opposition was too great. But I can assure you that Europe has been a very strong partner and that we have put many of our ideas across, without the need to cross our red lines. I can compare: I was in Copenhagen and Lima, and for me, in these two conferences, the European Union was neither visible nor audible. I was ashamed to be a European! But in Paris, believe me, I was proud to be among the Europeans who played a very important role. I agree with all those who have said that, of course, this agreement is not going to solve everything. We agree that an agreement will not change the climate and a treaty will not change the world. It is paper, as some have said. But for the rest, look what's being done. The world is already on the move, there are countries, European countries that are on the move. The conference was not even over as President Hollande himself pledged to the 196 parties that he would increase France's contribution, both in terms of reducing emissions and contributing to climate finance. I have just heard from the German environment minister who said that Germany would accelerate the exit of coal. I am very pleased, as a former mayor of a small municipality in Luxembourg, that the Commission has managed to release EUR 60 million to globalise the Covenant of Mayors. There are millions of people on the march, and in the United States there are cities and states that are on the march, and let us not forget the NGOs that did a great job before Paris and will continue after that. I think the signal that is given to all these players is there; there is a paradigm shift. I do not know if you are familiar with the halma game, which is to place sticks that should not be moved. So what has been the situation of the parties and the states so far? Until now no one wanted to move because everyone thought that the first one who moved would lose. In the future, the opposite will happen, ladies and gentlemen: it is the one who will not move in the area of climate change who will lose. I believe that the European Union has always been very ambitious, that it has led the way for others, and I am sure that with your support, the European Union will not be one of those who will be punished by history because they will come too late. At the end of the discussions, and bearing in mind the atmosphere that prevailed in Paris after Mr Hollande's hammer blow, I would like to quote the representative of St Lucia who, during his contribution at the end of the conference, said: The future looks much better than three weeks ago.'", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3837, "date": "2015-12-15.json", "name": "President. –", "mepid": "28242", "text": "   The debate is closed.

This is an ambitious agreement, especially as regards the commitment and effort to try to keep the temperature increase below 2 degrees compared to the pre-industrial era by aiming, if possible, at as much as 1.5 degrees. What I would like to stress, however, is that this agreement is, as I have already said, only a starting point and that much remains to be done in the coming years, and that is why we need everyone to engage and to share responsibilities more and more on the part of all the actors involved.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3846, "date": "2015-12-15.json", "name": "Der Präsident. –", "mepid": "28242", "text": "   The next item on the agenda is the debate on the report by Anneliese Dodds and Ludak Niedermayer on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, with recommendations to the Commission on making corporate tax policy in the Union more transparent, coordinating and approximating corporate tax policy (2015/2010(INL)) (A8-0349/2015).", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3847, "date": "2015-12-15.json", "name": "Anneliese Dodds", "mepid": "124969", "text": "   rapporteur. – Mr President, aggressive tax avoidance and evasion cost the European Union EUR 1 trillion a year. That is a huge loss for Member States, but it is an even bigger loss for the people who live in the Member States. Their public services have, in many cases, been cut to the bone while the taxes they pay have been hiked. It is also hugely unfair for those small and medium—sized businesses that pay their fair share of tax. How can they compete against giant multinationals which can get their tax bills down to almost nothing? There is a wider impact too – less tangible, but no less important. Scandals like LuxLeaks have severely undermined the public’s trust, not just in the Luxembourg Government but in tax administrations and governments across Europe. I find it impossible to explain to my constituents why giant companies like Facebook can get away with paying less in corporate tax, in a country like the UK, than the average citizen does per year in income tax. The time for hand—wringing is well and truly over. Now we need to take the hard decisions necessary to sort out the corporate tax system. Both the Commission and Member States will have to take action which, in the short term, will almost certainly be challenged by vested interests but, by stopping the vicious cycle of beggar—thy—neighbour policies, they can make their economies more efficient and help rebuild public trust in both tax authorities and governments. As with the Ferreira—Theurer report, this report shows that there is a strong consensus in the House for real hard—hitting action to be taken against tax dodging. That consensus is quite remarkable. It extends across every single political group in this Parliament. Individual MEPs from across this House have submitted amendments that have strengthened the text as, of course, have the shadow rapporteurs whose contribution has been essential. Above all, I want warmly to thank my co—rapporteur, Luděk Niedermayer, for all his incredible hard work and that of his team. Despite the inevitable differences between us, we have managed to create a text that is simultaneously comprehensive, practical and radical. As rapporteurs, we were given the brief of improving transparency, coordination and convergence in corporate tax. To achieve this, we drew on the work of the special committee and our own consultations with a variety of stakeholders, experts and academics. Four key measures stand out from our recommendations on transparency. First, all companies that operate across borders should report where they make their profits and where they pay their taxes. A ‘fair taxpayer’ label should be awarded to companies which engage in good tax practice. EU countries should tell each other when they introduce a new, potentially harmful, tax measure, and there must be much better protection for whistleblowers who report tax dodging. When it comes to coordination, businesses underlined to us time and time again the need for the EU to implement a full Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB). This would not set common tax rates, but would clean up the process of defining taxable assets and activities and greatly simplify tax administration.  Finally, when it comes to convergence we need clearer guidelines on tax—related state aid and a common, objective definition of tax havens. We then need to apply the definition to prevent those companies that use tax havens benefiting from EU funds. The constituency of the UK Prime Minister, for example, that of Witney in his hometown, includes 25 properties registered to tax havens and huge swathes of countryside owned in tax havens, which benefit from Common Agricultural Policy funds. We have to end this farce. To conclude, I hope that, throughout the debate to come and the vote that will follow it, we will see a continuation of our consensus so far, as a parliament, to take timely, targeted and practical measures to end tax dodging.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3848, "date": "2015-12-15.json", "name": "Luděk Niedermayer", "mepid": "124701", "text": "   rapporteur. – Mr President, let me start by saying that it was a great pleasure to work with Anneliese Dodds and with all the other shadow rapporteurs on this fascinating economic and political subject, and on an area in which we can really make things better. Anneliese Dodds talked about the revenues lost by governments. We do not know exactly what they amount to: the estimates start at tens of billions of euros a year, but there may be hundreds of billions. In any case, it is a lot of money. An even more important issue is the fact that a market in which some companies pay taxes and some do not pay is not a fair market. We must address this issue. It is not a static issue: if we do not act, the situation will just get worse, and those who pay taxes, including employees and small businesses, will have to pay more because of the others who do not pay. This is an issue that has undermined the credibility of states and governments. So we must act. We must act decisively but we must act smartly: not everything that can be done should be done. Luckily, there is enough expertise, on which we were able to build our report. I would mention the expertise of the Commission and the OECD, academics, civil society and businesses. Consequently, we have tried to put together the report with well defined, clear recommendations that are feasible and well justified. Let me look at it from a different perspective. The first area I want to mention concerns implementation of the recommendations that were the outcome of the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project. The G20 and the Commission asked the OECD to tackle this issue at global level. The results are well thought-out economic measures which have been endorsed by the governments of many countries. including the G20 and developing countries. There is no excuse for us not to implement these measures briskly. The measures concern, for example, country-by-country reporting, patent boxes, hybrid mismatches and permanent establishment. The second issue I want to highlight is the re-launch of the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base project (CCCTB). The CCCTB project has benefits both for governments, as it will generate more secure revenue collection, and, importantly, for businesses because it will substantially reduce and simplify tax compliance. There is no alternative to CCCTB if we want to tackle the issue. There is no other measure that would be as effective and as efficient at the end of the day. Lastly, let me mention some proposals that are EU specific. We want a Code of Conduct Group to function better. We want, effectively and jointly, to act against tax havens. There is the corporate social responsibility initiative that Anneliese Dodds mentioned and, last but not least, we want to work with regular estimates of the tax gap arising in the area of corporate taxation. I am very pleased that we are on the same wavelength as the Commission because we have in mind the same proposals, and I believe we will be able to convince the governments to go forward. Let me now conclude, first by thanking Anneliese Dodds for her wonderful cooperation, and all the shadow rapporteurs for their input. I look forward to the debate here and, more importantly, I believe we will gain support for the report tomorrow. I hope this is not the end. It is a start, and at the end of the day – though rather sooner than later – we will achieve the improvement that we want.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3849, "date": "2015-12-15.json", "name": "Christos Stylianides", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I am here on behalf of my dear colleague Pierre Moscovici to express the Commission’s positions on this specific subject. Once again, Parliament is making its position on tax transparency very clear. I would particularly like to thank the rapporteurs, but also everyone else who has contributed to the drafting of this excellent report. It is rich in proposals and recommendations that will assist the Commission in moving forward on this subject of common interest. Like you, the Commission wants transparent, fair and modern taxation to become the norm in the European Union. The Commission has already taken firm steps this year to address aggressive tax planning, but we need to advance further and faster. That is why the Commission will, at the beginning of next year, present strong measures to combat tax fraud, tax evasion and aggressive tax planning within the European Union. The package which the Commission will present will be comprehensive. It will include both legislative and non-legislative initiatives. It will address both internal EU aspects and external aspects – it will contain an external strategy towards third countries. It will also include measures stemming not just from the discussions that have taken place in the EU but also internationally. For all these measures, the Commission counts on the active support of this Parliament.  Let me now come back to the main recommendations of the report. First of all, I would like to assure you that the Commission is maintaining the pace on the subject of country-by-country reporting. For us, the best way forward is to complete the impact assessment which is planned for the first quarter of 2016. We will then have the necessary data so as to be able to make appropriate proposals to the co-legislators. The Commission also wants to relaunch and make rapid progress on the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base project (CCCTB). In 2016 we intend to propose a two-step approach so that Member States reach an agreement as soon as possible. As a first step, Member States should agree on a common tax base. The consolidation would follow as a second step. I would like to stress again: the Commission remains fully committed to consolidation, but we want to overcome the current prolonged stalemate. Pending the adoption and implementation of the CCCTB, the measures included in the OECD/G20 BEPS package should be implemented in the EU rapidly and in a coordinated way. What we want to avoid at all costs is a patchwork of 28 national approaches to implementing the BEPS recommendations. A coordinated European approach towards the BEPS package is therefore essential. As regards Parliament’s recommendations on transfer pricing, I would like to stress that the Joint Transfer Pricing Forum of the EU is currently looking into the most coherent and effective implementation within the EU of the OECD guidelines. This debate, as you know, also concerns the Commission’s own internal instruments. I am thinking first of the European Semester. The Commission is, of course, ready to continue to use all the instruments at its disposal to combat tax evasion, including in the framework of the European Semester.  You are also aware of our views on state aid. Firstly, the Commission is willing to provide further guidance in the medium term to Member States and market participants on the application of state aid rules to the tax planning practices of companies. Secondly, however, to do this, the Commission first needs to close a sufficient number of cases so as to be able to assess on that basis what form of guidance would provide the necessary clarity for both Member States and market players. Thirdly, as regards the rules for recovery of state aid, these rules are based on the longstanding jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union.  A fairer distribution of tax revenues amongst Member States is a discussion that goes beyond the issue of state aid. The Commission will participate in this debate of course, bringing all relevant services into the discussion. In this way, dear colleagues, the European Parliament has a crucial role to play in maintaining political pressure and in supporting the action of the Commission in the field of taxation. The Commission, of course, counts on your support in all aspects.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3850, "date": "2015-12-15.json", "name": "Massimiliano Salini", "mepid": "125670", "text": "  Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.

We must ensure that the Member States are no longer on the brakes, but allow newer and better rules, namely rules that lead to truly fair tax competition, which make tax-free allowances for multinationals a thing of the past, which will bring benefits to the EU's internal market and strengthen the competitiveness of the European business sector as a whole, and therefore also globally, and which, in the end, also mean simplification rather than more tax bureaucracy. To this end, we must push ahead with essential legislative projects such as the common consolidated corporate tax base. We naturally respect the fiscal sovereignty of the Member States, but there can be no more hiding behind them, especially when coordination is more achievable for all. The OECD has initiated significant international progress in the fight against tax avoidance and profit shifting.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. We all know that there is a great deal of tax avoidance in the European Union, in its Member States: by multinationals, by a large number of multinationals – not by everyone, but by many. This is detrimental to taxpayers and it is harming the competitors of these multinationals. It is therefore a challenge for legislators in the European Union to counter this. However, it is important that the EU and its institutions act together with the legislators of the Member States. It is important that they do this together. It is also necessary for them to do this together, because the proposals that we have made here, which are to a large extent good and far-making proposals, can only be implemented if we also have the agreement of the Member States to do so. Otherwise, we will not get the Council's approval. That is why it is important that we make it very clear that this is not about somehow intervening in the competence of the Member States, regulating tax matters, of maintaining the distribution of powers – the Member States are responsible for tax legislation, and the Commission is responsible for competition.  If we do not respect that, we will not move forward. In the area of competition, in the area of competition supervision, enough has to be done. From Luxembourg alone, we know, there are more than 5000 cases of possible state aid through tax measures. The Commission has only been able to deal with 65 such cases in 25 years.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteurs who have also done a very useful collective work and this complements the work of the TAXE Committee. I still have the impression that we are telling ourselves an old story here, that we are getting older, always telling the same things on a subject which is unfortunately - and I draw your attention, Commissioner, to this reality - more and more at the centre of the rejection of Europe by the citizens. We have sinned in two ways. The first is the internal market. We explained to people that in Europe there would be no differences depending on where an activity takes place. This applies to a multitude of other labour rules, standards and regulations. On the other hand, for all that is tax, there remains this total anomaly which is to accept that within the single market, depending on where you settle, you ultimately benefit from completely different conditions; from there, unfair competition takes place between the Member States - this has been pointed out, this question of competition is not the least. So in this regard, I think it is really urgent that the Commission re-engages in the question of the consolidated common basis for corporation tax. It is simply a question of the internal market. On the other hand, there is another particularly regrettable dimension: with the introduction of the euro and mutual control of budgets, we find ourselves with states that boast of having a triple-A rating but which, during this time, steal the tax resources of the little comrades, which allows them to improve their own performance. We have also seen that, in a country like Greece, it is not entirely neutral that we have never dared to face - I tried to do so in the two-pack - the issue of tax fraud and evasion of particularly wealthy people in Greece.

It does not serve the interests of, for example, ordinary Irish people to have sovereignty relinquished through attempted tax harmonisation. It is absolutely and fundamentally the right of governments in each state to legislate in the best interests of their people, particularly the setting of tax rates. For our part, my party will continue to demand that genuine and credible actions are taken around corporate tax evasion, specifically in relation to the evidence which suggests that the effective rate of tax paid by multinationals and large corporations is in fact much lower than the 12.5% headline rate in Ireland. Mr Bayet and others said that whether Groups do or do not support tax harmonisation is almost irrelevant: the fact of the matter is that it is on the public record that citizens do not support it. In fact, they have stated time and time again their view that all matters relating to the setting of tax rates must remain a matter of national competency and the European Parliament has no right to attempt to attack tax sovereignty in this way.

Today we are challenging the Commission to introduce these into law across the European Union to demonstrate that they will resist the power of corporate lobbying and act for the people of Europe. What has been less encouraging is the way all groups, apart from the Greens, have had Members who have put national interest above our continent’s interest.

The shortfall for France would be 15 billion euros a year, probably ten times more for the Union.

The National Front has joined all the texts in favour of tax transparency but categorically refuses to move towards a fiscal union. I therefore once again welcome initiatives to control transfer pricing, introduce transparency in rescripts and harmonize the corporate tax bases. On the other hand, I would have liked clearer sanctions against consulting firms that help with abusive optimization.  Beyond that, it is obvious that a country like France will not save itself from a reflection on the level of its compulsory levies.

Counterproductive, however, the serious obstacles faced by foreign journalists in China continue unabated. Of course, Chinese media can now operate completely freely in Europe. We fully support that.  Hence my unfulme-made plea through an amendment for mutual media freedom between the EU and China. I regret this omission in the report. A previous report did say so. Important for the report was also the academic input I received. Because a strategic partnership - and this is the case between the EU and China - requires mutual clarity in the precise views and intentions of both sides. Inaccurate Western translations or depictions of Chinese political positions can be misleading. In two cases, we find this in the report: it concerns the universality of human rights and the rule of law.  As far as the rule of law is concerned, the Chinese government does not object to this Western translation, but President Xi Jinping does not leave any ambiguity that his country will not adopt western style of law. And on China's position on the scope of human rights, it was officially stressed this summer that Beijing is committed to, I quote 'the combination of the principle of universality of human rights with the reality of China's national circumstances'. Both examples underline the European need to know Chinese political positions accurately and recognise the appropriate and fair development of relations between them.  I am in no doubt that the EU and China can do a great deal for each other's citizens in their strategic partnership. The report goes into detail. However, this requires an open attitude from both parties, both self-directed and partner-oriented. Above all, a solid foundation for this mutual openness is a genuine interest in each other and mutual well-being. My wish is that this report will deepen and strengthen European-Chinese relations!", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3892, "date": "2015-12-15.json", "name": "Nicolas Schmit", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, I am pleased on behalf of the High Representative, Federica Mogherini, to introduce this important plenary debate on the latest European Parliament report on EU-China relations. First of all, may I congratulate Mr Bas Belder who is a veteran of the past three reports on China. The valuable work by him, by the shadow rapporteurs and by AFET as a whole is clearly visible in this very comprehensive report. As you know, the High Representative’s interactions with China have been considerable this year. She held her first high-level strategic dialogue with China on the 14th anniversary of our diplomatic relations in May in Beijing, and had further interactions at the 17th EU-China summit in Brussels, the ASEAN Regional Forum in Kuala Lumpur, and the 12th ASEM Foreign Ministers meeting in Luxembourg. That is not forgetting China’s constant presence in the Iran talks that helped make the deal. At the level of officials, there have been around 120 meetings and visits this year. Members of the European Parliament have also been active in seeking contact and visiting – not least, of course, the President of the European Parliament. The first thing we wish to emphasise is the importance of the EU-China Partnership for both sides. It is not just that EU-China relations are a vital source of economic dynamism in Europe. We need to remember also that China needs the EU just as much as Europe needs China. China knows that its relationship with Europe is vital for its economic well-being and social stability. E-knowhow and technologies assist China’s economic and governance reforms and reduce vulnerabilities in its economy. Recent concerns about the risk of a hard landing of the Chinese economy as underlined in the report show that the EU has a huge stake in the success of China’s economic and governance reforms, and in supporting a well-managed transition to a more market-driven economy. It should be remembered that China’s gradual opening up of its economy to foreign investment has helped to stimulate the big economic growth needed to lift 600 million Chinese citizens out of extreme poverty, of which fact China is rightly proud. The report acknowledges that the EU-China Investment Agreement negotiations represent one of the most important issues in EU-China bilateral economic and trade relations. The report underlines the need for balanced economic growth and the fact that the investment agreement contains disciplines for sustainable development. The EU is indeed pursuing such disciplines with China, as it does in all its agreements. We are aware of the difficulties EU companies face in their effort to access the market and operate their investments in China. We are committed to pursuing new market access opportunities, as well as overall improvements in China’s regulatory framework. In this respect, our EU delegation in Beijing, in close coordination with Member States, has participated actively in the open consultations conducted by the Chinese Government on the cyber-security, counterterrorism, NGO and national security draft laws. We will continue to put pressure on the Chinese Government and point out that these laws work directly against China’s economic interests, stifling creativity, innovation and precisely the inward investment that China cherishes and needs to avoid the middle income trap. The EU and its Member States will continue to engage China and encourage it to see its own interests in fulfilling its commitments to uphold universal values and standards as recommended by your report. The EU Special Representative for Human Rights visited China this year and our human rights dialogue was held there two weeks ago. The report lists many areas where China’s human rights record does not live up to international standards. Indeed, the situation there is deteriorating. The European Parliament, jointly with the other EU institutions, must continue to make the argument that China’s stance risks leading to more, rather than less, instability in China. On the foreign policy front, we need to look at ways of encouraging China to do more multilaterally, especially in Africa, the Middle East and Afghanistan. The High Representative’s work with the Chinese counterparts since she took office has convinced her that there is considerable potential to boost EU-China foreign policy and security cooperation. China can be a positive force in the world by making a more substantive contribution to global security and exercising its UN Security Council role accordingly. Given China’s increased willingness to work via the UN, positive areas of cooperation could be developed, including in peacekeeping, humanitarian affairs, disaster risk management, economic and social rights, and health. China could also take greater responsibility internationally concerning migration. Climate change, green growth, development assistance and the sustainable development goals are also important areas. Here the relationship has the potential to grow and I have to say that China’s role in achieving the Paris Agreement on Climate Change has been positive. China’s forthcoming G20 presidency, the WTO and fora such as the EBRD offer further avenues for EU-China cooperation on aspects of international governance. We note the position taken in the report on the South China Sea. The EU takes no position on claims but remains strongly committed to unimpeded commerce, to the freedom of navigation, right of transit passage and to the freedom of aviation according to international law, in particular as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The EU strongly opposes any attempt to assert territorial or maritime claims through the use of intimidation, coercion, force or any unilateral action which could cause further friction. Here, as in many cases, we do consult with the United States and other like-minded partners, but naturally take decisions based on our own assessment, our own interests and values. Finally, I wish to close on the issue of EU unity. The EU must be cohesive and effective in the pursuit of its own interests while upholding its values and international law. The EU-China framework should provide a guideline which strengthens Member States in their own dealings with China. Our negotiating strength will always be stronger when the 28 act as one.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3893, "date": "2015-12-15.json", "name": "Antonio López-Istúriz White", "mepid": "28399", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen Belder, Mr B-tikofer, Leinen and other shadow rapporteurs who have been working with me on this report, thank you all very much. We've done a job that will be put to a vote tomorrow. China is a strategic partner of the European Union and a key player on the international stage. With last June's XVII European Union-China Summit in Brussels, we held forty years of diplomatic relations and sent, I believe, an important signal for closer cooperation with China.  The continued strengthening of our bilateral relationship has enormous potential that we must be able to harness, without prejudice to the central importance of our transatlantic relations in the Pacific; and particularly in China—which will soon be the first global economic power—much of the future is played. At the same time, China needs to be progressively involved in managing global challenges and threats by taking responsibility and acting in accordance with established standards for all.  In this regard, I would like to stress the importance of China's respect for an open global economy. China is trying to make an economic transition to a market economy. A successful transition will be beneficial for China and also for the rest of the world. Acts of intimidation and unilateral actions in the South China Sea are an element of particular concern. What happens there has a major international dimension.  Finally, I would like to stress the importance that has been given justifiably in this report to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Their violation — it is worth noting the plight of the Tibetan people, as well as that of other minorities such as the Christian one , is a major concern.

Mr President, Mr Schmit, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the president for his excellent work and for the work he has The S&amp;D Group is in favour of developing the EU's strategic partnership with China at all levels. China and the EU have different political systems. This results in different views and opinions on very different topics. However, this should not prevent us from working closely and trustingly for both bilateral and global benefit. Strategic partnership at economic, political and cultural level is also at the heart of this report. That is the essence of This Report by Parliament. The mention of some recent events should not obscure the fact that we are concentrating on this strategic partnership. China and the EU have done and achieved much together in 40 years of diplomatic relations. I think there is much more to be achieved and done in the next few years. We want economic relations to be developed and we are in favour of an investment agreement between the EU and China. China's participation in the Juncker Investment Plan and our consideration of participating in investment in the new Silk Road can be an important step forward.  However, we want a fair exchange. We are very much against all forms of dumping and, of course, against discriminatory obstacles for European companies in the Chinese market – this is also addressed in the report. China and the EU are global players. We also need to work more and more together for global challenges – for peace and development in the world. The key words are mentioned: whether cyber security is, stability of the financial markets, the fight against terrorism – there is still a lot that can and must happen. We are therefore concerned about the tensions in the South China Sea. Here, the dialogue with the ASEAN countries, with our neighbours and also the use of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea must be fully exploited. I mentioned different political systems. We are concerned about the curtailment of the freedom of the people in China, about discrimination, including human rights. The human rights dialogue and the rule of law dialogue are so important here, as is the dialogue on Tibet, on Xinjiang province, on relations in the Taiwan Strait and, of course, on democratic development in Hong Kong.

Nevertheless, I have been a long-standing critic of the lack of human rights in China. I criticised the bullying of peaceful democratic Taiwan through its exclusion from all international organisations. I criticised the repression of peaceful Tibetan culture, the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners and other religious minorities, and the widespread censorship of the media, including Google, as well as military expansion in the China Seas. I also condemned the widespread use of the death sentence for lesser crimes such as economic subversion and pimping, believe it or not. We cannot ignore the importance of the People’s Republic of China but must never lose sight of the fact that it is a one-party communist dictatorship.

This includes, of course, the role of economic and trade relations, in which it is important that the Investment Protection Agreement finally becomes operational. However, the current general positive background in European-China relations also gives hope of real change in many other areas.  China is active on a wide range of global issues that are of utmost importance to Europe, such as climate change, the recently concluded climate agreement in Paris and the implementation of this agreement, as well as non-proliferation, counter-terrorism, urbanisation and energy security. However, there are areas where more effort must surely be made to find common ground. I consider it extremely important to cooperate more on security and defence policy issues, especially in view of, for example, the fight against terrorism in Ukraine. China's support is needed in the fight against Da'esh. China has already experienced the hess of Da'esh on its own and it is important that China actively participates in international cooperation to resolve the situation in Syria, Iraq and Libya. The area of cyber security is not only a growing security problem, but it is already a very important area where action must be taken together today. China has an important role to play in ensuring the security and stability of the Asian region, so it is important that tensions in the South China Sea are reduced and peaceful solutions are found with other countries in the region. China is also one of the few that can influence North Korea.

This report comes in the 40th year of EU-China relations. In these 40 years we have seen many changes. But one rule still applies today, as it was 40 years ago: the exchange can only be fruitful if it is fair oncoming traffic. In other words, we must also take very clear note that China, as a global power, is becoming an issue for us, not only directly in its EU relations, but also indirectly – as it interferes in global relations. Both sides – China and the EU – remain in transition. That is why, Mr Belder, I would like to express my support for what you have said. We need an annual report in this Parliament, which the High Representative gives us, on the development of relations between China and the EU. It is developing so fast that we need this instrument – just like Congress in Washington – to stay at the height of the debate. The role of the proud Parliament is to say certain things even if they do not like them on the other side. That is why I mention, for example, our criticism of China's law against foreign non-governmental organisations or our expectation of China that it will abide by the arbitral tribunal, which is likely to be handed down by the middle of the year, by the middle of the year, the arbitral tribunal under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos).

I would also have liked to see a greater decision in calling for Europe to cut its political actions out of its own interests, moving away from washington's suffocating umbilical cord. But the real test will be to move from noble words to concrete political decisions. Rather than proposing the absurd, suicidal and unacceptable recognition of China's status as a free market economy, the Commission has a political and moral duty to demand genuine reciprocity, conditionality and respect for universal human rights.

Hong Kong is a good example of a successful, and mostly democratic, Asian territory holding elections and continuing to use a system based on English common law. However, around a year ago, China attempted to interfere in the election of the Hong Kong Chief Executive, proposing that only candidates from a pre-selected list were eligible to stand.

Already a few decades ago, German and other European multinationals, in order to reduce labour costs, have gone through the well-known outsourcing process, transferring all or part of their production to China, resulting in a sharp increase in unemployment in Europe. At the time, the European Union and the governments of its Member States were closing their eyes to the massive human rights violations in China.  Over the decades, China has grown into the second most powerful economy in the world and aspires to achieve a new division of labour and a redistribution of spheres of influence and exploitation in Africa and other parts of the world.

You cannot just ‘choose’ to cooperate with the second biggest economy in the world, the most populous country in the world and a very important trading and financial power. We share with China the same interest in stability concerning the political environment and the economic and financial environment, and we share the interest of keeping the world economy stable. So we need dialogue with China. We need it in different areas and it is clear, as was mentioned here, that there is still room for improvement in many areas. That was also underlined in the report. It is true too that, as a trading partner, China has to play by the rules. Having an open market also means respecting certain rules, including no dumping practices. I was very sensitive, as you know, to what you said on steel. Luxembourg is also a steel producer, and we gave a very clear signal because we organised a special Council on this issue. It is obvious that we do not want the European steel industry to be destroyed. In this dialogue with China, as I said, we have to tackle a lot of questions, including human rights. Human rights have to occupy an important place in this dialogue. Coming to the question of investment, it was agreed at the last summit that a possible free trade agreement should be negotiated in the longer-term perspective, and we consider that the successful conclusion of these investment negotiations could also be seen in the framework of multilateral and plurilateral trade negotiation. Concerning other negotiations – and especially the launch of the Taiwan and Hong Kong investment agreement negotiations – the Commission adopted the communication on its Trade for All strategy on 14 October 2014, underlining the importance of Asia for our trade and investment relations. The communication recognises that, operating in an increasingly integrated regional supply chain, EU investors in East Asia should benefit from a broader network of investment agreements in the region. Building on the investment provisions under negotiation with China, the EU will explore, and I quote, ‘launching negotiations on investment with Hong Kong and Taiwan’. Thank you for this very useful and stimulating debate. The view of the European Parliament, as expressed in the report and also in the contributions here, provides valuable food for thought in the process of developing the new global strategy on foreign policy and security which is on the way, and for updating our tailored strategic approaches to important partners such as China. I have also noted that Parliament has requested an annual report on EU-China relations. I would like to emphasise that we are all well aware of the need to keep track of the implementation of policy commitments in the EU-China context. That is why we agreed, at this year’s EU-China Summit, to create a senior officials’ mechanism to review progress on a regular basis.

Mr Schmit, representative of the Luxembourg Presidency, thank you very much for your position on the substance. I very much appreciate that and I hope to hear again tomorrow what exactly you have said, but I found it encouraging that you are so substantive in this report and are also looking to the future, because the changes are indeed happening quickly. I then come to two points, Madam President, which I very much appreciate. Firstly, the Neue Zürcher Zeitung reported last Saturday through its correspondent Matthias Müller - and I found this a rejoicing development - that a dark side of the one-child policy, which is now a thing of the past, was that millions of citizens were not registered. They're called \"the black ones.\" It is probably 13 million people, 8 million of whom were not actually registered, because the parents could not pay the fine for crossing the one-child limit. So they could not go to school, could not move freely, had no social insurance. A reform commission under President Xi Jinping is now going to fix this.  A very important first step in that so-called hukou system and the second-class citizenship of the hundreds of millions of migrant workers in the smellbanized China. I welcome the fact that Beijing is now embarking on this, because it is an extremely complicated and complicated process and we in Europe must keep a close eye on the difficulty of the whole society and the burden of the past.  Now I come to the burden of the past: I fully agree with the conclusion of the religion expert and sociology professor Fenggang Yang who says: there has been one miracle in China, the economic miracle, but there is also a second miracle, namely the religious revival and in particular the flowering of Chinese Christianity.

On the way to that Istanbul Summit, the Commission has drawn up a Communication, which my report values very positively and continues almost entirely. Parliament will vote on this report tomorrow and the Council has drawn provisional conclusions which will surely become final next year, closer to the summit. My report is about answering three questions. The first question is: why is a global humanitarian summit necessary now? Secondly, what objectives do we want to achieve in Istanbul? And the third, what role should the European Union play in this process? And to answer the first question, the answer is not that we need a summit now because the global humanitarian system was adopted a quarter of a century ago and the passage of time requires a change. No, the answer is deeper: because the world has changed dramatically in this quarter of a century and the humanitarian system is now unable to respond to the new challenges we encounter. Today we have more numerous, more serious humanitarian crises than ever before, of the highest level in many parts of the world. We also have major crises from natural causes and others because of war, and we have fewer means to respond to these crises, which last longer because in many cases for up to thirty years: \"enceded\" crises. In the face of this situation, what are the consequences? More refugees than ever before: about forty million in 2015, half of them virtually children. More people in need of humanitarian assistance: about a hundred million people needed it last year. If we grouped them all together, they would form the tying country of the world into population. For us to get an idea, all of France and all of Spain together would need humanitarian action. And we have fewer economic means, because in the last year, for example, there has been a need on the part of the United Nations to end some provision of simple humanitarian aid in some parts of the world that urgently need such aid.  To answer the second question — what should we achieve in Istanbul?—, my report took into account the global consultation process that has been carried out in different parts of the world and which has been accumulating proposals from different sectors committed to humanitarian action, and that is why I propose four axes of joint global action. First, to promote a global consensus of action that re-entrusts the principles of humanitarian aid and focuses on the protection of people. This consensus must be strengthened with an action plan of at least five years to implement the commitments reached at the Summit.  Second, promote a code of conduct; a code jointly developed by all participants, without an exclusive Western vision, and based on respect for humanitarian principles and international laws. We call for transparency and accountability to be vector values of the Summit's conclusions.  Thirdly, we call for the creation of a comprehensive humanitarian action fund to ensure the predictability, operational flexibility and security of multiannual contributions. So far the financial mechanisms have been voluntary; we also call for mandatory commitments.  Fourth, we support local and national preparedness and response. On the other hand, we call for the independence of aid, we accept private sector participation when it can contribute to its experience and in accordance with humanitarian laws, but above all we focus on the protection of human beings.  As regards the third question — what should the European Union do?—, I refer to what the Council has adopted in an interim manner: the Union and its Member States must commit the ourselves to helping to make the Summit a success, both in the preparatory process and in the presence in Istanbul at the highest possible level. They must use all their means of development, humanitarian, diplomatic, to achieve a vision that promotes specific initiatives that transform humanitarian aid. The object of all this can be nothing but to protect people, to protect lives, to guarantee their dignity, which is the only way to guarantee our own dignity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3939, "date": "2015-12-15.json", "name": "Christos Stylianides", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, human suffering has reached levels not seen before. As Mr Guerrero Salom said, 100 million people depend on humanitarian assistance. 60 million people have been forced to flee their homes, half of them children. These numbers are simply shocking. That is why the World Humanitarian Summit is such an important and timely initiative to restore humanity to the centre of political decision-making, and to improve the way in which we help people in humanitarian crises. We need the Summit to address the efficiency and delivery of humanitarian aid. But we also need the Summit to enable that aid to be delivered. Therefore, it is crucial that it addresses the increasing violation of international humanitarian law. That is a personal priority for me, and it will require political commitment from leaders at the Summit. Let us be realistic. We need more than humanitarians to achieve solutions to the underlying problems. Humanitarians cannot – and should not – carry the whole burden alone. Humanitarian aid can only be a short-term solution. It does not prevent or end conflicts. It does not generate social or economic progress. This is most evident in the worst humanitarian crisis of our times: the Syrian crisis. As long as a political solution is not reached, as long as Syrian people do not get basic social opportunities, our humanitarian assistance to Syria and its neighbouring countries will never be enough.  The fact that the Summit is taking place in Istanbul is by itself very significant. Istanbul has a strong symbolic meaning. It is a city bringing together continents, cultures and religions and it should become a symbol of bringing together humanitarian, political, development and environmental actors to better serve people in humanitarian crises. And it needs to reach beyond traditional humanitarian actors, to bring on board the private sector. To achieve this, all world leaders must be ready to make concrete commitments in Istanbul at the highest political level. The next six months will be critical in order to elevate the Summit to its rightful place. My personal commitment is to engage with partners around the world ahead of the Summit. I will encourage EU Member States to do the same. The European Parliament clearly has a role to play, too.  I would like to thank the Members of this Chamber for their interest and involvement in the discussions on the Summit. In particular, I would like to thank Mr Guerrero Salom for his personal leadership, especially on the European Parliament’s report that will be discussed in a moment. The Commission set out its position in a Communication last December. The Council adopted its conclusions last week. Parliament should now complete the EU’s contribution to the Summit by adopting this report. This way, we will have a strong collective vision on what a successful World Humanitarian Summit should be – a vision that we can communicate to partners around the globe. Regarding the massive refugee crisis, Europe has undertaken its share of responsibility. The initiatives by President Juncker and the Commission clearly show that this crisis is a major priority, and that the basic values of humanity and solidarity are at the core of the European Union. Europe is assuming its share of responsibility, in three major ways: firstly, through assistance to the refugees wherever they are; secondly, through the EU migration agenda – a difficult agenda; and thirdly, through a comprehensive response to the Syrian crisis. We are leading by example and doing our fair share. This will strengthen our credibility. We will become the main advocate for the global response we need so much.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3940, "date": "2015-12-15.json", "name": "Pier Antonio Panzeri", "mepid": "28365", "text": "  Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.

Humanitarian crises always involve enormous human suffering for the entire affected population, and even in these tragic humanitarian crises we must think of those who suffer the most, women and girls have always been the first victims, especially in armed conflicts, victims of abuse, rape and violence of all kinds. That is why humanitarian action must focus first and then on them so that they can receive adequate support and be guaranteed access to a whole range of sexual and reproductive health services, as set out in international humanitarian law.

For too long, women and girls who have been victims of sexual violence in armed conflicts have not been adequately served on health care. For too long, through its humanitarian work, the EU has departed from the letters of the Geneva Convention on the right to adequate medical care in the context of sexual violence in conflicts. Women and girls who are victims of sexual violence in conflicts should not have to be punished twice by also being refused the necessary medical care. That must be a starting point.

I want to repeat the figures, because then other things will fade into the background. Other things are trivialities.

The reactive has to give way to the proactive, because to move is not to move.  Humanitarian aid is inextricably linked to foreign policy and, of course, to development policy. That is why the World Humanitarian Summit in May must have the highest profile of international political representation, not only of the European Union but of the whole world, because it is the first and because it will be held in Istanbul, Turkey, a symbolic place that embodies both the problems and solutions to the desperate situation that refugees experience on the borders of Europe and in Europe itself.  This situation has shown that humanitarian aid is a major political instrument, and as such we must address it and use it from efficiency and from adapting to the problems that have changed in the world in which we live.  Our role at the Summit, as the world's leading donors, must be to influence the outcome so that the consensus reached incorporates essential humanitarian principles: the fight against impunity, putting protection, especially for women, at the centre of humanitarian aid and compliance with the international legal framework. Because, let us not forget, as long as our own Member States do not respect European and international legality, our action abroad will be very limited.  We know that the current humanitarian response is facing a constant erosion of respect for international law. And so, including civilians, aid workers, who often move to places where very few would go, must increasingly become the object of our protection and work.  The European Union has the responsibility and has the impetus to take a leading role in finding more efficient ways to meet the needs of people affected by conflict and catastrophe.

So in Istanbul next May we have an opportunity but also, maybe, a ‘last chance’ to make the humanitarian system fit for purpose and to build strong and diversified partnerships. The preparatory process has been inclusive and extensive, but there is a risk that the Summit will try to cover everything under the sun. So, if we really want to have an impact as the European Union, we need to be focused, by pushing two or three really game-changing points, and start discussing well in advance with our partners these two or three issues. That takes me to the substance of the Summit which you have addressed so comprehensively. Let me say again what three of the big issues are where we can and should make a difference. Firstly, we need to make a difference with respect to international humanitarian law and humanitarian principles. The protection of humanitarian workers is paramount. Secondly, we need a more and more effective and transparent humanitarian system, with agencies working to deliver in a more transparent and efficient manner. Thirdly, there is a desperate need for more resources and more predictable funding. You know all about this. We need to work on bringing in new sources of funding, on working better with development funding. I am delighted that our Vice-President Kristalina Georgieva is part of leading a panel which will address these issues. The Summit must address all of these in a concrete manner. For that we need to build deeper and more genuine partnerships; find ways of bringing in local actors more consistently; definitely bring in the private sector – we need it; build universal support for humanitarian principles; and of course show that humanitarian aid is not a Western enterprise. We want to work on this with all of you during the coming months, thinking creatively, being innovative, but remaining very focused.

Free movement and adequate social protection for mobile citizens are core values of the European Union. They directly affect the lives of millions. Therefore, I am glad to have the opportunity today to have an exchange with you here in Parliament. Since I took office as Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility more than a year ago, I have listened carefully to the very different views that exist on these matters. Those exchanges with many people and representatives of many organisations, many Member States and many parliaments have convinced me that, irrespective of the differences, there is also a lot of common ground in what most people want. Fundamentally, the right to move across borders, to travel, to study, to work or to retire is not put into question. On the contrary, it is considered to be one of the major achievements of the European Union and a right that is cherished by many. But people want this right of free movement to be exercised in a way which is fair for everybody. They want rules which are clear, fair and enforced on the ground, and it is precisely our job as lawmakers to provide for such rules. The Juncker Commission has committed in its political guidelines to reviewing the existing rules on social security coordination and the posting of workers, and to table legislative proposals for amendments where appropriate.  We are sticking to that commitment. We repeat it and operationalise it further in the Commission’s work programme for 2016, announcing proposals for a revision of the social security coordination regulations, as well as a targeted revision of the Posting of Workers Directive to implement the principle of equal pay for equal work. We will also outline our priorities to support and facilitate labour mobility across Europe. We are finalising the technical work on the package. When exactly we will be tabling it also depends on the political context.  As you know, the European Council will this week discuss security alongside migration, the internal market, the deepening of the EMU and the UK – all topics related directly or indirectly to labour mobility. The Commission will re-evaluate, after the European Council, when is the right time to table its labour mobility package. My ambition is for it to be a balanced package taking the interests of all 28 Member States – and, of course, of all their citizens – into account. In the meantime, I am at your disposal – of you all – to continue our exchange, which I value a lot and will take into account. Parliament will have its institutional role to play in the legislative process once the initiative – or the initiatives, because it is a package – are on the table. So let us prepare further that process now. I am available for questions.

We in the European People's Party support you in the European Commission in their concern to increase and massively promote the mobility rate of workers and jobseekers within the EU. Only about 7.5 million of European workers were active in another Member State in 2014. This corresponds to a share of only 3.1%. The mobility potential of the EU labour force is far from being exhausted. This is absolutely unsatisfactory with the highest unemployment in certain regions of Europe. The new EURES network of public and private labour market administrations will also be able to make a strong contribution to providing hundreds of thousands of vacant jobs. Of course, we want in future the posting of every worker to another country not only facilitated, but guaranteed under fair conditions. We agree with you, Commissioner, that we are giving people the security of receiving their fair wages and benefits throughout the EU. I therefore do not think it makes sense to act hastily now and to put the 2014 Posting of Workers Directive in place before it has even been fully implemented. Let us wait for the evaluation!

I am already asking myself the question: what is this to do? This is a pure announcement commission! The problems are on the table.

Free movement is an individual right of every European citizen and, as such, it must be protected, but this should not blind us to the fact that there are pluses and minuses to labour mobility. Yes, it can provide opportunities for job seekers and it can help to deal with issues like labour shortages and skills shortages. But equally there can be a brain drain from sending countries and also, if in a receiving country there are significant numbers of posted workers arriving in a particular sector, it can have the impact of driving down wages. I believe that our job as parliamentarians is to act to mitigate the bad effects and promote the good effects of labour mobility. We need to recognise that in some cases our legislation needs updating, either to take account of new realities – and there are many in the European Union – or to deal with the unintended consequences of previous legislation. I presume none of us in this Parliament think we get it right first time, every time, or indeed that past Parliaments did. As always it depends on politics: in the Commission, in Parliament and in the Council. So that is three politics: politics, politics and more politics.

Our citizens deserve that – they expect it and they deserve it. Finally, your comments on equal work for equal pay in the same place. I agree with you on that because it is well-established in European legislation and, as you have said yourself on many occasions, we do it for part-time workers, for fixed-time workers, for seasonal workers, for temporary agency workers.

We cannot be held back in difficulties, nor give in to any form of pressure by those whose sole purpose is to destroy the union of our Europe, or who attribute the responsibilities for its failure in national governance. It is therefore urgent that we be able to launch an effective labour mobility package that ensures that mobility workers have the most fundamental labour rights. They need to be ensured that they are well-working, to ensure that they have access to health monitoring and social protection systems in the host States, and that in the future their pensions reflect all the efforts of a lifetime.

Madam President, in this period of financial crisis, we note that labour mobility is presented as the forced solution to tackling unemployment. According to the European Network of Employment Services, EUROPES, workers from the Member States of the Union who have the possibility of occupational mobility in another country within the EU will be subject to the labour and insurance legislation of the host country and not of the country of origin. According to research, Germany will need up to 490 000 workers from European Union states each year to maintain its current levels of prosperity. Already, the European Union regrets that only 700 000 people are moving within the other European Union countries in the second half of 2015 to find work.

I want to wish Mrs Collins the best. I hope that after a working day that has probably consisted of two shifts, she will recover quickly.  What I would like to point out once again is that there is a commitment, a commitment by the Juncker Commission to deliver on this dossier. A review has been promised. Ultimately, it will amount to a revision, both of the social security coordination regulations and the posting directive, and I want to assure you that we will deliver as well. I will work very hard for that myself, you know that. But I will do the same along with the college as a whole. Ultimately, we want to achieve legally secure rules, fair rules that are enforceable and where those who have to do the inspection can also effectively ensure enforceability. Those are the three main points. What I would like to say specifically about the enforcement directive: some of my colleagues here spoke about the enforcement directive, we must first make it stand out and then see if we need to do something further.  The enforcement directive, ladies and gentlemen, is not going to be there, it is not being reopened. The enforcement directive was voted on after lengthy negotiations here in this House. We completed this process in May 2014 after lengthy negotiations between the Council and the European Parliament. That directive is what it is, remains what it is and must be transposed accordingly by each Member State. I have already asked my services to look closely at this, and I ask in every bilateral contact, and also at the Epsco, the Social Affairs Council, that ministers and governments all do their best to ensure a timely and quality transposition. But we must ensure that enforcement can also be done effectively and we see that there are still gaps there. Not in the enforcement directive, but in other parts of the mobility legislation, we will look at that and we will fill those gaps. As far as the Posting of People's Directive is concerned, we are going to open it. That's where we're going to do a target review. We have decided to revise it anyway, because otherwise we cannot comply with the principle of equal pay for equal work and we think that is a fair rule. We believe that this rule should be put in place. Someone here has said that we have that in other legislation, why can't we have that here? We will ensure that the way in which we introduce this rule ensures sufficient legal certainty to prevent it from becoming a source of many difficulties which will then have to be fought in courts and tribunals. We want the rule that is as law-a sure as possible. We have worked on this and I hope that we will be able to present it to you shortly. This is a matter of fairness.  As far as the Observatory is concerned, someone asked for an observatory, an observation centre to monitor mobility. Well, I can refer you to the European Foundation for the improvement of the living and working conditions, which has its seat in Dublin. It follows these issues closely, has carried out regular studies on and can give a good picture of the mobility flows in Europe.  A question has also been asked about the importance of companies. Indeed, we must take that into account. These are situations in which both companies and employees and the services market have an interest. What is our concern is that we are delivering on the two principles for which we introduced the secondment for workers at the time, for which we drew up that directive in the 1990s. This was a dual concern: to ensure a level playing field between companies in the service sector and to ensure the social protection of people seconded to other Member States in the context of services. That remains our dual concern and we will take into view each of these aspects. Of course, I have taken note of the letters from, among others, the business organisation you are quoting, ma'am. I take note of all the letters and I try to read everything that comes in. I usually do that thoroughly. But of course we have to form an opinion afterwards, to make sure that we put together a package that we ourselves are convinced is the best thing we can put together. And that's the way we'll go. With all due respect to the letters we receive, but we cannot always give a positive response to every letter or to every part of a letter we receive. The concern I see in this House is a concern that I share with you. We must move towards a balanced package that is at the service of the people, the citizens of each of the 28 Member States. We will work on that, too. We are going to do this from an attitude that mobility. We are convinced that mobility is a good thing for the European Union, gives extra opportunities to citizens when certain conditions are met. We will therefore ensure that this mobility is done in a fair manner, that there are no abuses. We must combat abuses, but we must give opportunities to mobility, free movement of people, of workers, but also of services, because that is a matter that ultimately benefits us.  So we're going to look at that legislation, we're going to make changes. But again, also ensure balance, i.e. look at all member states. Ensuring rules that are legally secure, clear, fair and enforceable, and where those who have to enforce them and inspect them also have sufficient tools at their disposal to ensure proper enforcement. I look forward to coming up with this package soon. Once this package has passed through the College, I look forward to continuing to debate with you on the basis of very concrete proposals. Then we can certainly exchange ideas usefully. We're going to do that in a mature way. I'm going to learn a lot from you and we're going to have a good discussion and make sure we get the best possible package and I feel that there is the spirit here to work together.

There is an urgent need to take action against social fraud, which undermines the internal market and dangerously fuels the rejection of the European project.

I have long been drawing the European Commission's attention to this case. Although, in the Commission's view, labour mobility is key to the success of the European economy, the area of taxation of working migrants is disorderly and this hinders the movement of labour within the EU. I would remind you that the EU Treaty prohibits discrimination against workers on grounds of nationality.

This is, for me, also an occasion to thank you for the valuable input and support received from the European Parliament throughout the preparation of this directive. As you know, there are still many obstacles preventing people with disabilities from fully exercising their rights in society. Often they cannot choose where and how to live, and they face additional challenges in finding and keeping jobs or participating in education, to name but a few examples. Technological innovation offers great potential for overcoming barriers. Take the example of smartphones or e-banking and online shopping. These are changing our society and our economy, and they make our lives easier. If these products and services are made accessible, they offer new opportunities for people with disabilities to participate in society and to make independent choices.  We see that demand for accessible products and services is increasing. This is also driven by demographic ageing. It is estimated that in 2020 120 million Europeans will face a disability or functional limitation. The European Union and its Member States have committed, under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, to making products, services and buildings more accessible. Member States have started to legislate on accessibility independently in an uncoordinated way. Unless we take action at European level, divergence in the national rules of the Member States will increase. This would make it more difficult for industry to sell products and services across borders, and it is also bad for citizens who are most in need of accessible products and services.  Our aim with this proposal is to eliminate and prevent barriers between Member States created by diverging national accessibility requirements. We want to establish Europe-wide, functional accessibility requirements based on a design-for-all approach. This will allow industries to offer a wider choice of accessible products and services throughout Europe at a better price. The functional requirements we propose in the Accessibility Act establish accessibility principles instead of prescribing detailed technical solutions. This leaves room for innovation and for flexibility. After intensive consultations with stakeholders, we have carefully selected key products and services from everyday life which are most relevant to supporting independent living. And let us be honest, at the end of the day, everybody’s quality of life can be enhanced by simple improvements to their accessibility. For example, we will all benefit from hearing train announcements in noisy stations more clearly, or from avoiding eye strain by working with enlarged document formats. This proposal is good for business, too. Europe-wide requirements will make it easier for companies, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, to sell in all the other Member States, thereby boosting cross-border trade and enhancing competition. Furthermore, when public authorities issue public calls for tenders for accessible goods, services or buildings, the businesses tendering will have certainty about the requirements they have to meet. The proposal also includes a common-sense clause which ensures its proportionality and balance, and that the situation of SMEs, particularly micro-enterprises, is well taken into account. The Accessibility Act complements the draft Directive on the Accessibility of Public Sector Bodies’ Websites, on which you have already given your first reading. Discussions in the Council on this Web Accessibility Directive have progressed to the point where we hope for the trilogue to start. We are asking Parliament to continue with its constructive and positive contribution and to facilitate the adoption of the measure as rapidly as possible. I believe this is a win-win situation for everybody. Thanks to this proposal, the cost for companies and Member States will be reduced. Moreover, European action can also have a positive impact on public budgets in the long term by reducing the dependency of older and disabled persons. Furthermore, this directive – and this is the most important aspect of it – will facilitate access by persons with disabilities to education, enhance their job opportunities and give them more freedom and more opportunities in their everyday life choices. To conclude, I would like to stress once more that it is the Commission’s firm intention to enhance social fairness in Europe. Nobody should be left behind.

This was a directive highly demanded by the sector. Specifically, I had asked a lot of questions to see if it could be approved.

Accessibility is the key word in everything, but especially in the collective of people with disabilities, because it is the precondition for ensuring equal and full participation of the collective of these people with functional diversity. What the Directive aims to do is, of course, to improve the internal market in accessible products and services by removing barriers created by existing legislation.  The Commissioner he said so: there was regulatory fragmentation, because each State was regulating differently.

What must it be like for the 80 million disabled people who need access to computers, ATMs, telecommunications, banking and transport – services that we all take for granted? How many of us MEPs used those services to try to get here to Strasbourg? I certainly used them all.

The Commissioner rightly pointed out that after 2020 we will be talking about 120 million people with disabilities and older people, i.e. one in four EU citizens will be affected.  The Public Procurement Directive is a regulation concerning EU funds, which is particularly important. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, including General Recommendation No 2 on accessibility, is equally fundamental.  I would like to point out that, for the first time, definitions of accessibility have been introduced into EU law, and this provides a framework. I think we have a long way to go before it comes to law, but we can finally start work on the merits after five years.

Ensuring that the 80 million European citizens who currently live with a disability have access to products and services in our single market is critically important in creating a more equal and fairer society. I want to particularly welcome the action point on ICT and operating systems. As the Commissioner highlighted, the accessibility of public websites is a key issue; a colleague also mentioned our own websites, and this is maybe a point we can take away with us. Many of us who have been working in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection have had a good look at our own websites to make sure that they are accessible, and we all can do the same.  These proposals to ensure that there is non-discrimination in the digital single market as well are important for all EU citizens. It is interesting that today in the UN they are considering the 10-year review of implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society. Point 12 of their outcome document highlights specific ICT challenges faced by persons with disabilities; this is interesting. We are sitting here in the European Parliament – although it is late – while in the UN they are also discussing these issues.  On the subject of the Marrakesh Treaty, which I continue to raise on the floor of this House, I would call on the Commission to come forward with a legislative proposal to implement this Treaty as soon as possible. The Accessibility Act mentions the issue of e-books, but with fewer than 5% of books published in accessible formats for blind and partially-sighted readers – and in poorer countries there are as little as 1% – we cannot see the Accessibility Act and the Marrakesh Treaty as separate. They are very much interlinked.

It is, of course, only a small part of the transposition of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

So we need to focus on getting rid of all the remaining obstacles, such as our own website. Companies still face additional costs when they want to offer their products across Europe because of all sorts of and sometimes conflicting national rules and standards. Of course, this requires a good balance between the interests of consumers with disabilities and those of companies. This would give a major boost to economic growth, because there are more than 80 million people with disabilities in the Union. This number will rise to 120 million by 2020 due to an ageing population.  So better accessibility benefits society as a whole. You can certainly count on me for a strong European accessibility law.

I think that we can all agree on promoting accessibility as it is being talked about here today, that is what we see here. The problem arises when these services are to be financed.

We must not allow the good thought and high expectations it rightly raises among people with disabilities to leave equally much frustration. I believe that will not be the case. Eighty million Europeans with disabilities have to face a number of obstacles in their daily lives caused not only by their disabilities. Better accessibility of goods and services is essential to improve the quality of life not only of people with disabilities, but also of older fellow citizens, for example.

Madam President, today in the European Union there are over eighty million people who face some form of disability. We therefore consider the initiative to adopt a European directive on the accessibility of disabled people to education, trade and work to be important, which will strengthen social justice. According to Eurostat data, a person of productive age has a 66% chance of finding a job while for a person with a severe disability the probability is reduced to 25%. In my country Greece, the proportion of people with disabilities is 10% of the population and, according to ELSTAT, 84% of people with disabilities in my country are outside the labour market. The Memorandum and austerity policies further exhausted people with disabilities as they found themselves in the crosshairs of the Troika which reduced their welfare benefits and disability pensions, which now range between EUR 250 and EUR 540, thus leading disabled people to social exclusion.

I would like to thank the Members of this European Parliament for their support for this proposal. I hope that we can work well together and that we can complete this package quickly. The sooner it can be transposed into legislation, the sooner it can also come into force. We have been made aware that we must also ensure sufficient accessability in our own instruments and in our own data that we disseminate from the European Commission. We must be careful about that. When I launched this package, I really made sure that all the material that was available should also be accessible to people with disabilities and that we at least meet all our own requirements there. I will also make it clear in the Commission that there is some room for improvement and that we need to work on it.  Helga Stevens, among others, has pointed out that it is a good proposal, but that it will also entail some additional costs for business. Indeed, costs are always there when conditions have to be met, but we have developed our system in such a way that those costs can be as low as possible, that there is a lot of room for choices at the companies and that the costs are low, also because we go for a design for all. The concept of a product or service must be an eye for service or product. It should also only be applied for new services and for new products being launched. It's not about transforming existing things. Because it is the reshaping that often costs money. If one pays attention to it from the start, it is often marginal costs. And if the costs are too high, is it really overburdening, is the cost or the question of accessibility such that this would mean that a product, which one intends to produce, would have to be completely modified or totally something else, then a company can still explain that, make an announcement and still launch its product as it wants. But it's first trying to make sure that there is compliance and that's ultimately what we're pursuing. So there is also real consideration of the costs for business. Because what we want is for products and services to meet as many requirements as possible. That there's accessability on the field. If everyone is behind it and can do so at a low cost, then we have the best chance of success. When it comes to the functional requirements that we impose on the websites of public services, of public authorities, I can say that the pending directive, which must be negotiated and which the trialogue has to start, scope, is different in scope. We're talking about private websites. That's what public service websites are about. However, the functional requirements are the same.  What I can say in relation to copyrights - Mrs Stihler referred to this - the Marrakesh agreement provides for an exception to copyrights for books that have been printed and which, in retrospect, are to be made in Braille or in something else. Well, what we have in mind here is: this is not about printed books, but about e-books, which can be downloaded via a website. We ask that these be accessible to people who cannot read, but who can have access through other senses. We ask that there be accessibility there, such that even non-sighted or visually impaired people can consult those books. Again, if we take care of this at the conception of such an e-book, then it is small adjustment costs that will improve accessibility, increase accessibility for many people, and that is what we ultimately strive for.

It is unnecessary to stress that the social integration of persons with disabilities cannot take place anywhere in 21st-century Europe without unhindered access to the Internet. I would therefore like to draw attention to the fact that in many cases the Union's own websites are not accessible. A good example is Erasmus, one of the most successful projects in THE HISTORY of the EU. There is currently no accessible version of the Erasmus Plus website, so in principle it would be in vain for people with disabilities to participate in the programme, but it is already an obstacle to being informed about their existing opportunities. Changing this is clearly not a matter of material, but of will.
