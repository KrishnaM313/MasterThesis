President Tusk has put four items on the agenda: migration, digital Europe, defence and external relations. Let me take them one by one. The first item on the agenda is migration. Recent developments are encouraging. Illegal flows along the central Mediterranean route have gone down significantly. The determined action of the EU as a whole, together with the resolute bilateral efforts from Member States, is yielding results. Leaders will want to consolidate these trends and root them in a long-term vision. This is why we need to scale up our work with international partners. This is also why a strong partnership with countries of origin and transit is indispensable. Tackling the root causes is the only way to handle this challenge of irregular immigration in the long term. Concerning the future Common European Asylum System, the European Council is expected to welcome progress already achieved and to call for further convergence to reach an agreement which strikes the right balance between responsibility and solidarity and ensures resilience to future crises. Second on the agenda, leaders will come back to the digital vision for Europe, following the successful Digital Summit in Tallinn last Friday. Behind the concept of a digital Europe lies more than the digital single market. The leaders will of course also want to take stock of the progress made on the concrete legislative proposals under the digital single market but there is much more. The question today is quite simply whether Europe is gearing up to meet the challenges and opportunities of the digital revolution. This is a key challenge for the future of Europe. It has an impact on all aspects of our lives, be it our citizens, our businesses or our governments. Leaders already touched upon this issue last June. Digital was also the focus of the summit last Friday in Tallinn in which you, President Tajani, also participated. In October, the European Council will provide further guidance to ensure that Europe is well equipped for this transformational change.  Let me now turn to the third item on the agenda, defence. Leaders established a comprehensive work programme in December 2016. They moved the discussion further in June 2017 with additional guidance focused on Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), but also on EU battlegroups and the industrial dimension of EU defence. More has been achieved in the last year than in a decade. Leaders are keeping a close eye on progress to maintain this momentum. In October, they will review efforts to launch an inclusive and ambitious Permanent Structured Cooperation. Discussions are moving in the right direction. Leaders will want to push for a rapid agreement on that basis.  The last item on the agenda of the European Council is external relations. Leaders will discuss recent developments on the international stage. One of the topics for this debate will be relations with Turkey. It is a little too early to pin down the other topics which will require leaders’ attention. I will therefore leave this open.  To conclude, I would also like to mention that leaders will meet as 27 in October as well. You discussed the latest state of play of the Brexit negotiations yesterday. You adopted a resolution and, as you know, a fifth round of negotiations is scheduled for next week. The European Council, under Article 50, will be the occasion for the 27 leaders to review the state of the negotiations.

Il est vrai qu’aujourd’hui, l’Europe bénéficie d’une reprise économique qui commence à se faire sentir dans tous nos États membres et d’un regain de confiance. De nouvelles opportunités s’ouvrent, et la balle est dans notre camp. Saisissons-la au bond car en réalité, il nous reste encore beaucoup à faire pour passer d’une amélioration économique passagère à une amélioration durable, qui sera réellement ressentie dans toutes nos régions par tous nos citoyens, y compris par les jeunes à la recherche d’un emploi.  Il nous reste encore beaucoup à faire pour passer d’un regain de confiance à une véritable adhésion à un projet d’avenir commun. Le prochain Conseil européen, d’ici dix jours, doit être l’occasion de faire quelques pas de plus dans cette direction, dans le même esprit d’urgence et d’énergie qui ressort des discours récents de Jean-Claude Juncker, d’Emmanuel Macron et d’Antonio Costa. Nous devons maintenir fermement notre cap en répondant concrètement aux attentes et aux préoccupations de nos concitoyens, et en ne cédant rien sur nos valeurs, y compris le respect de l’état de droit. Le moment est venu de nous fixer des objectifs ambitieux mais réalisables d’ici 2025 pour une Union à vingt-sept plus unie, plus forte et plus démocratique. Honourable Members, the Europe we are working for each day is a Europe which protects its citizens, which empowers and defends them. The Digital Agenda which was at the heart of the discussions at the summit in Tallinn, and which will also be on the agenda for the European Council, is one example of where we really need to show concrete results. Since the start of the mandate, this Commission has presented some 40 initiatives, 24 of which are legislative proposals. We have proposed action ranging from making sure high quality internet is available in public spaces for thousands of local communities, to measures to combat threats to cybersecurity and to ensure that personal data is as well protected online as it is offline. We have launched a discussion about how best to ensure that services provided through online platforms are effectively taxed.  It is now time to find agreement on the 18 legislative proposals which are pending here in this House and in the Council. I hope that we can see tiny progress in particular on the telecoms package, the revision of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, and on our recent proposals on cybercrime.  The Commission would also like to see timely progress on the other new proposals made together with the State of the Union speech. Trade in particular is an area where urgent action is needed to take advantage of the momentum. The European Council will also pay particular attention to migration. Last week, the Commission presented our views on how to ensure and consolidate the ongoing work on the European Agenda on Migration. We have identified where and what further efforts are needed in coming months. Particular attention must be given to stepping up returns and to resettlement, whilst the reform of the Common European Asylum System in Dublin now needs to be completed as soon as possible. We must also continue our work with priority third countries and the Commission would like to see a concerted effort from leaders when it comes to the issue of financing, where we need to live up to our collective promises and we are living up to them today.  Finally, the European Council will also review progress on defence. The Commission is closely following the developments on Permanent Structured Cooperation. The Commission wants to incentivise greater cooperation in defence in line with the Treaty and stands ready to support it with the instruments at its disposal. For this, we need to ensure an early agreement on the proposed European defence industrial development programme. Honourable Members, together we have more or less 18 months to finish the job and deliver on the 10 priorities on the basis of which this House approved the college in 2014. If we fail, this will be a collective failure. To the outside world it makes no difference whether we failed because the Commission made the wrong proposals, or Parliament or Council took too long. When we succeed, it will be our collective success. When we fail, it will also be our collective failure. I set out in the road map for a more united, stronger and more democratic Union. Europe now has an opportunity to look further ahead. The road map sets out a path to March 2019 when our Union will sadly become a union of 27. It is in Sibiu, Romania, on the banks of the Cibin river in Transylvania, that we should reassert this Union and our confidence in our future together, a Union based on our values, a Union of equals, a Union able to deliver for its citizens on the things that matter the most.  We saw in Tallinn that there is now a real appetite amongst European leaders to move forward together, but we cannot wait until March 2019 to start the work and we cannot be bogged down in process, treaty changes or institutional wrangles in the meantime. That is why in the letter of intent, Jean-Claude Juncker and I laid out a concrete set of actions which are all achievable under the current treaties to prepare the Europe of 2025. I can assure you that we will continue to work alongside you every step of the way, starting with a social summit in Gothenburg where I hope we can  proclaim the European Pillar of Social Rights. And then in December, with the euro area summit underpinned by concrete proposals to deliver a strong economic and monetary union and ensure the lasting stability and success of our European single currency.  This summit will be inclusive with the participation of those EU members whose intention is to introduce the euro before 2025. I know Jean-Claude is looking forward to organising the summit together with President Tusk. The Commission will then present its full package of proposals on the EMU on 6 December. For Dutch and Flemish people, I would say on St Nicholas day.  I trust that the Commission can count on the full support of this House as we implement the road map together. Let’s use the next 18 months to deliver positive changes in the lives of Europeans and to set the course for a more united, stronger and more democratic Union for the future. (Applause)", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Manfred Weber", "mepid": "28229", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, Mr Vice-President, Mr Councilor, my dear colleagues! People expect practical action from us, and I would like to thank both the Council representative and Frans Timmermans for this basic direction that we are now dealing with the issues that concern the people. I also think it's important what Frans Timmermans did, namely to talk about the successes first. We can only convince people of our project and take them with us if we talk about successes. The growth in the euro area is strong and solid, we have reduced unemployment to pre-crisis levels, the debt in the euro area, in the European Union - compared with the Americans, with the Japanese, with other major currency areas - is low. We have also made significant progress on the second major task, namely solving the migration issue. Compared to 2015, when we had the large migration flows, the numbers at the external border were reduced by over 80%. Europe delivers, Europe moves forward, and we can tackle the big tasks together. And yesterday, too, we achieved a great success: our colleague Salvatore Cicu and all those responsible in the other political groups found new investment protection and new WTO regulations - in partnership with all parties. We want world trade, but we Europeans also want to be able to defend ourselves when unfair world trade is practiced. Big steps for this continent! I believe that we are entitled to talk about Europe delivering. The Council is about the tasks that now lie ahead of us. The main topic is certainly the great open wound on the continent, and that is still the question of migration. Despite successes, there is still no legislative solution as to how we can permanently solve the migration issue. It is clear to the EPP Group that Europe must help. We need people who flee the civil war, offer shelter. On the other hand, we need control and a strong state that puts a stop to the gangs of smugglers and organized crime. That is why we have to work on further developing border protection. Why don't we further strengthen Frontex - for example by building up additional capacities for direct intervention at certain borders of the Schengen area? Second, we need cooperation with the United Nations. Last week's Commission proposal to offer a 50 000 resettlement quota is the right way to go. Controlled and structured by the United Nations, bringing people in need to Europe in order to offer them better care based on humanitarian criteria, as well as security checks - that is the right way to go. The third thing we have to make clear is that the asylum issue is not an issue. Asylum is a fundamental right of the European Union, which we have fought for through many bloody experiences that we have had. That is why the right of asylum should not be an issue in any way. Real help is needed there. And last but not least: Solidarity with Africa, fighting the causes of displacement. Europe will only be able to live in peace in the long term if Africa also has a reasonable future. The second big issue is the digital agenda. I would like to thank you for the many proposals that the Commission has put on the table. The urgency is obvious. Europe can only move forward if we act together to achieve economies of scale. We have to strike a balance between taking advantage of opportunities and simultaneously implementing our values. I would like to make it clear to the EPP Group that we as Europeans already have the task of giving this digital single market a framework that is shaped by our values. For example, the copyright that we are currently debating is a value that we recognize to have. We need to protect intellectual property. That must also be enforced in the digital world, principles must be enforced, because this is the only way we will defend our way of life. The next big issue will be security policy and foreign policy. I would like to single out two more points on foreign policy. On the one hand, on behalf of my group, I would like to show that I fully support Federica Mogherini and our external colleagues that we consider the agreements with Iran to be existential. It would be a catastrophic development if we now open a second nuclear conflict in this world in addition to the North Korea conflict. What Europe has achieved there with the Iran Agreement is an example of the fact that we are not resolving these conflicts through war, but through diplomatic means with agreements. We hope that Europe speaks a clear language. Last but not least, I would like to make a political note: we are experiencing our ongoing struggle against populism and extremism on this continent. We had positive experiences like in France, we also had negative experiences like now in Germany, for example, where populists and extremists are moving back into parliament in strength. In other words, the debate, the fight against these simplifiers, remains on our table. I would just like to say one thing, and that, dear Gianni Pittella, in the direction of social democracy, because in the German experience on election evening a week ago we saw that German social democrats refused to talk about forming a government from the start . Martin Schulz decided to immediately join the opposition. I personally believe that it is right that we as Democrats talk to each other first. Going into the opposition may be the result of conversation, but it is not the starting point for going into the opposition. I'm bringing this up here because that's what we're in the The Netherlands have seen it because we have seen it in Spain, too, that social democracy is increasingly evading responsibility.I hope that doesn't catch on.(Applause from the EPP Group)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Gianni Pittella", "mepid": "4436", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, dear colleague Weber, I do not think it is appropriate to discuss the German elections while the next European Council is being discussed. But if you really want an answer on this point, I welcomed Mr Schulz's decision to take note of the conclusion of the grand coalition in Germany, as we did here in the European Parliament a few months earlier. This does not mean that we cannot collaborate: it is one thing to have a strong, true dialectic between right and left, moderate conservatives and progressives, and one thing is to do the big coalitions. Yesterday we demonstrated, on the issue of recognizing China as a market economy, that Parliament, while maintaining this strong dialectic, can work together and we have achieved a great result, defending European industries and European workers. I want to thank the comrades and colleagues of the Socialist Group who played a crucial role, starting with my colleague Moscow, my colleague Maurel and President Bernd Lange. I have heard comforting words from Frans Timmermans, First Vice-President, which are in line with the report made by President Juncker and I want to say to the European Commission: the Socialists are ready, they have always been ready! When it comes to action and doing, we are ready; when it comes to having courage, we are ready! We are not ready and we are against, when you put your head in the sand. We must challenge the Council, together, in a constructive way, but in a clear way. On immigration we await convincing answers. The fact that flows have been reduced by 80% cannot reassure us about the elimination of the root causes of migratory flows; indeed, we must use this phase to address the root causes that push thousands and thousands of people to come to Europe and we must not trade the causes with the effects and wrong therapy. The therapy cannot be to force Europe and Africa into a fortress. Therapy cannot be to build new walls! I say this to the Council and I say it to the Commission: the idea of ​​creating new borders, of strengthening the internal borders of European states, of extending the time at these borders is the wrong weapon to tackle a serious problem which is that of terrorism. It is legitimate for Member States to equip themselves with effective tools in the fight against terrorism, but do not delude yourself that you are curing a serious problem with aspirin! Aspirin can cause stomach ulcers: internal borders can abolish a great European achievement which is the free movement of people within the European Union. And be careful not to transform the hotspots, which are a tool for the emergency management of flows, into a tool for the ordinary management of migratory flows. It is not fair, it is not useful, it is not effective to do these things. In recent days we have appealed to President Tusk to finally recognize the Council of Bulgaria in Romania and, in due time also for Croatia, the right to be part of the Schengen area but also to finally reform the Dublin regulation: the Parliament he is doing his job - as always - and the Council must begin his! Here we cannot say: \"Europe does not work\". No! The Commission has made a proposal and Parliament is working on it. It is the Council that did not open the file! This is the truth. We want to say it clearly and loudly: when the Council opens it, I will say: \"Good Council, you are doing well, you are doing well\" and we must clearly say that the rule that states that it is the first country of arrival to take on all the burdens and of all responsibilities is contrary to the spirit of unity and solidarity that must exist in the European Union. Finally, Africa. Colleague Weber also spoke about it: he tells me pleasure, because this idea is spreading that Africa is our priority.Two years ago the Trust Fund was launched in Valletta;well, great foresight of Vice President Mogherini and the European Commission.But the Member States that fed that fund were very few: here too I say this to the representative of the Council: take it upon himself!Africa is not a slogan: Africa is an issue that requires answers.The 44 billion euro investment plan is doing well: but those investments must be conveyed and aimed at interventions that really create development and create jobs, because this serves to give African girls and boys a future and also to reduce migration flows.I am increasingly convinced that the solution of our global and local challenges is coming from Africa.I would like to conclude with a beautiful phrase by Fatou Diome.\"We must stop with the hypocrisy: we will be rich together or we will all drown together\".", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Ryszard Antoni Legutko", "mepid": "96796", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, it is highly probable that the Council will start with everyone congratulating Chancellor Merkel on her electoral victory. Indeed, Ms Merkel should be congratulated. Firstly, because she won for the fourth time, which is remarkable; secondly, because she won after having made the worst political decision of her life: opening the European borders without bothering to consult anyone. So much for solidarity, by the way.  Yet, while Ms Merkel’s victory was a success, it should also be viewed in equal measure as a wake-up call for Europe. After all, the two main parties scored the worst results for years, something that only months ago happened in the French elections too. For many years, Germany epitomised what political science calls ‘consensual politics’. We had a sample of it a while ago in what Mr Weber said, to put it crudely, a sort of united front in which everyone tends to speak with one voice. But if in a country like this – and Germany is just such an example, because of its remarkable political culture – we see some cracks in the hitherto monolithic structure, perhaps we are witnessing the beginning of some kind of pluralism underway in the western part of the European Union.  As for me – and on this point I believe I differ from most of you – I believe it is a good thing and long overdue, considering the stifling atmosphere of European politics, the absence of any serious debate, and the routine bullying of anyone who dares to voice a different opinion. The Council will take up for the nth time the problem of immigration – perhaps the most misrepresented, mystified, lied about, contaminated to the core by political correctness, problem of recent decades. The good thing is that the infamous mandatory relocation scheme is now history. It is dead. It is dead and gone. It is an ex—relocation scheme. But from the very beginning this was a bad idea. This was a stillborn idea, and whatever progress we have achieved in controlling immigration – and we have made some progress – this scheme had nothing to do with it whatsoever. Will this idea disappear? I am not sure. Experience has taught us that in the European Union bad ideas die hard. There has been a lot of talk about the new European asylum policy, and it is a good thing that we should be working on it and making it better and better. President Macron mentioned it in his speech too, but President Macron’s speech was not really the exposition of a strategy as a lot of us expected it to be. It was more – I apologise for the comparison – like a pep talk, but beautifully delivered as always. So whatever shape this asylum policy – and everything that surrounds it that is related to immigration – will take, it should not repeat the errors of the past. The asylum policy on immigration is not a matter for a majority to decide. There has to be a consensus of all Member States. Otherwise, we will be back in the situation where the big guys do what they want, they can get away with anything and they order the others are not so strong to obey. That has to be over. Demographic policy is too subtle and too complex a problem to be imposed by the European political and ideological bulldozers. Of course, anything is possible so it can be predicted that remarks like mine will be ignored and the EU will sink more deeply into the sea of troubles, because we are already quite deep in the sea of troubles. There should be some hard thinking rather than going in the same direction with the same remedy – whatever happens, more of the same. That is not a solution. I have serious doubts if the coming Council will start rethinking, but I really hope they do. I do hope against hope.  (Applause from the ECR Group)", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Guy Verhofstadt", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, I hope for two things for this European Council. The first has been already echoed by other colleagues, namely that there can be a breakthrough in the migration package. In fact, if there is one role the European Council can play, it is on that because they have to give political direction. So a conclusion by the European Council, where they push forward the package as it has been introduced by the Commission is what we need now, because we can continue to complain about Dublin, which is not a European system of asylum, we can continue to complain about the lack of legal migration ways in Europe, and we can continue to complain about the bad management of our outside borders, but the proposals are there. We need a European Council which in fact now steers the Ministers of the Interior responsible in that direction. So that is my first wish.  My second wish for this European Council is to further take up the work on the reform of the European Union. My fear is that – you know how it is – there are elections in France, elections in the Netherlands, elections in Germany and then it is like– I cannot say a pudding, because that is a British word I think – a soufflé, that is maybe a French word, and then suddenly we go back to business as usual. Business as usual for the last 18 months before the European elections. That cannot be the case. I think that President Juncker made an enormous effort on this reform of the European Union with his State of the Union speech, I think that President Macron made an enormous effort with his important intervention on the future of the European Union, and we hope to see other leaders express themselves on this. I do not even see big differences. The whole discussion about the difference between the Macron speech and the Juncker speech is that one is saying we are going to do it in one circle and the other is saying that we are going to do it in two circles. But on the content, we agree and not only do they agree, but also this House because let me recall that, at the beginning of this year, we adopted three important reports on the future of the European Union which were completely in line with President Juncker’s State of the Union speech and which were completely in line with the proposals of the French President. (Applause from ALDE and Vert Groups)  So it is the moment – and that is my message to the Council – to pick this up and not to lose the momentum because it is true what Manfred Weber said. It is not the end of nationalism. It is not the end of populism. It will be the end of nationalism and populism if we are capable of reforming the European Union, changing the European Union and breaking the deadlock that exists. In that sense, I think there are doubts – the Liberals in Germany, will there be an obstacle, yes or no? – but I can tell you one thing. I know the FDP. It is a genuine pro-European party still anchored in the legacy of Hans—Dietrich Genscher, in favour of a European defence union, in favour of European transnationalism, and in favour of European capacities in investigation and intelligence. If there is a difference in the point of view on the eurozone, we know that there are rules to be applied in the eurozone and we want a new governance of the eurozone. Well, the one is not in contradiction with the other. You need both of them. You need a new governance to have a sustainable eurozone and to apply these rules.  So my last wish – and this is not for the Council President but more for us – is what is the role we are going to play in this? It is this House that has to take the lead on this reform and this debate on the European Union. So my plea to you – and I know that you are in favour – and also to the plenary is let’s organise here, every session, this debate on the future of the European Union. Secondly, let’s ask, through our Committee on Constitutional Affairs, to have regular meetings with the national parliaments because we are not going to reform the European Union without the help of these national democracies and these national parliaments. Finally, let’s put the three institutions together – the Commission, the Council, the Parliament – in such an endeavour.

The Geneva Convention on the Protection of Refugees was one of these. Now the European Council is to talk about stemming illegal flows on all migration routes. That same Geneva Convention states very clearly that illegal entry can never be held against refugees, so this type of language undermines respect for the elementary rights of refugees. I call upon the Council to rephrase the wording, putting the emphasis again on Europe’s tradition of caring about people, and to make sure that the refugees are protected. In the field of human rights, ambition is lacking more generally. The Commission is making no progress whatsoever with the ratification by the EU of the European Convention on Human Rights, nor with the European Social Charter. When, First Vice-President Timmermans, can we expect to see a breakthrough here? In a few weeks’ time, in Geneva, the UN will again discuss a convention on business and human rights. The Commission and the Member States are not driving forces there, indeed they are reluctant to participate, whereas we all know about inhuman practices, in closing factories, or in mines, and in Africa and developing countries generally. If we want dignity and stability, we need to invest in respect for human rights, including by our companies, instead of in arms and defence. We all saw the tragic pictures of the attack in Las Vegas. It is cynical that, after such an attack, arms sales in the USA go up – for so-called self-defence. This is a vicious circle: the more arms people buy, or a state buys, the more attacks. Let us learn from this. Instead of speaking about more defence, let us stick to the European tradition of promoting human rights, including through radical disarmament treaties. We should not fall into the Trump vicious circle. Let us be different, let us be ourselves and let us invest in human rights and not in arms.

I think they were right because, little by little, our Union seems to be won over by this cancer of the mind, which would like to reduce our societies to an opposition between “them” and “us”, like a landscape without nuances, frozen, in black and white, the realm of real and virtual walls which, when they are not concrete or barbed wire, are erected by words or actions. In such a world, we are constantly called to choose our side. There are plenty of examples. Remember the euro crisis, which separated Europe between creditor states, by definition virtuous in everything, and debtor countries, necessarily guilty of everything. On the issue of posted workers, there would be the ugly profiteering Member States, and the nice Member States victims of social dumping. After the terrorist attacks, I remember a French prime minister asserting that to explain was already a little excuse, or even here, that refusing the general surveillance of our society would be tantamount to being an accomplice of the killers. Finally, any call for Europe to take its responsibilities to do more and better in welcoming migrants is immediately denounced as an unbearable call or a threat to our identity. Dear colleagues, what happened last Sunday in Barcelona is the result of this binary logic, according to which you have to choose sides. Faced with the obvious dissatisfaction of a majority of citizens of Catalonia with the status of their region, the government in Madrid has chosen denial. Over the years, this stubborn refusal to engage in dialogue has led to unilateral actions, certainly, but peaceful, of which nothing, absolutely nothing, can justify the violent repression which we have witnessed. And make no mistake, because you will ask me what is the connection with the Council? Make no mistake about it! What is playing out in Catalonia at the moment is not only a Spanish affair, it affects the European Union in its foundations, because what is the European Union, if not a conscious and resolute decision to resolve our conflicts and differences through dialogue, negotiation and compromise rather than violence. Isn't our motto \"Unity in Diversity\", a diversity that we choose to see as an asset, rather than a handicap? It is all of this that is at stake today in the Spanish constitutional and political crisis. That’s why, Mr. Juncker or Mr. Timmermans, that’s why, Mr. Tusk, you cannot remain spectators. Who can understand the silence and inaction of the Commission? Who could understand, Mr Maasikas, that the European Council meets next week ignoring a crisis which, far more than Brexit, can undermine the very spirit of European integration? If this is an internal matter, Mr Timmermans, it is an internal matter within the European Union. If anything needs to be done to help reconnect the thread of dialogue between Spain and Catalonia, it is up to the European Union to do so. And there is urgency. Let us not wait for further unilateral steps to take place, which would make a negotiated solution even more difficult.

That sets you apart from Mr Timmermans, who has not talked about migration for so long. You talked about the upswing that can be seen everywhere, about the values ​​we want to preserve, about the digital agenda, about cybersecurity, broadband expansion, trade. But you hardly touch the all-important issue on which the future of the European Union will be decided. But that's how it is. We are two years after the outbreak of the dramatic refugee crisis and there are still two unanswered questions. First, how do we prevent millions more from entering Europe? Second, how do we bring back those who came here illegally? We have to state that the Balkan route is still not sealed. Those who are committed to it are attacked as hard as possible. This is Mr Orbán, he is being attacked and not defended. At the same time we support Macedonia - not a member of the EU, not a member of the Schengen area. There we build fences, there we support fence construction. But if Mr Orbán does that, he will be criticized. We make deals with warlords all over the world - e.g. on the Bosporus. B. with Mr. Erdoğan. This is completely the wrong way. We still don't have the Australian solution. We have to like France suspend the European Convention on Human Rights so that we can rescue the refugees in the Mediterranean, but then drag them back and not across to Europe. Instead, we also make deals with Libyan warlords - it's all wrong. Mr Juncker said that 36% of illegals are deported, pushed back - an astonishing number! In Germany it is around 5%. How Mr. Juncker gets 36% - I don't know. Refugees - this is being completely forgotten - only have temporary protection, a temporary right to stay, and if there is an opportunity to return in the states from which they come or to set up protection zones there so that they can return, then we must support that . That is what we should focus on. And of course I'm talking about Afghanistan and Syria. But, Mr Timmermans and the Council, keep talking about broadband expansion. Then we shall see how this Union develops. If you touch the right topics at some point, we may move forward.

I will start with the question of immigration. Mr Timmermans explains to us that he now wants to further strengthen Frontex. But Frontex is an illusion! A few weeks ago, I was in Warsaw where I visited the site of this agency. It was explained to us very well that, in the end, most of the work of the coast guards and border guards consisted of boarding the boats of illegal migrants to secure their approach in Italian territorial waters, before letting them settle in. the European continent. The European Union has never had the slightest will to prevent or curb illegal immigration. It has never implemented effective means to ensure the return to their country of origin of illegal immigrants. Moreover, today, when we talk about the issue of asylum, we are told that the rules must be harmonized, and this harmonization will obviously go in the direction of ever more flexible criteria, which make asylum today become a full fledged sector of illegal immigration. This allows millions of people to arrive on the European continent with no prospect of ever being deported. Moreover, what is very revealing in our debates is that we never mention the technical means that the European Union or the European nations could implement to organize the return of these migrants to their country of origin. 'origin. As far as defense is concerned, the permanent structured cooperation that you want to strengthen corresponds to a desire now displayed to suppress the sovereignty of nations. We know that there are considerable disparities between the different Member States, that some have ambitions and military forces, and others, much less. It is linked both to the history and to the unique capabilities of each nation. It is obvious that defense interests are totally different, sometimes divergent, and even contradictory. You have to accept it. And if we force harmonization or enhanced cooperation with a view to a hypothetical European defense, we will end up in the field of defense, as in all other fields, in the collective impotence of our nations. Digital is obviously a very important subject, but let's start by talking again about industrial issues. The European Union has no industrial strategy. We can clearly see with the Alstom-Siemens affair that we are subject both to American interests - Mr. Macron was in the front line to dismantle Alstom from part of its activities - and mainly today, to German interests, which are defended to the detriment of those of other nations. In economic matters, Mr Timmermans, you tell us that the recovery is there, which is false. The truth is, you only consider growth points and growth prospects. But growth is what you think of economics. It will perhaps be there, and undoubtedly in more limited proportions than you say it, but it relates to the financial economy, which does not necessarily correspond to an increase in employment, nor to a improvement in purchasing power. That is, the distortion will always be greater between your purely financial conception of the economy and the real economy, which itself continues to suffer. As for your desire for fiscal or social harmonization, this will again lead to a race to the bottom. When you look at the wage differences that exist between Eastern and Western Europe, this harmonization would obviously be disastrous. To conclude, I would like to respond to Mr Weber. Mr Weber, you present yourself as a great democrat, but suffer democracy, accept the verdict of the ballot box and respect the six million Germans who voted for our AfD allies.Respect the 90 members of this party in the Bundestag, who have said and still say clearly that they are tired of the crazy policy that you supported and that Mrs Merkel pursued, which consisted in organizing the migratory invasionfrom Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 11, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Bruno Gollnisch (NI).", "mepid": "1164", "text": "- Mr President, some of the speeches I have heard, whether they come from the Council, the Commission or other speakers, bring back old memories to me because I have been a Member of this institution for almost 28 years. I have heard for 28 years that when it comes to migration, we have to tackle the causes, but the problem is that we have never tackled the causes and that we will continue to not tackle it. What would it mean to \"tackle the root causes\" in the current situation? This would, for example, be dealing with the abominable regime in Eritrea, which forces the particularly male population of that country to come to Europe to escape military service for life. But for that, of course, we would have to enter into a relationship with the African Union. Tackling the causes would mean not giving up a large part of the Libyan coast to traffickers, but that would obviously require concerted action. It is not only, as the previous speaker excellently pointed out, sending boats to pick up potential migrants, after receiving a phone call from the traffickers indicating that the boat is two or three miles from the coast. , as a French admiral responsible for the European armed force on the spot told me personally.

It is good that the European Council will be talking about the future of the European Union in two weeks' time and that we do not only have to deal with current crises. We have to look ahead and say specifically what the European Union has to do. I say yes to a strong, efficient Europe where we need common solutions - in the fight against terrorism, in defense, in asylum and migration and in international trade. Yes, we need a common European asylum law, an effective border protection. We have to introduce biometrically secured identification documents and return refugees who have no right of residence, and we have to get involved in Africa too. I think it's very good that one of the priorities at the European Council is migration and asylum. I would like to remind colleagues on the right-hand side, who want to show us that we have not delivered anything, achieved nothing, once again, very clearly, with the figures. I don't even know why we're discussing when no one is listening. Both Vice-President Timmermans and the representative of the Council made it clear: 80% fewer refugees, less immigration than a year ago, two years ago. If that's not a success, then I have to ask myself the question: Where do we actually live? We fought the smugglers, we fought the people smugglers on site, dear colleagues. And if we talk to the African states, that is the right solution. That is not all easy and good, but - sorry - we are tackling this problem consistently together in Europe.

Recently, three speeches of three leaders – Juncker, Macron and Antonio Costa – have showed important overlaps from different political sensitivities. This means something, but let me be clear about the real meaning of delivery. If we want to deliver on the migration crisis once and for all, we need to prepare a much stronger partnership for African development, and we need to create a real European asylum agency. If you want to deliver better social equality in Europe in this digital age, we need to have a strong pillar to ensure that everybody in employment can count on a decent labour contract and access to social protection. If you want to close these divergences which we still have in Europe, you need to have a community budget and a Eurozone budget working for convergence.

Migration is very divisive, gives rise to tensions and controversies. On the other hand, the single digital market is indisputable, uncontroversial. Of course, all simplifications are confusing, because although the digital revolution is inevitable, the different levels of advancement of the member states can create or deepen a multi-speed Union in an economic sense.

Reception in your own region leads to more efficient use of available resources and therefore makes it easier to return to your own country. More pressure should be put on third countries that do not cooperate in curbing illegal migration. Development aid and partnerships must be linked to the willingness of these countries to take back rejected asylum seekers and illegal immigrants.

All the topics for the Council meeting in two weeks' time are very important. Let me reflect on these. With regard to the migration situation, I would like to emphasize that a successful immigration policy can only be pursued on the basis of the views of European citizens. We Hungarians reject an unrestricted immigration policy. There is a need for effective but strict border protection, for assistance to persecuted locally, for controlled protocols that focus only on real refugees. Economic migrants must be returned to their country of origin as soon as possible, in accordance with the will of the taxpayers. I would like to refer to the recently adopted Ukrainian Education Law, which unacceptably undermines the right to use the language of the Hungarian, Slovak, Romanian and Polish national minorities living in Transcarpathia. I very much hope that the European Council will address this deeply infringing situation at its meeting and send a clear signal to the Ukrainian authorities. With regard to Digital Europe, I would like to emphasize that this can only be successful if services are accessible.

So you cannot wait until the last moment to deal with the social dimension of the digital universe. What does that mean? Our colleague Kósa has just spoken of accessibility, but there is also the question of the status of workers in the digital field, and from this point of view, access to protection, to the portability of rights, training, the possibility of leading collective claims, is a new challenge for social law that you must also tackle. Then, of course, there will be no social justice for digital workers if there is not an adapted tax system and, from this point of view, the initiatives which are launched here and there, a little in disorder, must not undermine the real reform of modernity in the fiscal field, which is that of corporate tax.

Digital technologies are the future if we want to have a competitive European economy on our continent, and it must guarantee better and more accurate content, cybersecurity and personal data protection, as well as the big issue of eHealth. However, when the Council pays attention to the topic of migration, let it stop talking, action is needed. The return of illegally staying and entering the European Union is a priority. For years, we have only heard talk about reforms in the Dublin Agreement, not action. Enough hypocrisy regarding the admission of Bulgaria and Romania into the Schengen area. I ask, or rather call on the Minister, to put this on the agenda in the Council as well. The feeling of a large part of European citizens is that the European Union, without distinguishing between institutions, is ineffective. The Council is called upon to change this. My call is for less talk and real action for more security. More common commitment to defense and effective foreign policy.

It is migration and foreign policy. Migration pressure has now eased and the EU is in good shape. But we must expect further migratory pressures in the future. It is a reality and we have gained time to prepare better now. I therefore expect the European Council summit to reflect on the effectiveness of existing measures so that we do not repeat mistakes in the future. It must not happen that the EU is taken aback again and not ready, which is why I support security as a priority. We must focus on protecting the borders of the Schengen area, speeding up return and assistance in countries of origin and transit, which are key, for example, with Libya's assistance, both financially and in terms of security capacity, in cooperation with the United Nations. This is where we need to strengthen return and resettlement policies in the nearest countries of origin. As regards the proposal for a common asylum system, reform of the asylum system is needed in terms of better coordination. And the decision to grant asylum must remain fully in the hands of the Member States, because the Member States are responsible for internal security.

Many of the comments were made about the situation in Spain. I have taken careful note of all the comments, and I would like to refer those who put the questions and made the comments to the statement I will make on behalf of the Commission later today in this plenary. Now, going back to the agenda of the European Council, it is clear to me that there is a strong convergence of views between the Commission and the European Parliament on such issues as the digital single market, the social pillar and tackling the enormous challenge of migration. Let me reiterate that last week we put on the table a number of proposals in a holistic approach to the migration issue. There is not one silver bullet that will solve this challenge to Europe and its societies. We can only be successful in managing the challenge of globalisation and migration in that framework if we are better at protecting our external borders; if we make agreements with countries of origin to offer prospects to people where they are instead of having people think they need to find a better future elsewhere; if we have agreements with the countries of transit; if we are more successful at combating human trafficking, at combating this terrible criminal activity on the backs of innocent people; but also if we understand that the Dublin Agreement was made at a time of different challenges and that now it needs to be adapted to the world of today and tomorrow. This means that the issue of solidarity cannot be avoided and must also be tackled in this framework. It is my firm belief that, although there are different emphases in different Member States on parts of the package, the package as a whole is the only way forward. I count on the strong support of the European Parliament to convince the leaders of the Member States that this should be done now, with a sense of urgency, so that we can show Europeans, before the next European elections, that Europe is capable of answering their call that we should do better at managing migration and that we should do more for our collective security.

I will convey them to the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, as it is he who sets the agenda of European Council meetings. On the Presidency’s behalf, I note that the reform of the Common European Asylum System was mentioned repeatedly during the debate. As first Vice-President Timmermans said, we should not lose sight of the fact that there are seven legislative proposals under this reform of the Common European Asylum System. Good progress has been made on some of them, others are already in the negotiation phase between the Council and Parliament, but the reform of the Dublin Regulation remains controversial. It was rightly mentioned that some Member States have not moved on this proposal, and I would add that this is the case with not just one but both extremes in this particular debate. Estonia is doing what the Presidency must do: we are in intense consultations with the Member States. The Estonian Minister for the Interior, at the Ministers’ meeting next week, will present the state of play, and we are also looking for guidance from the European Council meeting in two weeks’ time on that particular legislative proposal. The broader debate on the future of Europe was discussed over dinner at the Tallinn Digital Summit. President Tusk’s conclusion was that, within two weeks, he will consult the Heads of State and Government of the EU Member States and will then set out his way forward in this debate. Last, but not least, I would like to thank all the Members of this House for their comments on the digital single market and, more broadly, on the digital society. Ms Berès, Mr Kelam and others rightly brought out various aspects of the digital society. The debate is not only about the digital single market proposals, it is much broader, and the digital revolution affects us all. There was overwhelming agreement and a common understanding at the Tallinn Digital Summit last week that all these aspects must be tackled by the European leaders.

The end of sugar quotas ends up having a political meaning that marks the end of a shift towards the complete liberalization of supply that is now governed solely and exclusively by the law of the market.

In Europe, after the Second World War, then after the end of dictatorships in Spain, Portugal and Greece, and again after the fall of the Berlin Wall, we have shaped our democratic societies on the basis of three principles: democracy, respect for the rule of law, and human rights. The three need each other. They cannot exclude each other. You cannot use one against the other. If you remove one pillar, then the others will fall too. Respect for the rule of law is not optional: it is fundamental. If the law does not give you what you want, you can oppose the law, you can work to change the law, but you cannot ignore the law. (Applause) So it is fundamental that the constitutions of every one of our Member States are upheld and respected, and this is the basis for our debate today. In that debate, we should be guided by the values set out in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union, values which are common to Member States and citizens, and on which our Union is founded. As Jean-Claude Juncker said in his State of the Union address to this House last month, our Union is not a state but it is a community of law. We must never lose sight of this. There is general consensus that the regional government of Catalonia chose to ignore the law when organising the referendum held last Sunday, the Spanish Constitutional Court having suspended the Catalan laws on the organisation of the referendum and issued daily penalties against those who went against its orders. That does not change the fact that we have all seen saddening images from Sunday. Let me be clear: violence does not solve anything in politics. It is never an answer, never a solution, and it can never be used as a weapon or instrument. Europe knows this better than anywhere else. None of us want to see violence in our societies. However, it is a duty of any government to uphold the rule of law, and this sometimes requires the proportionate use of force. We understand that people wanted to express their views. Freedom of expression is a fundamental right for all European citizens, and thus for all Spanish citizens. But one opinion is not more valuable than another opinion only because it is expressed more loudly. As the Commission has stated, under the Spanish Constitution Sunday’s vote in Catalonia was not legal. Looking ahead, it is clear that an agreed way forward is needed in Spain. In the Commission’s view, as President Juncker has reiterated repeatedly, this is an internal matter for Spain that has to be dealt with in line with the constitutional order of Spain. That is why the Commission has called on all relevant parties to move quickly now from confrontation to dialogue. The power of dialogue – of sitting down and talking to each other even if, and especially when, we passionately disagree – is what our Union is built on. All lines of communication must stay open. It is time to talk, to find a way out of the impasse, while working within the constitutional order of Spain. At the end of the day, the real answers can only come from all those concerned. Those directly concerned are all 46 million Europeans who are Spanish citizens. Those indirectly concerned are all Europeans who are citizens of all the other Member States. Jean-Claude Juncker is in touch with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who, I trust, will ensure that the situation is resolved in a spirit of dialogue and in full respect for the Spanish Constitution and the fundamental rights of citizens. This must be the goal for all of us. Allow me to stress that the development of Spain since the Spanish people liberated themselves from dictatorship is one of the greatest success stories Europe has seen in its history. (Applause) In less than my lifetime, Spain was transformed from a nation under the boot of a dictator into a nation that leads globally in a great many areas, where every citizen has full rights protected by the rule of law, where culture flourishes and the economy grows. This is the awe-inspiring achievement of all Spaniards, including Catalans. It would not have been possible without full respect for the rule of law, respect for the separation of powers, and respect for the rulings of judges. And, let me add, nowhere is attachment to the rule of law stronger than in those nations which have memories of what it means to be deprived of it. All this was achieved through hard work, commitment, dialogue and respect for diversity. Please let this inspire all of us to leave the path of confrontation and follow the road of cooperation and dialogue to resolve the situation.

We are very sorry for all those who were hurt. The news arriving from Catalonia is extremely worrisome. Citizens were hurt, but so also were policemen who were sent to stop the referendum – not by the Spanish Government, they were sent by Catalan judges to defend the rule of law. The European People’s Party (EPP) rejects force as a political solution. European history teaches us that violence is never an answer. What is at stake today is the integrity of an EU Member State, and this justifies the debate we are having today. An EPP Group colleague, who is from Catalonia, yesterday told us: ‘I am Catalan and I am Spanish.’ It is not a conflict between Catalonia and Spain, he said, it is a conflict within Catalonia. A government without a majority of votes in the last elections is using all means for this escalation. We as the EPP, cannot accept such a behaviour. Europe is built upon the rule of law and Spain is built upon the rule of law. There is no doubt that Spain is a country that guarantees fundamental rights for all citizens. We stand by the freedom to demonstrate. For a living democracy, freedom of demonstrations is not only indispensable, it is also desired. Nevertheless, demonstrations cannot replace a democratic decision-making process in a society. Not the protests on the streets, but the institutions in a democracy in Spain, will decide on the future of the country. Let me be very clear: mass demonstrations in Barcelona will not change the Constitution of Spain. Only democratic institutions can do so. For the moment, everybody is focusing on the separatists, but who is taking the perspective of the rest of the country into account? Spaniards from Catalonia, Aragon, Castilians, have been living together in one country over centuries peacefully and now an irresponsible government in Catalonia is splitting the country. The Spanish legal situation is clear for us: in Spain, no person in charge, not even the Catalan regional government, is allowed to disregard the law. The rights of all Spanish citizens have to be respected. It is unacceptable that a few Catalan politicians encourage civil servants, officials and citizens to break the law. From our point of view, the referendum is not valid. The legal base was not adopted in line with the Constitution of Catalonia. It is against the Spanish Constitution, and last Sunday, the Catalan authorities were changing the electoral law 45 minutes before the so-called referendum started. This is not credible behaviour.  Another point dear friends is also clear: we need an inner-Spanish dialogue, on the basis of Spanish law. We appeal to everybody, please sit all together. Instead of further escalations, we call upon all the actors involved to engage in dialogue in Spain, but first and foremost in Catalonia itself. A peaceful dialogue in Spain is necessary. We will not find a solution to this Spanish internal conflict here in the European Parliament. This conflict can only be solved by the Spanish people itself. The EU has neither the will nor the right to intervene in a true liberal democracy such as Spain. The dialogue has to be frank. The times in Europe in which division trumped compromise, hatred won over cooperation and egoism beat solidarity, have long gone. As a Bavarian, I know that nation states are compatible with proud regions. Europe needs both strong nation states and regional diversity. For today we appeal to the Catalan authorities: do not take irreversible steps and please keep in mind that whoever leaves Spain, leaves the European Union. This means leaving the internal market, leaving the Schengen area and leaving the Eurozone. Is this really in the Catalans’ best interest? Europe is living in historic times. This morning, we asked for more European cooperation in our debate. The European way of life does not need division, but unity in diversity. The European way of life needs not more nationalism but more cooperation. The European way of life needs not more egoism but solidarity and the willingness to compromise.

Let's forget our belongings for a moment: we have to pronounce only one word: \"Parad\" !, \"Stop\"! Sometimes a gesture is enough to change the course of history. And when you are on the edge of the abyss, it takes very little to fall into the abyss; but even a little gesture of reasoning and good will is enough for the dialogue to restart, as requested by the first vice president Frans Timmermans. First of all, I address the Government of the Catalan Generalitat. And I say it explicitly: a unilateral declaration of independence would be a further provocation and would add fuel to the fire after Sunday's useless referendum: a unilateral plebiscite imposed in open violation of the democratic Constitution and the rule of law. A regional government that represents less than 50% cannot harm the future of an entire people. The referendum was not legal, we have said so in many and it is not a legal wit. Challenging international legality today means helping to destroy that system of rules that has ensured peace in Europe over the last fifty years, which arose precisely to protect the weakest peoples against the will of the strongest. And we should look less superficially at the return of nationalism in Europe. When the flag of secession is raised, when identities tend to exclude rather than include, we know where we begin but we don't know where we end. Some of you will remember the sentence pronounced by François Mitterrand in his last speech to the European Parliament: \"le nationalisme, c'est la guerre\". It's the war! I will never give up on the idea that one can be Catalan, Spanish and European at the same time, without the need to create new states, new borders and there is an indissoluble thread that binds Catalonia, Spain, Spain, Europe: Europe was born to reconcile peoples. Europe was born to bring unity and peace. These days, while secession is being discussed in Spain, Germany is celebrating the anniversary of German reunification. Reconciliation: this is the raison d'être of the European Union. We were born for this and that is why we Europeans must do everything possible to get out of this impasse. We owe it not only because Spain is part of us, but because we are - or must be - defenders of Europe, of the essence of Europe, of the DNA of Europe. I also want to address the Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, without wishing to make controversy: I say with intellectual honesty that the management of this crisis could and should have been different. The Spanish and Catalan socialists have offered serious and practicable proposals, even contemplating the possibility of changing the Constitution. You can change but with your own tools, not in contempt of the laws and common rules: you work in this way in a state of law: respecting the laws. We may have different opinions but no Democrat can be pleased with the charges of the police and the clashes last Sunday. And when there is a disproportionate police raid, there is always the failure of politics. Now there is a need for a regeneration effort. We need a fresh start. And I want to appeal to the Catalan authorities: do not pronounce the declaration of independence this evening because this pronouncement could be the harbinger of new clashes and new disasters. The appeal is jointly addressed to Prime Minister Rajoy, so that, together with the other Spanish political forces, he may carry out the dialogue with all their strength, because Spain needs its integrity and its unity: a strong Spain, with internal realities. strong and autonomous within a rediscovered Europe.

We have just heard it talking about a union of values, but when we view the actions of the Commission in the handling of this particular situation in Catalonia, it looks more like a union of selective values. The double standards of the Commission is something that leaps to the eye. All are equal, but some are more equal than others. Everything depends on who is involved. Let us be honest, ladies and gentlemen, if it were another Member State rather than Spain, the consequences and the rhetoric from the Commission would have been far harsher.  I want to be clear: I do not believe the EU, or the European Commission for that matter, strengthens the EU’s unity through infringement proceedings, or triggering the articles of the Treaties or all the political point-scoring and suchlike. This polarises the debate and pushes Member States and its voters further away from the EU. I urge the Commission to practice the virtue of self-restraint, but consistently, not selectively.  Coming to Catalonia, I do believe – a rather simple-minded observation but always worth repeating – that significant progress can be made through patient negotiations. Whether and how soon an effective resolution is possible in Catalonia, I do not know, and very few people, if anyone, in this Chamber knows that. I wish to be honest with our Spanish colleagues: riot police and violent scenes have not helped but shocked and, whatever your intentions, those scenes will continue to be a part of the image of your government for some time. Let us admit it, the handling of the crisis was appalling. It was really appalling.  What are the next steps to be taken? Whether it involves constitutional reform, or the granting of a referendum or international mediation, the role of the Commission is probably as an intermediary or a go-between. It is for the Spanish Government, Spanish society and the Catalonian people to decide for themselves. However, I do caution that the passions of those citizens in Catalonia seeking a new settlement is unlikely to fade away by simply drowning out or ignoring the voices of dissent.  To sum it up, the action of the riot police, the conspicuous silence or the Aesopian language of the European Commission will not make the problem disappear.

That was the day that Colonel Tejero attempted his coup d'état. Javier Cercas, in his famous book ‘Anatomía de un instante’, describes how, under the threat of Tejero’s pistol, three Spanish political leaders stayed upright in their seats, refusing to hide under their benches. They were Santiago Carrillo, the historical leader of the Communist Party, Adolfo Suárez, the first Prime Minister of democratic Spain, and his deputy, General Guttiérrez Mellado. Despite the shots, not one of them blinked, an act of courage and determination that anchored forever democracy in Spanish souls. Spanish democracy was born under the pistol of the putschist Tejero, so no one among us has to give a lesson in democracy to Spain. (Applause) Now, 36 years later, Spanish democracy has to surmount itself again – to surmount this deep division and to overcome this existential crisis. It has to do so not by believing that the judiciary can solve the problems on its own, and certainly not by using deplorable violence, even though it is based on a court ruling. In other words, this cannot be done just by relying on the power of the state. No, what we need is a renewed political vision, an inclusive dialogue, a vision that the future and the interest of all people living in Spain lies in a multicultural, multilingual, federal state embedded in a multicultural, multilingual, federal Europe. It is true that you cannot go against the law and it is also true that you cannot govern without the law, but it is even more true that you cannot solve such a deep division only with the law. You also need to listen, to try to understand each other, to have dialogue and to talk with each other. That is the only way to find solutions, and that is the real strength of good politicians and of statesmen. To my friends in Catalonia, it is not in the interests of your citizens to pursue separatism at all costs. That the referendum was against the Constitution is not my main point. The point is that this referendum simply lacked basic democratic legitimacy. You knew very well in advance that a majority of Catalans would not participate and would stay at home, as the majority of them are against separation. It is not by accident that you did not even install a minimum threshold. So the result of this referendum was already known before it began. What do you call this? Manipulation? Deception? Moreover, to declare independence based on the outcome of a defective referendum is totally irresponsible, not so much for Spain, not so much for Europe, but for Catalonia itself. It will cause a fatal fracture in your society, a fracture that may be impossible to heal. Who is going to profit from this gamble? The anti-Europeans who, as we know, want to destroy our union and who have already started to abuse your cause and violate our treaties today.  (Applause) I urge all sides to stop the escalation and to go and sit around the table. The spirit there, around that table, has to be the understanding that the future of more than 70 European nations, the future of Catalonia, the future of my own Flemish community, lies not in brutal separation but lies in deep cooperation – cooperation inside federal structures in a federal Europe. Look a little bit – if I can ask that – to your own Basque countrymen. Look at what they have achieved, how they have developed their country, defeating terrorism and reinventing themselves, proud and autonomous.  (Applause) Finally, let me say that in politics it is not shameful to make compromises. The opposite is true. I have done it all my life and I am still alive. But, moreover, when you have to make a choice between the steps forward of a compromise or the standstill due to purity, then choose the way forward, however small the steps may be.

However, these events unfolded in Spain on Sunday, due to a government as cold as it was weak, sitting at the European Council table, as the European authorities looked away and let a nation of the Union tear itself apart. We ask you, Mr Timmermans, to condemn clearly and without delay the violence and repression in Catalonia, and to denounce the violation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This crisis is not foreign to us because we cannot accept the use of force in the European Union, any more than we can accept the unilateral proclamations of the government of Catalonia. We must ask the Spanish government to stop its escalation in tension, in the use of repression and police and military force. And we must ask the Spanish government, like the President of the Government of Catalonia, to put an end to this logic of confrontation, which can lead to the worst. The first victims will not be the politicians but the citizens and the people. Free from any interference, the European Union must offer its services to facilitate dialogue with a view to a peaceful and democratic way out of this crisis, with respect for international law, the founding pact of the Spanish constitution of 1978, history of Catalonia and Spain, and of the 1966 Civil and Political Rights Pact ratified by Spain, whose article the first states that \"all peoples have the right to self-determination\". Dialogue must therefore resume and we must encourage it. Let us help in the search for a compromise, which will undoubtedly require a common definition of the status of the referendum of last Sunday. Yes it is illegal, yes it does not have democratic legitimacy, but one cannot ignore the aspiration to express oneself, the democratic aspiration of the Catalans. At the same time, regional institutions must be respected, as well as the autonomous status of Catalonia. From there must begin a period of dialogue and in-depth debate in Catalonia and throughout Spain, with a view to the constitutional conference, at the end of which the people must be able to vote. More generally, this crisis once again raises the questions of ending the austerity policies imposed by the European Commission, the fight against territorial inequalities, and a fair distribution of wealth within the European Union and of each country. It also questions our conception of the European Union: either a Europe of cooperation and solidarity, a community of free and sovereign nations, or a federal Europe of competing regions, under even greater domination by industrial and financial powers. Our choice must be cooperation, solidarity and the union of free and sovereign peoples. The last word must go to democracy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 157, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Ska Keller", "mepid": "96734", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, last Sunday will be remembered as a sad day and, I think, not just in Spain but all over Europe. We saw peaceful citizens confronted with a huge police force ready to use all the force they had. Families, pensioners, people of all backgrounds, were confronted with a state that was willing to use almost all means to stop the referendum from taking place.  The world was watching while this was happening, while the riot police met people with brutality, charging with batons and even firing rubber bullets. Polling stations and hotels, schools and city halls and streets were turned into front lines between national police and their own citizens. What happened in Spain is unacceptable. I think it will unfortunately also set the image that we all have of the situation for the future. This was massive police violence against peaceful people, and that was beyond any proportionality. Violence so disproportionate cannot be justified, no buts and no excuses. Whatever you think about the referendum, whatever you think of independence, I think that has to be clear: that violence is not a mean for solving political conflict.  And whatever the views about the referendum and everything, it is also clear that the strategy of Prime Minister Rajoy has clearly failed. He has refused the dialogue that was offered and he has used and reverted more to judicial means, to police means. But the judges cannot solve a political problem, police cannot solve a political problem. Criminal prosecution cannot work that way. It is inappropriate. What we need is a political solution, but rather than doing that Rajoy has worsened the problem. He has escalated the situation. The massive mobilisation we saw yesterday: it is not just independentists who are appalled by what happened last Sunday. I really think that Rajoy has not really been helpful in this situation.  In the future, I believe the Spanish Government must refrain from using police violence against peaceful people. It must aim to find a political solution, because the Catalan crisis is a political crisis, a political problem and therefore it needs to be solved politically, not by police force. The political solution must always mean that people talk to each other, that all sides talk to each other.  I believe the European Union has a role to play in that because the whole affair is not just an internal matter for Spain. Spain and Catalonia are inside the European Union. President Juncker cannot sit on the fence and just watch from Berlaymont what is happening and how the conflict escalates. The Catalan crisis is a European affair. It goes to the heart of the European Union’s fundamental values because the European Union is built on the conscious decision to live together on this continent, settling our differences, however great they might be, through dialogue, through negotiation and through compromise rather than through violence. It is wrong, I believe, that the Commission shies away. It is its duty as the guardian of the Treaty to get involved and help in solving this problem, to offer mediation, to offer its help. I think this is something I would really expect of the European Union. Citizens all over Europe are looking at us, looking at what we are doing in the European Union. I think it is important that we offer our help, that we promote dialogue, that we tell both sides to stop escalations. The Commission can be an honest broker here.  Colleagues and Commissioner, I think it is very important that all of us understand how grave the situation is and how easily and how quickly it can escalate even further. No one knows what tomorrow will bring. I think if we have any chance at all to do something, to do our small bit, then we should do it. I believe, Mr Timmermans, that you have a chance to do something and I hope that we will use it all together. The Spanish and the Catalan Governments, of course, also have their responsibility. They have to agree to negotiate, to sit together, to accept mediation and to prevent further escalation. The whole crisis is a breakdown of the rules and the democratic consensus that so far ensured a peaceful and non-violent relationship between Spain and Catalonia. The right to self-determination is firmly anchored in international law, and both sides, both the Spanish Government as well as the Catalan Government, have to take the responsibility to find a common solution for how to put it into place in a peaceful and in a democratic way.  Further police violence and intimidation will not solve the problem. Many actors have called for dialogue, including all over Catalonia, such as the Mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, many people have called for dialogue. Colleagues here have said that this is the way forward. I think this is something we all have to agree on. The European Union is built on dialogue. We have to solve political problems by political means and dialogue is the only way forward.

This is not a good sign. We have all seen the media images regarding the attempted suppression of the independence referendum called by the Catalan Government over the weekend. My first question would be: why? Why did the Madrid Government feel it necessary to stop this in such a heavy-handed, brutal and, in the final analysis, counter-productive manner? It is blatantly obvious that by doing so, they have handed the initiative to the Catalan nationalists. Is the Madrid Government so afraid of its own people and so removed from political reality that it thought these actions would calm the situation?  Given that the Madrid Government has repeatedly stated, and we have heard it today, that a majority of Catalans do not want independence, and furthermore that the referendum had no validity under Spanish law, why did the government not simply state that whatever the result, the vote was null and void, and the Catalan Government was merely wasting everybody’s time and money? Instead of which we now have a template which every independence movement on our continent can use to provoke unrest. Mark my words: by their actions, Mr Rajoy and his advisers have lit a bonfire under your Europe. The fact that the EU’s institutions and its leaders have failed to recognise the human rights abuses which have taken place and have instead focused merely on legalistic verbiage shows how shallow the foundations of this project really are. Any ruling order that can condone acts of state violence has no popular legitimacy. Those Catalans who have looked to the EU for succour will be sorely disappointed. I feel that the only way the Spanish Government can restore trust is to accept that its behaviour was ill-conceived, launch an immediate independent committee of inquiry into the violence and state, that when the inquiry has concluded, a new and binding referendum under the auspices of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights will take place.

The Commission and Parliament opposed amendments to the Constitution of Hungary, which included the organisation of public broadcasters. The Commission and this Parliament are fully at ease with the condemnation of laws and constitutions of democratic states when they do not obey the diktats of Brussels. They claim that the EU is a community of values. What they do not say is that laws are subordinate to it, that democratic decisions, freedom and self-determination are subordinate to it. Freedom, democracy and human rights apply only to Member States that serve the EU agenda. For Spain, national sovereignty and the primacy of the Constitution apply. For Poland and Hungary, they do not. This EU is indeed a community of values: of double values and double standards. If you are in favour of the EU elitist, globalist agenda, then you can do anything. When you are against it, they will combat you using all available means. The hypocrisy of this Commission has no limits. In September last year, Mr Juncker explicitly condemned violence against Polish workers in the United Kingdom. In Spain 800 people have been beaten up and needed hospital treatment because hundreds of thousands were about to vote in a formally illegal referendum. In its declaration, the Commission stated only that violence can never be an instrument in politics. Certainly, violence does not belong in politics. And of course the state has the monopoly to use force to protect the rule of law. The state can use proportionate violence to stop unlawful behaviour or to prevent this from happening. But when hundreds of thousands illegally enter a country, would it be proportional to beat up 800 of them (so that they end up in hospital)? Would your response there be that violence can never be an instrument of politics? I am convinced that Mr Timmermans would explode in anger and this Parliament would demand immediate action, so let me be clear: I fully support the rule of law – that is, the rule of law of the sovereign nation state, the free nation state, the democratic nation state. That is the rule of law which should be defended. However, I certainly cannot accept the hypocrisy of this Commission and this Parliament, which are concealing the advancement of their own elitist economic interest under the guise of European values. I am completely against silencing opponents, against financing pro-EU propagandists and persecuting EU-sceptical parties and Member States, and I am telling Mr Timmermans and Mr Verhofstadt that Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union calls for respect for human dignity and equality.

I watched with horror as a grandmother’s blood washed down her tear-strewn face after a beating by the Spanish police. I watched as young people, hands held aloft in peace, were smashed by black-suited armed storm troopers and their wild batons. The shame on Spain rests mainly on Rajoy, and now also the King of Spain, for not only permitting the brutality of their police, but also – shamefully – for blaming the violence on those violated and seeking to dismiss the abused as the originators of the abuse. And what of the European Union’s response? Their first response should have been to completely condemn the violence. But no, whilst every right-minded person was outraged, they were critically silent on the violence. They sought to deflect the issue as a matter of breaking the rule of law by Catalans. This is from the EU, which recognised the independence of Kosovo without a referendum and which recognised Palestine as a nation state, even though the EU treaties did not permit it.  Twenty five years ago, Barcelona held the Olympics. The closing song was ‘Amigos para siempre’. It was written by a Brit, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and sung by a Catalan, José Carreras. It means ‘friends forever’.

The rule of law in our Union is the only thing that protects the weak from the power of the powerful. The rule of law is the only thing that protects what is small from what is big.

From the institutional position of the Commission, however, I have to insist on this point of the rule of law. I say this also because there is no doubt – not in this Chamber, and not even among those who are extremely critical – that the referendum held on Sunday was not within the remit of the rule of law.

To do this we have to go back a little to prehistory: 1972. he It starts with the monetary snake, the first failed attempt to constrain the exchange rates, only to be able to implement it in 1979 with the EMS. 1981: the Italians will remember him well; It is the year of the separation between the Bank of Italy and the Treasury Ministry by two federalists, as well as architects of this European Union, Ciampi and Andreatta, who handed over control of our public debt to the financial market. 1992: the triumphal entry into Maastricht, with the introduction of numerical constraints, such as the spending limit of 3%, based on any type of economic logic. Then, in 1999, the euro arrived, wanted by Prodi who declared: \"we will work one day less and we will earn as if we had worked one more day\". The truth is that they deprived us of monetary leverage, without telling us that they would have taken away the freedom to self-determine. And here we are in 2012: the year in which 25 out of 28 member states sign the fiscal compact, making binding the principle of balanced budget and the 60% debt / GDP parameter contained in Maastricht. In 2012, governments met for 5 years to discuss it. Those 5 years expire in 3 months and citizens, at Christmas, could find yet another transfer of sovereignty under the tree, because the fiscal compact will become legally superior to national legislation and will make liberal policies and austerity irreversible. The fiscal compact assumes the trap of the single debt as an indisputable framework within which to build the cage for social and labor rights and the privatization of common goods. If governments confirm the fiscal compact, my country for example, will be obliged for the next twenty years to bring the debt to GDP ratio from the current 133% to 60% through a reckless cut in public spending on welfare, and above all, medieval treatments for pensions and workers' rights. This is the balanced budget foreseen by the fiscal compact and inserted in the Italian Constitution with a coup d'état that took place in 2011, at the hands of Professor Monti. What is Greece is the biggest success of the euro, supported by parties such as the Democratic Party and Forza Italia that militate in the European Parliament between socialists and popular people, who have forever bound the democracy of my country to the will of Brussels. Many of you with cameras on continue to say that you are opposed to these principles of austerity but you do it only to collect votes: it has happened in the past, it is happening in the present and we cannot allow it to happen in the future with vital issues such as those enshrined in the Brok-Bresso report, the parliamentarian of Renzi's 40% Democratic Party, that of the revenge against austerity and economic constraints, a shameful report, where the fiscal compact is celebrated and what is in fact an institutionalization of the troika. You want to transform the European Stability Mechanism into the European Monetary Fund, you want to institutionalize that perverse and blackmail system to ensure that the states are crushed by the Troika. You want to institutionalize all of this. You ask us to put our money into the European Stability Mechanism and then you loan it to us to pay unsustainable and above all illegitimate financial interests. All orchestrated by a super minister of the Eurozone who will tell the bad peoples of the periphery which reforms tears and blood must implement. So what are the balanced budget and the fiscal compact? They are simply vulgar instruments of blackmail towards the rights of the European peoples, in contrast with the principles of the Constitutions of our countries and in the same Treaty of Lisbon on which this whole European Union should be founded.But all this can be stopped by the end of the year: the states will have to decide the fate of the fiscal compact.This Parliament has a moral duty to give a negative indication to unsustainable and depressive austerity policies.We were not there in 2012: today we do and we know that our government will still humiliate its citizens.We ask this Parliament to support our battle to finally tear up the fiscal compact.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 171, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Matti Maasikas", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, the Intergovernmental Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the economic and monetary union aims for its substance to be incorporated into the EU legal framework.

It was signed in March 2012 by 25 Member States. 22 out of those 25 contracting parties, namely the euro area countries Bulgaria, Denmark and Romania, are bound by the fiscal compact. The chief objective of the fiscal compact is to strengthen budgetary discipline by operating as a complement to the Stability and Growth Pact, the EU rule-based framework. In fact, the fiscal compact was initially proposed as an amendment to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and became part of the intergovernmental instrument only after having failed to garner unanimity in the European Council. But this intergovernmental approach was understood from the onset as a way to move forward swiftly, as a response to the economic and financial crisis. The integration of the fiscal compact into Union law was already foreseen at the time of its creation. This is clearly acknowledged in the text itself, specifically in the so-called repatriation clause. This clause states that the necessary steps will be taken with the aim of incorporating the substance of the TSCG into the Union legal framework within five years at most from its entry into force. This means 1 January 2018. The Commission is not legally bound by the provisions of TSCG. However, as a general principle, the Commission is in favour of integrating intergovernmental arrangements such as TSCG or the Treaty Establishing the European Stability Mechanism into Union law. These intergovernmental solutions were conceived as stop-gaps during the crisis. Their incorporation into Union law would bring greater democratic accountability and legitimacy across the Union. These are not just the views of the Commission. The Five Presidents’ report argues that a well-functioning Economic and Monetary Union would benefit from the integration into Union law of all intergovernmental instruments created during the crisis. The Commission’s Reflection Paper on deepening the Economic and Monetary Union published this May recalls the agreement among the contracting parties to integrate the relevant provisions of the fiscal compact into EU law as one of the elements towards completion of the Economic and Monetary Union by 2025. Accordingly, President Juncker’s letter of intent that accompanied his State of the Union speech lists this step among the priority initiatives to be taken forward by the end of 2018. The integration into Union law should take into account the flexibility built into the Stability and Growth Pact. The Commission is currently exploring the concrete options for this incorporation, with the aim of putting forward the proposal as part of the December package on the EMU as announced by President Juncker.

Its objective was to strengthen budgetary discipline across the EU, with the introduction of more effective and stricter fiscal rules, including independent monitoring, the automatic corrective mechanism, transposition of a balanced budget rule into national legislation, and swifter sanctions for non-compliance. Four years after the Treaty entered into force, its implementation is only partly completed, and the results achieved are not very impressive. First, specific measures undertaken to comply with the fiscal compact vary from country to country, with different degrees of commitment and effectiveness. As a result, the budgetary situation in some Member States has not improved despite a generally better macroeconomic environment and stronger growth. Moreover, many Member States do not generate progress towards their medium-term objectives at a sufficient speed. Moreover, the overall fiscal framework in the EU has become even more complex making its implementation more difficult and less transparent. Therefore, further steps are needed. While fully endorsing the fiscal compact, we need to enforce it more effectively. First, we need to make sure that its transposition into Member States’ legislation leads to stronger national ownership and better compliance with the rules. Second, we have to reduce the complexity of the whole EU fiscal framework in order to make it more transparent and to ensure better monitoring and equal treatment of all Member States.

However, from the start, our group was very clear, and we fought to ensure that, at the very least, the objectives pursued by this treaty are in conformity with those which we believe essential to pursue, namely the objective of sustainable growth in employment, competitiveness and social cohesion. From the start, we were also critical of the conditionality of access to the European stability mechanism that it established, of the necessary incorporation into the legal order of the Member States of the golden rule or of the tightening that seemed to us excessive budgetary surveillance. From the outset, we said that this treaty should be complemented by economic policies conducive to sustainable growth or job creation. We now come to the conditions for its integration into Community law. For a long time, this European Parliament, resolution after resolution, and the last time yet, in Guy Verhofstadt's report, has called for this integration to be preceded by a rigorous evaluation of the experience acquired after its implementation. From this point of view, I can only quote President Juncker himself who, in his State of the Union address, made it very clear that the intelligent application of the rules had improved the situation of the Union without destroying growth. It is in this spirit that we ask you to review and evaluate this pact to make it consistent with the goal we have always pursued.From this point of view, there is a lot to be done because, in the calculation of structural deficits, in the evaluation of the adjustment trajectory of economies, when they enter the preventive \"arm\" of the pact, we can clearly seethat the treaty, as it was drawn five years ago, is not suitable.Therefore, we will support integration, but after a rigorous assessment in the framework of an open democratic debate that we are ready to have.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 175, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Joachim Starbatty", "mepid": "124827", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mister President!

Schäuble said that too - just cautiously. Why is it that we keep talking about the fact that the fiscal pact has to be made more effective, that something has to be changed, that it has to be integrated? Why is that? It's easy!

There is a yellow card for this. And every player knows that if there is a second violation of the rules, it is not a second yellow card, but a red card. Every player knows that multiple rule violations can result in expulsion. But if there are no red cards, you can show as many yellow cards as you want, nothing will change! We have a system here with the Fiscal Compact where only yellow cards are shown. That's why we keep asking ourselves: Why isn't this getting better?

First, in principle, because we are supporters of the Europe of the Nations, we have a clear preference for intergovernmental agreements, such as the TSCG, in order to avoid the federalist spread of the legal framework of the Union. However, the matters of the TSCG are very important for the budgetary autonomy of the States. Second, because the integration of the fiscal compact into the legal order of the European Union is extremely dangerous in the context of the establishment of a European monetary fund, the EMF. The European Commission is in fact preparing for December a reform package for the euro zone which includes this EMF. This European monetary fund is wanted by Germany. A macro-financial policeman, his mission will be to set up a mechanism for restructuring public debts, that is to say a buy-in for the States. The FME will thus announce to investors and economic agents the different pairs that would be applied in the event of default. This will have the effect of preventively increasing the pressures on states, via market disciplines, and increasing the cost of debt financing. The FME will ensure the strictest observance of the TSCG. Its task will be made easier by the new possibility of bringing proceedings before the Court of Justice of the European Union. This possibility, actively defended by Merkel during the original negotiations of the TSCG, was then rejected by the other States. Five years later, discreetly, we come back to it.

Let me start with a broad perspective and also history, but not so old. In pre-crisis time, the fiscal framework of European Union – the so-called SGP – has failed – or we should rather say that politicians of that time let it fail. SGP was not respected, the purpose, neither substance. As the consequence, countries soon after suffered with substantial difficulties, and people have suffered. During the crisis, under the threat and during the very limited time, a new framework, including the Fiscal Compact that we are debating today, was created. More intelligent rules, as some would say, were the result of that. The results, the data and the figures are quite impressive. Just looking at the data, I would observe that in the Eurozone from 2009, every year there was a decline of deficit to GDP. Since 2014, there is a decline of debt to GDP, and the deficit to GDP reached 1.5% last year. At the same time, if I look at the US data, I can see the deficit was twice as high. The debt is growing since 2008, with only one exception. People can ask: what about the growth? The European Union is growing, unemployment has dropped down and employment is at an all-time high. People can say that it was too much of austerity; I would rather say it was a responsibility. Spending money that people do not have is not a good policy; sometimes it is a mistake, and sometimes it is even a crime. I fully support the idea of incorporation of the Fiscal Compact into EU legislation, but I understand why, at a given time, it was not part of that.

That's right, Mr. Starbatty, for the fiscal compact, throwing money into women and alcohol, as Dijsselbloem unhappily said, is the same as Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal: there is no difference - that is, a vision, indeed, that decades of economic culture of the twentieth century have helped to overcome - and, moreover, disregards the concept of the aggregate fiscal position of the euro zone, as well as denying the fact that an economic policy is not conducted only on rules, on automatic pilot, but needs a government cheap. This is all the more so since the Economic and Monetary Union does not have a serious common budget worthy of the name, which would justify greater rigor at the level of the Member States. Moreover, this approach, as is well known - perhaps the 5 Star Movement ignores it - is also present in the Stability and Growth Pact, which is the true source of the rules we were talking about. In recent years we have opposed this vision and fought for a flexible application of the rules of the stability pact. And if today there is a recovery and the deficit is shrinking, as Niedermayer said, it is precisely because we have applied flexibility to rules, instead, conceived in an excessively rigid and antiquated way. And yet, it is equally clear that we must build better rules: it is not enough for us to simply find ways to apply them more intelligently every year. And in this sense, the real problem is not the fiscal compact, also because there is an article 2 - I will explain to you - which explains that it must still accommodate any changes in the laws of the Union, but is the we ask to improve it, to change it, to introduce a \"golden rule\", which distinguishes between investments and current expenditure and to introduce the concept of the eurozone's aggregate fiscal position.That is why we believe that the Commission would do well to use its time in a more useful way, to work on building fiscal capacity in the eurozone and improving the rules of the stability pact.If this is not the case, and integration is proposed, it is clear that the Democratic Party in Italy and in the Council will veto, unless there are profound changes in the content of the fiscal compact.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 183, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Νότης Μαριάς (ECR).", "mepid": "125069", "text": "- Mr President, the fiscal pact is a system of imposing permanent \"Merkel\" austerity to the detriment of all the peoples of Europe.

One may recall that the European Parliament has never been a proponent of resorting to an intergovernmental treaty governed by international law to strengthen the fiscal rules and compliance with fiscal discipline in the Union, and this is why, in the phase leading to the adoption of this Treaty in 2012 (which was exactly after the most famous, I think, of the British vetoes in December 2011), the European Parliament has insisted on certain safeguards to be put in the Treaty in order to guarantee conformity with the Union Treaties, the Union law in general, and to make the international nature of the Treaty temporary. It was the European Parliament that insisted on this specific clause contained in Article 16, which requires the substance of the Treaty to be incorporated into the legal framework of the Union before January 2018. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs is concerned with the institutional aspects of the incorporation of the substance of the Treaty in the EU framework, and we have been investigating this issue for quite some time. Now we have it in the Commission work programme; we have it in the letter of intent of Jean-Claude Juncker, so we are expecting the proposal. There is in the Treaty the substance that is not necessary or suitable to be incorporated, because the provisions relate to the intergovernmental nature of the Treaty and have no substantial content or duplicate existing legislation but also concern elements that could be established within another framework. There is also substance that is already – or can be – incorporated through secondary legislation, but there is also substance that most likely would require Treaty change, and this is about the key provisions of the Treaty. So we are awaiting the December proposal with a sort of curiosity, especially in the context of the declaration of the President of the Commission that no Treaty change is on the Union’s agenda.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 187, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Maria João Rodrigues (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124737", "text": "   – Mr President, the integration of the fiscal compact into the legal framework of the European Union should be envisaged only if the lessons of recent years are properly taken into account. The first lesson is that this Treaty is also about coordination and governance. When it comes to coordination, the objectives are not only stability but also growth and convergence. We have learned in recent years that this convergence should be guided by economic and social targets together and the European Semester should be designed with this purpose. When it comes to reforms, the assumption is that the reforms which should be recommended to Member States should take into account their real priorities and not invented priorities. But we also need to deal with the governance part of the treaty and the governance must be democratic, which is not yet the case. This means that, if a eurozone summit is now being convened, let me remind you that the Treaty provides for Parliament’s President to be invited. Most of all, we need to make sure that, all through the process, Parliament will play a central role: when we discuss the reforms of the economic and monetary union (EMU), when we discuss the fiscal stance and when we discuss the recommendations for the euro area. We also need to recognise that there is a role for the national parliaments – yes, there is – when they are involved in discussing the national reform programmes and the country—specific recommendations. But overall we need an interinstitutional agreement to set the rules for real democratic governance of the EMU. Finally, on fiscal discipline, let me be clear: of course we need common fiscal discipline in the eurozone to make it sustainable, but it is also clear that, in order to have this common fiscal discipline, if we do not want to hinder growth and growth potential, we need to complement national fiscal discipline – which should be intelligent – with a proper fiscal capacity, as all other monetary zones in the world have. No monetary zone in the world has existed and been sustainable without a fiscal capacity.

Having a balanced budget means having more fiscal space when it is needed. It means having funds available to implement structural reforms, not only in bad times but also in good times. The time to repair the roof is always when the sun is shining. My country, Romania, has been part of the fiscal compact since the beginning. Joining it was the correct decision. Let me explain briefly why. The actions of the current government of the country make clear why the fiscal compact is necessary and why it protects our citizens from what is sometimes irresponsible governance at national level. In Romania, the debt-to-GDP ratio has increased by 4 percentage points from 37% to 41% of GDP in less than two years, and structural deficit has increased from 0.6% of GDP to more than 3%. Due to the significant deviations from the budgetary medium-term objective, the Commission issued a warning, and the Council followed. In the case of any country that does not comply with the provisions, the Commission or any other country can take the case to the Court of Justice. The last step is the imposition of sanctions. These current developments, in any Member State, highlight the importance of respecting EU fiscal rules and the importance of imposing them on governments that sometimes work only for short-term objectives. Otherwise, who will carry the burden of the increasing deficit and debt in any Member State?

However, it would really be more relevant to take into account all indicators, be they social, environmental or economic, and not just budgetary. By taking only part of the data into account, the TSCG prevents Member States from investing and, as we all know, without investment, no economic recovery is possible. This quite simply means fewer and more precarious new jobs for European citizens. Changing the TSCG is therefore an essential condition for offering quality jobs to as many people as possible and combating growing poverty in the European Union.

The US, a mature federal system, operating as a transfer union, has less controls on the policy options available to its component parts, than the eurozone already has as of now. Meanwhile, the “terms of trade” defined by the eurozone’s implicit internal exchange rate, actually make it a sytemic ‘transfer union’ from south and east to north and centre.

This year the European Court of Auditors is celebrating its 40th anniversary. As the debates in this House this week have shown, the political, financial and economic framework of the European Union has changed significantly over the past four decades. Recent challenges have put our citizens' trust in European and national institutions to the test. We, who work in these institutions, have to react to this and find solutions, each within the framework of his or her own area of ​​responsibility. In this regard, I am pleased to announce that I will report positive things. In our estimation, the EU financial statements for 2016 give a true and fair picture. The 2016 revenue was not affected by any material errors. Above all, however, the estimated error rate in payments to the detriment of the European budget has continuously improved. Around half of the European editions we audited in 2016 showed an error rate that was below the materiality threshold of 2%. As a result, instead of failing, we issued a limited positive opinion on the 2016 payments. This is our first qualified audit opinion since we began producing an annual statement of assurance in 1994. It represents a major improvement in EU financial management. In concrete terms, this means: The estimated total error rate in EU spending in 2016 is 3.1% compared to 3.8% in 2015 and 4.4% in 2014. So this is a continuous improvement. The so-called entitlement-based payments, which are made when certain conditions are met, make up around 49% of EU Expenses and showed error rates of less than 2%, below the materiality limit. This includes direct aid for farmers, studies and research grants and personnel costs, to name a number of examples. In contrast, the so-called reimbursement-based payments, which are made to reimburse expenses, were found to have higher error rates. While actions taken by Member States and the Commission helped reduce the overall estimated level of error, we found that sufficient information was available to prevent, or detect and correct, far more errors. In our opinion, this means that no additional control levels are necessary, but the existing controls must be carried out properly. Let me also issue a warning, however: the total amount of payments that the European Union will be required to make under future budgets, at EUR 238.8 billion in 2016, was higher than ever before. The elimination of this backlog and the prevention of new backlogs should be the focus of planning European spending for the period after 2020, i.e. in connection with the next MFF. It is important for our citizens to know that public money is being spent lawfully. But just as important - perhaps even more important - is for people to know what they got for their money. Did building a particular road or airport in a particular location or any other infrastructure really make sense? Did it actually create jobs and growth? In order to answer these questions, we are increasingly placing the focus of our work on the efficiency and effectiveness of European spending and programs. In many areas of the European budget, control systems have been implemented serve to prevent, detect and correct errors, improved in recent years. This also offers us an opportunity to further develop the declaration of assurance with the aim of being able to rely more heavily on these control systems in future with regard to the correctness of expenditure. In this way we will be in a position to provide Parliament and the Council with more and better information as part of the examination of the European budget. Ladies and gentlemen, in the coming decades we will continue to act as guardians of European finances and the interests of our citizens. We will continue to be an independent voice, pointing out areas that work well but also speak uncomfortable truths. In a world where misinformation and data manipulation is becoming increasingly common, the European Court of Auditors will continue to provide reliable and impartial information. Let us work together at every stage of the legislative and budgetary cycle to ensure that the European Union delivers results efficiently on issues that matter to the citizen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 218, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Günther Oettinger", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "Member of the Commission. - Mr President, Mr President Lehne and Mr Lazarou from the European Court of Auditors, ladies and gentlemen! For us as the European Commission, the annual report and the recommendations of the European Court of Auditors are an important basis for our further work. This cooperation between the various organizations - the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Council and the Court of Auditors and, on the other hand, the Commission - is bearing fruit, I believe. The fact that we have had the reliability of our accounts confirmed for the tenth time in a row, that we are showing a further decreasing error rate, that the audit judgment of the Court of Auditors confirms us, shows that we are not unsuccessful together. A long process also seems to be worth it. The European Parliament can be proud of the contribution you have made in the context of the discharge procedure. Over the years you have ensured that we as the European Commission have become better through constructive and critical support. The Court of Auditors makes very specific proposals to ensure that public procurement is carried out correctly, that agricultural areas are measured correctly, that financial aid in the research sector reduces the bureaucratic burden for researchers and thus increases the value of our research program. One thing is clear: we are always closely dependent on the Member States. We have a shared responsibility, and the administration of the Member States and their regions is often jointly or even primarily responsible with us for the correct use of funds and the implementation of procedures. The limited audit opinion is very good news for us. But we don't say complacent: \"That's it\", we want to make our work more efficient and further improve it. Mr. President Lehne has Mentioned the backlog and the difficulties it created in the 2014 and 2015 budgets. As of today, we are again in the final phase of this period in a comparable development, because the funds that are available in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 will probably no longer be needed. In the next few days we will be proposing changes and making cuts to the current budget, but also to the budget for 2018. We must learn from this for the next period - the Member States and us. And perhaps a new MFF shouldn't be adopted just before Christmas last year. A year earlier would mean safety for everyone involved, and preparation and driving speed would be better from the first year. We are happy to say that we want to learn from all of the Court's proposals. And the issue of success orientation: the effectiveness and the question of added value, which we will and must justify, are in the foreground in all infrastructure measures, in cohesion programs, in new tasks such as migration - the added value that we at European level compared to the provision of tasks and funding at national level. We want to draw the House's attention once more to the reflection process. For the next budget framework we have presented a paper in which we identify options and where we value your opinion. That applies to the number of years of the next MFF, that applies to the priorities in the next MFF, that applies to the headings, and it also applies to programming, which in turn is crucial for the execution of the contract and for orientation towards success. My thanks go to the Court of Auditors. I believe that the basis for good consultation has been laid here in this House today over the next few weeks.

First of all, many thanks again to you, Klaus-Heiner Lehne, and Mr Lazaro and the staff of the Court of Auditors for the annual report for the 2016 financial year. 322 pages of the Court of Auditors' annual report provide detailed information on how the Commission and the Member States are responding worked on the EU budget. Even if it is a look back, the Court of Auditors report, together with the special reports of the Court of Auditors, which I would like to mention again at this point, offer a very good analysis of the achievement of objectives in European programs and projects. The error rate, which has fallen again from an average of 3.1%, is encouraging, and we of course welcome this positive trend. A look at the error rate alone is not enough, however. Mistakes often tell more about the complexity of rules than they do about abuse and fraud. We must therefore further simplify the rules governing our financial management so that the beneficiaries can benefit from the European budget more quickly and effectively. The highest error rates continue to occur in the area of ​​shared management. I therefore appeal to the Member States and their administrative authorities to work harder to avoid errors. The considerable delays in entering the current funding period and the associated blatant payment arrears, as mentioned and noted by the Court and the Commissioner, are cause for concern, because 2016 was already the third year of the current funding period. This can lead to a considerable excess of payments at the not too distant end of the current funding period. It is therefore high time to work on the processing of the backlog so that the goals that are to be achieved with the European budget can actually be achieved.The current debates have limited my speaking time, which is why I can only comment on the Court of Auditors report in a very general way.But in the next few weeks we will discuss this opulent work in detail with the Commission and then lead it to a report by Parliament.Thank you again for the work you have done and for the constructive cooperation!", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 220, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Inés Ayala Sender", "mepid": "28292", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - Mr President, Mr Lehne, Mr Commissioner Oettinger, in this plenary session where debates abound about - say - bad news for the European Union - a Brexit that is stalled due to the failure of the party that led to it and an example of how to obtain political gains secessionists not complying with the law and the rule of law and manipulating the goodwill of the people - however, we can only congratulate ourselves on excellent news that it took only 23 years to achieve. And success is due to you, Mr Lehne, to all your colleagues at the Court of Auditors and to all of us in general, since this Parliament and the Committee on Budgetary Control, especially, have fought and beaten the copper to achieve it: an opinion not negative, but only subject to reservations, which finally gives us a true picture of reality.

You have done a great deal of work. According to your report, there has been improvement in the estimated level of error in payments from the EU budget. You have issued a qualified opinion on the 2016 payments rather than an adverse one. The overall level of error for EU spending was estimated at 3.1%. Your report indicates that ‘entitlement payments’, made for meeting specific conditions, and accounting for about 49% of EU spending, show levels of error below 2%. These payments include direct aid to farmers, grants to students and researchers and staff costs. However, higher levels of error were found in ‘reimbursement payments’, made for economic, social and territorial cohesion. The estimated level of error here was 4.8%. For ‘natural resources, world development, the environment, climate action and fisheries’ it was 4.9%. Action by the Member States and the Commission reduced the overall estimated level of error. However, sufficient information was available to further prevent, or detect and correct, many errors. If this information had all been used correctly the levels of error for economic social and territorial cohesion and for natural resources and ‘Global Europe’ would have been below the 2% threshold.

It bears the serial number 40, which is truly respectable and also worthy of a small celebration. But I'm not sure if it's all about opening champagne. The general public probably would not understand, but all of us who deal with European finances could celebrate, for example, the fact that, after 23 years, the annual report contains a statement on the reliability of the operations carried out instead of a negative one. And in the case of entitlement and administrative payments, the error rate is even well below the materiality level. Reducing the error rate in the spending area of ​​the European Union budget is one of a number of priorities that we would like to achieve on a permanent basis when spending EU funds in accordance with the principles of sound financial management. The second, in my opinion even more important aspect, is the focus on performance and added value of all projects and investments. A new and difficult task before the European Court of Auditors is to find an answer to the question of whether low error rates automatically mean cost-effective, efficient and effective spending of EU funds. The European Commission and the Member States face the same task. The delay in the current multiannual financial framework results in a historic maximum of unused Union funds. We will certainly agree that the resources of EU citizens must not be spent solely on the purpose of exhausting national allocations. On the contrary. Let us work to ensure that the almost unbelievable, unspent EUR 240 billion is used to fund quality projects that will bring real benefits and added value to the European Community.

I would like to admit that in the past the discussion on the report has lingered on the finding that the Court of Auditors was once again unable to give an unqualified opinion due to an excessive error rate. That is not good, because it is of course more than just an error rate. That is why I welcome the fact that the Court of Auditors now wants to look more broadly at value for money. At the same time, the attention for the regularity of expenditure must not be allowed to diminish. If I have to read in a footnote that you can also say that the actual error rate is not 3.1 but 5.1 percent, then something is wrong. This concerns the justification of the expenditure from the financial instruments. The Court itself states that 2.3 billion euros was spent on expenditure outside the competent period, so without there being a legal basis to which Parliament has also approved. How is that possible? The same applies to the reservations of the Commission services, which increase from 21 to 26 percent of expenditure. Then it would be the first time that the Commission itself is more critical than the Court of Auditors. That would really be unique. How does the Court explain these contradictions?

And it is interesting whether the costs that we are carrying out for inspections in Luxembourg to find out these audit results are also justified. And, as you know, my long-standing idea has been that, since the first round of enlargement in 2004, the European institutions have been unnecessarily inflated in favor of nation states. We know that every country must have a commissioner, every country must have a member of the Court of Auditors, every country must have a prosecutor or a prosecutor, and so on. In my opinion, this is not at all necessary if we want to think of the European Union as an effective organization. And I would ask Mr Lehn to definitely carry out an audit next year and analyze whether it makes sense to consider seven former Prime Ministers of Eastern European countries as Vice-Presidents of the Commission, where Commissioner Oettinger does all the work anyway and only vice-presidents, and whether it makes sense to have an Estonian auditor in the Court. who has dropped the airline, the shipping company, the train company, the ferry company, whatever, and now she controls us.

And this, however, is only part, because the European Commission, as you know, is limited to taking these documents and paying the bills. He obviously doesn't have the ability to control everything.

Because, in all the States where I have been, in recent years, especially in the trips of the delegations, I have noticed how this system is very much based on conflict of interest, where the certification and control authorities are then appointed by the policy itself, such as it is logical that, however, at the same time, in many cases, parochialism or non-transparent relations are created.

It is important not just because of the role of Parliament, but also the role of the Council in making sure that EU taxpayers know that their funds are being used properly in key areas of public expenditure. But we should never forget that we are talking about a very small fraction of total public expenditure in the European Union. That means that we should use that expenditure to the very best of our abilities and for the objectives of the programmes that we set out.

That is a significant improvement and it is something to be recognised and something to be celebrated in this House and within the Council. There are issues that we need to address. As other colleagues have said, the question of simplification of rules is crucial to reduce the error rate. One of the issues outlined in the report from the ECA this year is this question of outstanding payments. Substantial amounts of commitments are made into the future and the money is not spent. We have got to make sure we can get on with the task of spending those monies. But there will be enormous challenges, not least because of the question mark of the budget into the future on the question of Brexit, but also because we have to review the MFF.

It is also important to note, as the President said, that Member States have the information to detect and reduce the error rate, maybe even below the 2% threshold. So again it would be useful to know why Member States are not using the information they have, which would allow them to reduce error rates even further.  On the important question of measuring performance – and I think this is something we all welcome, we talk about it all the time and we need to find better ways of measuring performance in the future – of course a number of measures have already been introduced to measure performance. Previously in its report the Court does suggest the Commission continues to look at other ways of linking payments to performance. I would be interested to know from the Commission and from the Court what those measures might be.

The estimated level of errors in the payments made from the EU budget for the last three years shows a clear trend of steady decrease from 4.4% to 3.1%. The bulk of the errors are concentrated within the areas of economic, social and territorial cohesion as well as in the competitiveness for growth and jobs. We should underline that, in the ECA’s report, there is an early warning on a number of issues that we should be careful about. The challenges are mainly related to budgetary and financial management. Delayed implementation of the programmes could create, at the end of the current programming period, a huge backlog of outstanding payments.

That note about 5%, the Commission's reservations: I would like to get an explanation of that in the course of the discharge procedure. Now, everything can be better. 3.1% is a good result, without any doubt, but we know that the vast majority of resources - 80% of resources - are co-managed, where Member States and regions bear responsibility. In the annual report we read that an extra effort is already being made to recover funds. This is undoubtedly under pressure from Parliament, but it can be done better. I have a question for Mr Oettinger: how can we together - the Commission and Parliament - force the Member States and the authorities of the regions to take better responsibility, to ensure that that margin of error is effectively below 2% comes true?

If any business were receiving a qualified opinion on its accounts, it would rightly be worried. Even more worrying, I suppose, is the way that we have arrived at this situation and why it was not the even worse adverse opinion as previous years. Firstly, it is argued that errors are not pervasive, claiming that the errors are only high for reimbursement-based expenditure, but it needs to be pointed out that the errors exist across every single area of spending within the EU budget. The error rate of 3.1% is still over EUR 4 billion of taxpayers’ money every year. If it were just that, it would still be bad enough, but it is not just that; there is an awful lot more to it than that. First, the error rate does mask a far, far higher rate of projects where there are errors. For example, 23% of EAGGF payments had errors, but the error rate reported is 1.7%. For Rural Development and Environment, 39% of projects have some errors within them but the error rate then is 4.9%, so it masks something that is somewhat bigger. Second, about a third of all errors are not quantifiable and those therefore do not show up in the statistics. Third, foreign aid sent via third-country governments is just assumed to have zero error, which for accountancy purposes is understandable, but in practice is palpable, self—evident nonsense. Fourth, we are only talking about money spent outside of the rules and waste of the money within the rules is not counted. Fifth, the errors in special instruments are not included, which would have led to a 5.1% error rate, rather than 3.1%. Sixth, the burden of proof is unequivocal errors, so these are only the errors that we are absolutely certain about. There are clearly more in practice.  Then we see that, in effect, there are blind eyes being turned left, right and centre. On page 47 of this report, we are reminded that pension contributions are not ringfenced but used to fund the general EU budget. Now that is something which, in any context and in any organisation, is not good practice. This is also the reason why we have the whole pension liability question in the Brexit debate in the first place, since this has not been done properly at EU level for many decades. I now have deep concerns with regard to the Court of Auditors because auditors should always be completely independent of the organisation that they audit. That is the whole point of auditing. But now we are in a situation where nearly 40% of the Court are ex—politicians, and most of those are ex—MEPs. When all but six of the auditors are former civil servants, it starts to undermine a level of public confidence in those same auditors. Throughout this report the perspective seems to me to be one of excusing problems so when 31% of projects contained errors on page 260, the report instead described them as 69% error free. It is not the job of the auditors to excuse failings. It is the job of auditors to expose them.

While our fellow citizens are subjected every day to demands of austerity and austerity imposed by the Union, the latter, without being criticized here, allows itself freedoms with its own management.

This year we can once again be mostly satisfied with the Court’s report itself and the conclusions it incorporates. However, despite improvements in the error rates, there are still some weaknesses. I have to emphasise in particular the issues of compliance and performance. Indeed, the issue of the error rate as such can be seen as of relative importance. Unfortunately – a confusing case of non-compliance regarding the eligibility period of disbursements within financial instruments – the estimated level of error for cohesion expenditure does not necessarily represent the true state of its implementation. It has to be made clear, this is not the Court’s fault. The Court is not at fault here. It did what it was bound to do within the legal interpretation. But the point beyond that is this: the European citizen has to have direct access to clearly understandable numbers, and there we still have some work to do.

For this reason, a good annual report inspires us to believe that even better results can be expected if and when we continue along the same careful lines in the European Union's economy. However, the annual report highlights concerns that we need to pay more attention to in the future. They have certainly been prepared by the Court of Auditors. One significant factor is the record high payments in this year's budget, which also means an increase in the number of inspections. We must continue to guarantee the principle that EU citizens have the right to know where their money is being spent. They must also be able to trust that these funds are being properly controlled.

Europe has made several errors in payments. Mistakes made with public money. What mistakes? Lack of essential documentation, ineligible expenses, conflicts of interest and irregularities in procurement. Then there is another important aspect that is underlined by the Court, namely the complexity of the financing mechanisms, which has continued to increase. The Commission justified the massive increase in the number of subjects and instruments participating in the financing of the implementation of European policies and programs with the need to face new challenges, such as immigration, Brexit, climate change. We honestly don't find the link. So much so that the Court finds it difficult to manage, control and report expenditure, with the real future risk of not being in a position to understand how the money is actually spent. In fact, as many as 1052 financial instruments had already been established at the end of 2015, the use of which has not always been precisely traceable. Furthermore, the Court points out that one of the main advantages of these instruments, namely the ability to use the funds more than once, has not been fully exploited.

Despite enormous expenditure from the EU budget, about a thousand farms, mainly family ones, disappear every day in the EU. The village is aging, only one in five farmers is under 45, European agriculture is on the way to liquidation. Deep changes to the CAP are needed to save them. The second is the excessive deficit procedure report. It shows that governments teaching others to learn the rules - I am thinking mainly about the government of France - are themselves breaking EU rules that the public finance deficit should not exceed 3%, and public debt should not exceed 60% of GDP.

And for that we have to work a lot on regulations. There is already an attempt to simplify through the amendments to the Financial Regulation, but I think that the Court, through a special report, can think of other instruments, because having the same type of regulations, the same rules in all regulations for all funds would be a very good thing, to have cost standards set in each Member State, to try, perhaps, to turn the public procurement directive into a regulation and then an electronic activity - everything, from the application, from the evaluation, from approval, from tracking, to be done electronically - I think it would bring great benefits. I will make some such proposals in my report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 250, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Andrey Novakov (PPE).", "mepid": "107212", "text": "   – Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the European Court of Auditors for making this step forward with the annual report. It is much more analytical – something which I appreciate. It is not just numbers and percentages, but it has very fruitful information for us. Obviously, dropping the percent of error rate is something which we should celebrate and appreciate. By saying this, I am not saying that we can shift the focus from fraud prevention to something else, but we could have other priorities as well: for example, fully-fledged audit reform. What do I mean? First: single audit. Let us prevent double checks by managing authority, certifying authority and audit authority by same beneficiary. Why not introduce risk based audit as well? Those beneficiaries with a proven track record and those who are object of audit of national authority should have lighter control, otherwise we make their life worse. Another thing: we can have simplified audit as well, introducing more simplified approach and removing unnecessary requirements.

Thus, I believe that both the Court of Auditors and the other European institutions, but especially the national authorities of the Member States, must be concerned with the implementation of single and simplified procedures at European Union level regarding the spending of public money. Defining errors is extremely important. Not every error should lead to the suspension of payments for beneficiaries, as preventing their occurrence entails strengthening the role of guidance and coordination of the Court before the role of control. The unitary approach to legislation at Union level is absolutely necessary, so that, either in Bucharest, in Prague or in Rome, there is the same interpretation on a legal norm. It is inadmissible today to have a certain conduct that is incriminated as a violation in Romania, but, at the same time, to represent a correct and legal approach in other states. National audit and regulatory authorities must be explicitly prohibited from adding conditionalities beyond European rules, as this always leads to excessive bureaucracy. Changing the procedures during the implementation process of a European project is another limiting factor for the beneficiaries of European Union funds.

However, I regret the lack of flexibility of the European Union budget in responding to unforeseen events, as highlighted by the Court itself: just think of the crisis in the agricultural sector, to which the European Union has not been able to give the right answers in quickly. Another negative aspect concerns the complexity, however increasing, of the financing mechanisms of the European Union: if this trend persists, there is a risk of compromising compliance with the reporting obligation and the transparency of the European Union budget.

We have heard the multitude of constructive and critical contributions, but also the words of praise, and we will evaluate them thoroughly within our services. I will limit myself to a few points. Firstly, we really want to maintain our ambition to further reduce the error rate. In other words, a certain shift towards the topic of effectiveness, success-relatedness, performing should not mean that one disregards the error rate. Hopefully further progress can be achieved here. With the new authority and public prosecutor's office, the EPPO, represented here by Mrs Jourová later, we have an instrument which, as a partner at European level, will certainly help fight fraud, embezzlement and corruption in the European budget. Second, I share the view that new financial instruments - guarantees, loans - are an addition to our leverage and are not a substitute for cash. For important projects in important member states, especially in rural areas and with municipalities, you will still need co-financing and cash from the European budget for the implementation of projects. It was rightly pointed out that still not all Member States have named the authorities responsible for implementing the program. We have written to these Member States, we have made progress, but not yet at 100%. We are working on this, but ultimately we in the European Union are dependent on the constructive cooperation of the Member States. We do not have our own administration or our own sub-structure in the regions. And that the member states do not call up the structural funds that are actually due to them - basically the voter should notice how successfully his administrations work, and this for himself Make voting decisions that are pending a benchmark. We can only advise the governments in the regions of the member states. We help where we can with words and deeds. But the application for funds, the implementation of projects and then the invoicing of the amounts paid - all of this is the responsibility of the Member States, the regions, which are the contact persons for us on the spot, but which we cannot replace. We are counting on hopefully more cash outflows over the next two years and the timetable for the next MFF - we talked about it yesterday - should be crucial. We shouldn't take our time, we shouldn't deliberate in the new parliament, we shouldn't deliberate until 2020. I urgently want to propose that this Parliament, together with the Council and the Commission, use the time from spring next year until the European elections to have as much, if not all, decided and in dry cloths for the next budget period so that implementation can then be carried out by January 1, 2021 and has no wasted time at the start of the next budget. Simplification in the procedures was critically noted here. This is exactly what we intend to do with our “omnibus” and the reform of the Financial Regulation. We are counting on the fact that Parliament will lead the deliberations to a result in the next few weeks and that the corresponding financial support procedures can then be simplified as early as next year. Otherwise, many thanks for your cooperation. I look forward to the deliberations that will now take place in the Technical Committee on the basis of this. We are ready to give any further answer, including in detail, to the Members.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 258, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Klaus-Heiner Lehne", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "President of the Court of Auditors. - Mister President! First of all, I am pleased that you are feeling better and that you are back in your chair up there. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that has also become clear in the course of the debate, but I want to say it again here: A restricted audit opinion does not mean that everything is perfect, it is a clear yes, but. Anyone who reads the report will also recognize that we have looked at an overall picture and have found significant changes and improvements within the framework of this overall picture. But if you go into the chapters and look in detail at what we have written in detail in the report, you will find that there are a large number of points in which concrete improvements are pending and must be made. The error rate is just one factor in the overall view. We have endeavored - and that is also our task - not to decide or judge anything within the framework of a mathematical guillotine, but rather a so-called professional judgment to make a qualitative assessment of the overall picture. That is why we have come to what we have come to. I also want to make it very clear: this is not our performance. As a farm, we only had to judge facts and the picture. It is essentially the improvement of financial management by the Commission. Of course we contributed indirectly to that. We, that is the Court of Auditors, but above all you too, ladies and gentlemen, former colleagues in the European Parliament. The sustained insistence on this in your work - above all in the Committee on Budgetary Control - and the interaction between our organs - that can really be said - have resulted in this improvement. I think we can be really proud of that, and it is a process that we want to continue, which shows that our efforts have borne fruit. I think that has already been explained in detail by Mrs Ayala Sender, Mrs Dlabajová, Mrs Gräßle and Mr Liberadzki. Regarding Mr de Jong's remarks: he asked the questions, some of which were already part of the Committee on Budgetary Control last week. Why did we rate the issue of financial instruments in the bugs as we did? Thats is quite easy. I want to say that again here: we have of course referred to the errors that we have criticized here in the past for reasons of transparency in the current report - that is clear - but it would not be factual to include them again in the error calculation was justified for the very simple reason that it was a question of atypical errors, errors the cause of which is essentially to be found in another legal conception that we do not share. Against the background, a corresponding inclusion in the error rate would simply not have been objectively justified. Here, too, we applied our professional judgment to this question. Perhaps I would like to point out again what significance this estimated error rate actually has. Perhaps that should be said again clearly here in the plenary. We are not saying that the error rate is exactly 3.1%. We apply a mathematical statistical procedure in which we evaluate the results of a sample and at the end - and you will see this when you read the explanations in the report - say that the actual error rate is in a corridor with a probability of 95% moved between 2.2 and 4%. What we have stated is the 3.1%, which is quite simply the relatively most likely mean. That's all. You have to do this in the context of the overall picture, if one has to judge this question, of course also take it into account. I think this explanation is important. Mr Tarand raised the issue of the size of the institutions. It is not up to us to decide, it is decided by the primary legislature of the European Union, the constitutional legislature, in other words, in plain English, the Convention, in which the European Parliament can also participate, then the Intergovernmental Conference and, moreover, the parliaments of national member states. That is something that we cannot judge what the constitutional legislature of the European Union thinks on these questions. Mr Vaughan, Mr Staes and Mr Ashworth raised the issue of the details, the causes of the errors. In view of the limited time we have, I do not want to comment on that now, but leave that to the debates of the committee. I share the view that has been expressed by Mr Takkula, Mr Salafranca and others - it is also in the report: we need more understandable, clearer, simpler rules and figures. We will endeavor - Ms. Gräßle mentioned this - in the future, with the new approach that we have, to give more country-specific information and also more concrete information on causes. One comment on Ms. Schmidt - which is unfortunately no longer there now - that I have to make. It is actually quite obvious that we have only dealt with the administration in a few pages in this report. Because with an error rate of 0.2% you can't say much. The report essentially deals with the issues of legality. The questions that Ms. Schmidt addressed relate more to questions of economic efficiency. I will simply give it back: if we, as the Court of Auditors, are asked to carry out a detailed performance audit of the administration of the European Parliament as part of the discharge decision, then of course we will seriously consider. That’s where it belongs. It’s a profitability issue and not a legality issue. Therefore, this question that was asked there is probably also answered. The subject of control density was raised by two colleagues, Mr Zdechovský and Mr Novakov. That is actually a central problem, and you will have gathered from what I said at the beginning: Our goal in future is to pay more attention to the quality than to the quantity of the control mechanisms. We are well aware of this problem of excessive control density, because that can of course also be an obstacle to the implementation of European policy. So it is better to have more quality than quantity in this question, better and fewer controls than too many control levels, which are theoretically possible. That is a very specific, clear goal. Mr Buda has called for uniform application, a Europe-wide regulation. I think we are in complete agreement on that, there is no question about that. Mr Caputo mentioned something that we have also mentioned repeatedly: the lack of flexibility in the overall budget. This is an issue that I hope will be addressed in the MFF. Finally, I would like to thank you once again for the interesting and valuable debate and, above all, for the encouraging words with regard to our work. I will inform my colleagues of this in tomorrow's quorum meeting and I am sure that it will be met with great approval and joy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 259, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Przewodniczący. –", "mepid": "28372", "text": "I close the debate.Written declarations (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 260, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Tamás Deutsch (PPE)", "mepid": "96826", "text": "in writing. - The European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the EU budget.

With a legal basis based on Chapter Four of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters, the European legislator felt the need to combat crimes affecting the financial interests of the Union, through a special legislative procedure, aimed at establishing a European Public Prosecutor's Office. Fraud, corruption and other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the European Union constitute a serious threat to the achievement of the objectives which, through the use of its own resources, the Union itself intends to achieve, and therefore require effective law enforcement, which also requires recourse to criminal law. The establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's Office undoubtedly represents a fundamental step in the process of European integration in the area of ​​criminal law, a requirement that arises from the numerous crimes that are perpetrated. According to data provided by the European Commission, European national budgets lose nearly € 50 billion in VAT revenue each year due to cross-border fraud. Organized crime, acting on a transnational level, earns billions of euros by circumventing national rules and avoiding prosecution. Just think that in 2015, the Member States identified and reported fraudulent irregularities to the Commission for an amount of around € 600 million. The tools available to national prosecutors in the fight against large-scale cross-border financial crime are limited. The new Union Prosecutor's Office will provide coordinating action, conducting rapid investigations across Europe and exchanging information in real time. Criminal investigations into fraud and other crimes against the EU budget are often hampered by divergent legislation: national law enforcement authorities, prosecutors and judges in the Member States decide on the priorities set by national criminal policy and on the basis of national competences. As a result, the level of protection of the Union's financial interests differs significantly from one state to another, with often disappointing results. OLAF has warned us that the rate of successful prosecution of crimes against the EU budget varies from 19% to 90% from state to state. The coordination activity of the prosecutor will thus lead to greater effectiveness in the prosecution of all crimes that have a cross-border dimension. With regard to this perspective, I join the many voices that in recent weeks have expressed the need to expand the powers of the European Public Prosecutor as soon as possible. This was stated by President Juncker during his State of the Union address, declaring that he considered it more appropriate than ever to entrust the new European Public Prosecutor's Office with the prosecution of cross-border terrorist offenses. This was also repeated by the President of the French Republic, Macron, who at the Sorbonne, a few days ago, proposed the creation of \"a European anti-terrorism prosecutor\". A position therefore in line with the wishes of the President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani. Expanding the range of powers of the Prosecutor's Office will create the conditions for greater efficiency in the fight against organized crime and terrorist organizations: to be united, to be stronger, and to be less vulnerable.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 266, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, it is a pleasure to be in the Parliament today and, believe me, that is not just a courtesy phrase. Just before the summer break, after long and extremely complex negotiations, the Council reached a political agreement to set up the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) as an enhanced cooperation, and I am happy that 20 Member States have already expressed their agreement to bring the protection of financial interests to an entirely new level through the establishment of a new Union body. The EPPO will considerably step up the current efforts to fight crimes against the EU budget such as fraud, corruption, money laundering or VAT fraud, since its work will be more effective, especially as regards cross—border criminality; more criminals will be put behind bars; more money will be recovered; and more money will be put to the right use. The regulation provides a robust set of procedural rights of suspects and accused persons. The EPPO will become the centrepiece of a new system, joining together national law enforcement, judicial authorities and EU actors such as OLAF, Eurojust and Europol. It will be to the benefit of the EU as a whole, the Member States and European taxpayers. Criminal investigations are essential to counter the most serious forms of abuse against the EU budget. The EPPO will carry out this task on the basis of a truly European investigation and prosecution policy. OLAF will closely cooperate with the EPPO to ensure complementarity of their respective mandates. The missions of the EPPO and OLAF are clearly defined. Strong energies will need to be created in order to allow both the EPPO and OLAF to perform their tasks in the most efficient and productive manner. There will be no duplication of work. On the contrary, I believe that the result will be a significant enhancement of our capacity to tackle fraud. The Commission has just transmitted, on 2 October, the evaluation of the OLAF Regulation and is analysing the need to adapt the OLAF Regulation to ensure that OLAF can cooperate smoothly with the EPPO and has the tools it needs to fulfil its mandate. Also, Eurojust will continue to play an important role as a crime fighter in Europe, focusing more on other forms, such as the trafficking of human beings or drugs. I am therefore pleased to see that you are advancing well on the Eurojust reform under the leadership of the rapporteur, Mr Voss. We would not be here today without the Parliament’s strong support. I would particularly like to thank the Parliament’s successive rapporteurs on the EPPO, Mr Iacolino, Ms Macovei, Ms Matera, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs, for their tireless efforts for a strong, independent and efficient EPPO. I would, of course, also like to thank Ms Reding for her efforts, because I took over the EPPO from her in a very good condition, ready to be finalised. I would also like to thank Ms Grässle and Mr López Aguilar for their crucial work, in particular on the Anti-Fraud Directive, which included serious cross—border VAT fraud in the scope of the material competence of the EPPO. The EPPO and the Anti-Fraud Directive are two sides of the same coin. They are constitutive parts in our joint efforts to better fight crimes affecting the EU budget. The Parliament made its voice heard in key moments during the negotiations and improved many important aspects of the regulation. For instance, you have ensured a clear delineation of competences between the EPPO and the other European actors; helped to design appointment procedures and introduce permanent chambers which guarantee the EPPO’s independence; ensured a robust judicial review of the EPPO’s procedural acts, or made sure that, from the beginning, the EPPO can cooperate on a solid basis with non—participating Member States. But the Parliament’s involvement does not stop here. You will have your say in the selection process of the European Chief Prosecutor, as well as in ensuring the general political accountability of the EPPO’s activities, and you will have a decisive say on its budget. I have no doubt that this House will continue to support the EPPO in its operations. As President Juncker said in his State of the Union speech, there is a strong case for tasking the new European Public Prosecutor’s Office with prosecuting cross—border terrorist crimes and, as announced in the letter of intent, the Commission will issue, in the next year, a 2025 perspective – a communication on a possible extension of the tasks of the new European Public Prosecutor’s Office to include the fight against terrorism on the basis of Article 86/4 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Parliament will debate this question in due course.

Indeed, after four years of negotiations, the time has come: tomorrow we shall vote on the creation of the European Public Prosecutor's Office. An important step towards a common European judicial area, yes, a great day for Europe as a whole. Especially when you briefly review the much longer history. For example, more than 20 years ago - in 1996 - Parliament called for the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's Office, and as early as 2002 the Commission presented a Green Paper on its creation, which states, among other things: “Should the credibility of the European project not be damaged , the Community must guarantee its member states and European taxpayers that fraud and corruption will actually be prosecuted, including criminal law. ”This is exactly what it is about: Crimes against the financial interests of the EU such as subsidy fraud or cross-border VAT fraud are not peculiar offenses! The annual damage runs into the billions, but we all pay the bill as European taxpayers. It is really high time to act. Parliament can only say yes and no to the negotiated text, but the Member States did not have a blank check from us. We closely followed the negotiation process and made it clear: the European Public Prosecutor's Office must be able to act independently, it must have efficient structures, and the procedural rights of the accused must be guaranteed at all times. With all this in place, our group will give the green light to the European Public Prosecutor's Office. We want European taxpayers' money to be protected more effectively in the future. It is deeply regrettable, however, that the European Public Prosecutor's Office will only be created within the framework of enhanced cooperation and that only 20 states will be there for the time being. This undoubtedly weakens the European added value.Speaking volumes, I think that the governments of Hungary and Poland in particular do not want the public prosecutor's office.Hungary receives the most EU funding per capita, while Poland receives the most funding of all with 86 billion in 2014-2020.We will therefore fight in the future for all member states to participate so that this European joint project can take full effect.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 268, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Monica Macovei", "mepid": "96824", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, tomorrow we will vote on the Rules of Procedure of the European Public Prosecutor's Office.

After almost three years of negotiations, the European Public Prosecutor's Office will finally be set up. In short, the cases of cross-border fraud with European money and some terrorist offenses will be investigated from start to finish, including by prosecution, by the European Public Prosecutor's Office, and in cases of conviction, money stolen from our pockets. Fraud in the European Union, I recall, is 500 million euros every year. The European Public Prosecutor will then gather evidence from each Member State involved in cross-border fraud. For searches, for example, in Romania, Romanian law will be followed, for interceptions in Germany, German law, for hearings or other investigations in other Member States, the law of those Member States will be observed. All these evidences made in different states, however, will be admissible and valid in the court that will judge the case, the case with cross-border fraud. This is very important and this will make all these cases investigated and tried much faster.

Although we have no power of approval on the file, Parliament's concerns have been satisfactorily addressed. A shadow on the table, of course: some Member States have decided not to participate, thus pushing others to engage in enhanced cooperation. However, I would like to point out that the fight against fraud in the Union's budget is a shared responsibility: that of the Union and that of the States. We are talking about the money of European taxpayers here. I therefore find it particularly regrettable, even shocking, that Member States, some of which are among the largest recipients of European funds, can shirk their moral and political duty to do their utmost to fight fraud. As far as I am concerned, I also believe that serious consideration should be given to linking the granting of European funds to the obligation to submit to this duty. In my view, it is inconceivable that the financial interests of the Union do not enjoy a uniform level of protection in all Member States. Fortunately, we still have to congratulate ourselves on the fact that no less than twenty Member States have decided to move forward to protect European public money. This is a crucial step in European integration and in the construction of our area of ​​justice. I sincerely hope that the public prosecutor's office can quickly demonstrate its efficiency and that its powers will in the future be extended to other cross-border threats facing all European states, such as cross-border crime, terrorism and organized crime that we know today.This would be the minimum to extend the skills to these subjects.(The speaker agrees to answer a \"blue card\" question (Rule 162 (8) of the Rules of Procedure))", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 271, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Kazimierz Michał Ujazdowski (ECR)", "mepid": "23791", "text": "question asked by picking up a blue card.- Mr.The Lord easily accuses countries that have not entered into enhanced cooperation, although this enhanced cooperation is essentially voluntary.It is easy for you, but it is primarily the responsibility of nation states and Belgium has a judiciary that is often subjected to very severe criticism, also from other states, such as French politicians.Wouldn't it be better to start with restoring the justice system at the national level, before accusing others of not engaging in voluntary cooperation?", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 272, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Louis Michel (ALDE)", "mepid": "96670", "text": ", answer \"blue card\".- Mr President, my answer will be extremely brief.I really, very incompletely understood the significance of this question.It was not a question, it was ..., I don't know ...

Another problem, in my opinion, will be the complex structure of deciding on the competence to investigate, where it will first have to be assessed whether it falls within the competence of the national or European prosecutor. It is also not clear to me who will be able to file appeals and other remedies. The issue of supervision also remains unresolved.

This is a really historic moment and I think we should cherish it. I am all the more disappointed that once again the Council is not here and that the Member States are not really appreciating this progress and are actually not bringing it to life. I hope that will change, and I also hope that the 20 Member States that have accepted the European Public Prosecutor can persuade the remaining Member States to take part in this instrument. It is important for the citizens of the European Union, for the EU budget. We lose hundreds of millions of euros every year in these crime areas when it comes to crimes against the EU budget. Some bills even go well beyond that. We got this read out, for example, in the special committee against organized crime, corruption and money laundering: it can even be several trillion euros. This means that the damage is enormous, and it is therefore all the more important that we really use this instrument now, that it be filled with life, that the Member States take part in it and that they use it as a model for proper police and judicial cooperation Take criminal matters.

First of all, it is regrettable that some Member States have preferred to remain outside the sphere of competence of this new body of the Union and, in this sense, we are confident that they will quickly repent. The prosecutor, as also underlined in the resolution of the European Parliament on the fight against corruption, of which I was rapporteur, must be efficient and independent from national governments and the institutions of the European Union, but above all, protected from political influence and pressure. I believe that the work of the European Public Prosecutor's Office, thanks also to the use of the resources already existing in the European context and thanks to the exchange of information with other bodies to combat fraud and corruption, such as OLAF, Europol and Eurojust, can guarantee a implementation of both repressive activities and in order to prevent crimes perpetrated against the European Union.

When criminals act internationally, our response too must be transnational and European. I am delighted that twenty Member States have decided to go ahead. Enhanced cooperation is thus proving its worth and showing that a Europe of precursors can drag in its wake the Member States which, even today, hesitate to protect taxpayers' money more effectively. The creation of the post of European public prosecutor is proof that Europe can and must move forward with a vanguard, and this proof has already been provided by the divorce regulations and the inheritance proposal. The European area of ​​justice is slowly being established, and it will be an honor for Luxembourg, as the seat of the judicial institutions, to welcome the new European prosecutors. Europe is acting and must continue to do so, so I call for the broadening of the powers of the organized crime and counterterrorism prosecutor in the future to better protect our citizens.

Crimes do not recognize borders, be they national or European. For more than 20 years, we have been trying by various means to improve cooperation and the exchange of information between the various Member States, and that is why we have set up Eurojust, for example. But when we talk about fraud with European funds, that is not enough. Obtaining evidence abroad is slow and slows investigations. Cooperation procedures also do not always bring the desired results and do not correspond to the reality of open borders. Our economies and taxpayers deserve better protection for the money they spend on the European project. Every year, at least 50 billion euros of VAT is lost due to various cross-border crimes, including European funds. European funds must contribute to stimulating growth, creating jobs, increasing cohesion between the various Member States, and not favor criminals. I believe that the new prosecutor's office will improve the investigation and cooperation of these crimes. It will be strong, independent, with the necessary investigative tools. It will cooperate with Member States in the investigation of a number of crimes related to European funds, fraud, corruption, money laundering. It will improve cooperation and information exchange. At the same time, it will ensure a high level of respect for procedural rights in the European Union.

I will react to what we have just heard. This is EU money and it requires a response from the EU institution. I think that is very clear. In the EU we see that crime is on the rise, cross-border crime is on the rise, we see permanent structures working against our interests, against our taxpayers’ financial interests, and we need to come with a permanent structure. This is a very practical response we are coming with. This is a very important moment for me too, because I worked for many years in cohesion policy, and I always found this to be a policy which is driven by a very strong ethical impetus. There is solidarity in it and there is a very strong, legitimate expectation from the European taxpayers that we will guarantee the protection of their money; and we have to do that! This is what we are doing now by the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) which is not replacing national prosecution services. It is going to work in a very strong synergy with national prosecutors, which will come into play in cases where the national prosecutors cannot come with an efficient response.  Here we heard a lot about the missing, non-participating countries. Three countries – the UK, Ireland and Denmark – have a permanent opt-out from criminal justice policies. What about the remaining five countries? I had to convince many more than those five, where we have failed for the time being. This was a very important time when, yes, we had yellow cards and it forced me to go to the national parliaments and have very intensive communications with the national authorities, national co-decision-makers in the field of the fight against crime, arguing that this is a very important step forward. I had to bring a lot of arguments, facts, figures. You mentioned EUR 500 million. I will add EUR 50 billion which we have as an estimation of the cross-border carousel VAT fraud. That is why it is very important that we added this cross-border carousel fraud under the remit of the EPPO. This was a real game-changer, and I must again thank those who worked on the Fifth Directive when we added this to the remit of the EPPO. We had to solve the unsolvable problem: we had the duty or the task not to touch the national criminal prosecution, because the EPPO will work under national criminal prosecution rules; and I am sure we have managed to do that. So, what about the missing Member States? I will keep trying to convince them. From Sweden and the Netherlands I heard the arguments: our prosecution works well. I have to be better in explaining that this is not about well or badly functioning prosecution services, it is about guaranteeing the protection of your taxpayers’ money. So this is my task for the near future. On Poland and Hungary I have never hidden that I see the need to take the EPPO as a factor in the negotiations on the future multiannual financial framework and for the possible future Cohesion Policy. I will be very strong on this because I am convinced that the EPPO will work as a very strong deterrent and, let me use the word, repressive body.  If a Member State does not have the EPPO then we will have to be much stronger in preventive action. Already now in the Cohesion Policy, in structural funds distribution, there is a lot of control, a lot of audit, a lot of preventive measures, and still you see so much fraud and corruption in it. For the Member States which will get the Cohesion Fund money and will not be under the EPPO we will simply have to be much stronger in enhancing this control and audit. This will be my effort for the months to come when we discuss the future Cohesion Policy. Thank you very much for your support.

In fact, there are already institutions with competences in judicial cooperation at European level, and the creation of a new institution (too complex and too expensive) will affect existing institutions and the fight against fraud in general.

It is unfortunate, but the experience of recent years has shown that the judicial organizations in the Member States are not suitable, and in some cases unreliable, for detecting and sanctioning abuses and fraud in the spending of European funds. And for OLAF, Eurojust and Europol, as we know, the Treaty does not provide such powers, as the legislator simply could not have foreseen a situation where complete corruption mafia systems parasitizing European funds could be built within the Union, with government support. It is a sad fact that the most obvious example of this today is my own country, Hungary, which has been left out of EPPO co-operation, where Orbán's authoritarian anti-European regime is largely based on systemic corruption financed by the deception of European funds. This practice is disguised - rather than exposed by its profession - by a prosecutor's office under the political control of the regime, where OLAF's inquiries are stalled.

The European Public Prosecutor's Office is a strong response to these challenges, but operating in an enhanced cooperation format may significantly reduce its intended effectiveness. Therefore, joining the project of other, still undecided Member States would certainly be a decisive step forward in the process of integration and deepening cooperation - in the interest of all EU citizens.

Following a letter from the German and the Swedish Foreign Ministers to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini, regarding the arrest of two EU citizens with dual nationality on the basis of Interpol Red Notices, the Presidency decided to address this topic at the joint meeting of the Political and Security Committee and the Standing Committee on Operational Cooperation on Internal Security, on 26 September. This was just the first step and the Presidency plans to raise the topic again at the half-yearly meeting of the EU Justice and Home Affairs Senior Officials with Interpol on 20 November. We aim to discuss then possible improvements to the existing Interpol systems, and we will listen carefully to Interpol’s plans. The number of Red Notices has increased over recent years, and they are an extremely useful tool in obtaining the provisional arrest of persons sought for extradition for serious crimes. This was shown by the result of a Commission questionnaire in 2016 regarding Members States’ use of Interpol Red Notices. Over the years, these notices have indeed resulted in the arrests of numerous criminals. Nonetheless, it is important that the proper review should take place before Red Notices are issued, which is a demanding task. It is essential that the rights of our citizens are protected and that an effective redress mechanism exists. The Presidency is aware that the Interpol general assembly last week, 26-29 September, discussed Red Notices. Interpol has an internal, systematic and proactive review process for vetting the legality of new Red Notices entered into the Interpol database. The Presidency will discuss with Interpol how this process could be speeded up and improved. The use of Interpol Red Notices for the purpose of obtaining the arrest of persons sought with a view to extradition is not new. The 1957 extradition Convention of the Council of Europe, to which all Member States are parties, as well as Turkey, allows Interpol to be used for transmitting requests for provisional arrest. Whether a Member State accepts an Interpol Red Notice, pending a decision on an extradition request, falls solely within the competence of the Member State. I would like to emphasise that an Interpol Red Notice will never be the basis for a decision to extradite, as that decision will be the subject of judicial review in a separate judicial procedure. Therefore, there is always a judicial review before a person is extradited. It does not appear feasible to have such a judicial review a priori but, as I have indicated, we will discuss with Interpol on 20 November how to improve the review of Red Notices by Interpol itself.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 316, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I am aware that Interpol’s Red Notice system has been used for political purposes in some cases. Obviously this is of great concern and it can have a significant impact on the persons involved. The overwhelming majority of Red Notices are genuinely used to seek the arrest of suspects and serious offenders. Exchanging information with Interpol is important in preventing and fighting serious crime. The arrest in Brazil of one of the most wanted Italian mafia criminals is an example of the added value of Interpol Red Notices. EU Member States are members of Interpol and make use of its Red Notice system. They are, however, not obliged to act upon them. It is for the EU Member States to assess what action they can take when they encounter a Red Notice and to consider such notices carefully in the light of their originating country. If there are abuses of Interpol’s system, it is for Interpol to put in place the necessary measures to prevent such abuse. As the EU is not a member of Interpol, the Commission cannot directly influence how Interpol puts in place procedures to avoid such misuse. However, the Commission has already, in the past, raised concerns with Interpol about misuse of its instruments. The Commission conducted a number of fact-finding missions and meetings in order to understand the procedures that Interpol has put in place to process personal data. Since February 2015 Interpol has presented a new framework for processing personal data. The processing of notices and ‘diffusions’ against refugees will not be allowed if the status of refugee or asylum seeker has been confirmed. It will also not be allowed if a person fears persecution by the country establishing the notice. I understand that Interpol has completed the process of reviewing its procedures and tabled a draft resolution to its general assembly last week. The Commission will raise this issue with Interpol as part of its November EU-Interpol senior official meeting. The Commission is ready to provide, as it has done in the past, any support that may be deemed necessary. As regards the procedures put in place by EU Member States, the Commission gathered information in October 2015 in order to understand how Member States are using Red Notices from Interpol. A large majority of Member States indicated that the upload of Interpol Red Notices into national databases is done only after further examinations and checks. The Commission will continue to follow this important question closely in cooperation with our Member States.

The issue really for us today is to understand what we do about it, and the Council went some way to explaining that mechanism – 20 November, and I want to say more about that in a second. The Commission also explained some of the limitations to what can be done, and again we must address that today. But let us be very clear what is happening – and again we have support from both the Commission and Council in recognising that these notices and the systems have been abused to – let us be very clear – harass and detain political opponents and dissidents. The countries involved include Russia, China and Iran, let us be very clear. A process to prevent this abuse is needed to resolve the issue, which will become ever more important as databases are increasingly, directly and automatically consulted. This is not an issue that will go away on its own and I respect the honesty of the Council in recognising this. There have been a number of recent examples of abuses of the system in Turkey. After the failed coup in the country last year, we have seen worrying signs that the situation of human rights is deteriorating, and we see this additional problem with the Interpol Red Notices as exacerbating the situation. We have received reports from journalists who are watching this debate carefully that they are now being harassed, and many others – including the Nobel Peace Prize nominee Can Dündar who is living in exile in Germany and who is currently on trial – are also being affected by this situation. We have heard from Fair Trials International, the Organisation for Security and Co—operation in Europe (OSCE) and others of what we need to do. As Members of the European Parliament, we need not only to speak out whenever there are incidents of political repression, but also to ensure there are safeguards in place to prevent the abuse of Interpol arrest warrants, which are an important tool in ensuring the security of the EU. My questions then come back to the Commission and Council: can we provide more detail on what has been done to ensure the rights of EU and third—country citizens, and whether there is a better mechanism to ensure that necessity and proportionality checks are carried out on Interpol alerts from certain countries. Could the Commission also provide guidelines on a common response on how best to handle extradition requests from third countries. I understand the limitations and the legal limitations, but I am happy that, in the initial responses from the Council and Commission, there is a clear recognition that we cannot see these potential abuses of Interpol Red Notices happening on our territory; we cannot see these obvious abuses of human rights.

International police cooperation is necessary and welcome. But we have a problem when the system is abused for political purposes, and we are seeing more and more examples of that. It is, as has been said here before, very important to emphasize that this warning is not an arrest warrant and that Interpol does not issue arrest warrants or force Member States to arrest a person on red notice. Each state makes its own assessment. One should be especially careful when it comes to people who have protection status of some kind. There I would also like to emphasize that it is important that not only those who have been granted refugee status, but that those who have been allowed to stay on some other ground of protection, because there are different levels and at different times - at least in Swedish law we have had three, four different articles with protection grounds, but this is the only one where you get a refugee declaration according to the UN system, so to speak - so it is important that those who have been allowed to stay on other protection grounds are also given special consideration.

Interpol countries include Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkey and Moldova. Interpol has therefore included in its constitution an important Article 3: It is strictly forbidden to act in matters of a military, political, religious or racial nature. Nevertheless, many people remain in search of undemocratic countries. Although the extradition of these persons has been rejected, they may still be on the wanted list, at risk of detention and detention, and not able to travel freely or find work. Interpol deals with the demands of undemocratic governments. For example, Akhmed Zakayev, Prime Minister of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, was arrested in Denmark on terrorism charges. It was not until 2003 that he was granted asylum in Britain after Russia's application was recognized as politically motivated by British courts. In some cases, Interpol rejected the requests. For example, in the case of William Browder, the author of the so-called Magnitsky Act.

That is, it was clearly a political offense. So the red announcement came, he left his homeland, so the red announcement of Interpol came and the Czech judiciary dealt with this. Of course, the Czech judiciary did not extradite the person in question, but the whole proceedings took more than a year, and the Sahin in question was simply detained, restricted in his rights, basically indirectly bullied, and at the same time the Czech judiciary proceeded in accordance with the law. I think that the reform must be carried out by Interpol itself, the red notifications must be reformed, because the individual judicial authorities are then deciding how to proceed, in accordance with the substantive law in the Member State concerned.

They want to use the waiting trucks for the journey, into which they break into by force and unsuspecting drivers face heavy fines from British controls for this. Already in September 2015, the first worrying cases of Czech, Polish, Romanian, Spanish, Danish, Dutch and other drivers were recorded, in the trunk of which migrants were found during border checks. While the French inspection in Calais found no persons in the cargo hold of the trucks, on the British side, during the same inspection, they found refugees who, without the knowledge of the drivers, penetrated the cargo hold because they were trying to enter the territory of Great Britain illegally. In that case, the British authorities were uncompromising. They fined drivers, and therefore transport companies, for smuggling, although they passed the inspection in France without any problems and complied with all safety regulations. This question was actually started by the situation from this spring, when a Polish driver died on the grounds that obstacles had been put in his way. You wrote in your reply to the European Commission that there is currently no EU legislation governing the safety of land transport, which remains a matter for the Member States. Yes it is true. But on the other hand, I believe that the safety of drivers and the safety of EU citizens is one of the EU's shared competences. Therefore, I would like to address you with a question about what measures you are preparing in this context and how to effectively prevent these cases of unjustified accusation of drivers of smuggling.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 337, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, a year ago the Commission held an exchange of views on the impact of the migration crisis on the European commercial road transport sector and, in particular, on truck drivers in the Calais area. The Commission was aware then that the security threat to this vital sector was not only from irregular migrants, but also from organised crime seeking to steal vehicles and cargo for profit. Accurate, up-to-date statistics are hard to find for criminal incidents affecting the road transport sector across all EU Member States. The most comprehensive data are collected by the Transported Asset Protection Association, which has recorded a 24% increase in the number of cargo crimes in August compared with August 2016. They recorded almost 8000 criminal incidents affecting hauliers over the five years from the start of 2012 to the end of 2016, with a rise of about 213% between the full-year figures for 2012 to 2016. About 4.3% of the incidents involved violence or threat of violence against the driver, although the figures suggest a downward trend. Just over half of the incidents occurred in unsecured parking locations, with the majority happening at night. The worst hot-spots are motorway service stations or road laybys. It is important to add the caveat that these figures as they are based only on those reported to the Transported Asset Protection Association, and some EU Member States collect and report on many incidents compared with others. This data can therefore only be described as an indicative sample, and the actual number of incidents will be far higher.  Indeed, we must also sadly add another threat that has become all too apparent since the summer of last year, which is the hijacking of trucks by would-be terrorists to use them as a vehicle-ramming weapon against crowds of people. In these cases the threat to people’s lives extends beyond the truck driver, as we have seen in numerous incidents across Europe this year. We therefore take the matter very seriously, and within the limits of our competences continue to work with Member States and transport stakeholders to find viable and lasting ways to reduce the adverse impact of these threats on the critical road transport distribution chain. The Commission believes in taking a holistic, rational and proportional approach in order to ensure high levels of security and safety in our road transport system, but with minimal disruption. We are taking action to help improve security for commercial road transport with a project underway, in partnership with the sector, to create a comprehensive security guidance toolkit so that everyone with a role to play in securing the road transport chain has the knowledge to better help protect it against a range of security threats and all kinds of unauthorised intrusions using best practice tips and guidance. All relevant stakeholders have been consulted in the development of this toolkit. The Commission is now reviewing the delivery of the draft toolkit ahead of publication and dissemination over the coming months. This will include the translation of the toolkit into all Community languages and the creation of a website where additional information will be provided.  The use of digitally connected security systems will be a major enabler of the transformation of the current road transport system, including the development of new security solutions. In particular, the Commission supports Member State initiatives, such as the Swedish Government’s response to the Stockholm attacks through the development of geo-fencing to automatically restrict commercial vehicles from entering centre city zones such as pedestrian areas. The creation of safer and more secure truck parking areas along the trans-European transport network, the so-called TEN-T corridors, is a crucial element of the strategy to increase the security of drivers and cargo in road transport. The TEN-T Regulation specifically requires, in the TEN-T guidelines, that the corridor network is equipped with safe and secure parking areas approximately every 100 Km. To help make this a reality, the Commission has made EU funding available through our Connecting Europe Facility Programme over recent years to finance such parking places, and the Commission has provided almost EUR 30 million since 2015 to support nine secure parking projects. The European Parliament additionally provided a budget of EUR 850 000 to the Commission earlier this year to be used towards further developing safe and secure parking areas across Europe. The Commission is using this funding to launch a twelve month study to identify the appropriate location of safe and secure parking areas and the best design for a parking reservation system. Most importantly, the study will deliver a concrete roadmap for the gradual completion of the network of safe and secure parking areas, including a description of the actions needed and their timing. The results of the study will constitute the basis for future work of the Commission to eventually ensure that drivers can rest in secure conditions and sleep soundly. Improving the availability of secure truck parking is only part of the answer. Existing capacity needs to be optimised by information on the location and equipment of existing parking areas, as well as by optimising the parking spaces’ specific methodologies. On the basis of the Intelligent Transport Systems Directive, the Commission has adopted a delegated regulation on the provision of information services for safe and secure parking places for trucks and commercial vehicles. The delegated regulation indicates the way to collect, update, share and disseminate the necessary information on the location of the secure parking, including the provision of reservation services.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 338, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Емил Радев", "mepid": "124850", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, 'safe parking areas' in Europe are currently lacking in almost the entire European Union. It is necessary to create parking lots and rest areas, equipped with the appropriate security technology, both for drivers and for the loads themselves. They must cover both the main road arteries in Europe and the key road junctions in each Member State. This need is further reinforced by the recently proposed changes envisaged by some Member States, which introduce mandatory rest requirements for drivers, subject to certain sanitary conditions. In practice, this would mean that any driver would \"abandon\" the load he was transporting and go to a hotel. Something that is unthinkable in the driver's daily life, at least due to the lack of safe and secure places where vehicles and cargo can be left. But this issue is much more complex. It also affects road safety, as well as the reduction of road accidents and deaths caused by drivers asleep at the wheel. Because last year, for example, a total of 25,500 people died on European roads, and according to a study in the UK, about 40% of accidents involving drivers asleep at the wheel involve truck drivers and trucks. Secondly, when discussing the issue of road safety, the issue of road network density and traffic should also be addressed, as well as the safety standards of the car fleet in Europe. We are all aware that the countries of Central and especially Eastern Europe need additional assistance in the form of European funds to catch up with the construction of their road infrastructure. The lack of motorways, bypasses for lorries and their adjacent road infrastructure is an additional obstacle to solving this problem and removing barriers to the integrity of the single market.

In other words, these drivers are also facing new challenges. Therefore, if now they are going to be required, as is being considered, to sleep away from the truck, we certainly need to make serious and credible commitments, not only about safe parking, but also and essentially to rehabilitate the sector, rather than continue to denigrate it as before, and, above all, to get more traffic safety officers on our roads.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 340, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Kosma Złotowski", "mepid": "124884", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. - Dear Commissioner, It is not the first time that we are debating the safety of truck drivers in this room.

Another Polish driver died in Berlin when an Islamic terrorist stole his vehicle to launch a cowardly attack on a Christmas market. Why has the Commission given so little attention to safety in its famous road initiatives? Can the Commissioner indicate where these safe car parks and hotels are located where, according to the Commission, drivers should take their daily rest?

That would be to side-line the two important issues: on one hand, the lack of secure parking places and, on the other, the inability of the Member States to implement the legislation which is in place. In this connection, it is worth mentioning that the driver is responsible for the truck and also for what the truck carries. As the Commissioner has already made clear, we have TEN-T guidelines, which say clearly that the Member States should be providing safe and secure parking facilities plus or minus every 100 kilometres. I would add that there is also an EU requirement for parking operators to provide information about the availability of these parking spaces, but Member States’ compliance with this requirement is, if I may say so, basically a joke. We can indeed ask how the Commission will safeguard security on European roads but we should not forget that Member States may be more to the forefront on this matter. They have to share information and make proper use of it, and they have to deliver for the TEN-T network. I have a final remark to make to the Commission. We are in the situation that we are to be implementing legislation which we are soon to agree on, but we have a lack of parking places.

Safety on the roads of Europe, but especially towards Europe, is a real problem. For the past twenty years, Calais has been a focal point that illustrates the consequences of European and especially Franco-British policies. The number of migrants, I assure you, dear colleagues, has fallen sharply since the end of 2016. We have gone from around 7,000 to a few hundred, but this number is tending to increase again. I sympathize with the plight of the truck drivers, but in Calais at least 150 migrants have died since 2002. They want to deprive them of shelter and food. A priest had to oppose the police to allow a distribution of meals in the square of his church. It is outrageous and inhumane. Justice condemned the mayor of Calais and the French state to finally put an end to the inhuman and degrading treatment inflicted on these migrants.

It was an area which had been set up by the Calais Chamber of Commerce, and we have seen considerable growth of the infrastructure up there since, with steel fences, more police activity, and yet the problems persist. All of us would agree that drivers should be able to operate safely, and we do need to tackle the criminal gangs who profit from desperate people here. We need to look at how we are doing in terms of cross-border police cooperation. But I also do not want to see any more dead unaccompanied minors falling from a truck when they should have been safe in the UK, had the Dublin system worked properly.

First of all, it must be said that road safety supervision and the handling of traffic offenses, as well as the prevention and prosecution of criminal offenses endangering property, health and life, are the exclusive competence of the Member States of the Union. However, the area of ​​transport and trans-European networks itself falls into the group of shared competences. We have common rules for the safe transport of passengers and goods. Road corridors are co-financed by the European budget. Transit transport simply has a European dimension and the Commission should address issues that jeopardize its fluidity and security. Taking effective measures to increase truck safety is also very important in the near future. Autonomous trucks, which should start driving on European roads in a few years, are already being tested in several Member States. But while artificial intelligence can significantly reduce accidents and increase traffic flow, it is much more vulnerable to unexpected attacks. Finally, another very sensitive dimension of European transit freight should be mentioned. It is a fact that most drivers are nationals of the new Member States.

It is a public secret that there are not enough hotels and guarded car parks on the roads of Europe to carry out such holidays. Examples are France and Belgium. There are no guarded hotels there, and drivers are forced to leave their cars in violation of the rules.

An action plan must be drawn up as soon as possible to make our roads safe: only homogeneous safety throughout the European road network can lower the impressive number of victims that we are forced to count every year.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 356, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Agnes Jongerius (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "125021", "text": "- Can I safely do my job today?That is what many truck drivers ask themselves when they drive their truck through Europe.I share those concerns of the truck drivers.That is why I, together with my colleague Dennis de Jong, wrote to the Ministers of Transport of the Netherlands, Belgium and France and called on them to take measures to ensure a safe route to Calais.My first question to the Commissioner is: has this topic actually been discussed in the Transport Council in September?My second question would be: if in 2015 we as the European Parliament called for more safe parking spaces, and the Commissioner says that nine have been built with European money in the past period, which Member States should do more to ensure the safety of our drivers?to ensure?Because I think we have a joint task here as the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 357, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Jiří Pospíšil (PPE).", "mepid": "125706", "text": "- Mr President, it has been a very interesting debate. When I am confronted with transport experts in my country, everyone is talking about safe parking zones. I think this is an extremely important issue that the EU should address, because if these parking zones are to be logically distributed across Europe in some way, then this must be coordinated by the EU. Thank you, Commissioner, that you have paid relatively much attention to this issue in your speech, but I still think that in the future, Europe will need to play an even bigger role here. We will probably not solve the violence against truck drivers, it will probably always fall within the competence of individual nation states. But we can play our part in increasing the overall safety of truck transport across the European continent and in ensuring a certain status for individual, say, truck drivers. And those parking spaces are, in my opinion, extremely important.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 358, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Der Präsident. –", "mepid": "2323", "text": "Before I give the floor to Commissioner Jourová, I want to say that we have seen a very broad debate, from refugees to cabotage.I do not want to disregard any of these issues, but I would like to thank all the speakers who, in their contributions, have referred to the core of the question.(End of the catch-the-eye procedure)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 359, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I wish to thank the House very much for this important and interesting discussion. As I said at the beginning of this debate, for the Commission it is of the utmost importance that the road transport sector can function well and that the safety and security of drivers is ensured. The road freight sector is facing a complex range of threats which continue to cause increased costs and delays, affecting the competitiveness and viability of the many small and medium—sized enterprises, which are the backbone of the sector. The Commission is working hard to find solutions to mitigate these security issues through a mix of interventions which include funding and the development of best practice guidance and tools to help the sector to improve its overall security.  This is in addition to actions that Member States and regional governments themselves must take to better secure their roads. There is no single magic solution that will solve all of these problems overnight, so the focus of the Commission will remain on working with our partners to collectively improve the security of Europe’s roads in the long term.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 360, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Der Präsident. –", "mepid": "2323", "text": "The debate is closed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 361, "date": "2017-10-04.json", "name": "Der Präsident. –", "mepid": "2323", "text": "I thank all colleagues who have followed this debate to the end.I also thank the services.I wish you all a safe way home and a good night's sleep.(The sitting was closed at 9.48 p.
