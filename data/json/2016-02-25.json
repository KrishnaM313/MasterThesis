Complaints arriving at the Ombudsman's office are mostly concerning transparency, access to documents or maladministrating as a whole, in particular in 20% of cases. Whereas the Charter of Fundamental Rights lays down the right to information and that the Treaty on European Union empowers the Ombudsman , under the principle of ensuring respect for citizens' rights, to investigate cases of maladministr administration, this must be his central task in order to strengthen that confidence. The Ombudsman has competence to be able to carry out this function, as well as to initiate strategic investigations of his own motion. On the basis of all this, I can only begin by giving my support and congratulations to the work which the Ombudsman and the Office she is leading throughout this year which we are analysing have been doing, for the proper fulfilment of her obligations. The Office has specifically responded in some way to more than 23 complaints, directly processed more than 2,000 and initiated 325 investigations, with an average response time of eleven months. However, in my view, the most important thing to highlight is the initiation of 17 ex officio investigations in relation to major issues of interest to European citizenship or of strategic importance in the European Union which, in the Ombudsman's view, needed greater transparency or better administration. In this regard, I would like to acknowledge and welcome the impetus it has given to the progress made on transparency in TTE, to investigations into revolving doors and to the call it makes to the Commission to establish a clear internal procedure, with clear rules and criteria, an interest in transparency in stakeholders and the request for compulsory registration and , at the same time, to be legislate on this subject, ensuring transparency in the composition of expert groups, in particular with regard to the development of the new CAP Regulation, which, as you know, represents the largest percentage of the Union budget. I also welcome the long battle it has given for the EEA to publish data on clinical trials, as well as the analysis of ensuring respect for fundamental rights in Frontex's cohesion policy and migrant return policy, requesting a mechanism for individual complaints. In short, and in my view, a brilliant, courageous and tenacious work is carried out by the Ombudsman's Office, which, in my view, deserves our approval. But that is not why I would like to miss the opportunity to emphasize not only that it continues to work on this line, but to point out challenges that we believe are still important for citizens, such as transparency and research in the field of health and conflict with the right to health protection , the accessibility of persons with disabilities to the documents and media of the European institutions, the mandatory registration of interest groups, the guarantee of fundamental rights, especially in the current refugee crisis, the improvement of transparency in the Council, which, I believe, is a pending subject — and we ask whether delays in decision-making by the Council in legislative initiatives such as the Anti-Discrimination directive or ratification Marrakesh Treaty are not cases of maladministrion—the improvement of the European Citizens' Initiative, or the erratic response by Member States to requests and whether we should not promote legislation establishing obligations and guarantees in this regard. In short, I would like to express this appreciation and reiterate the recognition of the work that the Ombudsman's Office has been doing during this time. Of course, my thanks to the Members of the Committee on Petitions for the understanding and good weather they have made it possible for us to reach a compromise in virtually every single amendment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-02-25.json", "name": "Emily O’Reilly", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Ombudsman. – Madam President, good morning and thank you to Ms Cabezón-Ruiz and to all the shadow rapporteurs for your work over the past number of months on this report. The text before the Chamber today shows a very clear understanding and support for my strategy for the office of the European Ombudsman, for which I am profoundly grateful. As I have said on many occasions, my office cannot function as it should without the positive engagement of Parliament, and time and time again, both I and my predecessors have received that vital support. We are a small office with fewer than 80 staff, but we are charged with a big mission on behalf of the citizens of Europe. I will endeavour to play my role in helping the EU institutions to keep pace with the evolving and increasing expectations placed upon us by European citizens and forced upon us by events, and especially at this time. I would like to thank, in particular, the Petitions Committee for its engaged cooperation and support. In our separate but complementary roles, we work not in the abstract but directly with citizens as they come to us either to seek our help our to assert their rights, at a time when, as Vice-President Timmermans has spoken of so well and so frequently, the rule of law and democracy needs even more strongly to be upheld and defended throughout the Union. Honourable Members, this is my second time addressing you in plenary since coming into office in October 2013. I have also addressed you in committee several times before the Petitions, Budget Control, Employment, Legal Affairs and Civil Liberties Committees. Each time I have benefited from your expertise, advice and support, and that has fed directly into the strategy that I have developed and which I am now implementing.  I thank the Petitions Committee for welcoming specifically my strategic use of proactive inquiries and for the reorganisation of my office in order to better support the strategy. I use the strategic inquiry approach to enter a dialogue at the highest levels in order to assist the institutions to achieve the highest possible standards of public administration. However, my office is, and always will be, driven by the complaints we receive. Today’s report notes that over 20% of complaints follow a refusal of an access to documents request. Transparency and the Treaty-based right of access to documents must play a crucial part, both in democratic participation and in democratic accountability. The EU does set higher standards than many Member States, but perhaps, given its reach and its role, so it should, and so should it also strive to achieve even higher standards. Thank you to Ms Cabezón Ruiz for welcoming my focus on the challenge of the so-called revolving doors issue in the EU. That is when officials leave the service for the private sector, allowing a potential conflict of interest to arise. My inquiry into how the European Commission deals with it has resulted in some positive improvements and, notably, the publication by the Commission, for the first time ever, of the list of names of senior officials who left for new jobs, with details of their move and assessments of any potential conflict of interest. This list will now be published annually, in accordance with the staff regulations, and I thank the Budget Control Committee for its attention to this important issue. The report also recognises the real progress by the Commission, following my inquiry, and much pressure of course from this Parliament, on the transparency of the TTIP negotiations. This was an excellent example, in my view, of the Ombudsman, Parliament and administration working together for a better outcome for citizens. The issue of lobbying transparency also features in my work. I have welcomed the Juncker Commission’s work in this area, through its Transparency Initiative, and have encouraged more to be done. I should, however – and conscious that issues concerning the tobacco industry will shortly be discussed in this Chamber – express my disappointment at the Commission’s recent decision not to accept my recommendation for the proactive publication of all meetings with that industry, and not just – as is currently the case – with DG Health. The legally-binding UN Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, to which the EU is signatory, is predicated on the recognition of the tobacco industry as one to whom the normal rules of industry-government dialogue should not apply. Briefly, we have also recently worked with the ECB on their transparency and ethics policies, and I am happy to see the ECB executive board now publish details of their meetings. I would like to thank President Mario Draghi for his cooperation on these issues, which are so vital for the public trust. As for the Commission, I expect shortly to receive its response to my strategic inquiry on expert groups and on DG Agriculture’s civil dialogue groups. I also very much welcome the upcoming public consultation on how to improve the transparency register, and I support a mandatory register. Such a register should not only have real sanctions but also full financial transparency requirements, to make sure that everyone is aware of who precisely is registering and being given access to decision-makers. Thank you to Ms Cabezón Ruiz for raising clinical trials’ transparency in her report, an issue about which I know she feels very strongly. I am continuing my inquiry into the public disclosure of clinical studies reports relating to Humira, a multibillion-euro drug sold worldwide. The report also recognises the work of my office in relation to how to ensure European fundamental rights and migration. I wish to thank Members for your overwhelming support for my special report to Parliament following the refusal of Frontex to establish a complaints mechanism. Following the parliamentary vote in plenary, I thank the Commission for including my recommendations on the complaints mechanism and on the treatment of people being deported from the EU in its new Border Agency proposal. Ms Cabezón Ruiz’s report also recognises the work of my office in the areas of whistle-blowing, fundamental rights and EU cohesion policy, the European citizens’ initiative, and in relation to the UN Convention on the rights of people with disabilities. Another new strategic initiative concerns the European Network of Ombudsmen, which I have the honour to chair, and the development of parallel inquiries into issues relevant to both EU and national and regional levels. This June, I will also host a major network conference in Brussels, inviting all national and regional ombudsmen to discuss and debate issues of mutual relevance. This will not just be an opportunity for us at the EU level to learn from their experiences but also for them to learn about the things that the EU institutions do well and which too often go remarked or unnoticed. An invitation to all Members to this conference will be sent to you in the coming weeks. One final issue concerns the compliance rate of the EU institutions to my recommendations. For many years, this is been around 80%, and I note the continued concern of the Parliament at the 20% non-compliance rate in my 2014 Annual Report. However, I am happy to report to you today, already, that the figure in the 2015 Annual Report has risen to 90% – a very satisfactory achievement, which would not have been possible without the increased support of all of the EU institutions and agencies, and especially the support of this House. Before I conclude I think it important to put on record again how impressed I am by the high standards of the European civil service, of the thousands of dedicated people who work in the EU institutions and agencies all over Europe. The vast majority work hard to achieve high standards in their work and display a true ethic of public service. People will regain trust in their governing administrations when they begin to see positive changes for their families in their daily lives. This is mainly a political challenge, but a strong and ethical public administration is often what separates strong democracies around the world from weak and failed states. In order to achieve higher levels of popular legitimacy, it is important for the EU administration to be not only of the highest possible quality, but indeed the ‘gold standard’ in ethics, transparency, accountability and effectiveness. My task as European Ombudsman is to work with those institutions and agencies, and to work with this Parliament, to help to make that happen. Finally, let me conclude by again thanking the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs, their staff and the secretariats for all the work on this report, and I look forward to your contributions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2016-02-25.json", "name": "Frans Timmermans", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   First Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur Ms Cabezón Ruiz for her excellent report on the activities of the European Ombudsman in 2014. The Commission considers the work of the European Ombudsman in fighting maladministration to be of the utmost importance. Good administration in the service of European citizens is our shared objective, and in that sense the Spanish translation of ‘ombudsman’ really describes the function in a perfect way – defensor del pueblo. I would like, therefore, to take the opportunity to thank the Ombudsman for her efforts, for the consistently good cooperation with her and her services, and for the excellent quality of her work. The report in particular comments on the importance of the Ombudsman’s work on transparency as a guarantee of good administration. In that regard, let me recall that the Commission has set itself very ambitious objectives on transparency and has taken important steps in that regard which have also been acknowledged in the report. For instance, we decided that as from 1 December 2014, all Commissioners, their cabinet members and directors-general have to publish information on meetings with stakeholders and lobbyists. Moreover, the Commission has also ensured an unprecedented degree of transparency in the context of the TTIP negotiations. This is one of the elements of the dynamic relationship, I can say, with the European Parliament. The Commission welcomes the fact that the Ombudsman, as well as the Committee on Petitions (PETI), has commended the Commission for its pro-active approach in both areas, and I of course will then also have to commend Parliament for taking such an active role in bringing this about. The Commission has also accepted the majority of the Ombudsman’s recommendations in relation to the ‘revolving doors’ issue and adopted last year its first annual report concerning the occupational activities of senior officials after leaving the services. The Commission has also committed itself to improving the functioning and transparency of expert groups. There are also other important areas where the Ombudsman’s recommendations have been followed up by the Commission. For instance, we have taken numerous steps to make the Citizens’ Initiative more user-friendly, reflecting the recommendations of the Ombudsman. In its proposals for a European Border and Coast Guard – and the Ombudsman already referred to that – the Commission has included a complaint mechanism for fundamental rights issues. That is how we took into account the suggestion made by the Ombudsman in the recommendations in the Frontex investigation, so I think we did what you wanted us to do on this. This brings me to the comments in the report about the compliance rates of the institutions. I think we, as the Commission, had a generally high compliance rate. In 2014 it was 86%, and I am very glad to hear today the Ombudsman’s answer that for 2015 it will be 90%. Let us try and improve that even further. It is important to look at the Commission’s approval rate, because we are concerned in about 60% of all the cases, so it is very important that we do our best to approach 100% as much as we can. Naturally, over the years the compliance rates may vary, as the cases and the conclusions of the Ombudsman are different every year. However, the Commission always takes the Ombudsman’s remarks very seriously, and we will comply with her recommendations whenever possible. She referred to one issue where we did not agree, and we will come back to the issue of the tobacco industry at a later stage also in the European Parliament. I want to conclude by again thanking the rapporteur and you for this debate, and I want to confirm that the Commission is looking forward to continuing our excellent cooperation with the Ombudsman and her services. I can say also, as a personal remark, that Ms O’Reilly fully deserves the title defensor del pueblo.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2016-02-25.json", "name": "Jarosław Wałęsa", "mepid": "96774", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, first of all I would like to extend my thanks to Ms O’Reilly for her work. Not only in 2014, but ever since she took office, her work has been exemplary. The Committee on Petitions’ annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman serves not only as summary, an approval of the work of the European Ombudsman in any given year, but also as a reminder to us and other European institutions to be more service-minded, to be more open-minded to our citizens. Living up to the highest standards of good administration in the European Union needs continuous effort on our part. The Ombudman’s power to open strategic investigations on her own initiative often gives us the necessary push we need. In that matter, I would like to extend my support for the Ombudsman’s drive for greater transparency and progress with regard to the transparency register. The register, which has been set up jointly by the European Parliament and the Commission, aims to answer some profound public concerns. The fact that over 7 000 institutions have voluntarily registered, with the news circulating that in the past week another 49 have signed up, shows the willingness to address the transparency issue, which is very important. I believe that the information provided in the register to ensure and confirm a balanced representation of various stakeholders is a great push forward, and I believe this will allow us, the decision-maker, greater transparency and greater understanding of what exactly we need to do in the European institutions and the European Union as a whole.

Madam President, we welcome the presence here of the European Ombudsman, Mrs O'Reilly, and congratulate her on her solemn re-election. The European Ombudsman's annual activity report in 2014 highlights the important action of this institution, in ensuring good administration and in protecting the rights of citizens, who are now becoming more accountable and transparent within the European Union, not only in relation to its institutions, but also with informal bodies such as the Eurogroup and the troika which are taking as they are known to be harsh and consequently anti-social measures imposed on the countries in a memorandum.  In this context, it is particularly important that the European Central Bank was forced, following the actions of the ombudsman, to make its letter to the Irish Government on the economic crisis public, when the ECB's interventionist policy towards Ireland was solemnly demonstrated. However, important steps still need to be taken in relation to monitoring the functioning of the troika, which is why the ombudsman must investigate the conflict of interest between the role of the European Central Bank, as a member of the troika, as a creditor of the Member States of the Memorandum, and the mandate of the ECB under the Treaty. The same applies to the conflict of interest within the Commission, between the Role of the Commission in the Troika and its responsibility as guardian of the Treaties. At a time of intensity of refugee flows there must be control and accountability of Frodex itself, and in relation to TTIP it is a given that the ombudsman must step up her action because there is a lack of transparency and accountability. After all, MEPs only have access to TTIP documents in harsh terms of confidentiality that violate democratic principle and establish a regime of secret diplomacy.

Madam President, I would like to congratulate the European Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, on her excellent work and personally thank you, Emily, for the good cooperation between you and your institution and my committee. It is always a pleasure working with you. I appreciate that the Ombudsman has focused in particular on transparency-related issues and transparency, as a guarantee of good governance. The Ombudsman plays a very important role in helping the European institutions to become more transparent, effective and, not least, citizen-friendly, as it contributes to increasing public confidence in our Union. One issue that has been particularly important in the year we are talking about, i.e. 2014, is the work of the Ombudsman in relation to Frontex. It is important that Frontex should have sufficient its own equipment and staff to ensure the sustainable protection of our external borders and to ensure the same functioning throughout the EU. I therefore particularly welcome the fact that the Commission has taken into account the Ombudsman's views in the new proposal on Frontex, to establish a mechanism for individual complaints about potential violations of fundamental rights. I also welcome the Ombudsman's inquiries into citizens' right to participate in the EU decision-making process. In relation to this, I would also like to draw your attention to an investigation presented in Sweden, the country that I know best, which shows very great ignorance of the role of the EU institutions. This is worrying, because it reduces the ability of citizens to actively participate and create influence on matters that we decide on in europe. In a prosperous democracy, anyone who wants to influence political decisions needs to be in a position to do so. Public discourse across our Member States often does not contribute to this. A more active public conversation could have improved democratic conditions. In this context, it is important that all institutions take greater responsibility for communicating information, dialogue and increasing people's knowledge. It is important that we take our responsibility and our time to inform about this. Together we can help to improve knowledge of europe and increase the sense of participation of our citizens.

Madam President! First of all, I would like to thank Ruiz for a good report and good cooperation. And of course, most of all, thank you, Emily, for living up to what we fought for when we had to have you chosen. We need to make it clear that these institutions should have a real ombudsman and not a partisan 'stick-in-the-rend-boy'. We have got that and I think we are getting it fixed now. We can also feel that all the institutions, including Parliament, are now preparing for this to be the case. I will not repeat what everyone else has said. I agree with it all and rejoice at what you have done for Frontex and what it has meant that we have been given openness – or some openness, let's put it this way – some openness about TTIP.  In particular, I will emphasize the work that you continue to get good administration into everything. Good administration is about citizens being well served, being at the centre. That's the service principle! They need quick answers, they need clear answers, proper explanations. But they also need to be comfortable with our system. In this respect, I would like to stress in particular that we have not yet managed to make it clear that problems of integrity, i.e. conflicts of interest, must not occur at all. It is still the case in many of our institutions that one thinks that as long as one has a 'declaration of conflicts of interest' then all is well. Then the rest of us are going to take an interest in whether they are nice people, whether they pay taxes on time, whether they are faithful to their spouses, and what do I know! Non of our business! It's none of our business! We must be sure that there is not the slightest shadow of conflict of interest. In this respect, therefore, we are going to look quite hard at the EMA in particular, where I have a feeling that it has gone completely wrong again. Now there are just two words I would just like to slam in here: the Aarhus Convention, it is not properly implemented here in the EU because we do not have access to justice. On the other hand, it is not properly respected in the Member States either. Although it is up to the Member States' Ombudsman to ensure this, I am glad that you are also doing something about it.

And I wanted to focus on transparency, because, as we have said, the greatest number of complaints and investigations relate precisely to requests for information and access to documents and transparency, and all too often these requests are rejected.  In particular, I would like to focus on the need to shed light and investigate the use and expenditure with regard to the Structural Funds, structural funds which, unfortunately, do not yet provide for an effective control mechanism and also where there are mechanisms such as auditing, very often we fall into the situation where the controller is also the controller. Moreover, all too often we talk about projects that have no added value for society. I am thinking, for example, of an absurd project such as the Tav, the Turin-Lyon high-speed project, which is in fact a major imposed and harmful project which has been highly contested by the local population for many years and which, moreover, is also financed from European funds.

Madam President, this report aims to give quitus to the 2014 activities of the European Ombudsman, Mrs O'Reilly. I recognise that Mrs O'Reilly has sought to improve the transparency of the functioning of the European Union. In this area, it has taken two initiatives that deserve to be commended. When it comes to lobbying, it has succeeded in creating a transparency register in which more than 7,000 lobby groups have registered. While this register will certainly not reduce the influence of the 35,000 lobbyists on the decisions of the European Union, it has at least the merit of existing. Ms. O'Reilly has also been successful in improving transparency in clinical trials. The information on these trials is now partly published. This is particularly the case with clinical study reports that determine the authorization to market drugs. This provides more information about the effectiveness of drugs and the actual cost of research. Transparency, however, has its limits. Ms O'Reilly has thus failed to achieve real transparency on the negotiation of the transatlantic free trade treaty, the TAFTA. While access to the negotiating documents has been officially relaxed, in practice their consultation remains problematic, including for MEPs. The Union really wants to prevent real democratic control over the TAFTA. Tomorrow, she will explain to us that national parliaments do not have the power to vote on this treaty, which will nevertheless change the lives of the peoples of Europe. In addition, Ms. O'Reilly has committed a political fault in my view by calling for a complaint procedure against Frontex officers for migrants.

Dear Ombudsman, Dear Colleagues, I have an idea.

Lack of transparency leads to mistrust, mistrust leads to false rumours, and false rumours lead to a loss of trust. We are witnessing it at TTIP. The most heated debates take place on matters that are not in the documents at all. It is true that we MEPs have access. I would also ask my fellow Members to make more use of these reading rooms, because what is in the TTIP is quite interesting, and we can then also prevent false rumours accordingly.

In my view, the reserves are still in that we are directing citizens' complaints or citizens' petitions more quickly to where they belong. We have the Ombudsman, the Committee on Petitions, OLAF, the courts, the institutions of the European Union – in this sense, we are all players in a common team. Close to the people for a better European Union. In this sense, we should continue to maintain good cooperation. Thank you again, until then!

I will therefore focus only quickly and quickly on one subject, which is that of transparency actions within institutions and in the context of lobbying. I share with you the idea that it is essential to guarantee the existence of European institutions free of conflicts of interest if we are to focus precisely on preserving the confidence of European citizens. It is in this sense that codes of ethics have emerged in recent years and a public register of representatives of interests has been created. I would like to take this opportunity to point out to the representatives of the National Front that this register does not date from their arrival, but from a little longer, since it dates back to 2011. I'm closing the bracket. However, are we well-armed enough to act? Indeed, how can we be credible if one of the institutions, such as the Council, does not play the game and participates in this collective effort of transparency on the relations we have with the lobbies?

Our report emphasises the crucial role that the European Ombudsman plays in ensuring European democracy and her key mission to make the voices of citizens heard. In her renewed mandate, the Ombudsman has demonstrated a clear commitment to increasing transparency, protecting fundamental rights and taking action to the benefit of the general public. The Ombudsman’s investigations into the ongoing TTIP negotiations have helped us achieve a greater deal of transparency than ever before in EU trade policy. More documents have been published and greater access to documents granted. To secure a decent TTIP agreement, we need to demonstrate that cherished institutions, such as our NHS in the UK, are not under threat. Transparency is crucial to delivering public trust in our trade policy, and the UK Government could learn a great deal from your work, Ms O’Reilly, in releasing the legal advice that they undertook on the impact of TTIP on the NHS and releasing that information as soon as possible. Citizens’ concerns for the protection of the fundamental rights of refugees have been heard loud and clear by Parliament’s Committee on Petitions and by the European Ombudsman. I fully support the Ombudsman’s call to establish a complaints mechanism for refugees fleeing war, who deserve to have their fundamental rights respected and upheld by Frontex. Her actions to ensure that clinical reports on medicines by the European Medicines Agency are published not only shows a commitment to proactive transparency but is also securing another step towards making lifesaving drugs for diseases such as hepatitis C available at affordable prices for those who need them.

From a human rights perspective, the return cannot be seen as a violation, and the ombudsman's suggestion that Frontex should set up a special service to receive and deal with complaints from migrants who feel mistreated during the return is the result of a policy that is not realistic.

Its role as a European ombudsman in helping the institutions of the European Union to become more open, effective and citizen-friendly, with a view to strengthening citizens' confidence in the Union, is very difficult. The idea of European integration must be consistent with more transparency and control of its institutions.

The ombudsman's interventions are based on citizens' complaints and are therefore reactive in nature, but For my part I believe that a genuine Ombudsman of the European Union should take a proactive stance, i.e. he should take initiatives, even without complaints from the citizens, with a view to correcting certain acts of the organs of the European Union or even some Member States. For example, the recent adoption in Denmark of laws allowing the state to confiscate refugees' assets should merit strong intervention by the Ombudsman because they are an unnameable attack on citizenship.  On the other hand, since poverty is one of the worst enemies of citizenship, its eradication should also be a priority for a true Ombudsman.

I would like to limit my comments to two issues. First, pertaining to the transparency on the TTIP negotiations: I would challenge any Member of this House to give me an example of any trade negotiation worldwide where there is more transparency than on this negotiation on the side of the European Union, and I would challenge those people who say that everything should be in the public eye. It is true of any negotiation on an international Treaty that parts of it will have to be dealt with in confidence for several reasons, and I think that is why the method of allowing Members of the European Parliament to know what is in the documents and asking them not to disclose that is the best possible method for people’s representatives to be fully informed about the subject without violating the necessary rules of confidentiality. The other subject I wanted to raise, which was raised by quite a number of Members, is transparency. We will launch a public consultation on transparency next month in preparation of a proposal we will make to Parliament and Council on a mandatory transparency register, which I think is the next step of where we need to take transparency. It would already be a great leap forward if Parliament and Council would apply the same rules on transparency that we apply today in the Commission. I hope that all of you who are so much in favour of transparency as far as the Commission is concerned will have the same zeal when it comes to transparency of the European Parliament’s work and especially also the Council’s work.

I found the overall impact very invigorating and very encouraging and it will encourage me to work even harder in relation to my strategy. I think this has shown again something which I greatly value – I valued it enormously as the Irish Ombudsman and I value it greatly now – because my work cannot be done properly and as it should be without the engaged support of Parliament, and I certainly felt that support that today. As First Vice-President Timmermans noted, an overwhelming majority of people mentioned transparency in their contributions. I think that at least 80% to 85% mentioned it, and that is not just reflecting the fact that so many of the complaints that I get have to do with transparency but because Members are reflecting citizens’ concerns about what is perceived to be a lack of transparency, perhaps leading to a lack of public trust within the EU. That again encourages me to continue even more vigorously, with Parliament’s assistance, the work that I am doing in relation to making all of the institutions of the EU more transparent. Another issue that emerged quite a lot was TTIP. As you know, I did an own-initiative investigation into the transparency of TTIP, and I posed the question that First Vice—President Timmermans has posed in relation to what is the appropriate space for confidentiality in any trade agreement and what is appropriate to be made open. As one speaker noted today, we are living in a digital age and, whether we like it or not, there is a much greater expectation, particularly among young people, that certain matters are going to be made transparent. I think that is something that we are going to have to live with. I shall be meeting Commissioner Malmström on Monday next, and I will be reflecting on some of the issues in relation to the transparency of the TTIP negotiations with her. Of course, it is very important for me, if I am to deal with this issue, to get complaints on it. Another issue that was mentioned a lot was Frontex, and here I would again like to thank Parliament for supporting me in relation to the complaints mechanism, which is something I believe is now going to happen in relation to a reformed Frontex. With my colleagues in the network, many of whom are greatly engaged in this migration issue, I will continue to see what we can do collectively to help in this.

Commissioner, I thank you for the evaluation report on the tobacco agreement with Philip Morris that we received from you yesterday. We have had to wait a long time, but the 31 pages are now in front of us. I am sorry, Commissioner, but I do not think that there are sufficient elements in this evaluation to extend the existing agreement. For example, the report states that between 2006 and 2014, the number of cigarettes confiscated fell by 85%. But is that a good argument? In the trade journal Tobacco International of May 2002 I read that the number of cigarettes confiscated fell to one tenth compared to the 1997-1999 evaluation period, i.e. by 90%. Was that because of the tobacco deal we signed with Philip Morris? No, because it didn't exist in 2002. This good result came thanks to the leadership taken by the European Union in the fight against tobacco smuggling. For example, there was the European Parliament's Committee of Inquiry in 1996-1997. There was the good work of uclaf's Tobacco Task Force and later of OLAF. There was the good work of the Commission and a number of Member States, by suing Philip Morris in court in New York. All this created pressure and a good result, as I can read in that trade magazine Tobacco International. Moreover, it is not an amiable agreement that ensures a good result in the fight against tobacco smuggling, it is sustained commitment. Moreover, 2004 2016 is not. In the meantime, we have the new tobacco directive, which contains elements of 'tracking and tracing' and which include the amendments tabled by Mrs Grässle and myself. There is, and you know this very well, because you are a strong supporter of the WTO agreement. There is the FTCT Protocol, which introduces new elements to combat tobacco smuggling worldwide. Let's not pretend that the tobacco industry is our friend. She's an opponent. Tobacco companies are suing the Tobacco Directive. They are suing member states or states such as Australia through ISDS mechanisms. Commissioner, let me be clear: I support your fight to have the WTO agreement and the FTCT protocol ratified by as many states as possible and first and foremost by the 28 Member States of the European Union. Let us work towards the proper implementation of the Tobacco Directive. Let us work towards a proper ratification of the WTO agreement. But if you are going to decide with the Commission later to continue or extend the existing agreement with Philip Morris, you are causing reputational damage to the WTO and the European Union. After all, why should other states outside the EU, why would our neighbouring countries sign that WTO agreement when they see the EU itself concluding or extending agreements, such as the one now before Philip Morris? Commissioner, we have a dialogue today, we have a debate today. We are going to vote on a resolution on 8 March. I ask the Commission not to take a decision before parliament's resolution is before it. I think that's simple courtesy.

Madam President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has I come to a different conclusion with the same arguments. But first of all, I would like to thank the Commission for finally presenting the report on the tobacco agreement after more than twelve years. Hurrah for that! The document is interesting. It shows the Commission's internal struggle in dealing with the tobacco industry, and I think we will have to fight this one here – unfortunately! For me, it is not a question of principle or even a decision of conscience, for me it is a matter of very pragmatic things. We should not attach more importance to this agreement than it actually does. The crux of the matter is this: what will be done in the next three years until the Tobacco Products Directive enters into force in the EU and outside the EU in the next six years, until the WHO Protocol can hopefully enter into force? These two new legal instruments are very, very important. The ratification process, the implementation process, must not and should not be jeopardised under any circumstances. That is why, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, you should comment on what the Secretary-General of the WHO Secretariat wrote yesterday, namely that the extension of this agreement undermines possible ratifications or that, under such an agreement, the EU would not be able and even allowed to make such an agreement. We need an answer to that. And then, of course, we need answers to everything. We budgetary controllers are concerned with tobacco smuggling and the fight against it. We need answers to everything that does not cover the agreement, the Tobacco Products Directive or the Protocol, namely the smuggling market with cheap white. I would therefore ask for further action. What we need is track and trace and due diligence for 1) cut raw tobacco – here we have five producers, two of them in the EU – 2) cigarette paper with its 25 manufacturers worldwide and 3) cigarette filters with around ten manufacturers worldwide. If we do something here – at the beginning of the product chain – rather than at the end, we would be able to achieve results much more quickly. From the present point of view and from the point of view of budgetary control, I can allow the agreement to continue for three years, provided that it does not jeopardise ratification. I do not believe that the industry will continue to apply the agreement voluntarily.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to remind the citizens who are following us that we are talking here about cigarette smuggling by the cigarette manufacturers themselves. The European Commission has taken a number of legal action against these manufacturers: at the moment there are four agreements in force, with Philip Morris, Japan Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco and British American Tobacco. Of these agreements, the one with Philip Morris is the most striking: one billion euros within twelve years, but Philip Morris has used it to ensure political interference in Europe and also in all Member States. For years the Commission has continued to postpone the publication of the evaluation of the agreement with Philip Morris and we have reached the point where the agreement expires in six months' time and Parliament has been kept in the dark about everything and all this time. I would point out that, while the Commission spends part of its resources on combating cigarette smuggling in the Hercule programme, it is not known how this money is spent within the Member States: we are talking about EUR 1.6 billion, the final destination of which the citizens are completely unaware of. In response to a question from me in November 2015, the Council washed its hands of it completely, saying that it could not provide any clarification on this because it is not an official part of the cooperation agreements. Meanwhile, in Italy Philip Morris invests and grows blessed with the approval of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, opens factories, obtains 50% discounts on excise duties to place its new products on the market, even receives a promise to be able to use its Codentify technology to manage traceability systems, before the Commission adopts the delegated acts required by the tobacco directive and before the European Union ratifies the Protocol of the World Health Organization on the same subject.

Perhaps that is why I have never smoked and, therefore, I always take into account these necessary measures and support the drastic measures imposed in my country by the Socialist Government, which have achieved a better approach. My group, therefore, has always been in favour of strong marking and demanding framing. That is why I recognise the excellent work which I recognise, and which I believe we should all recognise today, of Mrs McAvan with the Tobacco Products Directive, which I believe is the legislative framework in which we have to work. And we were also so when the Commissioner presented her agreement to us and we therefore intended to have a legal instrument for the European institutions, so that we could control and deal with an absolutely inadequate and uncontrolled situation regarding the capacity and impact of tobacco companies. I believe that this agreement, and we all agree, served to improve knowledge on how to deal with illegal importation and tobacco trafficking and smuggling, but also to teach us how to track and trace and improve the control situation of that. But now, at present, I only have questions about the new situation, because it turns out that the agreement expires and we have a loophole from this year on. And the new legal framework of the Directive and its implementation in 2019 and the WHO Convention from 2022 leave us enormous questions, Commissioner.  Madam Vice-President, I know its effectiveness and I would therefore like to know, first of all, what will happen to the three outstanding agreements with so many other tobacco companies. I would like to know whether at the time the Directive also comes into force we can avoid it and we could just work to get them to finish.  But also if our customs are strong enough right now—since their assessment recognizes that it is the most important factor—and under what conditions they are, just like ports. We have vacuums there (I am transporting I know from experience that the ports are getting bigger and more uncontrollable), how can you guarantee us, or, since you are not alone, but with the College, how can the Commission guarantee it?  And also the fears of those who think that the extension of the agreements would only delay the implementation of the Directive and the ratification of the Convention. I would like you to also be able to give us guarantees in that regard, how to ensure that this is not going to happen.  On the other hand, absolutely convinced of the need of the rule of law to defend our democracy, I do not like to run out of any kind of instrument in this vacuum.

Unfortunately, the detailed examination of this flagship document was not helped by the fact that we had to wait quite a long time for it, nor by the fact that the date of its publication was only yesterday. Despite these facts, I would like to share my views on this issue on the part of our group. The agreement with Philip Morris International partially served its purpose, as there has been a significant decrease in the smuggling of goods into the EU since its conclusion, and there have been substantial changes in legislation. We now have a directive on tobacco products, which represents a Pan-European system for monitoring and tracking cigarettes from 2019 on the one hand, and the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control ratified by five Member States, on the other. Unfortunately, however, there has also been a significant increase in market share for unbranded cigarettes. The ALDE Group has always been synonymous with the fight against trafficking in human beings, counterfeiting or smuggling of goods. We intend to continue the trend of zero tolerance in this area, because these phenomena are not only harmful to our economy, but are the driving force behind the grey economy and the black market linked to organised crime. Any loophole in the rules could serve as an open door for criminal groups. It is therefore our duty to ensure that illicit trade in tobacco products has no place at all in the EU, starting with active prevention and ending with sanctions of liquidation.  However, I must admit, Commissioner, that I do not find the Commission's published findings to be very convincing. There is no sufficient data clearly showing a link between the agreement with Philip Morris International and the reduction in the number of confiscations. After reading the Commission's opinion, I rather got the impression that only a few hypotheses were presented here. I therefore believe that, before the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control enters into force, we should conclude another agreement for this as if for a transitional period. And that we will help to combat the current problems with illicit tobacco and that we will use all measures that are proven to work, such as tracking and tracing obligations.

Illicit trade in tobacco products, in particular the smuggling of counterfeit cigarettes, means that the European Union and the Member States together have revenue losses of EUR 10 billion per year, and the value of one European anti-fraud programme (Hercule III) is around EUR 100 million for the period 2014-2020.  Tobacco smuggling is a serious crime that contributes to the financing of other types of organised crime. It is also a public health problem, because these illegal cigarettes pose a greater health risk because no one really knows how they are produced. The Agreement with Philip Morris has therefore made a contribution here to the fight against the illegal trade in tobacco, and the initiative must therefore be supported, and President Georgieva's efforts to extend such an agreement must be supported.  This agreement was concluded 20 years ago, now the market and the mirroring environment are completely different than they were then, but such agreements seem necessary, and there is another thing, namely that this global protocol to combat smuggling will enter into force 50 years after ratification, i.e. around 2020.

I am pleased that Parliament has finally received the securities report on the agreement with Philip Morris. According to the report, the number of pmi cigarettes intercepted has fallen by 85% since 2004. However, as the researchers themselves have pointed out, that doesn't say much yet. Since 2004, more and more unbranded cigarettes, cheap whites, have been smuggled into the EU. The researchers therefore had to conclude – i think this is very important – that cooperation with PMI has not produced a demonstrable benefit for public health in Europe. Remarkably, the small amount of fines that PMI has had to pay, i.m. to more than EUR 68 million. The researchers note that the intercepts involve smaller and smaller quantities of cigarettes. They therefore remain under the radar because the agreement with PMI only includes intercepts of at least 50 000 cigarettes. This means that the tobacco industry is getting away with it very well. Now to the key question: should we extend the agreement with PMI? In my group's opinion, not. The researchers already point out that it is at least curious to conclude a cooperation agreement with the same manufacturers that are legally challenging the European Tobacco Directive. In addition, new legal rules will come into force within a few years that force PMI to make similar provisions as agreed in the agreement. The main argument, however, remains that, according to world health organisation rules, any appearance of conflict of interest or entanglement with the tobacco industry should be avoided. Let us not make ourselves dependent on money with blood attached. That is why I hope that today we can see with the Commission that cooperation with PMI will not be extended.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 59, "date": "2016-02-25.json", "name": "Kristalina Georgieva", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, it is very clear from the discussion we are having here that the smuggling of tobacco products is something that concerns us all. It affects our public health, our public finances and the quality of our law enforcement. The interest of Parliament is shared by the Commission. This is an important priority in our work. Today we are debating it because the EU’s first anti—fraud agreement with the largest tobacco manufacturer in Europe, Philip Morris International (PMI), is set to expire in July. We are currently reflecting on the way forward and we are benefiting from the debate in this Chamber. Yesterday we disclosed the Commission assessment of the agreement. It is the result of very thorough discussions with the Member States and all relevant services. We wanted to make sure that it was as good as it could be, and we acted on our promise to Parliament that we would engage all the services of the Commission, and in particular the Directorate—General responsible for health, to produce this assessment. We did that. Let me start by recalling why we have this agreement in the first place. In the past, significant volumes of contraband cigarettes from the major tobacco manufacturers were being smuggled illegally in the EU. We pushed the companies to take action, and the very extensive investigation by OLAF led to litigation by the EU and its Member States before the US courts against several tobacco manufacturers, resulting in anti-fraud agreements.  Under these agreements, the manufacturers accepted regulatory discipline that, at that time, was very innovative, included global tracking and tracing of their products, due diligence and know-your-customer, as well as anti-money-laundering provisions. They also offered financial incentives to these companies to comply with the agreements. What is the assessment telling us? First, even if we cannot make – as has been pointed out – direct causality between the agreement and the results in terms of the reduction of smuggling, we have achieved the key objective. The seizure of PMI contraband notified by Member States under the agreement was reduced by 85% between 2006 and 2014. That is a fact. Second, the agreement provided national and European investigators with intelligence that has led to many seizures, arrests and criminal indictments. Transnational criminal organisations were dismantled and illegal factories in some Member States were closed down. Third, it must also be made clear that the reduction of the PMI contraband did not lead to the overall reduction of the EU tobacco black market. The assessment is very clear about that. What we shrank has been taken over by the so—called ‘cheap whites’. Fourthly, the total payments asked by us – annual and seizures – made by the four manufacturers into the EU have so far surpassed EUR 1.1 billion, including around EUR 100 million in seizure payments. Fifth, lessons have been learned from the implementation of these agreements, especially in terms of global tracking and tracing, and these lessons are now very valuably integrated at international level. Today, the growing problem of cheap whites requires us to continue to work with our Member States to tackle it. I am very pleased to report that OLAF has taken this mission of tackling illegal smuggling very seriously, together with Member States. Last year, 2015, 600 million cigarettes were confiscated, and a vast share of those were cheap whites. As has been stated, we have new tools today. The world has changed. We have the Tobacco Products Directive from 2014 which focuses on production and sales into the European Union. The track and trace features under this Directive will become mandatory for all manufacturers and importers in May 2019. Just as importantly, we have the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. It requires 40 ratifications to enter into force. So far we have 15. I look forward to Parliament voting in May on ratification by the EU, and I can tell you that we are putting a lot of attention and energy into facilitating more ratification so we can have it in force by 2022. So what is the future of the PMI agreement? We are clear that our overarching goal to fight the illicit tobacco trade remains, and we have to make sure we are as effective as possible. We are strengthening our capacity for that. In March this year we will have an independent laboratory to help us in this fight. We are very keen for the regime that is put in place in the EU and internationally to be active and to deliver in this fight. Now the question is whether or not, between today and the time when we have the directive in place, 2019, or the time when we have the protocol enacted in 2022, we still need a legally-binding instrument to fight illegal trade. This is what I am here to listen to. I will take this debate into account so we can make an informed decision in the Commission in the weeks to come.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 60, "date": "2016-02-25.json", "name": "Petri Sarvamaa", "mepid": "112611", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, Madam Vice-President, thank you for your presentation and for the assessment made available yesterday. The assessment arrived right on time for this discussion, although we had to wait for two years for it. So yesterday with the paper in our hands, we already knew what the reality out there is. We had gotten the information from out there. Which, by the way, gives me reason to ask this little side question: besides the tobacco industry, does the Commission have any other sources of information than the Member State listings of seized cigarettes exceeding 50 000 smuggled cigarettes? No matter how well the industry takes care of its responsibilities, smoking as such is annually causing well over EUR 30 billion of damage to our economies, not even mentioning the immense human suffering. While the Commission’s staff working document provides us with a comprehensive view of where we stand with the PMI agreement, I must say, even after the words you have just said, that after such a long wait I wished for a more thorough assessment about what all this means. The reality that is out there: the amount of illegal cigarettes is still about the same – at least, it is too much. So should we prolong the PMI agreement or not? If the answer is yes, then what should it consist of? If we do not know yet – if we do not know before 2019 or 2022 – then that is wasted years.

EU budgets miss out on between EUR 10 and 12 billion a year. What has not been assessed is the 700 000 deaths that die prematurely each year due to tobacco consumption. What has not been assessed is the health costs of the systems resulting from the smuggling of tobacco, but above all from the use of tobacco. In other words, we must not only consider today whether we want to have a cooperation agreement with a tobacco producer in the future, but we must also look at how we can take action together to ensure that far fewer young people, above all, use cigarettes. What is presented to me here in the assessment does not do that. This speaks of the fact that the project of controlling the tobacco market has in fact failed if those who are to be controlled also decide what has come onto the market and say: all right, these are not our products at all. About 80 percent of the products, Philip Morris itself has found, do not come from them, so they don't have to pay fines. In other words, there is a traceability system, but it is also assessed by those who control it themselves to see if it works. In other words, we urgently need an independent traceability system, and we have really created the principles for this here with the Tobacco Products Directive of 2014. Those with whom we are to enter into a cooperation agreement here are the ones who are now suing us because they believe that they do not want an independent system of tracing. Why don't they want it?

Madam President, Commissioner, just a little chronological reminder, since things have already been said a little bit by everyone. In 1998, the tobacco industry in the United States was fined more than $200 billion. In Europe, in the face of the complaint, the industry agreed that Philip Morris should pay 1.2 million euros, but in return there was this agreement. This is a problem, because it means that the wolf has entered the fold, in the European institutions, and in particular in OLAF. In 2012, at a time when we were debating the reform to put in place binding rules, Philip Morris - again himself - had the head of the European Commissioner, Mr Dalli, with the complicity of some people at OLAF, so much so that, for ten months, the Belgian justice system has been calling for the lifting of Mr Kessler's diplomatic immunity. Finally, in 2014, two months after the vote and the introduction of the new regulations on tobacco and tobacco control, the industry, including Philip Morris, took the matter to the European Court of Justice to challenge the content of our own texts. On the basis of this observation, I would like to ask three very simple questions. First, how can a multi-recidivist criminal enterprise be assigned to a multi-recidivist criminal enterprise against public health? Today, that is not acceptable. Secondly, how can we accept that the European Parliament should be kept out of the decision that could be taken next week, even before a resolution is voted on in Parliament? Finally, third question, how to get the approval of the protocol that requires the rejection of non-binding partnerships and agreements with the tobacco industry to be voted on in May?

Well, first let us do no harm, let us note that the evidence on a link between plain packaging and smuggling is mixed and make sure that Member States can decide their own laws. While we are on public health, we should welcome, not condemn, moves from traditional cigarettes to e-cigarettes, and I have a lot of concerns about the revised Tobacco Products Directive on that one, which is going to put people in my constituency out of work, which is going to increase the share of the market held by big tobacco, make it harder for people to quit smoking , and result in more deaths.

Madam President, in many Member States of the Union, if not as a whole, the rates of tobacco smuggling are much higher than those provided by the statistical services because of political and economic interests. The illegal tobacco trade has two aspects to take into account: the purposes of inter-party politicians of all parties pan-European, and the invasive role of the large tobacco companies that claim the lion's share in a large profitable market. The interests are enormous and the budgetary implications at Community and national level are immediate.  Tobacco companies interact at all levels of the decision-making process. For example, the four largest agreed to pay $2.15 billion to avoid legal penalties after lawsuits were filed. If they were innocent, they wouldn't pay such a huge sum. In-house, voluntary or unintentional, it leads to a budget deficit of 12 billion at Union level each year. Especially in Greece, tobacco retailers are a big loser, as the weak link in the market, while losses for the State lead to an increase in unemployment, a reduction in insurance contributions and an increase in the risk of public health from smoking contraband cigarettes.  The ratification of the Protocol of the World Health Organisation on the eradication of illegal tobacco and the implementation of independent tracing is a first step. We should also deal with the taxation of hookah tobacco, which has never been counted and there is no evidence of lost profits, of the refillable liquids of e-cigarettes, which in some countries coincide with excise duty, and the fight against the markets of foreigners and illegal immigrants in which the illegality committed is impossible to control due to gableisation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 73, "date": "2016-02-25.json", "name": "Claudia Schmidt (PPE).", "mepid": "125016", "text": "   Madam President, Madam Vice-President, this House, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on this The European Parliament has been waiting since 2014 for a paper assessing the tobacco agreement between the EU and Philip Morris International, also as a basis for further negotiations.

There are also successes: tobacco consumption is constantly declining, which is a good sign. However, those who want more must work to ban the production and distribution of tobacco products. However, this seems unrealistic and would only encourage illegal production and smuggling and trafficking. Tobacco products, however, are also an asset, highly taxed, with significant revenue for the Member States. In addition, many thousands of legally paid jobs in the EU depend on tobacco production.

Very clearly this is an issue that is on top of our minds as a concern for many of us, and also very clearly there are certain points on which we have full agreement: firstly, that we ought to concentrate our efforts on making sure that the Tobacco Directive becomes effective by May 2019, as well as that the WHO Protocol is ratified by at least 40 countries , so it can become effective at the earliest possible time which is 2022, no later. Secondly, there is full agreement in this Chamber and full agreement from the side of the Commission that we ought to fight illegal smuggling of cigarettes. Not only does that come from the companies covered by agreements, but especially the so-called ‘cheap whites’ that have taken the space that used to be taken by the companies. Where there are clearly also differences in views is around what we do between now and 2019, and what we do between now and 2022. There have been very fair comments made that it has taken the Commission time to complete the assessment. Just listening to us in this Chamber – the divergence of views, the difficulty of the questions that are being asked – this is why it has taken us so much time. We have promised to make sure that we involve all our services, including, in particular, our health service, and we have done it. Now we have an assessment that we all have subscribed to, but it has taken time because the questions we are debating are not easy. So what do I take out of this discussion today? I take a recognition that we have to deliver on the issues where we have full agreement, and that we need to focus our efforts where it matters the most. And I also take under advisement the views that have been expressed on what we do between now and then, and I can tell you we will reflect on those very carefully. Going back in history, Parliament was very supportive of the signing of the agreements – for a reason, because at that time we had nothing. And now Parliament is not so supportive – there are divergent views. Why? Because we have better tools to fight illegal smuggling. But we do not quite have them just yet, and this is what puts us in a debate that we have to integrate in our decision. I was asked a specific question – what information do we use? We use information on seizures from the 28 Member States, provided to us on a daily basis. We also use data from Euromonitor, and we are currently discussing with our health colleagues the carrying-out of a targeted study on the illicit tobacco market in the EU, with an eye to focusing attention on the ‘cheap whites’ and strengthening our fight against their smuggling. Again I want to confirm that, on transparency, we have made the agreements available to Parliament, and we will do all we can to promote more transparency in the future.

The guidelines contained in the report, which should be respected by governments, insist on the same revenue that soed poverty and unemployment across Europe, in practice preventing any alternative strategies to address the crisis, with growth-stimulating policies based on public investment and increased aggregate demand. There are no cosmetic maneuvers, whether from a social point of view or through the greater involvement of this House, which erase the deeply undemocratic nature of economic and monetary union, which imposes, in the interests of the people and workers, its neoliberal policies of concentration of wealth.

Tunisia is a country with traditional ties to the European Union, and it is the country's first and most economically important partner.

The initial draft contained a harsh criticism of the ECB's unconventional policies as ineffective in supporting the real economy. There was strong disapproval of austerity policies and some hints were directed at the inefficiency of the euro. Finally, the rapporteur attacked the ECB for its role in the Troika. We welcomed this initial position, which was very much in line with our amendments. In addition to criticising the single currency and unconventional policies, we have, in fact, denounced the management of the UNION supervisory mechanism within the ECB, to which we have also called for greater transparency and the role of lender of last resort. However, in order to find a compromise, all the critical and politically most important parts have been deleted from the text. The result has been a much more watered-down and untenable report. That is why we voted against it both in committee and in plenary.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2274, "date": "2016-02-25.json", "name": "Hilde Vautmans (ALDE)", "mepid": "130100", "text": "  Written.

Despite their geographical location, both Australia and New Zealand are free-market countries with a long democratic tradition and a modern legal system guaranteeing the protection of their commitments.
