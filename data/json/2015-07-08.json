I would like to point out at the beginning of this sitting that there is no catch-the-eye procedure on this point and that no blue cards are allowed either. Let me be clear: this is a decision of the Conference of Presidents. I call for the Luxembourg Presidency, together with a warm welcome, Prime Minister Xavier Bettel.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1, "date": "2015-07-08.json", "name": "Xavier Bettel", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, on 1 July Luxembourg took the reins of the Council of the European Union for the twelfth time. We hope that the coming months will allow us to demonstrate our commitment to the European integration project. This presidency will not be a routine presidency for Luxembourg. With the years now separating the presidencies of each Member State, the benefit of experience is fading. The Treaty of Lisbon and the redistribution of the institutional situation make it a first for us as well. Finally, or rather alas, the circumstances are not the most favourable. We are in fact the presidency at a critical time for the Union. The challenges we face are serious. Growth is not on the agenda in all Member States. Unemployment, and above all youth unemployment, remains a real scourge. The desperation of hundreds of thousands of migrants seeking to reach Europe forces us, politically and morally, to put in place a new migration policy. I am also thinking about security challenges or sustainable development.  We will do everything we can to establish sincere and effective cooperation with the European Parliament, based on pragmatism and common sense. Mr President, the Luxembourg Presidency will also ensure that the real and direct interest of citizens is better taken into account in all EU policies. We are counting on the commitment and determination of the European Parliament because, without Parliament, the Union cannot move forward. In these times of great challenges that test the people, it is up to us, politicians and representatives of European citizens, to demonstrate that Europe can bring solutions. Together, we must act in a united and determined way.  The new inter-institutional agreement on improved regulation is in this context. The Luxembourg Presidency will endeavour to achieve success before the end of the year. It looks forward to starting talks with Parliament and the Commission in a constructive and pragmatic spirit and bearing in mind the European interest and its effectiveness. Let me share with you my thoughts on the situation in Greece. Indeed, the Greek people spoke on Sunday. We have taken note of his decision and we must respect it. However, I must express to you the disappointment of most European leaders meeting yesterday in Brussels that they did not have any concrete proposals from the Greek Prime Minister. That is why he has committed to making concrete proposals by tomorrow. I must tell you that these proposals, which are not unilateral proposals, will also have to be accepted by the other 18 members of the Eurogroup. I hope that we will find a solution for the benefit of all. In any case, the Luxembourg Presidency does not advocate Grexit as a priority and hopes that we will find a solution in the interest of all, especially when we see the economic situation of many Greeks as well as that of businesses. In line with the 2014 European Council's strategic agenda and taking into account the Commission's political guidelines and programme, the Luxembourg Presidency has set out seven objectives that cover the major projects of the European Union. The most pressing challenge and the first of our priorities must be to free up investment for growth and jobs. We want the investment plan for Europe to be implemented robustly and quickly. Measures to facilitate access to investment, especially for SMEs, will need to complement the effort in order to multiply the effects of the investment plan. The Luxembourg Presidency will encourage the initiatives taken by the European Commission to this end.  The establishment of a true capital markets union serves the same purpose. The European Union must make it easier for our companies to access European capital markets without barriers. The new regulatory framework should also be used to encourage investment beyond capital markets. We want to complement the regulation of financial services by moving the negotiations forward on a number of issues, in particular that of structural reform banking and money funds. Mr President, the Luxembourg Presidency will also continue the Union's efforts to implement a genuine European industrial policy, including, for example, in the steel and space sectors, by systematically integrating the competitiveness imperative in all areas of the Union's action. The development of the European Research Area will make it clear that the potential of the single market for researchers and knowledge on our continent, which is often caught between the United States and Asia, will be fully exploited.  Secondly, Mr President, social cohesion is the mainstay of European integration most affected by the economic and financial crisis. Deepening the European social dimension will be a priority of our Presidency.  Our Presidency will strongly support the idea launched by the President of the European Commission to keep this triple A social. To advance this ambitious project, our Presidency will work closely with social partners and institutions. The focus will be on social investment, particularly in areas of expertise, with a particular focus on digital skills. I will be looking after that as Prime Minister and also as Minister of Communications and Media in my own country. Governments must continue to improve the efficiency of their labour markets. In concrete terms, the aim is to improve the transition between the world of education and the world of work and to promote access to employment for groups further from the labour market, such as the long-term unemployed. It is also a question of facilitating the integration of young people through the \"Youth Guarantee\". I have received messages from a large number of people, especially youth organisations, who welcome this European initiative. However, this programme cannot be the only measure to combat youth unemployment. It must be accompanied by other measures, such as investment in education and training. The social dimension of the governance of the Economic and Monetary Union and the euro area needs to be taken more into account.  The Luxembourg Presidency will place particular emphasis on equal opportunities and emphasise the increase in the female employment rate and a balanced representation between women and men in political and economic decision-making as factors of competitiveness. Another pressing priority is to manage immigration, to combine freedom, justice and security for our citizens. The tragic loss of life in the Mediterranean calls for resolute and continuous action in the field of migration. The Presidency will give urgent importance to a range of internal EU measures and actions in partnership with third countries to put in place the beginnings of a fair, effective and credible immigration policy.  The Commission has presented an agenda on migration. It is now up to the Council to adopt a balanced package of measures to save lives, combat criminal networks and welcome migrants with dignity. It is also about guaranteeing them the necessary protections and promoting the return and readmission of irregular migrants to their countries of origin.  At the European Council at the end of June, we saw how sensitive these issues are. I am convinced that we will work together to bring together Member States, institutions and our citizens to promote healthy and inclusive management of migration. But I also know that it will take everyone's efforts. The European Year for Development will also be an opportunity to examine the link between development and migration. Indeed, deepening cooperation with third countries of origin, transit and reception will play a central role in the work of the Presidency. Mr President, the terrorist attacks have shown that six months after the deadly attacks in Paris and those that followed, the risk of such attacks remains real. The Presidency will vigorously and decisively implement the measures and actions decided by the Heads of State and Government on 12 February 2015.  The large flows of residents and citizens who have left to join terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq, and their potential return to Europe, are a major challenge. The Union will have to make full use of existing tools, develop new instruments if necessary and ensure that the coordination of the actions taken is perfected. These measures, of course, will have to be taken and implemented with full respect for human rights and the rule of law. With regard to the new tools to combat terrorism and organised crime, the establishment of the European Passenger Data Collection System (PNR) is essential for the safety of our citizens.  At the same time, the finalization of the reform of the protection of personal data is also essential. The success of the digital internal market will depend greatly on the confidence citizens and businesses to online data flows. The Luxembourg Presidency aims to conclude negotiations on this reform package by the end of the year. With regard to the European judicial area, Mr President, the creation of a European Public Prosecutor's Office to investigate and prosecute fraud in the European Union budget is the flagship project. The Presidency will work to move the negotiations forward so that the Union has an independent and effective European Public Prosecutor's Office as soon as possible.  The Luxembourg Presidency also considers that the Union must be determined to consolidate and promote the fundamental values on which it is based. Respect for the rule of law is one of them.  Fourthly, we want to restore its momentum to the internal market, in particular by focusing on digital technology. The latter remains under-exploited. The Presidency is committed to giving digital a cross-cutting priority and putting it at the heart of its internal market policy. We will work to dismantle the barriers that continue to fragment the digital internal market into twenty-eight national mini-markets.  The Luxembourg Presidency will encourage the use of the most effective regulatory and non-regulatory instruments, namely harmonization and mutual recognition. The examination of the future \"Internal Market Package for Goods and Services\" will be a priority for our Presidency.  The energy union, Mr President, must enable us to strengthen security of supply and to promote energy transition through the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors, which are essential drivers of green and sustainable growth, creating wealth and jobs.  In the field of transport, the Luxembourg Presidency will contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the European transport policy, which aim to promote efficient, safe, reliable, accessible and socially responsible mobility.  The fifth task of the Presidency will be to support European competitiveness, within a global and transparent framework. Following the presentation of the report of the five presidents on the completion of the Economic and Monetary Union, we intend to lead the work to move forward on the four pillars of EMU construction. It is important to promote a return to growth and employment in a framework of solidarity and budgetary discipline, but also of a more social Europe. We remain committed to the triptych based on fiscal consolidation, the revival of growth through investment and structural reforms that have a positive impact on sustainable and balanced growth. This exercise takes on, of course, another dimension in the current context of the situation in Greece and the necessary acceleration of the deepening of EMU. Sustainable and balanced growth means the fight against tax evasion and evasion! This is a priority that Luxembourg intends to place within a global framework to ensure that all competition is fair. The European Union will have to take action in the wake of the decisions taken and to come from the G20 and the OECD. The establishment of a level playing field at the global level is a prerequisite for the effectiveness of this fight.  The Presidency is committed to moving tax issues forward in a spirit of openness and full transparency. While ensuring that the achievements of the internal market are respected, in particular in the area of the free movement of capital and the right to establish, the Presidency aims to carry out the proposal on transparency and the exchange of information on tax rulings. The expected progress in the context of the OECD's work on BEPS will inspire the European Union's approach in the second half of 2015. The Action Plan for Fair and Effective Corporate Taxation, which the Commission published in June, will serve as a starting point for the Presidency's tax work. The Luxembourg Presidency hopes to move forward on the international elements of the proposed directive on the consolidated common corporate tax base and on the proposed directive on interest and royalties.  Die gemeinsame europeische Handelspolitik ist ein weiterer bedeutender Aspekt auf dem Weg zu mehr Wachstum in Europa. Wir brauchen eine Handelspolitik, die Gelegenheiten liefert und uns dient, aktuellen Herausforderung gerecht zu werden, eine Handelspolitik, die Arbeitsplàtze schafft, die inklusiv und koh-rent ist.  Wir werden alles daransetzen, gemeinsam mit Ihnen hier im Parlament und der Europ-ischen Kommission genau eine solche Politik zu betreiben, sei es im Rahmen der Welthandelsorganisation oder bei bilateralen Verhandlungen. Der luxemburgische Ratsvorsitz wird deswegen auch die Verhandlungen 'ber die transatlantische Handels- und Investitionspartnerschaft voranbringen. Diese sollten go Voraussicht nach im Laufe des zweiten Semesters an Intensity gewinnen. Ferner werden wir Handelsabkommen mit weiteren Schlàsselpartnern der EU in Asien fàrdern. Ich denke hierbei vor allem an Japan sowie unsere Partner in der ASEAN-Region. Wir werden uns jedoch stets fer ein Maximum an Transparenz einsetzen und ermutigen alle implizierten Akteure, einen konstruktiven Dialog einzuhalten. Aus diesem Grund habe ich mich auch dazu entschlossen, gemeinsam mit dem European Parlament und der Europeischen Kommission eine Konferenz zur TTIP abzuhalten.  Zu dieser sollten vor allem Vertreter der Sozialpartner aus den 28 Mitgliedstaaten eingeladen werden. Die Konferenz soll am 17. November dieses Jahres in Bressel stattfinden und einen konstruktiven Austausch 'ber Chancen und Herausforderungen der TTIP erlauben. Schlie-lich mechte ich mich beim Europeischen Parlament ausdr-cklich fer das Engagement rund um die Debatten zur TTIP bedanken. The sixth priority of the Presidency will be part of a sustainable development approach. We often talk about tax and social dumping, but there is also a real international environmental dumping today. Sustainable economic growth at the service of the citizen goes hand in hand with the highest environmental ambition. The Presidency will seek to accelerate the transition to a green economy with low greenhouse gas emissions by creating the dynamics necessary for the emergence of a safe and sustainable society. It will also promote an innovative, circular and competitive, energy-efficient economy that preserves biodiversity and natural resources, avoids waste and promotes recycling at the best cost. This much-needed ambition will guide the Presidency on current legislative issues, such as those relating to air quality or the reduction of CO2 emissions.  Sustainability will also be at the heart of the Presidency's work towards the various international deadlines that will dominate the global agenda, whether it be the summit in New York or the COP 21 in Paris. The Luxembourg Presidency is working intensively with the French presidency of COP 21. At the Paris conference, international negotiations will have to lead to the adoption of an ambitious and binding new treaty with global participation. We will put a particular emphasis on the issue of climate finance. Finally, the seventh objective will be to strengthen the European Union's presence in the world. The Presidency will strongly support the Vice-President, Ms Mogherini. The Presidency believes that the prospect of accession remains a powerful engine for reforms at Europe's borders, benefiting the stability and prosperity of the entire continent.  The Presidency will continue negotiations with Turkey, Montenegro and Serbia as soon as the conditions are met, and will contribute to the continuation of the road to Europe of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania. The signing and conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Kosovo and the implementation of the recently entered into force stabilisation and association agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina are other issues that will be encouraged by the Presidency as long as the preconditions are met.  Furthermore, Mr President, on the basis of a Commission communication on European Neighbourhood Policy, the Presidency will contribute to the work to update this policy with a view to adopting conclusions in the European Council before the end of 2015.  The credibility of the European Union in the world is strengthened by decisive action on development cooperation and humanitarian action. The year 2015, called the European Year for Development, will be, from this point of view and because of the major international events, a pivotal year for development. In particular, we attach the utmost importance to the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals. Improving policy coherence for development is an integral part of this new agenda, including migration. On 9 December, the Luxembourg Presidency will have the honour and pleasure of organising the closing of the European Year for Development in Luxembourg, but it will ensure that this strengthened solidarity continues beyond this year. Finally, allow me to say a word about the referendum that Prime Minister David Cameron is planning to hold. We will listen carefully to the British Government's proposals, and I am convinced that we will find common ground for solutions - but the acquis community cannot be jeopardised. I have no doubt that the United Kingdom will stay in the European Union. The Luxembourg Presidency is ready, for its part, to contribute to that objective. I am confidant. I cannot imagine the United Kingdom without a European Union, or the European Union without a United Kingdom. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these are the few major projects that the Luxembourg Presidency will have to launch, continue or complete. We will do so with enthusiasm and convinced that the European project remains the instrument par excellence to face the challenges of our time.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2015-07-08.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Commission President. Mr President, Prime Minister, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to see today the Prime Minister of the country I know best in a place I know well. I have chaired the European Council twice, the Council of Ministers four times, so I know the constraints that will be, dear Xavier and dear Nicolas, yours. You can count on the Commission, which I have the honour of chairing, to be useful to you in every place, at every moment and throughout the presidency and beyond.  I would like to thank the Latvian Presidency for ensuring that the investment plan proposed by the Commission can start its activities and I would like to encourage the Luxembourg Presidency to speed up all work, particularly with regard to the third part of the investment plan, which is to improve the overall context in which our businesses and businesses must operate and , in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises, which account for more than 90% of the EU's economic activity. I would like to encourage the Luxembourg Presidency to start the energy union, the capital markets union and the digital European union. Digital is of particular importance to Europe because, when we talk about the digital union, we are actually talking about an additional added value of 415 billion for European growth and 2 to 3 million jobs. I would therefore like to encourage the Luxembourg Presidency to do everything possible to speed up the work of implementing the ideas presented by the Commission. It is clear that all the issues that revolve around immigration are of particular importance. The Luxembourg Presidency has the task of ensuring that the objectives we have set for relocation and resettlement are achieved. The Council of Ministers will have to do so on a voluntary basis. I would have preferred that we use the Community method, but the European Council, in its near-wisdom, has decided otherwise, since it has opted for the intergovernmental method. But I am convinced that the Luxembourg Presidency will succeed in achieving the objectives we have set ourselves. In the same spirit, I would like to encourage the Luxembourg Presidency to redouble its efforts to make the Paris climate conference a success at the end of the year. The role of the Presidency is essential and fundamental and I am sure it will make the Paris conference a real success that will last. I do not see very big differences between the Luxembourg Presidency programme and the Commission's programme. It is actually the same thing and we will work together in the best way possible. Yes, the Luxembourgish Presidency will have to take action towards finding a fair deal with Britain. We will find a fair deal with Britain, and Mr Farage will of course be helpful. He did everything possible to stay in this House and now, as he is here, he will be the best ally of the Luxembourgish Presidency. (Applause) Also, Kollegen, funkt one!

Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, it was a joyous Reunion in Luxembourg in the European Parliament this morning. We might have been pleased if this had happened in more pleasant circumstances for the continent. But times are difficult and challenges are many.  I could try to paint a picture of the legislation that the Luxembourg Presidency should carry out, but it is extremely difficult for me to do so during the minutes that are allotted to me. I could talk about the need for reform of data protection legislation, we could talk about PNR - as they say in good French - climate negotiations, which the President of the Commission has just mentioned, as the Prime Minister, or the agreement that we will have, when the time comes, with the United States on free trade , and that worries our citizens. In this context, we will have to find a European way to complete a business that, at present, may well be moving away from many voters. This is not only about the German-speaking world, but it is particularly sensitive in this part of the European electorate. I could, Prime Minister, wish that it was precisely Luxembourg which, over the next six months, would achieve significant European progress in tax justice. It is strange that Luxembourgers are throwing such admonitions at each other. I remember several years ago that Prime Minister Juncker succeeded in putting a common tax base for commercial companies on the European agenda in 1997. It never came about, because it was challenged, not by Luxembourg, but by others. I would like us to re-enter the momentum in this area. Finally, there are even bigger issues. We must ensure that the European Fund for Strategic Investments achieves the success it deserves, because this continent is sorely lacking in productive investment, not only around the Mediterranean, but also throughout our continent. This fund is intended to remedy this situation. Secondly, in the context of Greece, in particular, Luxembourg has a great tradition of moderation and rapprochement of attitudes and the continent has reached a point where centrifugal movements are numerous, frequent and intense. My group and I would like the Luxembourg Presidency to try to give our continent a more centripetal dynamic. Many people want to leave, others don't want to leave. Above all, it is necessary to ensure that those who remain and who have always been there find a unifying and non-dissonant dynamic.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2015-07-08.json", "name": "Gianni Pittella", "mepid": "4436", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Luxembourg Presidency has a huge task ahead of it. As has been mentioned, the Greek crisis is before us, everything must be done to reach an agreement. I repeat: we do not even want to think about the idea that no agreement is reached, because this would have catastrophic consequences for the European Union and would also change its programme in certain respects. Too many European Councils have disappointed our citizens in recent months, while citizens are waiting for strong responses to Europe.  I have spoken about Greece, but it is not just that, I am also thinking of immigration. The Commission has presented a bold plan, which provides for the first time a mechanism for sharing refugees at European level. The Council has held back. It is now up to you, Mr Bettel, to return to this subject. We want a compulsory mechanism of solidarity between the Member States.  Solidarity for us also means taking back the social agenda. You mentioned the triple A of Mr Juncker's programme, in particular the issue of labour mobility. Everything must be done to stop social dumping. Solidarity means implementing the investment plan for growth and work. Solidarity means working with High Representative Federica Mogherini for Europe's decisive role in the world. Solidarity also means making a great effort to support the social economy; There is the big question of our development model in front of us: every effort must be made to accelerate the transition to a green and circular economy. The Paris Conference will perhaps be the last opportunity to reach agreement on climate change. We call on this Presidency to engage with the Commission in reaching an ambitious agreement, obviously with Parliament. Dear President Bettel, you have also been a close friend for many years and we are well aware of the quality, competence and commitment that your government has already amply demonstrated. We are therefore convinced that it will be able to face such demanding challenges and will certainly have the support of socialists and democrats in the European Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2015-07-08.json", "name": "Mark Demesmaeker", "mepid": "117477", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. On behalf of the ECR Group, I would like to welcome Prime Minister Bettel to this hemisphere today. He has outlined an ambitious programme with seven major points for the Luxembourg Presidency. I fear that you will not really be heading for a big summer holiday with the ongoing crises we are facing. I am thinking of the Greek crisis, which will be discussed in detail in the near future, but also of the migration crisis, perhaps the biggest challenge we face and will be in the coming years. To do so, you will need to have the necessary negotiating skills and skills to actually reach agreements and tackle the challenge. For my government and my group, the conclusion of an effective PNR agreement is also crucial, such that we have a common framework to effectively protect people's data and to fight and win the fight against terrorism. Prime Minister, another crisis lurks on our eastern borders. We are very clear on this. There is no place in Europe for the kind of aggression we see today in eastern Ukraine. Prime Minister, we will be happy to work with you on a number of important policy initiatives, such as the Better Regulation Agenda, the negotiations on an EU-US trade agreement, the energy union, the digital single market and the pursuit of a global agreement at the major climate conference in Paris. You will find in us an ally where you want to pursue reforms, but a constructive opponent where you do not. I will switch to English because I would like to say something about language. I take the opportunity to address you, Mr President: I know you meet a lot of people and have a lot of meetings every day, and you don't always remember everything. Let me just remind you of a promise you made back in 2012, as newly elected President of this Chamber. You said you would allow Catalan MEPs to speak the Catalan language here in the plenary. It is the thirteenth most widely-spoken language in the EU, with more than 10 million speakers. Well, their MEPs are still not allowed to speak Catalan in this House, which is supposed to be open and democratic. That, Mr. Schulz, is a shame and a democratic deficit.

Recurrent topics, of course, but this time it's different.  The current presidency of the Council of the Union will not be judged exclusively on the number of laws it will pass, nor on how it will fulfil its protocol obligations. No, this time it's different. The time is no longer for hollow sentences, nor for the optimism of circumstance, much less for \"there is only... Fewer of us have come to defend Europe's project. Here, in this very chamber, an impressive number of colleagues do not hide, or more, their pleasure at seeing the European construction shaken in its foundations. At the beginning of summer 2015, we need an unwavering will to preserve the essential: the link between our nations, between the citizens who live in our nations. Let us have the courage and determination to defend our freedoms. Let's be ready to take in the refugees. If they managed to escape the hell of Syria - often at the risk of their lives - it is certainly not to go drown off the Italian coast. It is on the irreducibility of human dignity that the European project is based and not on the Malthusian approaches that make citizens believe that the limits have already been reached, when we have not even begun to explore new possibilities for cooperation.  It is in this spirit, I hope, that we will still remain quite ahead, mobilizing the resources necessary to maintain the single currency, which is much more than a matter of money.  In view of the historical task before us, giving up 0.1 or 0.2% of GDP in the short term to rescue our assets could cost us a multiple of these amounts in the future with a Europe in tatters.  We are counting on your presidency as well as those that will follow. Let us not leave our Europe offered to the least federal, nor to the nationalists.

The Luxembourg Presidency must act as guardian of the parity of the Member States and the sovereignty of the States. Interventions such as those made in the wake of the referendum in Greece by the President of the Commission and the President of the European Parliament must not be made again.

The promotion of neoliberal policies of harsh austerity, which sustain the recession, which inflate public debt, which lead to unemployment and the poverty of the people, cannot continue.

Luxembourg is taking over the EU Presidency at a very important moment for Europe. Building and communicating bridges is necessary, and it has always been part of the self-image of Luxembourgers in Europe. I see four priorities: climate, refugees, fair tax policy, Greece. Climate: There is nothing to negotiate with nature. Either we respect the limits of nature – in the climate it is two degrees or less – or nature gets out of hand, as the heat waves in India, Pakistan and now in Europe show. Paris must be a success! Refugees: Reception of refugees from Syria. One million in Lebanon, one million in Jordan, two million in Turkey. What an international testament to Europe's poverty if, as the EU-28, we cannot even agree in the next few weeks on the regular admission of 60 000 people in need.

Greece: Above all this is the Grexit question. A Grexit would not only be a disaster for the people of Greece. Do the US need to remind us that an unstable Greece in the quadrangle between the Balkans, Turkey, Russia and the Middle East would be a bad, a very bad move? But Grexit could also be the beginning of the end of the euro and even of the European unification and peace process.  Of course, Mr Tsipras must do his homework. But we also need movement on the other side: from Mrs Merkel, Mr Schäuble, Mr Gabriel, Mr Schulz, the gentlemen from the Bavarian province and also the Greens in Berlin who have been swept away.

On tax rulings, shameful agreements that have allowed hundreds of large companies for decades to pay derisory taxes in the Grand Duchy, in the face of low profits in other EU countries: nothing! Hundreds of billions of euros in damage to us; from you only yet another deafening silence, even today. Mr Juncker, you were in charge of the Eurogroup at the midst of the economic crisis.  You are one of the greatest architects of austerity and rigour. Today pontifica ing, like others, on the future of Greece. But he didn't find a shred of courage to eliminate the shameful tax engineering that is a social hell for us. If that is your sense of community, it confirms to us that you are the anti-Europeans!

Mr President, Prime Minister, you look happy! You're joking with Mr Juncker, and you feel that lightness a bit like casualness. The Luxembourg Presidency opens in a very special atmosphere. A heady scent of chess floats in the atmosphere. The European Union seems to be in a state of clinical death, the problems insoluble, the tensions, the contradictions are piling up. The Europe of peace has become the Europe of debt war, of economic war, where the President of the European Parliament calls for the overthrow of democratic governments and replaced them with governments of technocrats, Europe of threats, permanent blackmail, unemployment, of course, and poverty. The euro crisis is starting again and taking a political turn, with peoples starting to say no to your hopeless hyper-austerity policies. Faced with the wrath of the peoples, no will hold, you must know, your worst nightmare is coming true. The people, whom you zapped, are rebelling. The crisis of illegal immigrants is taking on an unprecedented scale. You can't think of any other way than to explain to us that this is a good thing. This makes perfect sense, since this crisis is the result of your ideology. The aspiring pumps of immigration, which are the almost systematic reception of illegal immigrants and the social assistance they are granted are turning flat regime. This mirage is trying and will tempt more and more people dreaming of a better economic future, more and more illegals supported by already drained economies, ever more deaths off our coasts, attracted by this mirage. Let us not talk about your policy of almost permanent interference in the countries of the Middle East, which causes the destruction of states and allows the development and strengthening of the Islamic State. You have therefore become the facilitators, through your action, of the worst violations of human rights, those same human rights that you are fighting - oh, only with words, of course - in European forums. The European Union's software no longer works. It is high time to abandon this ideology, for the good of our peoples, to finally solve these major problems.

I must tell you that I am proud to be able to speak in an assembly where a peace project, which was built in 1957, is still at the heart of the priorities and ambitions of MEPs.

Mr President, we have talked a lot about migration. No, the task is not easy and it is up to us at present to try to build bridges and, above all, to recall the solidarity that must exist in this regard. I would like to point out that people who leave their country with a plastic bag that sums up their whole lives do not do so with a cheerful heart and that, if they do, it is often to save their lives and that of their children. So to say that these are people who risk their lives and that of their families, their children, just for fun, I find it simply outrageous. These are people who leave in desperation, precisely to save their lives and that of their children. (Applause) We talked about the Paris conference and expressed the hope that it would be a success. But it must be a success! We have to make commitments. On this occasion, we must come to an agreement, to have ambitions, and they must also be shared by other States. Nor can we in Europe give ourselves rules that are not those of other continents, whether it is Asia or the United States. As I said earlier, this ecological dumping that exists in some countries that do not apply any rules, simply to be able to attract industry, must stop as well.   Therefore, Mr President, our task will not be easy, but we have, throughout history, always tried to build the bridges that are needed today.  The situation is not easy, whether it is Brexit, Grexit, immigration, I think solidarity today is more important than ever and it is our responsibility to explain it to our citizens.

The health of dairy farms continues to deteriorate due to the Russian embargo, falling global demand, price volatility and imbalances in the supply chain. I am therefore pleased that the Presidency will also address the problems in this sector. Every effort should be made to de-bureaucraticise and simplify the milk package. The mechanisms currently being implemented, in particular with regard to producer organisations, have not worked.

Now we've escaped a winter without a gas crisis, but I'm sure none of us would want to have to worry about the next winter.  Guaranteeing security of energy supply is still the number one energy policy command for all responsible European leaders today. Tomorrow we will not be living in a world of smart meters and decentralised energy production. We must do everything we can to spread these technologies, but in the meantime we must ensure a continuous supply of energy.

There is a very challenging six months ahead and I look forward to the closest cooperation possible. Knowing Prime Minister Bettel, I am sure that he will do an excellent job. We meet at a unique and difficult time for Europe, and for our economic and monetary union. Before I discuss the special Euro Summits of last night and in June, I will report briefly on the key outcomes of the June European Council. Leaders discussed how to support front-line European Union countries under the greatest migratory pressure. We agreed on the relocation and resettlement of 60 000 refugees over the next two years. For clarity, the scheme will complement existing national efforts, with EU countries now receiving 600 000 asylum applications per year. Yes, the discussion was difficult and at times divisive. To my mind, it was the first time European leaders have had such an honest exchange on the refugee question. The European Council chose to keep to the voluntary approach agreed at the Special European Council in April. There is a balance to be struck between national sovereignty and action at European level in this matter. Now we have an agreement with which we can work, and on which we can build. The Luxembourg Presidency is receiving voluntary pledges from Member States on both relocation and resettlement. Based on progress so far, we hope that the numbers agreed at the European Council will be reached. In the light of the ongoing emergency, leaders also agreed that the European Union will assist in setting up ‘first reception’ facilities in front-line states to ensure swift registration of irregular arrivals. Meanwhile, the Commission will accelerate talks with countries of origin and transit on readmission to strengthen our returns policy. These will be on the basis of the ‘more for more’ principle in related areas such as development aid. The British Prime Minister confirmed his government’s intention to hold a referendum on membership by 2017. Talks on UK renegotiation will now get underway. It was the first step in a longer process that will also end at the European Council. We will come back to this in December. The NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg discussed with us the new security threats facing Europe, just as we learned of the latest terror attacks in Tunisia, Kuwait and France. In the context of international terrorism and other security challenges, leaders tasked the High Representative with preparing a new European Union strategy on foreign and security policy for June next year. We also agreed to use EU funding to support collective efforts to invest in the future of European defence. Finally, we discussed economic matters, most notably the report on completing economic and monetary union (EMU), published on 22 June. The report makes clear that the priority in building a deeper monetary union is reform at national level. We can best address the structural weaknesses of the eurozone by confronting the weaknesses of its national economies. Leaders asked the Council of Ministers to examine the EMU report further to determine quickly the next steps. Leaders also highlighted the importance of building a digital single market and noted the Commission’s new work plan in this respect. Given the central role of the digital economy in job creation and growth, the European Council was absolutely clear that this area is now a top priority. To achieve this goal, the future co-operation of the European Parliament is vital. Two weeks ago, I called a Euro Summit on 22 June to help break the impasse in negotiations on financial assistance to Greece and to ensure that all leaders were on the same political page. Over the next days, leaders asked the Eurogroup to accelerate discussions on a last-minute proposal by Greece. We believed a deal was achievable then. Two weeks later, there is now a race against time to re-build trust. I will not discuss the rights and the wrongs of the Greek referendum. Everyone has their own perceptions. It is necessary at this stage to move on. Let bygones be bygones. At the Euro Summit last night, leaders had a frank and honest exchange about the difficult situation now before us. We asked Prime Minister Tsipras to present his government’s ideas for sustainable growth and prosperity in Greece. The Eurogroup will now consider the detail of Greece’s request for a programme under the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) Treaty. Clarifications will be needed in the coming days and should be provided as quickly as possible. All sides in the negotiations share the responsibility for the current status quo. I call on all leaders to try to find consensus – that can be our common success, with no losers or winners. If that does not happen, it will mean the end of the negotiations, with all the possible consequences, including the worst-case scenario, where everyone will lose. Our inability to find agreement may lead to the bankruptcy of Greece and the insolvency of its banking system and, for sure, it will be most painful for the Greek people. I have no doubt that this will affect Europe, also in the geopolitical sense. If anyone has any illusions that it will not be so, they are naïve. The stark reality is that we have only four days left to find ultimate agreement. Until now, I have avoided talking about deadlines, but I have to say loud and clear that the final deadline ends this week. All of us are responsible for the crisis and all of us have a responsibility to resolve it. As Plutarch once said, ‘To find fault is easy; to do better may be difficult’. I hope doing better is not as difficult as Plutarch once thought. Let us prove him wrong.

Mr President, Mr President, Prime Ministers, ladies and gentlemen, the Task of the European Council in June was to formulate an answer to the problem of migration. The Commission had proposed a mandatory relocation and resettlement system. The European Council, after a very painful debate at times, has agreed on a system based on volunteerism. I did not like that decision, because I would have preferred a mandatory system. I would have preferred the application of the community method; we have a provision in the treaty. (Applause) But, to be honest, the gist is not there. We agreed on the principle of relocating and resettling 60,000 people.  This is a decision that is going in the right direction, since the Luxembourg Presidency, which I trust in this matter, will be able to organise volunteerism in order to reach this target of 60,000 people, which must be absolutely maintained.  But I would like to say that we should not be proud. I am not criticising anyone, but the pride of Europe to welcome 60,000 people to its territory is not a huge achievement, given the scale of the problem. (Applause)  Since it was the Commission itself that proposed this number of 60,000, I was not going to criticize that decision. But, if I let my heart speak, I must say that we are not up to each other!

I will not go into detail before you, because you have probably read it carefully, but I mean that, in the face of the Greek crisis, in the face of the many breakdowns of solidarity that are taking over in Europe, we will have to agree - or not - with all the steps proposed in this programme on deepening economic and monetary union.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour for me to speak at the temple of the Republic of Europe. Thank you very much for the invitation. It is an honour to address the elected representatives of the peoples of Europe at a critical time both for my country, for Greece, but also for the euro area and for the European Union as a whole. I am among you only a few days after the strong verdict of the Greek people, after the decision we took to give the Greek people the reason to decide immediately and to take a position, to take an active part in the negotiation concerning their future. Only a few days after his strong verdict, which instructed us to strengthen our efforts to achieve a socially just and economically sustainable solution to the Greek problem, without the mistakes of the past that condemned the Greek economy, without the perpetual and dead-end austerity that entraps the economy in a recessional vicious circle but also society in a constant and deep depression. The brave choice of the Greek people in conditions of unprecedented pressure with the banks closed, with the majority of the media terrified that the choice of no is a choice of rupture with Europe... It is a pleasure to be in the temple of the Republic, because I believe that here we hear arguments and judge arguments. So listen, I'm not going to let you get out of here.   I was therefore saying that the brave choice of the Greek people is not an option to break with Europe but an option to return to the founding principles of European unification, to the principles of democracy, solidarity, mutual respect and equality.  It is a clear signal that Europe, our common European structure, the European Union will either be democratic or have enormous difficulties in surviving the difficult conditions we are in.   The negotiation to be concluded between the Greek Government and its partners seeks to reaffirm the double respect of Europe, both in its common rules of operation and in full respect for the democratic choice of our peoples. My government took over, I personally and my government took over about five months ago, but the rescue programmes have been in place for about five years. I take full responsibility for what has happened in these five months or so. But we must all honestly realise that the main responsibility for the deadlocks in which the Greek economy is today, for the dead ends where Europe as a whole is today with the choices made, is not for the last five months but for the five years of implementation of programmes that have not led to the exit from the crisis, and I would like to assure you that , regardless of everyone's judgment on the right or wrong of reform efforts: One is a fact; Greece, over the past five years, and the Greek people have made an unprecedented attempt to adapt difficult, cruel. This effort has exhausted the resistance of the Greek people. Of course, a similar effort was not made only in Greece. It has been done in other countries, and I fully respect the efforts of other peoples to cope and governments to decide on tough and difficult measures. Austerity programmes have been implemented in many European countries, but nowhere have these programmes been as hard and as long as they have been in Greece. It would not be an exaggeration to say that my country has been transformed over the last five years into an experimental austerity workshop. But the experiment must all admit that it didn't work. In these five years unemployment has skyrocketed. Poverty skyrocketed. Social marginalisation has widened. The same has been extended to public debt, which before the programmes started was at 120% of GDP and is now at 180% of GDP.  Today the majority of the Greek people – regardless of our estimates this is a reality and we must accept it – feel that they have no choice but to claim to be freed from this dead end, and this desire, expressed in the most direct and democratic way, we are called upon as a government to implement. We are demanding an agreement with our partners, but an agreement that will signal a definitive way out of the crisis, giving the impression that at the end of the tunnel there is light; , workers, pensioners, those who can no longer bear burdens, and of course with redistribution policies for the benefit of the low and middle classes for a balanced and sustainable development perspective.  The proposal we are tabling to our partners is a proposal that includes credible reforms based, as I said before, on fair burden-sharing and with as little impact as possible. It includes the call for adequate coverage of the country's medium-term financing needs with a strong and forward-looking development programme, because if we do not put the growth agenda on the table, we will never get out of the crisis. Our first objective must be to combat unemployment and encourage entrepreneurship. And of course our proposal also includes the call for an immediate commitment to start a meaningful dialogue, a meaningful debate on tackling the problem of sustainability of public debt. There can be no taboo between us, we must see reality and seek to find solutions to this reality no matter how difficult these solutions are.  The proposal was tabled with these characteristics in the Eurogroup, at the summit we had yesterday. Today we are sending a request to the European support mechanism. We have undertaken over the next two days to make our proposals absolutely concrete and I hope that in the coming days we will be able to meet the demands of the critical juncture both for the good of Greece and the euro area, I would say mainly not only for the economic but also for the geopolitical interest of Europe.  I want to be clear here: the Greek Government's proposals to finance its obligations and to restructure its debt are not intended to burden the European taxpayer in addition. The money given to Greece – let us be honest – never ended up with the Greek people.  It was money given to save Greek and European banks but never went to the Greek people.  In addition, since August 2014 Greece has not received a disbursement of a instalment in accordance with the rescue programme in force until the end of June. Payments of 7.2 billion euros have not been given since August 2014 and it was not our government that was in power from August 2014 to January 2015. And then the instalments were not given, because the programme was not being implemented, and the programme was not being implemented and then not because there was then the specific ideological reference that exists today but precisely because this programme and then and now does not find social consensus. A programme is not enough just to be correct, in our view, it must be able and implemented, to find the social consensus to be implemented.  Ladies and gentlemen, at the same time Greece negotiated by claiming this 7.2 billion of disbursement but having to repay to the same institutions from which it claimed disbursements, during that period, of EUR 17.5 billion. This money was paid by the Greek people.  Ladies and gentlemen, despite what I have said to you, I am not one of the politicians who claims that all the evils of my country are the fault of bad foreigners. Greece has reached the brink of bankruptcy because for too many years the governments, the governments of Greece, have created a client state, strengthened corruption, tolerated or even strengthened the interconnection of politics with economic power, left the tax evasion of great wealth unchecked. According to a survey by Credit Suisse, 10% of Greeks manage 56% of national wealth, and this 10% of Greeks in the period of harsh austerity and crisis found themselves in the undisturbed; it did not contribute to the burdens as much as the remaining 90%.  These great injustices, the rescue programmes and the memoranda not only did not try to restore them, but unfortunately they have extended them. None of the supposed reforms of the Memorandum's programmes has unfortunately improved the tax collection mechanism, which collapsed despite the overzealousness of some enlightened but also rightly frightened state officials. No supposed reform has taken on the notorious triangle of interconnection that has been building in our country for years now and before the crisis, between the political establishment, the oligarchs and the banks. No reform has improved the functioning and effectiveness of the state machine, which has learned to operate in order to serve self-interests and not the common good, and unfortunately these proposals are now at the heart. Our proposals focus on real reforms aimed at changing Greece. These are reforms that previous governments, the old political system and the bailout programs, did not want to happen in Greece; this is real Truth. The effective treatment of the oligopolistic structure and cartel practices in individual markets, including the unregulated and unacvolved television market, the strengthening of control mechanisms in public revenues and the labour market, with a view to combating tax evasion and tax evasion, the modernisation of public administration are the reform priorities of our own government and we certainly await the agreement of our partners.  Today we come with the strong mandate of the Greek people and with our determined will not to clash with Europe but to clash with the incumbents in our country and with the established logic and mentalities that have sunk Greece and sunk the eurozone together.  Ladies and gentlemen, Europe is at a crucial crossroads. What we call the Greek crisis is nothing more than the eurozone's overall inability to find a definitive solution to a self-fuelled debt crisis. In fact, this is a European problem and not exclusively a Greek problem. A European solution is also needed to a European problem. European history is a history of conflict but, at the end of the day, compromises. But it's also a story of convergences and enlargements. A history of unity, not division, which is why we are talking about a united Europe. Let us not let it become a divided Europe. At this time we are called upon to find a fruitful and honest compromise in order to avoid a historic rupture that will overturn the tradition of a united Europe. I am sure that we all understand the criticality of the moment and we will respond, we will take our historical responsibility.

Before I talk about Greece, i would like to make a request to the President-in-Office of the Council: if this is the heart of European democracy, then I would also ask that the European Parliament be involved in the Council's deliberations, as it used to be, including in the person of our President. I believe that this is important. (Loud applause) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which I am not talking about economic policy today, I am not talking about budgetary figures, but I would like to talk today about the principles of European culture. Let's talk, for example, about decency, about partnership, about how to deal with friends. Mr Tsipras, you represent a government that has said the following in recent weeks: your defence minister has threatened the European Union that he will send waves of refugees across Europe if Europe does not pay. And your now-de Ladies and gentlemen, I would have expected the Prime Minister of Greece to come here today and apologise for these unacceptable remarks. But unfortunately, he has re-energised god today. (Applause, heckling) Let us talk about reliability and trust, including a cultural asset in Europe. In February 2015, at your first European Council, Mr Tsipras, you promised that Greece would present a reform programme. To date, there are no concrete proposals from Greece that form a basis on which to discuss. Yesterday, too, everyone sat together again, without even having any basis for consultation. They are destroying trust in Europe. The rest of Europe no longer has confidence in you. (Applause, boos) Prime Minister, you are talking about dignity, that is a key concept in your policy in Greece. Do you know what is part of dignity? Dignity involves truth, honesty. Her government has told Greek citizens that the banks will be closed because the bad ECB wants to exert pressure, and Varoufakis, your now-retired minister, has said: \"The banks will reopen on Tuesday.\" Today is Wednesday, the banks are still not open. Mr Tsipras, you are not telling your people the truth, and that is a undignified policy! (Applause, whistles) I want to keep talking about dignity. Dignity also includes the question: with which friends do you surround yourself? All I have to do is look at the plenary: the extremists of Europe are applauding together on the left and on the right. Here are Le Pen, Strache, UKIP. (Applause, boos) Mr Tsipras, the extremists of Europe applaud, and one thing must not be missing, of course: Fidel Castro has congratulated you on the great success you have achieved. They surround themselves with fake friends! (Applause, boos) I would like to say another thought about dignity, namely the dignity of others in Europe. When we talk about a debt cut, please do not lie to the people! The debt reduction will not be paid for by foreign financial institutions, banks, any financial markets. No, Portugal will pay 3.5 billion euros for the debt cut and 24 billion euros for Spain. It will be the farmer in Portugal, it will be the nurse in Slovakia, and it will be the official in Helsinki who will have to pay your debt burden. In this respect, I would also ask you to see the dignity of these people. (Applause, boos) I would like to introduce the concept of solidarity. Greece is in an extremely painful time. That is why Jean-Claude Juncker has offered EUR 35 billion in reconstruction aid, which you have rejected. To the north, Greece borders Bulgaria. Bulgaria is a member of the European Union. As an experienced politician, you know what people's living conditions are. How can you actually explain to the Bulgarians – in solidarity – that Greece cannot withstand further cuts now, even though the minimum wage is lower in five eurozone Member States than in Greece? Are you thinking of these people? (Applause) I would like to add two other concepts to European culture, namely the question of hope. The people of this continent need hope for the future. Yesterday, Prime Minister Straujuma sat in your seat. In Latvia, gross domestic product fell by 14% in one year – in 2009 – an economic disaster. There, the politicians of all parties did not hold a referendum, but they put the budget in order, they reformed their country and led it into the future. Today we have a future for the people there. You, Mr Tsipras, have a disastrous record, and that is why you do not stand for hope. (Applause) The last thought is democracy. You represent here ....

Mr Tsipras, Slovakia's Socialist Prime Minister Fico, a Socialist, has said he now wants to consider holding a referendum because it is enough for Slovaks to open their pockets for the Greeks. Can other states now also vote, Mr Tsipras? We have enough national perspective in Europe. Europe is not the sum of national referendums, Europe is the compromise, the search for compromise.

That is why we have opposed and are opposed to extremists and political speculators playing on the skin of Greece and Europe. I could quote Varoufakis' sudden statements or Schäuble's extremist positions. I could respond to some of what Mr Weber said. However, I would prefer to stress the sobriety, seriousness and constructiveness of Mr Juncker, who has worked all these months to find a positive solution. Today is not the time for excuses, friends of friends... The hairpin bend we are experiencing is too serious for this and is too serious to turn this House into a cheering Chamber. This is not the time to divide this House! this is not the time to divide the European institutions! It's time to join them! Because you do not play the luck of a political party, but you play the luck of Europe, within which Greece is also in. I agree with Weber on one point. Dear President Tusk, you made a good speech today. But it is not possible for the most important European institution, Parliament, not to see its President attending the Euro Summits. I would therefore formally ask you to invite President Schulz to his meetings. Mr Tsipras, you do not belong to the party, but I feel European at the moment and as a European I tell you that, for the sake of Europe, we Socialists will never accept a Grexit. Never! In the last few hours, hope has been rekinded. I note a constructive attitude on the part of all. The attitude of yesterday's Heads of State or Government is a good one. Well the sharing of all the Greek political forces around a possible solution. I think the conditions are in place to reach an agreement this week. The agreement was already there.  We need a clear commitment from your government to reform. Support for development and work, reform of the Public Administration, the fight against corruption and evasion, liberalisation: these are not measures that Europe as a stepmother wants but are measures that serve the Greek citizens! And I think it is also right to discuss debt restructuring, which is not a forcing but a commitment made by creditors in 2012, which we must honour today, and I also believe that we need to think about a European debt conference, which will discuss the Redemption Fund and debt mutualisation. I believe that on this basis we must authorise a bridge loan to make greek citizens breathe and put the negotiators in a position to reach a medium-term agreement. Mr President, anyone who will read the history of these days must be able to read that in this Parliament, in the European institutions and in the Greek authorities and among the Greek authorities there have been women and men who have been able to put aside their shack, their political affiliation, in order to do an act of responsibility and constructiveness, to save Greece and to save Europe.

In the beginning there was the original sin of the currency union, and today we are reaping its sour fruits. I do not know about everyone else here, but this gives me the impression of a pièce de théâtre that has been unfolding before our eyes; nothing really is what it seems. The Greeks want help and, at the same time, they want to have a free hand, apparently not aware of the old saying that ‘he who pays the piper gets to call the tune’. They organised a referendum which was, and at the same time was not, about what it was purported to be about. In Greece-EU relations we have witnessed a number of final rounds of talks, and we know that the word ‘final’ does not mean final – it means something else. The hard-core currency unionists speak about Greece, but what they have in mind is the monetary union, and they want to defend the monetary union and see it as the crucial point. They argue – and you heard it here in this Chamber – that once Greece is out, the entire construction, said to be so magnificently stable and firm, will fall to pieces. Either one or the other, ladies and gentlemen. So if this pièce de théâtre continues, I think we will be more and more confused about who and what we are trying to save: is it the currency union, the Greek society, the credibility of the government, the creditors, the reputation of Angela Merkel or the infallibility of the ever closer union? We certainly cannot save all of these; there will be some casualties, I am sure.

I say to him that, at the moment, when there is such a crisis in Europe, our Europeans institutions have to be united – the European Council and the European Parliament – and, as you are invited here, you should also invite us to Council meetings, and please do that for the extraordinary meetings as well. Mr Tsipras, welcome. You can see that you do not have to be afraid of the European Parliament. You refused at first – I did not think that it could be true that such a big democrat as Mr Tsipras was afraid of a debate! – but you are here. I am pleased that you are here, because this is the first time that we have in fact discussed this with you in the European Parliament. I do not think that there are any possible solutions in the case of Greece, and in the case of the eurozone, if they do not have the backing of democracy and are not debated in a democracy and debated here in the European Parliament. That is what we are doing today. But I have to tell you – and you started, and what you said is true – you said the Greeks made enormous efforts, and that is true. But the problem is not there. It is that the Greek political class did not do enough in the case of Greece. That is the problem today.  (Applause) I have to tell you that I am angry because you are talking about reforms, but we never see concrete proposals for reforms.  (Applause) I am angry because we are in fact sleepwalking towards a Grexit. We have already been sleepwalking for five years with the help and the support – do you hear them? – of the people of the extreme right at the end. Not only have we been sleepwalking, but in recent months I have more the impression that we have been running towards a Grexit. But it is not you and it not us who will pay the bill.  It is going to be the ordinary Greek citizens who are going to pay the bill of a Grexit of 30-40%.  (Applause) So I have to tell you that if we want to avoid that, there is only one possible way, and you know very well what it is. The only possible way is that you come forward in the coming days – in the coming 48 hours – with a credible reform package. That does not mean you saying ‘Yes, I want to end clientelism’ and so on. It means that you make a roadmap and a clear calendar (no intentions) with end dates of the different reforms we need desperately in Greece.  (Applause) And let me tell you the five things you have to do – I am even ready to come to Athens to discuss it with you, because I like a challenge! But what do you have to do? First, end the clientelistic system. You need to put on the table legislation for that that does not exist and not to apply clientelism yourself, because a few weeks ago 13 directors in the Ministry of Education had to be nominated, and by accident there were 12 from the Syriza party. There was only one of them whose affiliation they do not know.  (Applause) That is the reality. You are using the system. You are falling into the trap which PASOK also fell into. That was also the big party of change in Greece after the colonels and which did nothing at all except use the clientelist system for years and years to its own advantage. You have to downsize the public sector. I know that is perhaps difficult for a leftist, but it has to be done, because there are 800 000 civil servants! That cannot work.  (Applause) You have to transform the public banks into a private banking sector. You have to open the markets and the professions for young people. We do not have legislation. Put legislation on the table to open at least 10 professions which are still closed in your country. Finally, let us propose ending the privileges in your country – the privileges of the ship-owners, the privilege of the military, the privilege of the Orthodox Church in your country... (Applause and interjections from the floor) you like privilege – that is fine, they like privileges, but I do not! There is also the privilege of the Greek islands. And let us not forget the privilege of the political parties in your country who receive loans and money every day from public banks which are in fact bankrupt. Syriza, your party, also receives such money. What I ask you to do is put all this together in a credible package and put it on the table in the coming days. I am pretty sure that from the other side – from the European side – we are going to be ready to find a solution to that. We are going to find a solution to all these problems. But it has to be done in that way. You can do it because there has never been a Prime Minister in Greece who had such a strong mandate as you. You even have a double mandate. You won the elections and you won the referendum. So you are in the position of being the only political leader in Greece who can put an end to that system in Greece. I have said to you that we also have a responsibility. In my opinion we have to make a debt redemption fund as fast as possible, and we have to do it as fast as possible in the Council as well. But first things first: you need to come forward with your reform package. It is not a chicken or egg discussion. You have a choice, and that is my conclusion. The choice that you have is very simple. How do you want to be remembered? As an electoral accident who made his people poorer in his country? Or will you not be remembered, Mr Tsipras, as a real revolutionary reformer in the tradition of Trikoupis and Venizelos? I am not talking about the Venizelos of PASOK, the new one; I am talking about the real Venizelos, the big leader between the two world wars who modernised his country, a liberal who in fact modernised his administration. That is the choice to be made, and I know what your people want. Eighty percent of your people want to stay in Europe and in the eurozone. So, show what you can do now and show that you are a real leader and not a false prophet. Do it!

Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, I do not believe that this is the time for us to use this podium here, on the one hand, in the face of the crisis and the disaster that has become very concrete for many people and which could possibly occur next weekend, in order to develop acting talents on the one hand – Mr Weber, I say it to you in concrete terms: to preach arrogance, schoolmastership and anti-communism here in the old German manner. (Loud applause) You can leave that stuck, because it won't help anyone. This is not the Bavarian regular table, here we are in the European Parliament. (Loud applause) Mr Tusk, I have taken very good note: you have been very reserved, very matter-of-fact in your assessments. I hope that this style will prevail. What we cannot use is the constant building up of threatening scenes, as if there had been no decision on Sunday, as if people had not said: for us the measure has been reached, we cannot go any further. However, you also said that we want to remain in the European Union, we want to remain in the euro area.  Please withdraw the sharpeners and the hardliners, especially on the creditor side! It does not help to stand up and impose its own ideological reservations on a country as regulatory measures. On the pretext that everyone must abide by the rules, something is being done that has not played a role in the history of Europe, especially in the history of Germany. With regard to the debts of the First World War, Germany has proved that you do not have to pay any debts for 37 years, that you can have 93 years to pay the debts of the First World War, and that, with a view to the Second World War, one had an international debt conference of 1953, which in the first place created the precondition for Germany to go down this path! (Loud applause) It is time for us to finally take this historic responsibility towards the people of Europe and finally put aside some of our better knowledge. I also call on my fellow Members from Germany in particular, regardless of which group – mine is, of course, behind us, that is quite clear.  But I believe that this is the way forward: let us finally sit down together and talk about what needs to be decided now. It is about solutions that are sustainable, not just an explanation of what should be done and what is required of others.  Respect the people of Europe. Also respect Sunday's decision.

I always do this when I don't know what's going on – and I'm doing that at the moment – then I collect and collect. And on top of the stack of these newspapers last week was a German newspaper with the photo, a portrait of a Greek pensioner who had collapsed in front of an ATM crying. And for me, at least, it's the photo that's in my memory this week. I believe that in this photo both the reasons that led to 60% voting 'no' in Greece have actually been captured. However, I believe, and this is the madness of this situation, that many of the reasons in this photo have also been captured by the people who voted 'yes'. For the vote in Greece was a vote on the fact that the impoverishment of a large part of society – and it is by no means the whole of society – can no longer go on. However, the vote was also clearly a vote on the fact that hope for change is still being linked to the European Union. (Applause) And that is your job now. I also think that, in a historic situation, you are the strongest Prime Minister of Greece, at least in my own memory, and that you must now be the one who leads your people into a proper prospect of reform. What has not happened so far and where, incidentally, Europeans also have a responsibility. This reform programme of the troika makes the word reform itself something that can only be recoiled from. (Applause) I have to tell you now: maybe I am naive, but I actually expected you to come here and not just say: stop nepotism and corruption, but I had this naive desire, tsipras is coming now and saying: this is how I will do this with my people. (Applause) This is what a fair tax system will look like. This is what a fair pension system will look like. We all know that small pensions cannot be cut any further. But the question is: how do pensions in Greece do justice? This is what the health system in Greece will look like in the future, so that we no longer need poor clinics. I believe that this is actually what you can not only lead the Greeks into a better future, but with which you can ensure that the Europeans join you. And we have to! This cohesion, which has been lost over the last five years, can be regained if you talk to your people and to the citizens of Europe in this way. I am not just referring to the Heads of State or Government or some of those who have not necessarily helped to invite you here today. You need to get into this direct debate, and europeans– as Guy Verhofstadt said– must get out of a wrong policy on the debt burden. And I agree with Guy Verhofstadt that a solution must be found that is not only needed for the Greeks, but which is needed for other crisis countries. That is fair. And then it is also European. (Applause) Mr Tsipras, I know that, unfortunately, time cannot be stopped. I wish we could. It is obvious that everything has to be decided this week. Listen to those who want a European solution! And remember because you are so appealing to democracy: Europe is great. The East is one of them, and it also needs solidarity. And democracy and Putin, that is not possible!

Europe, the European project, is actually beginning to die. Nobody in this room will recognise that, but actually the peoples of Europe are saying, ‘We were never asked whether we wanted this: this has been foisted upon us.’ And we need to understand why economic and monetary union does not work. Those monsters Kohl and Mitterrand, backed by a clever but dangerous Delors, believed that if they put in place an economic and monetary union, then, as night follows day, there would be political union. They believed there would be acceptance of this project; that the North and South of Europe would converge; that we would all start to love each other; that we would all begin to feel a European identity; that we would all begin to show allegiance to the flag and the anthem. Those of us, of course, who criticised this were told that we were extremists and we lacked vision. Well, in one respect we did not lack vision: we understood that the countries of Europe are different, and that if you try to force together different people or different economies, without first seeking the consent of those people, it is unlikely to work, and the plan has failed. This is not just Greece we are talking about today: the whole of the Mediterranean now finds itself in the wrong currency, and yet virtually nobody in the political arena has got the courage to stand up and say that. I feel that the continent is now divided from north to south: there is a new Berlin Wall and it is called ‘the euro’. The old enmities have been resumed. Just listen to the way that the German leader of the Christian Democrat group this morning attacked Mr Tsipras. I think it was absolutely disgusting, but it shows the way north and south now feel about each other. Mr Tsipras, your country should never have joined the euro – I think you acknowledge that – but the big banks, the big businesses and big politics forced you in. Goldman Sachs, the German arms manufacturers, they were all very happy. And when the bailouts began, they were not for the Greek people. Those bailouts were to bail out French, German and Italian banks: they have not helped you at all. These years of austerity, these years of high unemployment, of increasing poverty: none of it has worked. In fact, your debt-to-GDP ratio has gone from 100% at the start of the crisis to 180% right now. It would be madness to continue on this course. You have been very brave. You called that referendum, although when one of your predecessors tried to do the same, the bully boys of Brussels had him removed. They tried their best again – Mr Juncker said you would have to leave the euro and the European Union. Even Mr Schulz, the President of Parliament, who one would have thought might be neutral, said that if the Greeks voted no, their power supplies might even go down. There were threats and bullying, but the Greeks stood firm. However, sir, you cannot have your cake and eat it. They will give you no more, these people: they cannot afford to. If they give you more, they will have to give other eurozone members more. So your moment has come. And frankly, if you have got the courage, you should lead the Greek people out of the eurozone with your head held high: get back your democracy, get back control of your country, give your people the leadership and the hope that they crave. Yes, it will be tough for the first few months, but with a devalued currency, and with friends of Greece all over the world, you will recover.

Mr President, Mr Tsipras, we have radically divergent positions on a whole range of issues. It is a fact, but we share the desire to give people a voice against the Europeanist and technocratic dictatorship, and we therefore very legitimately welcomed the organisation of the referendum.  This referendum in Greece on austerity marks the return of politics in its noblest sense, in a European Union often reduced to technocratic attitudes. The European institutions - and this is perhaps a positive point - have shown their true face: horror! They tried everything to win this referendum. There have been multiple moral pressures. Proponents of austerity predicted disaster in the event of a \"no\" \"no\" We, the French people, know this because we experienced the same thing during the campaign on the European Constitution.  The Speaker of parliament here has even dared to call for the overthrow of your government legitimately elected by the people, Mr Tsipras, in order to replace it with a government of technocrats. Eurozone countries tried in vain to prevent the release of the IMF's report on Greece's debt on Thursday.

Finally, the European Central Bank has tried to sow fear by suffocating Greek banks and causing their temporary closure. I believe this is the first time in history that a central bank has created a crisis from scratch, in an absolutely artificial way. But the anger of the Greek people towards the European policy of hyper-austerity was such that all the manoeuvres were swept away by popular fervor. Beyond the threats, the Greek people have pushed back the path without hope or prospects for the European Union.  Which people would have accepted for five years what the Greek people went through, for God's sake? Which would have accepted that? Gentlemen of the EPP group and liberals who have been frantically applauding Mr Weber's indictment, would you be willing to campaign? Do you agree with that? So campaign by promising your respective peoples a 25% pay cut and a 25% reduction in pensions! Campaign by offering your peoples the explosion of infant mortality, the threefold increase in unemployment! Be brave! Take responsibility for your positions! That is not what you do when you are on the campaign trail.  (Applause) Mr Tsipras, the euro and austerity are Siamese brothers. That's the reality. You will not be able to get your people out of austerity if you do not allow them to escape the euro.  What I think is that Greece must, in agreement with the European institutions and in a concerted way, quietly, get out of the iron jaw that the euro represents for all the countries of the South. All European peoples would then have their eyes fixed on Greece and could verify that the exit from the euro allows for the renewal and return of sustainable growth. That is what Mr Krugman, the Nobel laureate in economics, said. What you are afraid of, gentlemen of the European institutions, is not that Greece will go bankrupt, what you are afraid of is that Greece, by leaving the euro, shows that we can do better without the euro than with it. The veil is tearing. The euro is not irreversible. This is what you have sold us for years: \"the euro is forever\". No, the euro is not forever. The euro is not irreversible. The first euro crisis was financial and was stopped by the ECB in 2012. The second crisis is political, do not displease you, with peoples who dare to say \"no\", and you will not be able to stop this one. After so many mistakes, it is time to dissolve the euro area in a concerted way, no longer to keep the euro as a common currency. The economies of the countries of Europe will be better off and tensions between peoples will finally ease.

Who and with what authority says that, if no is voted, Greeks should be looking for another currency? In what mindset, with what competence and what fascist mentality do you get into the political issues of my country?  I would like you to address the German chancellery about what Germany did to the Greeks during the Second World War: one million one hundred and six thousand dead from losses, executions, diseases and hunger; 11 and a half billion forced occupation loans of the Third Reich, without counting interest; many thousands of billions of war reparations that you refuse to include in the debt.  So do you have the audacity to address this proud people with suggestions? How small are you, Mr Schulz, in relation to the greatness of a nation! You and Mr Weber should also address the Chancellor of Germany about what is owed. Do you think the Greek will be afraid and bow his head for not bowing four hundred years of slavery in the Ottoman Empire, in the Turk? You got the answer the other day: \"no.\" No, of course, categorically to the Tsipras government, which is preparing and intends to pass a new onerous memorandum for the Greek people.

I hoped that the Prime Minister of Greece – and Mrs Harms is absolutely right – would have put forward proposals today. The frightening thing about the debate on this issue over the last few months is that many years ago, in my own country, I helped to show solidarity with countries in difficulty. And then I saw that this was used in Portugal, in Spain, in Ireland, that they have made their contribution and that has preceded it.  In Greece, too, Prime Minister – who is not listening, I have imagined it in a similar way – greece too – excuse me, I thought you were interested in hearing our opinion – it went a long way. And then, Prime Minister, came the election, and everything changed. And from that day on, Greek politics has been seen as a new promise every day, a promise, but nothing concrete was ever put on the table. Since that day, you can no longer believe that you are really sticking to what you are saying. And solidarity does not just mean taking, claiming, hoping that this will somehow go well. But solidarity also means making your own contribution. Otherwise, this is sheer selfishness and only think of itself.  And, Prime Minister, I think that is precisely the mistake. You have to deliver. I would just like to mention the President of the Commission here: what has Jean-Claude Juncker shown as an effort to accommodate you? In the end, it was 60 million, and he offered you 35 billion. Then you go back to Greece and say: we are now going to hold a referendum and we are destroying everything. Is that solidarity? Do you think anyone can still believe that you mean it honestly? That's the problem.  Credibility is an important prerequisite for history to work. And if you can't believe it, if you think that the man is just telling commonplaces again, nothing concrete comes out again, then Greece will get into the greatest trouble.

Important steps have been taken in recent weeks in this regard, and we are now having regular meetings at the eurozone summits. This is a very important development. The Commission is coming with proposals to these eurozone summits. This is also a very important development. And now the European Parliament has a role to play, because the European Parliament is the parliament of the euro. That is why the President of the European Parliament should also be represented in these discussions and bring our message to these discussions. But let us use this opportunity today to discuss exactly what a fair deal is, because what is at stake is whether we can reconcile the euro with democracy. Is it possible? Mr Tsipras, you come with a strong mandate from your country; you have just won a referendum. But other prime ministers can also argue that they have a strong democratic mandate, and we here also have a strong democratic mandate. Therefore, we need to find a way to draw up a new compromise in democratic terms: a real European compromise. That is why this discussion today is so important. My question to Mr Tsipras, but also to my colleagues in the European Parliament, is: can we accept a fair deal with a real opportunity for recovery in Greece, a real opportunity to invest, with more fiscal space, but also a clear solution for the debt burden in Greece in exchange for clear commitments for reform, ensuring good public administration, tax collection and a sustainable pension system?

The ALDE Group really wanted this debate to take place and we thank you for being there. I would like to make three proposals: the first, Prime Minister, would be for us to change our method. So far, we have worked behind closed doors. The European Council decided without us always knowing exactly what was going on. For the first time, you are here in front of us and I wanted to tell you that there is only one euro, there is not the Euro of the Germans or the French and the euro of the Greeks. There is only one euro and there can only be a democracy!  We must avoid at all costs to continue to pitt people against each other. This method is extremely dangerous. My proposal is to use Parliament and that if there is an agreement, it should be followed up at the political level. You know that we have written a report on the troika and we have tried to hear it. Accept a compromise by following up in this Parliament. Second, the change in procedure cannot prevent us from making substantive efforts. Guy Verhofstadt went into detail. I want to tell you as they say in America: \"Just do it!\". You have said a lot of things that are quite right about tax reform, about the need to move forward. Do it, implement it. The Greeks said no, but they want to stay in the eurozone. What would you say yes to? What are you prepared to say yes to? Are you prepared to say yes to a minimum of rules, to a minimum of respect for its word, to an attitude towards the ECB, which reminds everyone that the ECB is the central bank of all Europeans and not just of the Greeks. How to return to fair cooperation, not insults. There would be much to say about the reparations of the Second World War. The reason we gave up reparations is that we did not want to redo the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty 2-4. You can talk to Barack Obama about it the next time he calls you: it was the Americans who wanted reparations to be abandoned, and Mr Tusk here knows full well that it is also the treaty that has set the borders of Germany and Poland. We don't touch history, Mr Tsipras! Let's move on! Let's try to find solutions for the future, don't wake up the corpses of the past! Finally, I am chair of the anti-poverty intergroup. Take the lead in an initiative to fight poverty across Europe. It's not just the poor in Greece and the rich elsewhere. There are poor people in Germany, there are poor people in Finland and there are poor people in France. Stand up for them and help fight inequality! Misery has no borders.

Madam President, Mr Tusk, Mr Juncker, Mr Timmermans, Prime Minister of Greece, a united Europe without Greece is like a child without a birth certificate. The Greek government and the Greek people do not want Grexit at 80%. The Commission and the Council also categorically reject this, because it will cause enormous economic, social and geopolitical costs. These costs have been measured and are enormous. So you all need to do in practice, as a matter of urgency, by Sunday, whatever it takes– as Mr. Draghi– so that the word Grexit can finally be removed from the European vocabulary, away from the mistakes of the past, which have caused enormous recession and unemployment and incredible social pain in my own country of Greece, and the Commission and the Council and the Greek Government must really try to do so.  Mr Weber, stop insulting Greece and the Greeks! Stop playing with matches in a fuel depot! Mrs Le Pen and Mr Farage, stop playing the populist game on the backs of Greek women and Greeks to advance your far-right aspirations! We want Greece not a debt colony but a respectable member state of the euro zone and the European Union. My country needs not to escape From Europe but a programme of strong changes for balanced public finances, a stronger economy, a reduction in unemployment, better administration rather than a client state, a fairer and more efficient tax system, a reduction in tax evasion, to finally pay the rich and powerful, to break the privilege of oligarchs that hinders both healthy competition and entrepreneurship; cutting red tape and corruption.  And in order to achieve what is the objectives of the Greek Government, Mr Juncker, both the Commission, Mr Tusk, and the Council must provide another solution with European characteristics to the debt problem, not to do that they do not listen to the reports and proposals of the International Monetary Fund.  And they must also help to boost the Greek economy by making the most of existing and new social resources. This is no time for mutual blame, this is no time for blame game. The cost of a Grexit is prohibitive for everyone and not just for Greece. Now is not the time for one ball to fly, Mr Juncker, at the other's teren. Enough tennis on the backs of Greek women and Greeks! The common interest is the solution with a developing, respectable and equal member of the eurozone, not a debt colony.

It is not austerity that is being asked of you, but simply to put your country in order. Ideology has no place at the negotiating table. The dialogue must not be broken, but it must be realistic. You want to play the big democrats, but there are democrats in every other member state of the eurozone, and the citizens no longer want to fund Greece at a loss.

What can we say to European citizens who are even poorer than the Greeks? They don't want to pay for Greek laxity anymore.  It is not Europe, it is not the creditors who will decide whether or not Greece leaves the eurozone. It is Greece itself that will de facto be outside the eurozone if it does not agree to the necessary reforms. Your referendum, Mr Tsipras, was a sham, and once again you did not tell the truth.

We knew that on the way to the agreement you would have forces that would probably use Greece to give the message that austerity, even without growth, is the only way forward. We knew it, so you know it. Now we get to five.

What then have the more than EUR 200 billion that the European people, which European citizens, have lent to the Greek people, served for? Spain has lent you 6 billion euros that you did not have, that you had to borrow, and 20 billion euros more in guarantees, which, if you do not pay what you owe, will have to pay for you spanish workers and the Spanish middle class with their taxes.

Today cancellations travel at a rate of fifty thousand per day. In Italy, we too have calculated that every citizen has put EUR 600 out of his own pocket.

So we must do what all Greek politicians and first of all the Prime Minister of Greece, Mr. Tsipras, can do. I understand that Mr. Tsipras has a problem with reducing public spending, he has a problem with reducing the costs of the insurance pension system, but we cannot destroy the country by giving pensions to people who have worked only fifteen years, accepting that already many categories of civil servants can retire at fifty-two or by continuing the appointments of relatives and friends in the bankrupt public sector. , a tradition that was not created by Mr. Tsipras's party was created by my own party, but we must finally leave it behind. If Mr Tsipras makes a shift towards economic realism and in favour of the European Union, we will support him vigorously and I also think that Mr Juncker should support him with a brave investment programme, because for at least two to three years Greece cannot operate on market criteria, it cannot attract investment, because it has a huge problem. So let the Greek Prime Minister dare and see that things are less difficult than he thinks. We will protect him even from the left wing of his party, which may object to this policy.

In the eyes of the world and in the eyes of citizens, the European Union is disaggregated because Europe apparently cannot solve a problem worth little more or little less than 2 % of its wealth. Is this the image that Europe gives in a world that looks at it at all times?  But solving greece's problem is not a technical issue – technical solutions are there. It is a matter of political will, in a common agenda which also includes filling gaps identified in the architecture of monetary union, such as joint management of at least sovereign debt. It is a political issue and it is a matter of method and trust. And on the method, President Tusk, I would like to ask you if you think it is possible to find solutions between the different legitimacies of different parliaments – did we not find a solution to this problem in 1957? The solution was the Community method. That is the element that is missing in this agenda, and that is why you have to turn to the Commission and to this Parliament to help you solve the problem. The second issue is the issue of trust, and on that, Mr Tsipras, I do not blame you for what was done five years ago or over the last five years, because you have only been there for five weeks. Mr Tsipras, I am talking to you! You have been accused in this Parliament of having developed a hidden agenda to get Greece out of the euro without being blamed for it.

The Greek Government wants to introduce socialism co-financed by European taxpayers. In a world of normal culture, things are set differently, because responsibility and ethics are embedded in the way of business and political life. Personal and social well-being depends on work achievements. The Greek Government imagines solidarity one-way. I ask whether it is fair that my Slovenia had to devote eur 1.7 billion to Greece in loans and guarantees, which is the highest per capita in the European Union. How can we persuade the Slovenian taxpayer to continue to fund someone who has a higher standard and who demands debt relief? Dear!

In just five months, the party has destroyed the efforts of previous governments and re-launched the country into recession.

But now, thankfully, because we took the hard medicine, we have the fastest-growing economy in Europe, at 4.8%. That is because of good leadership.

Mr President, I think that this meeting should have taken place some time ago, because the debate we are having here today is not just about the future of Greece, it is about the future of the euro area and indeed this debate cannot take place in closed-door rooms, and it is not our responsibility to do so. For five months the negotiation took place in closed-door rooms, but it is an extremely political question of how it will proceed and where it will end up and how it will end up. We have realised this today from the very fruitful debate here and from the confrontations which did not have a confrontational character of states against states within the euro area but had a profound political and ideological content. I really respect all the views that have been heard, even those that have had a particularly polemic rhetoric. I would also like to say that I fully agree with the view that the European Parliament should play a more active role. I wonder how it is possible that we have authorised three institutions, the troika, and of course the Commission, reasonably the European Central Bank, because it pays, but how can we have authorised within the troika those responsible for taking decisions to be the International Monetary Fund and not to be the preeminent European institution of the Republic, that is, the European Parliament. I'd like to say...  (applause) ... with absolute sincerity: In this European case, if the debate and negotiation had taken place exclusively between the Greek side and the Commission, a solution and agreement would have been found a very long time ago. Unfortunately or fortunately, we had to conduct a negotiation process – please listen to arguments and you have reason to refute them – we had an obligation to discuss, on the one hand, the Greek Government and on the other hand three different institutions with different and conflicting, many times, positions and proposals; I would like to come to the substance and answer some of the questions raised in our debate.  First, whether or not the Greek side has put forward proposals, credible or not, you will judge them. The Greek side has put forward proposals. He tabled a forty-seven-page text, which was not our positions, but the result, in our view, of a difficult and arduous negotiation process. Unfortunately, the picture that has been created is that it has not put forward any proposals. Last Monday, the Greek side came back with a new text of credible proposals, which was accepted as the basis for discussion by all three institutions. Last Monday. In these proposals we are obviously committed to meeting the budgetary targets required by the rules, because we recognise and respect that the euro area has rules. However, we reserve the right of choice to choose where we, as the sovereign government, will add the tax burdens in order to meet the required budgetary targets.  And I truly believe that it is the sovereign right of a government to choose to increase the taxation of profitable enterprises and not to cut the allowance for the lowest pensions, the EKAS, in order to meet the budgetary targets. If it is not the right of a sovereign government to choose how to find equivalent measures to meet the required objectives, then we should adopt an extreme and undemocratic concept: that in countries on a programme, there should be no elections; governments should be appointed, technocrats appointed and they should take responsibility for decisions. I would like to inform the House that, indeed, you are right; in Greece, there are distortions from the past that need to be removed, such as the distortion of early retirement, and we were the first to take the initiative to say that we want, without anyone telling us, to abolish early pensions in a country that is in such a dire economic position. The reforms are therefore necessary and our commitments to the necessary budgetary adjustment in order to have surpluses, not deficits. These commitments are given. But we reserve the right to choose the redistribution of burdens, which, I believe, could and should and I am sure most of you agree with. Ladies and gentlemen, the question has been asked: 'Do you have a secret plan to take Greece out of the eurozone?'. I want to answer you honestly. All last week, the vast majority of statements by European politicians and officials were that a no vote in the referendum automatically means Greece leaving the euro. People knew this when they were asked to vote, when they went to the ballot box and brought all this a result that some surprised. If I were to take Greece out of the euro, I would not go immediately after the close of the ballot box to make the statements I made and interpret the referendum result not as a mandate to break with Europe, but as a mandate to strengthen real efforts to get to a better deal, a more credible deal, an economically viable and socially just agreement. That's my goal. I don't have any other secret plan, and I'm talking with open papers. Finally, I would like to say to you: I have heard from many, and especially those who have used the strongest polemic rhetoric, talk about our inability to respond to the solidarity of the European partners. I would like to say that, of course, borrowing is a form of solidarity, there is no doubt about that. But we want a sustainable programme, precisely in order to be able to repay the loans we have received, and when we ask for debt write-downs, we are asking for this write-down, precisely to be able to repay these loans and not to be constantly obliged to repay the old ones. I would like to remind you, Mr Weber, that the strongest moment of solidarity in modern European history was in 1953, when your country was coming out in debt and plundered by two world wars and Europe and the European peoples showed the greatest solidarity at the London summit in 1953, when they decided to write off 60% of Germany's debt, as well as a development clause. This was the most important moment of solidarity in modern European history. I heard from my friend Guy Verhofstadt – we were co-candidates last year for the Presidency of the Commission and we know each other well and we have good relations – ask him: 'How are you going to deal with the problems? with what reforms? You are not proposing reforms; what have you done?\" and I would like to reply: Indeed, in these five months, we are more negotiating than governing, in conditions of financial suffocation. Our concern, our concern, our thought is more how we will manage to keep the Greek economy alive. Nevertheless, we did things, my dear friend Guy. We were the ones who tried and brought to the stool of Justice many of whom had fled tax. Previous governments have not. It was we who made an agreement with Switzerland in order for the Greeks who made their money abroad to pay taxes. It was we who passed a law to limit triangular transactions. No previous government had done it. It was we who asked the owners of the media in Greece to pay their taxes. No previous government had done it. It was we who strengthened customs controls in order to hit smuggling.  Of course, we must and we have before us an obligation to do much more. We didn't have much time to do and we ask for your support to change Greece. It is our shared responsibility to change Greece and from this we will be judged. In conclusion, I would like to tell you this: everyone understands that the debate is not just about one country. It concerns the future of our common construction, the euro area and Europe, and here two diametrically opposed strategies for the future of European integration collide. Let's all take responsibility! Despite our ideological differences, despite what divides us at home, at a crucial national moment we have the opportunity to join forces and the day before yesterday all the political forces under the President of the Republic found themselves at the same table and we agreed on a framework of positions and on the basis of that framework tomorrow we will re-table concrete proposals for a sustainable and fair agreement , proposals for credible reforms I want to tell you, but in closing, this: Many people have referred to the ancient Greek tragedy. I want to tell you that I fully respect the laws governing the European Union and the euro area. Without laws, no one can move forward. But since you mentioned the ancient Greek tragedy, let me tell you that one of the most important ancient tragics, Sophocles, with his masterpiece, Antigone, taught us that there are times when the supreme law of the laws of men is the law of men. And I think now is such a moment.

(Applause) But I have asked to speak in order to be able to supplement the speech by the Greek Prime Minister. It is true that the negotiations took place behind closed doors. I can't change that either. It is also true, however, that these negotiations were completely different from what they used to be. Mr Barroso has never met with the Greek Prime Minister, the head of the International Monetary Fund, and the head of the European Central Bank for hours – thirty in total – to find a solution. Technocrats used to rule, in my Commission it is the Commissioners who sit at the table, including the President of the Commission. The negotiations that we have conducted – always in a friendly tone, incidentally – were high-level negotiations, and if the negotiations had not been interrupted, we would have reached an agreement between the three institutions and between the Commission and the Greek Government. But because these negotiations took place behind closed doors, Mr. Tsipras could not tell everything. He will not contradict me when I say that I have proposed and enforced that shipowners should finally be taxed in Greece. (Applause) The Commission has proposed a reduction in the Greek defence budget. Thank God this proposal was accepted. No one in the Greek delegation will be able to accuse me of not putting myself before the small pensioners and the minimum wage earners in Greece. I have always resisted the fact that pension cuts will happen again. Nor has any pension cuts been proposed that would have affected small pensioners. Nor has any wage reduction proposed that would have affected wage earners who are at the lowest level of the wage scale. In this respect, I believe that we must describe things in the way that they really have gone on behind closed doors. (Applause) The Commission has proposed to its Greek colleagues a multiannual investment programme of EUR 35 billion to get the real economy in Greece back on track. It is not enough to consolidate public finances. We also need to make dynamic economic policies that are growth-oriented and job-oriented. We would have provided the money, we are prepared to provide that money. In this respect, I would have been grateful if everything had been said. Much has not yet been said.

Secondly, morality means paying off the debt you owe to others. It is not so that the creditors are bad and immoral, while the debtor is the innocent victim.

Athens's current troubles are also the aftermath of this decision.  There is no doubt that the Greeks are largely to blame for themselves, but few remember that the two largest EU and euro area countries, Germany and France, have systematically violated the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact on debt and budget deficits for several years in a row and have not been penalised by the European Commission for this. This has set a precedent and an euthason for similar practices in southern European countries.  In order for Greece to have a chance of exiting the debt spiral, realistic conditions are needed to give it a chance to repay its debts and must be combined with the requirement to restructure the economy.

Personally, I am very disappointed with the greek Prime Minister's speech. His speech was full of phrases about democracy, solidarity, the eurozone's inability to find a solution to the crisis in Greece. He asked for help, he wants a deal, but he did not name concrete measures to restart the economy and reduce Greece's debt. After the weekend's referendum, Greece is in euphoria, celebrating, but its leaders should take immediate action. Take action in the banking and financial sectors. The Greeks have exported billions of euros to foreign banks in recent years, which are currently lacking in greek banks as currency. Other concrete decisions have to come very quickly, because in commercial relations no one wants to do business with Greek firms anymore, only in the case of advance payment. Various privileges need to be addressed acutely – for islands, churches, soldiers... In ten million Greece, it is now a great luxury to have more than 800,000 civil servants.

If Guy Verhofstadt is rhetorically attacking Alexis Tsipras and listing Greece's failings, why didn't he and the European Parliament speak sooner? The required reforms are institutional in nature. A decade goes by before they are implemented halfway. If Greece were not a member of the euro area, every economist and politician would propose a sharp devaluation of the Greek currency.

It is the obligation of any member of a group to follow the rules by which it is guided – in this case the Eurogroup, which brings together the 19 euro area states. On the other hand, I think there needs to be a more effective approach from Athena's external partners. Endless financing leads to unsustainable debt. I therefore share the view that Greece needs a long-term debt rescheduling and a grace period to stabilise economically, but I am totally against the cancellation of any part of the debt.

Faced with this explosion of democracy, Europe reacted by showing its true face, that of a political project that has reneged on its fundamental values, choosing to bypass democracy, the rule of law and national sovereignty in order to defend the interests of strong countries and finance. It remains a way to rebuild the Europe of the peoples from the ground up: to abandon the crazy project of the euro which, far from accelerating convergence between countries, has accelerated its disintegration, amplifying imbalances and contrasts between strong economies and weak economies.

On the contrary, it says that in this case this amendment is inadmissible. If you then believe that this is a compromise amendment, if you really want to force the rules and consider that an amendment proposed by a group is only a compromise, I would ask you to read Rule 174(4) of the Rules of Procedure, which states that this compromise must be put to the vote.

First of all, as you have quite rightly stated here, I must ask the House whether it agrees that we should vote at all on these amendments, which were tabled as compromise amendments after the debate has ended. There must be a vote in plenary to do this. Only then can I put this to the vote.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Friday 26 June, a kind of black day, was marked by several terrorist attacks. This time, three countries were hit almost at the same time: France, Kuwait and Tunisia. These attacks have once again reminded us of the despicable nature of terrorism and especially of those who sponsor and execute them. Our response must be firm and supportive. On 26 June, the European Council made it clear that we must step up our action against these terrorist threats. This fight against terrorism is one of the most important challenges facing our open and democratic societies and one of the very first priorities. Our presidency will make it a top priority. We will build on the work undertaken by our predecessors, taking into account both the internal and external aspects of security. The Luxembourg Presidency will work to ensure that the European Union adopts a coherent approach in the fight against terrorism, which encompasses both these internal and external aspects of security, namely strong and fruitful cooperation between the Member States, the Commission, the European External Action Service and the European Union coordinator. We have instruments such as Europol, Eurojust, Frontex and Cepol. These instruments must be given the means and resources they need.  In response to the attacks in Paris in January, the Heads of State or Government adopted a declaration on 12 February based on three pillars: ensuring the safety of citizens, preventing radicalization, protecting values and, ultimately, cooperating with partners at the international level. The Union Counter-Terrorism Coordinator presented a full report to the Council and the European Council on the implementation of these measures. On 28 April, the Commission adopted the European security programme. We discussed it yesterday. The fight against terrorism is one of the main priorities, the strong international dimension of terrorism has been highlighted and our action must be placed at the same international level. On 9 February, the Foreign Affairs Council adopted conclusions on the fight against terrorism aimed at precisely strengthening cooperation with the countries of North Africa, the Near East and the Gulf, as well as with Turkey and the Balkan countries. A number of counter-terrorism capacity building projects have been approved. Workshops on this topic have already taken place in Lebanon and Turkey. The Union Counter-Terrorism Coordinator visited Tunisia at the head of an inter-service mission, following which the High Representative proposed a series of support measures to the Tunisian Prime Minister. Finally, a task force for strategic communication was created to develop an awareness and communication strategy for the Arab world. We must also actively pursue our cooperation with the United Nations, NATO, the Council of Europe and other international organizations, as well as our bilateral collaboration with our key partners, such as the United States. On 16 June, the Interior Ministers concluded that tangible progress had been made in recent months. Preventing radicalization in our own countries and partner countries is essential. How is it possible that young people in our countries, who have gone through our schools, are attracted to these terrorist networks that preach unprecedented violence? There is an in-depth work to be done on several levels: education, integration, our values. To this end, the Centre of Excellence, called the European Radicalisation Awareness Network, is about to be launched. Other measures should be taken, such as strengthening the application of the Schengen framework: documents and individuals should be subject to more systematic monitoring in relevant databases through a risk assessment approach. This approach was finalized on June 15 and will now be implemented. The Schengen Handbook for Border Guards has been updated. A unit responsible for reporting content on the internet was set up on 1 July within the framework of Europol in order to speed up the pooling of resources and intensify cooperation with the relevant sector. The aim is to reduce the scale and effect of terrorist propaganda and extremist and violent propaganda on the internet, with full respect, of course, for fundamental rights. The Council intends to be quickly able to adopt a decision on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, of the additional protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism, which would criminalize the movement of foreign terrorist fighters. Externally and in close partnership with countries where the terrorist threat is particularly present, we must help these countries to combat the social causes of terrorism, such as youth unemployment, which is a source of frustration, and thus becomes a breeding ground for the recruitment of new terrorists. Tunisia is, alas, an example.  The Luxembourg Presidency will be actively involved. Next week we will propose a new initiative of cooperation with Maghreb countries on youth employment, on vocational training for young people, because I believe that it is at the root that we must take this problem of young people tempted by the terrorist adventure, whether in Syria or in their own country. Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to return to the issue of radicalisation.  The rate at which this phenomenon is spreading is worrying. In some cases, young people become radicalized over a very short period of time, as little as two months. On 19 and 20 October, we will hold a conference on the topic of reintegration and radicalisation in prisons, which often reveal these young terrorists who are ready to take action. Another issue that we will have to address is the treatment of foreign fighters returning to our societies. Commissioner Jourova has also refocused funding to include the fight against terrorism in the funding programmes launched this year under justice.  We must strengthen the means to combat the use by terrorists of the internet and social networks to spread their hate propaganda and to radicalise and recruit young people. We must spread messages to counter this terrorist propaganda and launch concerted and well-organized campaigns, especially in the media. More needs to be done, in particular, with regard to the decommissioning of firearms and the strengthening of the fight against arms trafficking. Similarly, we must redouble our efforts in terms of information exchange. Tomorrow, at the informal meeting of justice and interior ministers in Luxembourg, there will be talk of improving the exchange of information between the intelligence services and the police services. Ladies and gentlemen, as I told you yesterday, the implementation of the renewed 2015-2020 internal security strategy for the Union is a priority for the Luxembourg Presidency and can become an extremely active and useful instrument in the fight against terrorism. We must act decisively by addressing above all the root causes of this scourge, but let us not fall into the trap of those who wage this terrorist war against our peoples and against our States, namely to weaken our democratic systems and our values. Democracies are all the stronger because their action also ensures respect for human rights, which must remain our common thread.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 153, "date": "2015-07-08.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the appalling attacks perpetrated on Friday, 26 June 2015, in France, Tunisia, Kuwait and Somalia demonstrate once again the brutality and inhumanity of terrorists. Let me first extend, on behalf of the Commission, our condolences to the families of the victims and express our moral support and our sympathy to the countries affected in Europe and beyond. I wish to condemn these acts of terror in the strongest terms and reaffirm our determination to address collectively this threat. We need to provide security to our citizens while upholding our values. Of course, we face constantly-evolving threats, and the numerous victims of this year’s attacks remind us of this reality. Investigations are still being carried out by the competent national authorities. The available information tends to demonstrate that the atrocities committed in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, in Sousse and in Kuwait bear the hallmarks of Daesh’s despicable ideology of intolerance. Their objective is to instil terror. It is also relevant to note that terrorists are focusing on soft targets, such as religious buildings or tourist resorts. This Commission, as you know, has been working closely with the Member States to identify areas in which the European Union can make a real difference in fighting terrorism and radicalisation. We have been working closely with Member States to enhance our capacity to address this threat. In April the Commission presented the European Agenda on Security. The agenda places terrorism very high among the future priorities. It embodies a concept of security that encompasses the rule of law and fundamental rights. The agenda sets out a number of actions to counter the threat posed by terrorism. We have started working vigorously on their implementation. Let me now focus on some of the ongoing work of high political and practical significance. First, preventing radicalisation remains essential. The Radicalisation Awareness Network Centre of Excellence, to be launched in September, will take the work of the existing RAN further. I consider the work of RAN and the whole prevention element of the counter-terrorism policy at EU level to be crucial. Secondly, on 1 July 2015, the Internet Referral Unit was established at Europol. It will be fully operational within 12 months. The mission of the Internet Referral Unit is to identify terrorist material in different languages and to help secure swift removal. Third, by the end of the year, the Commission will formally launch an EU-level forum together with the internet industry. This will allow us to discuss how we can reduce the accessibility of online terrorist material and counter terrorist propaganda on the internet and in social media. A first workshop under the forum will be held on 24 July 2015, with experts from the industry and the law enforcement communities. Fourthly, the protection of external borders is crucial. With a view to supporting Member States in performing enhanced and targeted border checks, the Commission finalised – in close cooperation with Member States – a first set of common risk indicators. Europol and Frontex are assisting Member States in their implementation, and we have just revised their handbook for border guards. In the framework of the European Union’s Customs Risk Management Strategy, work is going on to enhance cooperation and information exchange between customs and law enforcement and to detect suspicious movements of goods. Fifthly, in order to trace and disrupt terrorist financing, we are working on the strengthening of cooperation between financial intelligence units. Let me also stress that the recently-adopted Anti-Money Laundering Directive improves the tools to address terrorist financing. Sixthly, as stated in the European Agenda on Security, we also need to better protect our citizens and critical infrastructures from terrorist threats. This work includes practical tools such as the guidance material that my services have recently developed on soft target protection. We are also upgrading the European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection, which will help to prevent attacks and failures and to improve preparedness and the response to incidents. Seventhly, as civil aviation remains the preferred target of terrorists, the Commission continues to work to increase aviation security and safety. A joint process is being developed with Member States to assess the risks from conflict zones and support the issuing of recommendations to airlines and the public. Eighthly, let me mention now EU-PNR, which is an important component of our security agenda. I wish to express my thanks to Parliament for your efforts in bringing to completion the EU legislation on PNR. I am confident that we can all continue to work together in such a constructive way so that the co-legislators can agree on a text that adheres to the highest standards of data protection and that is, at the same time, effective. Ninthly, the recent attacks illustrate the need for better international coordination and cooperation. The attack in Tunisia was extremely brutal and symbolic, as it targeted tourism – a vital economic sector for the country. It was an attack on Tunisia’s hospitality and its long-standing and friendly relations with Europe. We must stand by our Tunisian partners and show solidarity. Increasing their security will also contribute to enhancing our security. In the wake of the Bardo Museum attack, I travelled to Tunis and discussed, with my counterparts, how the European Union can provide support. We need to work together in tackling the root causes of radicalisation, detecting terrorists’ travel and building security capabilities and capacities. Honourable Members, we have worked a lot in the past six months and we have made good progress in a number of areas, but the recent attacks remind us that a lot still needs to be done. We owe this to the victims, and we owe it to our citizens and our partners. Let us therefore continue, with resolve and determination, in our joint efforts against terrorism and radicalisation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 154, "date": "2015-07-08.json", "name": "Monika Hohlmeier", "mepid": "96780", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the I warmly welcome you: the Presidency of the Council and the Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. The recent terrorist attacks have shown us that our liberal societies are vulnerable. They have also shown us that in our immediate neighbourhood – in the Middle East, towards the African continent – there has never been so much unrest, as much cruelty as there is today. For this reason, it is imperative that, on the one hand, we help the partners who are willing to work with us to fight terrorists directly on the ground, that we try – I very much welcome what the Commissioner has said here, including what the Presidency has said – that we need to tackle the issue of security very seriously and very consistently. Consistent also means that we must take measures that we might wish we did not have to do, but which are simply necessary in this day and age in order to provide protection for citizens. An important component and a new instrument is the PNR system, which is to be used effectively and sensibly, so that it can work across countries, europe-wide and perhaps even in combination with third countries. To this end, we also need better protection of our external borders.  But we also need to be clear that it is difficult to spot sleepers who might have been believed – three or four years ago – that they were dangerous, then stopped watching them because they were believed to be no longer dangerous. They are people who feel that they are not very much different from you and I, and suddenly they become murderers. To counteract this phenomenon or to try to get it out of these circles is, in my view, essential; above all, to dismantle and destroy the networks of radicalisation.

Terrorists and extremists thrive when people don't trust each other, building social pens and stereotypes. This is not a clash between Islam and the West.  Young Europeans going to the battlefields in Iraq and Syria and returning are a big challenge. We need to improve education programmes, social integration, understanding between different countries and religions. The European Air Passenger Data Record (PNR) may be becoming indispensable for many, but let us not, please, take such measures that will simply make every passenger a potential terrorist.

All of the perpetrators of the terrorist attacks were somehow linked to ISIS in terms of its poisonous ideology. One year on from the lightning advance of ISIS, the group is becoming a more permanent fixture, tragically and unfortunately, of the map of the Middle East. On the same day, and months after the liberation of Kobane had been celebrated, ISIS carried out one of its most deadly massacres to date, storming the city and executing up to 250 civilians, many of whom were children. These attacks illustrate that, by allowing ISIS to establish a foothold in Iraq and Syria, a new magnet for jihadi terrorism has been created. We became used to understanding, in the past, international terrorist activities of the al-Qaida model, based on perceived grievances, no matter how unjustified. But now ISIS offers a new, more brutal, territorial death cult model, in which terrorist attacks are more firmly based on attacking religious beliefs and minority individuals, and they are more involved in attacking these people than in attacking the state. Whilst clearly we need to do more in the European Union to ensure that our societies remain vigilant and develop means to detect and prevent radicalisation and recruitment, we also need to have enhanced domestic security measures, such as the passenger name records (PNR) system for aviation, and better internet monitoring of terrorist activities. Ultimately, however, we must also take the fight against evil ISIS everywhere, particularly militarily in Syria, Iraq and Libya.

The three attacks add to this wave of unprecedented hatred and radicality with which we are beginning to live together, an extreme situation that we seem to be willing to accept as usual. Worse, we know that they will strike hard again, especially those countries like Tunisia which, when they try to move forward on the democratic path, radicals plunge back into doubt and instability. It seems that it is clear that the High Representative stated in this House that the situation in North Africa is a priority of the European Union and its foreign policy. After the attack at the Bardo National Museum, we began to realize the importance and need for the European Union, with all the tools at its disposal, to become involved in the fight against terrorism in North Africa and to help countries such as Tunisia, Algeria or Morocco without mitigation. I heard numerous appeals in this regard in the last debate. But what progress have we made? What goals have we achieved? What's changed? Financial and financial aid is not enough. From this seat I reclaim and insist on the urgency of actively engaging us, not just dedicating good words to them. We must become aware, once and for all, that the border of our security is in North Africa. We cannot afford a single more focus of tension and instability on the southern European border. We cannot afford to lose Tunisia, because the Islamic State we are far from defeating is knocking on your door, at our door. We must reformulate the Union's neighbourhood policy.

How many discussions have we had? Nothing has really changed. Most of the time, the answers were: more surveillance, more weapons, more repression. This has not produced the results we would have liked. Nor have we really asked ourselves the question: how can support for terrorists be prevented in countries where terrorism is practised? How can this support be prevented from being granted? How can democratic processes be developed? I say to you: I keep thinking about it when we were in Iraq and of course the question had to be asked for us: Why is ISIS so successful? Because, of course, he also has support in parts of the population. I never forget – as I have already said here – as the Bishop of Erbil has told us: we do not need weapons, but we need support, and that is for reconciliation with the Sunnis, and indeed in the population, not, of course, with the terrorists.  We don't do anything about that. We need an honest discussion about the reasons why young people or others – not just young people – see their ideal in terrorist actions.

We had the answer 48 hours later. We had a beheading in the French town of Grenoble, a massacre of 38 innocents in the Tunisian resort of Port El Kantaoui and a bombing of a mosque in Kuwait. What did all of these attacks have in common? Now some may find what I am about to say to be unpalatable, some might find it politically incorrect, but the simple fact is the one thing they all had in common was they were done in the name of Islam. Now I hear people in my own country claim the opposite and say that these outrages have nothing to do with Islam. But this is not only ludicrous, it is also extremely dangerous. These terrorists commit these atrocities and quote the text from the holy book of Islam, so to suggest that these attacks have nothing to do with Islam is akin to suggesting that the Inquisition had nothing to do with the Catholic Church. Indeed, if we are to deal with radical Islamism then we must at least have the courage to name its source. It is not just poverty and poor education, it is a literal and backward interpretation of the Koran. But not only do we in the West turn another cheek to extremism, we actively encourage it. We turn a blind eye to misogyny, homophobia, limb amputation, and the funding of extremism in return for arms deals and oil, and this primarily takes place with the States of Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

Of course, one is particularly shocked when – like us liberals – we have been warned for years that radical Islam will not shy away from attacks in Europe either, and when we have been warning for years that radical Islam is already in the middle of our society. We always hear and read in the media and from responsible politicians: these are all individual perpetrators. Slowly, it seems to me that we are dealing here with an army of individual perpetrators, ladies and gentlemen. We also know that ISIS is already deliberately bringing new assassins to Europe with the help of the wave of refugees. There are three different routes. The most dangerous leads over Bulgaria with fake passports. There, these assassins with EU passports are on their way. \"The next battlefield will be Europe,\" \"The World\" is already headlined. In addition to the wave of refugees, this terrorist problem, which we imported ourselves because of the failure of the EU governments, will be one of the biggest we will deal with in the coming years.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 171, "date": "2015-07-08.json", "name": "Gerard Batten (EFDD).", "mepid": "28497", "text": "   – Mr President, my colleague Paul Nuttall’s speech of a few minutes ago said many of the things that I might hope to say and with which I totally agree. The threat that we all face in the West – and not just in the West – is from fundamentalist Islam. The terrorists and the extremists all have one thing in common: they are all reading the same book, and it is called the Koran. It contains exhortations, such as ‘kill unbelievers wherever you find them’, ‘make war on unbelievers’ and ‘strike terror into the hearts of unbelievers’. Some people take that literally. We are told by our leaders that Islam is a religion of peace and love. The problem is that it is actually a contradictory mishmash of nonsense. The problem is that the extremists and the fundamentalists actually choose the bits that they like in order to satisfy their bloodlust and earn themselves 72 virgins in paradise, although nobody has actually come back to confirm that they get them. Western liberal democracies must make it plain that extremist, fundamentalist Islam has no place in western society. We all come into contact with moderate, peace-loving Muslims every day. They are not the problem. Their ideology is. We must support the moderates against the extremists. Sun Tzu said that the first place you win a war is in the mind of your opponent. All propagandists know the importance of words. If you control words, you control how your opponent thinks and reacts. Most religions are named after their founders – Christianity, the religion of Christ; Buddhism, the religion of Buddhists; Judaism the religion of the Jews – and yet we accept the word Islam – submission to the will of Allah. It is not. It is the construction of a person. Let us go back to what we used to call this religion 30 or 40 years ago: Mohammedanism. It is the cult of Mohammed, and these people accept the death cult of Mohammed. Let us make it plain that we do not accept this ideology and take practical measures to defeat the extremists and support those moderates who want to stay in western liberal democracies.

I am very impressed. Mr President, Commissioner, the evolution of the terrorist phenomenon has, over the last fifteen years, seen considerable changes, both in terms of organisational structure and objectives, methods of action, recruitment and propaganda.  The main and common goal of all terrorists remains to undermine democratic values, human rights and societal structure. Terrorist activity is, in this context, a common, horizontal and cross-border threat with a growing dynamic.  Since the beginning of 2015 alone, there have been 138 terrorist attacks, six of which in July. Those who led the attacks include not only known terrorist organizations such as Isis, Boko Haram, Al-Shabaab or Taliban terrorist cells, but also the so-called \"solo terrorists\" or Lone Wolf terrorist, acting on their own initiative.  Recent attacks in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Yemen, Nigeria, Mali, Kenya, Syria, Somalia, Kuwait targeted not only crowded, touristic places with minimal security devices, which would have diminished the attractiveness of terrorist purposes but also targeted law enforcement with a view to destabilizing regions, states, a region of great proportions, MENA, as well as weakening the confidence of the local population and the international community in the state's competence to control the phenomenon.  However, the terrorist threat does not stop at the EU's borders, and the June attacks in Austria and France, as well as the forecast of imminent attacks in Member States, recall this fact.  In this context, I would like to stress the importance of increasing synergy among the Member States of the European Union in order to deal with this threat, as well as the full and effective implementation of the strategic anti-terrorist objective as set out in the EU Security Strategy, the elements agreed by the February Council and the priorities reiterated by the June Council.

The recent terrorist attacks by ISIL demand our full attention. Once more, we see the terrorists have no mercy.

In the last few weeks they have killed tourists in Tunisia, Egyptian soldiers in the Sinai, Pakistani bus travellers in Karachi, worshippers during prayer in Kuwait, and beheaded one person in France. The death numbers are more than statistics, they are reminders that the fight against extremism, globally and here in Europe, is far from over. There is also good news: the Muslim world is increasingly taking a firm stance against extremism falsely conducted in the name of Islam. The EU should support such efforts by partner governments as well as ordinary citizens. However, a long-term solution depends on us solving the underlying root causes. Primarily, we must achieve a comprehensive, just and enduring Middle East peace. The EU must win the war against extremism right here in Europe. A recent public opinion poll suggests that 46% of Britons believe Muslims do not share British values. This is devastating. Not only is it not true, it has also fuelled the extremist narrative. EU Member States must increase cooperation in pre-empting further radicalisation of our citizens.

This was an attack that aimed to sow fear and division. We stand together with Tunisia so that the terrorists do not succeed. This was an attack on people, first and foremost, and our sympathy lies with the families and friends of the victims and the Tunisian people. It was also, however, an attack on Tunisia’s brave choice for democracy, targeting the tourism industry, which is the backbone of Tunisia’s economy and which was already facing enormous challenges. The democratic transition accomplished by Tunisia since 2011 is unique and, as recognised by the Tunisians themselves, fragile as a result of the remaining political and socio-economic challenges still facing the country. Courageous reforms are still necessary to consolidate the country’s democratic constitution and to meet the social and economic difficulties of the country, which primarily affect Tunisia’s youth. The European Union has supported Tunisia’s efforts since 2011 and will continue to do so as the government’s major source of external support. I sincerely hope that Europeans will continue to visit Tunisia and invest in the country. It is our shared responsibility to ensure that they can continue to do so safely and securely. The attacks in Sousse and at the Bardo Museum were not the first signs of the enormous security challenges facing Tunisia. Since the revolution the European Union has been engaged with the country’s authorities in a dialogue about a comprehensive reform of the Tunisian security sector in order to ensure that its security institutions can more efficiently provide security to its citizens, in full respect for human rights and international norms, as guaranteed by the new constitution. Despite the difficulties inherent in developing cooperation programmes on such a sensitive topic, the current political context of an elected government committed to reform allows us to launch an ambitious programme of support for the sector. We will speed up as fast as possible the implementation of this programme. As part of this wide-ranging reform, the fight against terrorism will be a major element, in particular to reinforce the confidence of the country’s citizens in its security institutions. However, we wish to go even further. Along with the EU’s counter-terrorism coordinator, Gilles de Kerchove, the Commission and the European External Action Service are currently identifying opportunities to act rapidly with all available instruments in order to assist Tunisia in strengthening its counter-terrorism strategy, particularly as regards counter-radicalisation, and reinforcing judicial and security mechanisms. High Representative/Vice-President Mogherini sent a letter to the Prime Minister of Tunisia in May with a number of concrete proposals. I also wrote to the Minister for Development, Investment and International Cooperation immediately after the Sousse attack to assure him of the EU’s steadfast support and to inform him that we intend to accelerate the delivery of certain tranches of support that originally would have been implemented later this year. As I have already said, the Tunisian example is a target for terrorists because it is a success. If there is a cause in the world which requires the European Union to be united in its support, it is with this country, with its democratic pluralistic government and a society that is committed to the protection of democratic freedoms, pluralism and the rights of women. We need coherent mobilisation of all the resources available to us to defend and strengthen Tunisia’s transition to democracy. This means that all of the European institutions and our Member States must undertake actions that demonstrate our common resolve. Our financial assistance is already substantial: EUR 187 million in bilateral assistance for 2015 alone. However, I intend to explore all avenues in order to reinforce this effort. Our macro-financial assistance is currently EUR 300 million and could be increased over the next few years. That said, Tunisia is a country in a particularly unstable region where our potential value added is commensurate with the size of the country and the crucial period of change the country is going through. We need to ensure that our contributions can be appropriately absorbed and remember that providing money for a problem will not, by itself, solve it. Our support to Tunisia is therefore of prime strategic importance to the European Union as a whole and, as such, requires speed and flexibility in some cases, but also careful planning. Tunisia has consistently been the main beneficiary of the so-called umbrella funds, which are intended to supplement the financial allocations of selected partners on the basis of their progress towards deep and sustainable democracy. This year, in recognition of Tunisia’s great strides in the implementation of agreed reform objectives, we are proposing an additional amount of around EUR 70 million in order to address all these positive outcomes so far, but also in the light of recent events we are now examining how best to employ these funds to boost the number of priority initiatives. Much remains to be done in order to consolidate Tunisia’s young democracy, including integration of the institutions provided for by the country’s constitution, reforms in the judicial and security sectors and launching the process of administrative decentralisation. Tunisia’s socio- economic transition demands considerable reforms and integration of a favourable climate for investment, growth and employment. Facing all these challenges will require efforts spread over many years, and in all these sectors the European Union has the capacity and expertise to provide support for Tunisia's efforts. We can also play a central role in enriching the privileged partnership that we have established with Tunisia. Tunisia wishes to take advantage of the potential offered by our Community policies, which can provide additional opportunities for our partner countries. In areas such as education, youth and university exchanges, innovation and research or agriculture, which is a vital sector for the country, together with my fellow Commissioners we are exploring opportunities for additional actions, including by placing an emphasis on measures that lead to the creation of jobs. Faced with threats such as the threat of terrorism which play on fear and prejudice, our response should be to reinforce the links which bind our peoples and our economies. We should be ambitious and creative in order to ensure that we make a real difference in our support for the people of Tunisia.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 204, "date": "2015-07-08.json", "name": "Michael Gahler", "mepid": "2341", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has I would like to express my sincere thanks for your presentation and also for the work that we, as the European Union, as the Commission are doing there in Tunisia.

A few months ago I participated in the European Parliament's election observation mission in Tunisia with one of the Members who are speaking at this session today. I was able to observe in detail, without any interference, a clean and transparent electoral process and a social environment full of hope. The mission held many meetings with various civil society groups and political representatives and candidates, including the now President, Beyi Caid Essebsi. We were reminded that the \"Arab Spring\" is actually a conglomerate of very different situations, and that, if there was a genuine \"spring\", it was Tunisian, the only country where a totalitarian regime was defeated with peace and where a successful democratic rupture has occurred. But at the same time as they told us that, they also discreetly told us that Tunisians had felt alone, alone in the midst of a very conflicted region, with more than a million Libyan refugees and with pressure from terrorist groups, which unfortunately has either. And what has Europe done so far? The amount of money he has given Tunisia to contribute to its growth is ridiculous. Tunisia urgently needs our security support, it is clear; political, it is clear; but above all, economically, in order to achieve a stable situation that allows young people, one of the sectors most affected by terrorist realities, to have hope for the future.

The aim of these terrorist attacks is, of course, to bring tourism, one of the key sectors of the economy, to its knees, as much as 10 % of GDP, given that the country has no appreciable hydrocarbon resources. Why this relentlessness? The very simple reason: Tunisia is a unicum in today's Arab world, the only real democratic transition that is being fully, if laboriously, taking place in a present of permanent instability in Syria as well as in Libya. A transition that frightens many, terrorists, of course, but also authoritarian Arab regimes, because it fully demonstrates the compatibility between Islam and democracy. It is an uncomfortable example: that is why Tunisia has so many enemies. But Tunisia is also many Tunis: it is its face on the coasts, more developed, more westernized, more linked precisely to tourism and the productive sectors – clearly afflicted there too by unemployment even for graduates and graduates – to a poor hinterland, full of poverty, which is the main basin of those 3 000 or 4 000 foreign fighters.  I strongly insisted in the AFET Committee on having a specific report on this country, because I believe that it has a value that goes far, far beyond its demographic size, and I agree with what President Pittella said in saying that we need a Marshall Plan: we cannot limit ourselves to areas, however important, such as cooperation on migration, security and security. , on circular migrations.

I would like to welcome the decisions taken by Tunisian President Essebsi, who, even before declaring a state of emergency last Saturday, closed no less than 80 Salafist mosques. May our governments follow his example! Since the 2011 revolution, the radical preaching banned by Ben Ali has resumed, mainly targeting the Code of Personal Status which, imposed by Bourguiba and then reinforced by Ben Ali, allows Tunisian women to be full citizens. More generally, beyond the terrible attacks that hit it on 18 March and 26 June, it should be remembered that Tunisia is the country that today provides the largest contingent of jihadists to the Islamist factions currently raging in Syria, Iraq and Libya.  In Algeria, at the time of the hostage-taking of In Amenas, the terrorist commando numbered at least 11 Tunisians and it is still Tunisian citizens who form the core of the Islamic State in Libya. In Tunisia itself, since 2012, Islamists have been holding the scrub in the Mount Chaambi region. However, despite the recovery of the Tunisian state, the dismantling of its security apparatus does not bode well. Meanwhile, Ennahdha is positioning itself as a remedy. The Islamist party has certainly experienced a slight electoral ebb, but Rached Ghannouchi and his family remain in ambush. While observing the parliamentary elections last October, I was able to speak with The main political leaders of Tunisia. Ennahdha has skilfully anticipated its decline and, as part of a long-term strategy, this Islamist party continues its penetration of the entire social fabric, following the model of the Muslim Brotherhood.

This has made the country a priority target for terrorism, as witnessed by the recent act of atrocious violence on the beaches of Tunisia. Its fragility is caused by insufficient jobs, investment and economic growth. Precisely, terrorists aim to destabilise Tunisia by hitting at this fragility to create more unemployment, frighten investment off and undermine the economy.  The destabilisation of Tunisian democracy is contrary to Europe’s vital interests. There is a moral obligation and just as importantly a geostrategic urgency for Europe to counter this threat.

The EU-CELAC Summit has underscored once again the strategic nature of our partnership based on shared values and aiming to promote joint solutions to global challenges. Enhancing ties with Cuba has been a fundamental chapter of this broader strategy. Some of the fault lines that have shaped global politics for decades are shifting with impressive speed. Sometimes we are so focused on the threats we face that we overlook the positive changes that are also taking place. We should not miss the many opportunities that are arising. Furthermore, Europe cannot take a back seat whilst someone else makes history. We should be driving the change forward, to make sure too that the outcomes reflect our values and our priorities, from trade to human rights. During these past months, the Vice-President/High Representative has engaged personally with the Cuban side. A first meeting was held with Cuban Foreign Minister Rodríguez during the CELAC Summit in January 2015 in Costa Rica. In March, she travelled to Havana and had a series of meetings, including with President Castro as well as with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs, the Economy, Foreign Trade and Investment. In April, Foreign Minister Rodríguez came to Brussels to relaunch the formal political dialogue. Finally a bilateral meeting was held with Vice-President Díaz-Canel on the margins of the EU-CELAC Summit. In February 2014 the EU approved the negotiating directives for a political dialogue and cooperation agreement – the so-called PDCA – with Cuba. This will provide an enabling platform for constructive dialogue and improve cooperation between Cuba and the European Union. The decision followed a lengthy reflection process in the Council. It took into account the incipient domestic reform process under President Castro. In parallel, Member States also increased their bilateral engagement with Cuba. Updating our approach in order to promote EU objectives in relation to Cuba more effectively was considered: encouraging political and economic reforms, promoting human rights and improving the lives of Cuban citizens. The agreement will include chapters on political dialogue and cooperation as well as on trade. Negotiations were launched in April 2014 and subsequent rounds took place in August and in March 2015. Ms Mogherini’s contacts with the Cuban side in recent months also served to provide additional impetus to the process. On 15 and 16 June last, negotiators met for a fourth round of talks in Brussels. The discussions took place in a good – and may I say constructive – atmosphere. Together we managed to achieve substantial progress, mainly on the cooperation and policy dialogue and the trade chapters. These chapters are now at very advanced stages and can hopefully be closed in the next round of talks. There was also progress on the political dialogue chapter, and the negotiators engaged in a productive exchange of views, during which positions were further developed and clarified. This discussion will enable a more in-depth preparation of negotiations on the proposed text in the next round, which means in early September. Members will be aware that it was agreed with Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez to seek to accelerate negotiations and conclude them soon, as both sides agreed that this would be to our mutual benefit. The progress accomplished in this round demonstrates the strong commitment of both sides to enhancing the relationship. Progress has also been achieved in an area which is, and will remain, at the core of EU relations with Cuba: human rights and fundamental freedoms. In March it was proposed to Foreign Minister Rodríguez that a dedicated and structured dialogue on human rights be set up. During the political dialogue meeting in Brussels, an understanding was reached to start consultations on the establishment of a human rights dialogue. A first session led by the EU’s Special Representative for Human Rights, Stavros Lambrinidis, was held in Brussels on 25 June, in between a preparatory and a constituting meeting. The purpose was to discuss and agree on the format and objectives of such a dialogue before the PDCA negotiations are concluded, to give us a head start. Thus the human rights dialogue parameters will be designed in line with the overall terms of the agreement, from where they will derive continuity and formal blessing. The dialogue gives us an opportunity to improve mutual understanding on human rights and exchange experiences and best practices, as well as seek to identify potential areas of cooperation between the EU and Cuba. It also provides a platform to address recent developments and, where necessary and appropriate, to address concerns over individual cases. This dedicated dialogue will provide feedback and bolster the formal political dialogue at the political level. In the light of this positive engagement, it was all the more disappointing to learn of the incidents which took place in Havana last weekend, including undue violence and a large number of detentions. There is no reason to limit the peaceful expression of opinion, and the use of excessive violence against peaceful protestors is unacceptable. Those who overstepped the mark of the legitimate exercise of authority should be disciplined. We expect the Cuban authorities to take all necessary measures to remedy this situation, and we call on them to permit all peaceful forms of expression. During the meetings with the Cuban authorities, the Vice-President/High Representative also explored the prospects for cooperation and joint work on a number of foreign policy issues. These include Columbia, where Cuba plays a positive role in hosting negotiations between the government and FARC in the mediation process. Other such cases include global cooperation on health issues, in which Cuba has a strong role, as we witnessed during the Ebola crisis, or, potentially, cooperation on climate change in the run-up to the COP21 Conference in Paris. Obviously, the recent rapprochement between Cuba and the United States has also been addressed in these talks. Last week, Cuba and the US announced the reopening of their embassies in Washington and Havana. This decision, as agreed between Presidents Obama and Castro, ends a prolonged stalemate and will create new opportunities for Cuba, the region and beyond. The isolation of Cuba would make no sense at all in today’s world. It is a cold-war relic we should all be happy to dismiss. This is even more true for us Europeans, who suffered for decades from the artificial divisions imposed by a conflictual world order. A further normalisation is necessary and should include the end of the US embargo, which is outdated and inconsistent with the context. The EU has always spoken up against this unilateral measure, including its humanitarian impact on many Cubans and its territorial effects on EU-Cuban economic relations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 228, "date": "2015-07-08.json", "name": "Luis de Grandes Pascual", "mepid": "28393", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your extensive and certainly hopeful information. It is clear that trade dialogues are moving forward and it is also clear, by their own diplomatic expressions, that, in political dialogues, each is expressed in the usual terms. I believe, Mr President and Commissioner, that the start of negotiations on a political dialogue and cooperation agreement with the European Union, on the one hand, and the thawing of relations with the United States, on the other hand, are two events which have marked a very important turning point in updating Cuba's relations with the world. It is clear, Mr President, that changes are taking place around Cuba. Changes that I would like to make faster, because, at the end of the day, they point to a new direction, which must be followed closely. Consequently, I would also like the European Union to be very present in this process, as the Commissioner said that it is doing so. Most Latin American countries are joined by a dense and close network of political, economic and cooperation agreements. Cuba, for well-known reasons, is one of the very few exceptions left on the continent. Let us hope that, in the coming months, the conditions will be met in order to achieve this agreement of political dialogue so that we can move forward in the intensification of our relations. A very important chapter, Mr President, of crucial importance in the context of this negotiation is that of human rights, and I am glad that you highlighted it in your speech, Commissioner. I welcome the first high-level dialogue between the Cuban and European authorities. Mr President, human rights and fundamental freedoms are not matters of internal order. On the other hand, they are the pillars of that community of values that is the European Union and of that wider community, which unites the two shores of the Atlantic, in which the friends of Cuba – and the Spaniards are – want to see it fully integrated. As I pointed out at the beginning of my speech, we must celebrate the timid steps Cuba is taking to open up to the world. Now, let's hope that Cuba will open up to Cubans as well. We want a Cuba fully integrated into the international concert, a Cuba that wins in prosperity, but also, of no, a Cuba that wins in freedom. A political cooperation agreement means that all parties undertake to do so.  But what is Cuba doing? He's doing it timidly while the others are acting.

We have, I would say in the difficult times that are going on, we still have and we want to continue to have a model of humanistic and people-centered development, a model that adds to social and public service concerns, something that Cuba values, with the freedom of expression of civil society, individuals and institutions.

However, we must not make a big mistake: to think that Cuba becomes the land of conquest of us or of the Americans. We absolutely must prevent the gradual transition to the capitalist economy from being a shock passage, a transition to savage capitalism which today, in the absence of an entrepreneurial class or people capable of managing it, will result in even greater inequalities and poverty than the crisis that is already taking place.  Our duty, therefore, is to assist the friends of the Cuban people and not to repeat the mistake that was made with regard to Russia: the agreement must be not only commercial but also political and human rights-oriented, especially for the benefit of the Cuban people and not aimed at exploiting their resources, let alone the famous hydrocarbons that are talked about so much in the Gulf.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 237, "date": "2015-07-08.json", "name": "Marie-Christine Arnautu", "mepid": "124748", "text": "  on behalf of the ENF group. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can only welcome the recent diplomatic rapprochement between the European Union and Cuba.  The policies of embargo and isolation of countries considered adversaries or enemies have always shown their inefficiency, even their harmfulness. However, I regret that it was not until the United States began a change of attitude towards Cuba, after decades of a severe embargo with dramatic consequences for the Cuban economy and people, that the European Union decided to do the same. How can we then claim that the Union has an independent foreign policy, when it is, once again, behaving only like the vassal of the United States? Finally, I hope that this diplomatic warming does not come at the expense of honesty and truth.  Since coming to power in 2008, Raul Castro has slightly relaxed the communist regime's rule over the population. But this must not make us forget the terrible political repression suffered by Cubans for more than 50 years, nor the tens of millions of deaths, nearly 100 million caused worldwide by communism.  This better world, which one of my EPP colleagues was talking about earlier, I believe we all hope so.

For Raul Castro's regime, the thaw does not seem to be synonymous with any political reform.

The Cuban government continues to violently suppress dissent and discourage any form of criticism. Peaceful protests are causing panic among the regime, which has recently arrested the wives of political prisoners. Because, yes, there are still dozens of political prisoners in Cuba and thousands of innocent people are still arbitrarily detained and convicted, because they are considered a threat to the system. There is no improvement in freedom of expression. I remind you that Guillermo Farias had to wait three years before receiving his Sakharov Prize, right here, because the Cuban authorities had not allowed him to travel.  Cuba is in the same situation today: anyone who allows himself to criticize the government or uncover gross rights violations is severely punished. It is still strictly forbidden to stray from the official line of government, as this is the way a totalitarian project works with a single and obligatory ideology.

Because Cuba is a country with enormous geopolitical influence in the region. Just look at the peace process in Colombia to discover how important Cuba is. Just look at Cuba's ideological influence throughout Latin America to discover that Cuba is important. It is not by chance that the United States has decided to resume these relations, because it wants to resitute itself in Latin America. It's okay what's been done and I congratulate you. Second thing: it is very important that we do not hold old positions on Cuba. Ancient is the embargo, ancient is the Common Position. We must adapt the European position to these new times, which are very fast-paced, which are running at high speed.

Indeed, Maduro's anticapitalist and anti-American tirades have always been meaningless, but they sound even more absurd at a time when his ideological idols from Cuba are meeting with the US president and restoring relations with the US.  Now, it is important that we also understand in the European Union the nature of this process of normalizing relations between Cuba and the USA, but also the impetus for democratization and respect for human rights in Cuba and the entire region. And in this context, I object to claims from the European left that the EU must enter some sort of race with the US over cuba policy.  The European Union established diplomatic relations with Cuba a long time ago, we are long past the point that US-Cuban relations are only now coming to.

May I remind you all of the reason for her absence: it is simply that she is taking part in the Viennese Iran talks. I hope this is more than a justification and hopefully they can strike a deal as soon as possible. Coming back to our debate, I think that, as is usual in this case and for such a subject, the discussions have reflected a very broad range of positions which are not always easy to reconcile. Having listened to all the speeches very carefully, I feel that the European Union is on the right track with the course adopted in 2014: more and closer engagement with Cuba in order to develop our relationship and find peaceful ways of fostering basic EU interests. The conclusion of the political dialogue and cooperation agreement would be a significant step towards this. It would provide an enabling platform for constructive dialogue and for enhancing cooperation. Consolidation of our engagement and the relationship of mutual trust are essential to ensure that our relationship evolves in line with our values and interests. The EUʼs experience could be greatly relevant for the country in its quest for economic and social modernisation. The EU can demonstrate how to combine a regulated market-based economy with the demands, social protection and participation of citizens. Many of you have expressed concerns regarding human rights. We are particularly attentive to this matter and fully share those concerns, as I have already expressed in my introduction. This is why the matter has been raised consistently with our Cuban partners, and we have agreed to start discussions on human rights even before the conclusion of the political dialogue and cooperation agreement, to ensure that we have an operational platform for constructive and result-oriented discussions as soon as possible. If Europe wants to be part of the historic process that is taking place in Cuba, and if we aim at driving this process – if we want to encourage reforms, if we want to have a say on human rights – there is only one thing to do: engage with Cuba.

Amidst the turmoil affecting the Middle East, the crisis in Yemen calls for more attention from the international community. Yemen occupies a strategic position along the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, at the crossroads of the Horn of Africa and the Middle East, on the route connecting the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean. There is a real and immediate risk of spillover of this crisis in an already troubled region. Furthermore, the latest developments in Hadhramaut show that terrorist organisations like al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, already rooted in Somalia, and more recently also Daesh, are benefiting from the vacuum of state authority in the country to regroup and regain strength. This is a threat for all countries in the region. The regional powers need to choose cooperation and common security issues. The only alternative to a more cooperative regional order is chaos. Saturday, 4 July marked the 100th day since the exile of President Hadi and the launch of the Saudi-led coalition airstrikes against the continuing advance of Houthi and pro-Saleh forces in Yemen. The country is facing a humanitarian catastrophe, with more than 3 000 Yemenis killed, over 14 000 injured, and 21 million people, or 80% of the total population, in need of humanitarian assistance, and a major food crisis about to unfold. Just to give you a comparison: there are now more people in need in Yemen than in the entire Sahel region. The EU’s position is clear, as portrayed in the Foreign Affairs Council conclusions of April 2015. We have also repeatedly – most recently in a joint statement by the High Representative/Vice-President and Commissioner Stylianides last Friday – made the case that there is no other way out of the current crisis than through an inclusive political process under UN stewardship favouring a genuine and constructive dialogue among the different parties. The continuing advance of the Houthis and forces loyal to ex-President Saleh, in contravention of UN Security Council resolutions, is  clearly unacceptable. But only a broad political consensus based on the parameters set by UN Security Council Resolution 2216 can provide a sustainable solution to the crisis, tackle the threat of terrorist groups and prevent further regional instability. Any long-term solution should address the underlying causes of instability, which are deeply rooted in local historical and socio-economic power structures. The EU fully supports the efforts of the UN Special Envoy, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, to recreate trust amongst the parties for a meaningful political deal. The consultations held in Geneva from 15 to 20 June could be a first step towards a return to an inclusive political process. We see a strong case for the gradual approach followed by the Special Envoy, first setting the conditions for a long pause in hostilities, leading to a sustainable ceasefire, coupled with a monitored withdrawal from key cities by the warring forces. The EU has been reaching out to all the parties in Yemen, including the Houthis. We believe it is critical for all the actors in the conflict to set a realistic path to peace in line with the parameters set by UN Security Council Resolution 2216. Our message to all parties is clear: engage in the UN-led dialogue process, with no preconditions, in good faith. All their legitimate concerns will be duly taken into consideration in a broad political settlement. The humanitarian impact of the ongoing fighting, bombardments and disruption of essential services on the civilian population, in particular on children, is reaching alarming proportions and exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation. The targeting of civilian populations and infrastructures, including UN warehouses or hospitals, is also clearly unacceptable. In this volatile environment it is all the more crucial that humanitarian assistance reaches the people of Yemen. The European Union has been steadfast in its support of the UN efforts towards a lasting, predictable and sustainable humanitarian ceasefire. Such a pause should allow the urgent delivery of humanitarian assistance and essential supplies, including fuel, food and basic commodities, according to the principles of impartiality, neutrality and independence. It is essential, to this end, that access to Yemen for commercial shipping be further eased and that measures taken to implement UN Security Council Resolution 2216 be proportional and predictable. A UN-led inspection mechanism should be urgently rolled out to enable faster and more streamlined clearance procedures for ships bound for Yemen. In parallel we are calling on all parties to ensure respect for international humanitarian law and international human rights law, in particular by protecting civilians. Everyone should refrain from direct targeting of civilian infrastructure, notably medical facilities and water systems, and from using civilian buildings for military purposes. It is also of the utmost importance that all parties ensure the safety and security of medical personnel and relief workers and facilitate the passage of aid convoys and ambulances to the most affected populations without discrimination. The EU Humanitarian Aid Office – Echo – has already mobilised EUR 25 million in humanitarian assistance for Yemen to respond to the most urgent needs. We are also engaged in diplomatic efforts to ensure unrestricted access to humanitarian workers and aid relief so that vital assistance can be immediately delivered. More needs to be done, but international assistance will remain a drop in the ocean if commercial shipping cannot resume and bring the 80% of goods that Yemen imported before the conflicts and if Yemini warring factions continue to hamper the delivery of aid. Ultimately, the solution to this crisis has to be a political one, and every day that passes further entrenches polarisations and sees the risk of a protracted conflict with sectarian undertones grow. The EU will remain committed to playing its full role in supporting the UN and in reaching out to the parties and to regional players to set a swift path for peace.

Mr President, Commissioner, Yemen is indeed crystallizing most of the tensions and rivalries that exist in the Middle East today. The Persian Gulf could lose its geostrategic balance, as you pointed out. Imbalances in the Gulf could also affect the entire Middle East and the countries near the Gulf of Aden. Who can think that this destabilization would not affect our own situation, economically, safely or culturally? The European Union cannot therefore lose interest in what is happening in this country, which is certainly far away, very little known - as I have seen many times - because it can also have an impact on us. Today, Saudi Arabia, as well as eight Arab countries, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Qatar, Sudan and the UAE, supported by the Western community, are conducting, for the first time, a joint military operation to oppose the Houthi rebels and the Islamic State group. It should be noted that this is the first time that these countries, which often experience rivalries between themselves, are now in the same together.  However, we are well aware, as you are, that military action cannot be sufficient to restore a long-term national, political and security balance, so essential to regional stability. We must not forget that the Gulf countries are our first allies in the fight against the Islamic State group and against terrorism. So I ask you the following question, what is the European Union doing, by itself, to participate in the restoration of stability in Yemen? It is not just a matter of supporting this or that initiative. Because we are not suspected of having financial or other interests in the region, we have an opportunity to act with the parties.  What is the European Union also doing to effectively support the civilian populations who are the first victims of any armed conflict? Do you also intend to take initiatives to improve the situation of women in this country, which is not often mentioned and has probably the most retrograde status in the world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 271, "date": "2015-07-08.json", "name": "Richard Howitt", "mepid": "2073", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, it is right that in this debate we put first and foremost our concern for the devastating humanitarian catastrophe occurring today in Yemen. The United Nations declared its highest level of humanitarian emergency, with over 80% of the country’s population in need of assistance. Prior to the conflict, more than one-third of the population – some 11.5 million people – suffered from food insecurity. Today, two million more have joined the starving. The UN envoy said the country is now just one step away from famine. It is a crisis for children, in which 1.8 million have lost access to education and one in three fighters are children. So our resolution makes the case for a humanitarian pause, backing the UN Secretary—General and marking the observance of Ramadan. My group stands with all who condemn violence on all sides – from the Houthis, al-Qaida and Daesh/ISIS. For us, however, this includes concerns about the humanitarian consequences of the bombing and of the blockade by the Saudi-led coalition. Regarding the request for military intervention from former President Hadi – someone whose term-of-office has expired and who had explicitly resigned – was that request more legitimate than the request of former President Yanukovych in a different sphere? In any case, that request to the Security Council was based on UN Charter Article 51, which concerns the defence of the country under external attack, and that cannot make it legal in this case. Our resolution calls on all regional actors to contribute to a return to stability. We call for an inclusive political process, which ends the polarisation of peoples based on religious sectarianism. Our resolution also understands that development must play an important role in what is the Arab world’s most impoverished country, if conflict resolution is to succeed in the long term.

Saudi Arabia has intervened militarily with air power against the Houthi advances on Aden, and they in turn are supported by the previously ousted strong man, President Saleh. The country has become a humanitarian disaster zone, with more than 3 000 people killed, more than half of them civilians, including women and children, as a result of the Saudi bombing campaign aimed at driving back the insurgents and restoring the elected, legitimate Hadi government. There have been allegations of gross violations of international humanitarian laws by all sides. Matters are further complicated by piracy in the Gulf of Aden, and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, active in many parts of the country.

The poor people of Yemen have suffered structurally from a lack of inclusive democratic governments, and the tensions and violence that that have resulted, for the past decades. Thousands have been killed and many more injured in the latest eruption of violence alone that started in the spring of this year. A report that the Saudi-led coalition is using cluster bombs should be investigated thoroughly by the United Nations and must have serious consequences, if confirmed. Independently-led investigations should also look at other crimes committed to assess whether these amount to crimes against humanity. The people of Yemen deserve justice, and a de-escalation of violence is needed to restabilise the country. There should be more respect for human life, and the human suffering must end. We therefore call on all parties engaged in this conflict to stop the use of violence, because while people suffer, al-Qaeda, so-called Islamic State, and other terrorist organisations benefit and grow amidst the chaos in Yemen. Ongoing insecurity is further stifling humanitarian efforts, leading to historic and tremendous chaos and crisis. As we can see, a toxic downward spiral is unfolding. The terrorists are going as far as recruiting children for their activities and using them as soldiers, and I think that that is disgraceful. We must work through and ensure that there is dialogue and de-escalation. But there is a political solution, including a more constructive role by regional actors, which – as many colleagues have pointed out – are very much involved in the situation in Yemen, leading to more and more violence. The EU should also reconsider its partnerships with some countries in the Middle East in this context. Foreign actors should stop the interventions, as I mentioned. They should stop adding fuel to the fire. We, as Europe, must support any UN efforts to lead in a dialogue that can lead to a peaceful and political solution to this terrible conflict.

The main speaker was Mr al-Jifri, a former South Yemeni Vice-President, who gave a detailed update of the tragic situation on the ground. He spoke passionately about the increasing humanitarian crisis, the fact that the international aid reaching Yemen is being distributed through Hodeidah port in the north, whilst Aden port in the south literally misses the boat. He also spoke of the increasing casualties and underlined how Yemen’s infrastructure has been completely obliterated. The pressing issue that must be addressed across the globe is the need for a correct diplomatic approach towards achieving a credible ceasefire so that the tragic humanitarian crisis that my colleagues across the House spoke about can be addressed as a matter of priority. I was astounded to learn of another issue that needs addressing urgently, and that is how someone who is taking part in the official dialogue might not actually be representing the very organisations that they claim to speak on behalf of. Certainly the Southern Movement delegates who attended my event left me with the distinct impression that they were currently unrepresented and that incorrect actors are currently at the table, incorrectly claiming to act for them. Now more than ever, the world has regrettably to accept the increasing divide across the Middle East between Sunni and Shia Islam. Yemen today is a tragic example of this. Accordingly, should not the international community honestly consider whether a unified Yemen is a viable long-term solution?

In times of regional turmoil and ongoing sectarianism, this conflict can only increase instability and chaos. A negotiated ceasefire in Yemen, on the other hand, could help to build confidence that can contribute to the resolution of other issues in the Middle East. Only a broad Yemeni-led political consensus, responding to the legitimate grievances of all segments of Yemeni society, will provide a sustainable solution to the crisis. I remain convinced that confidence-building steps should be urgently agreed, including an immediate humanitarian pause with commensurate disengagement of armed forces in all areas including Aden, Taiz and Marib. This would allow international aid organisations to deliver urgently-needed food, medicine and fuel to citizens throughout Yemen. The lack of progress towards the resumption of an inclusive political track and the absence of steps towards de-escalating the conflict carry the risk of a greater regional conflagration, with serious consequences for the Gulf region, the Horn of Africa and, ultimately, Europe.

The annual report tells the story of the work the EU has done on human rights and democracy during the past year, both bilaterally with our partners worldwide and multilaterally. The year 2014 has been a year of unprecedented challenges to human rights. The world has not seen so many people fleeing conflict since the Second World War. Almost 60 million people are displaced worldwide. These millions of people fleeing their homes to find refuge from violence and economic hardship are an easy prey to violations of human rights. Finding an appropriate response to the manifold issues arising from these dire circumstances is often not easy. To ensure that the human rights of migrants are duly respected, we need to address all parts of the chain, providing immediate measures to save lives and fight traffickers while at the same time working on long-term strategies to tackle the root causes. The threat of terrorism poses an ever-growing challenge to our free and open societies, but we need to ensure that counter-terrorism activities are guided by the same principles that formed the foundation of our democratic societies. Respect for human rights is central in this regard. In the end, our ability to achieve sustainable improvements on human rights worldwide will also depend on our own ability to live by, and adhere to, these standards. Cooperation with this Parliament is one of the guardians of democratic principles and values and is therefore of utmost importance to us. In our concerted efforts to find solutions to the most pressing human rights concerns, the EU has taken action in multiple ways, and our report bears witness to that. It underscores the extensive work done by the network of EU delegations worldwide in following cases of human rights violations, meeting the lawyers of jailed human rights defenders, attending trials as observers and leading local, political and human rights dialogues with the authorities. In short, by being on the front line in defending people whose human rights are violated. In 2014 we held human rights dialogues and consultations with nearly 40 partner countries. In addition, many of the 79 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries that are part of the Cotonou Agreement conducted a dialogue with the EU, during which human rights issues in cases were raised. At the same time, the implementation of the 132 human rights country strategies has resulted in more intense collaboration between the EU delegations and Member States embassies on the ground and has led to more coherent human rights dialogues. Our main financial instrument in the area of human rights – the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights – has continued to support civil society organisations and human rights defenders worldwide. We have also strengthened our capacity to act in a coherent and effective manner by adopting guidelines on freedom of opinion and expression online and offline, and on freedom of religion and belief. The EU has reiterated its strong commitment to preventing and eradicating torture worldwide and has systematically raised individual cases during human rights dialogues, besides calling for the introduction of specific national prevention mechanisms. During the last year, we remained strongly committed to protecting children from violence, exploitation, abuse and neglect. The EU pledged more than EUR 100 million for the next seven years to gender equality and children’s wellbeing, including concrete projects on ending female genital mutilation and child, early and forced marriage. The crucial role of our Special Representative for Human Rights – and I am happy that Stavros Lamprinidis is with us today – in increasing the overall coherence, effectiveness and visibility of human rights in EU foreign policy cannot be highlighted enough. The year 2014 also marked the end of our first long-term policy on human rights, the Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy for 2012 to 2014, which has allowed the overall coherence and coordination of EU activities in the field of human rights to be improved. Progress could also be achieved in mainstreaming human rights across all EU policies and promoting greater coherence in our action towards third countries. Not least thanks to your valuable proposals, we managed to make remarkable progress in defining a new, ambitious, long-term policy document for promoting and protecting human rights worldwide in the next five years. I am happy to announce to the House today that, together with Member States, we are finalising the new action plan on human rights and democracy for the years 2015-2019. It will aim at substantive further progress in implementing the EU strategy adopted in 2012. It includes multiple dedicated actions focusing on those areas that require renewed political commitment and additional efforts. We intend in particular to concentrate on, firstly, empowering local actors and encouraging indigenous forces in a spirit of partnership, and secondly on addressing human rights challenges in key areas. These include freedom of expression, freedom of religion, anti-discrimination, gender equality, children’s rights, combating torture and promoting economic, social and cultural rights. Certainly we want to tackle and redress human rights violations in conflicts and crises. Further, we want to foster the coherence of the EU response in strategic policy areas such as migration, trade and counterterrorism. Finally, we want to deepen our effectiveness and improve the results of our tools. I am aware that this is a rather ambitious agenda. It will be the agenda for human rights in the coming years. Looking back on our activities, we have already come a long way. Despite the severe challenges that still remain, we should not underestimate the progress already achieved, hence our increased and concerted commitment for sustainable long-term solutions to the current complex and diverse challenges. We will continue to speak out on injustice and human rights violations all around the world. We will continue to challenge others as much as we challenge ourselves, and we will continue to critically assess our own approach and actions and, where necessary, adjust them. Your scrutiny is central and indispensable in this regard.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 295, "date": "2015-07-08.json", "name": "Cristian Dan Preda", "mepid": "96838", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Mr President, I would like to begin by welcoming the adoption by the Council of the annual report on the state of human rights and democracy in the world in 2014, as well as the statement that Commissioner Hahn has just made. I am pleased to see that the European Commission is continuing the tradition of presenting this text to the European Parliament and I hope that the High Representative, Mrs Mogherini, will be present in December, when Parliament debates and adopts its own report on this subject. I hope that the coherence and strength of our human rights and democracy policy will emerge as a winner from this inter-institutional dialogue.  In recent years, the annual report on the state of human rights and democracy in the world has really turned into a report on the implementation of the European Union's strategic framework and action plan on the same issue. Of course, this is a very positive development, because we need to take the time to reflect on what we are doing, day by day, to promote human rights and democracy. The annual report for 2014 leads me to wonder whether the interpretation given to the terms \"implementation\" is not too narrow. This year's report, which is almost 400 pages long, is actually a long catalogue that describes in detail the Union's actions. This includes the number of dialogues and consultations with third countries, the number of meetings with civil society, the details of human rights conferences, etc. I believe that the report should go further in understanding the terms 'implementation' and that it should also address the difficulties and, of course, the successes in the implementation of our human rights and democracy policy. It could thus fuel reflection on our policy with concrete examples. Similarly, again with regard to the content of the annual report, I think it would be important to put more emphasis on our policy of supporting democracy, because it appears to be in some way secondary to that in the field of human rights.  In reality, democracy and human rights are closely linked. The most basic rights of any individual are much more likely to be respected in a democratic system than in any other regime.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 296, "date": "2015-07-08.json", "name": "Elena Valenciano", "mepid": "4334", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Mr President, I am very grateful for the Commissioner's speech and I also know that there is a very powerful reason why Mrs Mogherini will not be here today. We all know why Mrs. Mogherini isn't here. And it's for a very good reason, for a very important reason. If Mr Lambrinidis is here, the Commissioner is here, and I thank you both for your presence. The analysis of the Annual Report cannot be a mere formality, nor a mere label. We are talking, from my point of view, of one of the elements that should inspire the heart of our external action. We are talking about a strategic approach to the role that the European Union has to play outside our borders. It is key, it is central, it is strategic and it is very important, not only because the number of humanitarian emergencies that are currently in the world is enormous: premature deaths, avoidable deaths, hunger, despair; not only because of the number of diseases, which we could also avoid, but also because of the immense number of displaced people, refugees, asylum seekers, desperately seeking a better life. Because there is something that occurs in all civilizations, on all continents and at all ages, and that is that human beings want to be free and live well. Everyone's entitled to the same thing. And I think the moment is especially critical, because we had thought, I think, a few years ago, that human rights were a struggle, a path that had only one direction forward, and we know that it is not, that it is a path of double direction, that we can move forward and we can go back, and my impression is that there are many human beings who are going back on the path to their dignity , towards true respect for their human rights. Why? For it is questioned, in many parts of the world, that human rights are universal, that they are indivisible, that human rights are the flag that all human beings need to raise. Because there are cultural, civil, political relativs that are calling into question that principle that was almost sacred to us. And they are regions of the world that have a lot of weight and have a lot of power, and that is why the European Union has to be much stronger than it has been, because we have the almost moral mandate to be the ones to continue to defend the indivisibility and universality of human rights; who we continue to say that all the women of the world want to be free, no matter where they live, because individually they want to be.

For the EU, human rights are at the centre, as an important pillar of our story. I would like to congratulate the Commission on european human rights policy. The human rights dialogue was extended to 37 countries. That is good. The instrument for democracy and human rights also gave EU embassies a greater role. But of course, the work is not finished. We must also reflect on the shortcomings of our policy. There needs to be more follow-up of human rights dialogues through verifiable and clear indicators.

There are countries like Morocco, Armenia, Israel, Turkey and others which enjoy a permanent discount on their systemic violations of human rights and occupation of foreign territories. Let me give you two examples. Some days ago, The Guardian reported on how Morocco manipulated confidential reports of the United Nations concerning human rights violations and the situation in Western Sahara. Today – this is the second example – this House has ignored my call to commemorate the 1 500 civilian Palestinian victims, among them 500 children, who were killed in the attack on Gaza exactly one year ago on 8 July. It was too difficult for this Parliament to commemorate this event. Can we do better in the future? Certainly not with the new organisational chart of the EEAS presented recently by its Secretary-General.

I think I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to all the staff in the EEAS, because a great deal of work has been done. Compared to other regions of the world, we can already say that the EU is a very active player and also an actor – compared to the other regions – who is working very consistently on the further development of human rights standards and who has also defended – and this has just become important – human rights achievements in recent years, such as the absolute validity of the universality of human rights. However, I would like the EU to take an even more decisive stand against all human rights relativism and, for example, to take more initiatives – for example, in the UN Human Rights Council with governments in the global south – to counter attacks on universality.  This report is a list of the work that has been done. I would ask you to consider whether such an annual report could not be partly different. It would therefore be interesting if evaluations were made as to the extent to which certain measures were also successful or not successful. It would be interesting to know, for example, how the human rights guidelines are applied by the EU delegations on the ground and what the results have been.  Such an assessment would certainly be important not only for the report, but also for the continuation and correction of one's own work. I said at the outset that the EU is a strong human rights player in foreign policy. The EU gains strength and influence, especially through credibility in its own actions. However, this credibility is seriously damaged if we lack consistency in complying with a policy in line with human rights in all areas, for example in our EU border and refugee policy, for example in our policy in the fight against terrorism. Last but not least, credibility is also reflected in the strengthening of human rights work in one's own institution, in the EEAS itself. There must be no downgrading or even weakening of working structures.

Violence and abuse of women and girls are systematically used as weapons in war. It is a despicable phenomenon. Therefore, there must be a gender perspective in all the efforts made in this area. Among other things, women must be appointed as peacemakers in conflicts.  According to the report, important work is being done in this area, but it seems to be to a limited extent.

Madam President, Commissioner, we have been talking all afternoon about issues such as Yemen or human rights, and we could also have talked about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, all of which are at the heart of the report on stability in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). This report is certainly a bit dense, but it accompanies the Commission's desire to give a strategic line to Europe's action in this region.  In this report, we were obliged to review all the different subjects: Syria, Libya, Iraq, Yemen, Tunisia, the fight against the Islamic State group. At the same time, it is not in the accumulation of specific cases that we have sought to identify a precise and long-term strategic line. The principles we have adopted in this report are first and foremost principles of accountability. There would have been nothing worse for us, the European Parliament, than to divide ourselves by taking up this challenge, when our South is already in the state we see and our imperiousness proven. So we have always sought to listen to each other and to find consensus.  From this point of view, I would really like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs very warmly, Mrs M-nescu for the EPP, Mr Nart for the Liberals, Mr Belder, Mr Smith for the Greens, Mr Iglesias, Mr Permuy, Mr Castaldo, Mrs Vergiat.  Whatever the political orientations, apart from those who are frankly anti-European, we have sought to build a common, responsible and can be heard.  The principles that have guided us are as follows, and know that it has not been easy to define them. First, do not consider that the security challenge must be limited to security itself. Of course, we have to meet this challenge, and there is no excuse for terrorism, either economic or social. It has ideological underpinnings. From this point of view, we are fulfilling our responsibilities by calling for strengthening and better coordination of Europe's security action. But at the same time - this is the strategic line we want to adopt - we know that peace and stability can only come back if we deal with the long-term causes: the democratic question and the human rights issue, which we have just addressed, the economic question and the social question.  Of the three parts of the report, two are devoted to the economic and social issue, the democratic question and the question of human rights. This allowed us to find a consensus, in a balance where there would not be a single cause, but multifactorial actions. Yes, we must intervene on the security issue, we must strengthen Europe's action, we must provide assistance to States, we must better help to monitor borders, we must of course do everything we can to train those who must ensure security on our southern flank and at the same time we must deploy economic and social actions. The second fundamental line of this report is quite new and structures the whole process. It is to admit that Europe cannot - as it tends to do, as we have heard in previous debates - hope to solve all the problems alone, in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, through a number of invocations or interference.  This report is based on a balance between the desire to have concerted, long-term, coherent action and, at the same time, to rely, on the one hand, on the States, but also on all the multilateral instruments that exist, especially in the South. In conclusion, Madam President, I believe that on these two aspects we have found a strategy and we have managed to come together around the idea that Europe needs to be more present in order to take more decisive action.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 322, "date": "2015-07-08.json", "name": "Johannes Hahn", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you today upon the presentation of your excellent report on ‘The security challenges in the MENA region and the prospects for political stability’. You have very accurately described the main political developments in the region over the last four years and well highlighted the areas in which the EU could play an important role. As you know, the geopolitical landscape of the MENA region has been utterly transformed during this period. Today, the EU is facing an arc of conflicts and crises – from Iraq, Syria and an unresolved Middle East conflict, to Libya and the Sahel, with spillover effects throughout the region. At the same time, the talks with Iran give us hope that a more cooperative order in the region is indeed possible, and therefore once again I think it is justified that our High Representative is there and participating very actively in these discussions. Let me briefly mention the state of play and how the EU sees the situation in some of these countries. In Tunisia, following the attacks in Sousse, we are more united than ever to ensure success of the transition with the Tunisian people. I have instructed my services to use accelerated procedures to deliver our support, including measures directed at the tourism sector, which is demoralised as a result of this attack, and may I recall that we were able to discuss this issue in extenso earlier today. In Libya, the EU – together with the international community – has deeply engaged with the country, but I cannot emphasise enough my plea to Libyan participants to accept the UN proposals in good faith in the interests of the Libyan people. On the unresolved Middle East conflict, the EU stands ready to work with both Israel and Palestine, and all other major stakeholders, to return to negotiations with the aim of achieving a comprehensive peace agreement based on a viable two-state solution. The situation in Syria and its neighbourhood is a strong reminder of the urgency to reignite an inclusive Syrian-led political process on the basis of the Geneva Communiqué. We fully support the UN Special Envoy Staffan  de Mistura, and along with the UN we have launched an urgent humanitarian appeal for the region. As underlined in ‘The EU regional strategy for Syria and Iraq as well as the Da’esh threat’, we are determined to support the efforts of those countries hosting a huge number of refugees. In this context I must mention the efforts of Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey: the burden they are carrying is enormous. We are also ready to cooperate with Iraq and other neighbouring countries on security and counter-terrorism issues and to move towards implementation of much-needed political and socio-economic reforms. Against this background, we welcome your excellent report on ‘The security challenges in the MENA region and the prospects for political stability’. We thank in particular Vincent Peillon for his work as rapporteur, the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) and all MEPs for their constructive approach to the challenges faced in the Mediterranean region. I would also include in my thanks, of course, the shadow rapporteurs. I fully agree with your conclusion that the conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Libya and the increase in tensions in the MENA region are major sources of destabilisation, that the risks these developments entail for European security are serious, and that it is a huge challenge to effectively enunciate and implement a coherent conflict resolution strategy. I also agree with your conclusion: to effectively deal with this challenge, the European Union and its Member States must think strategically in the medium and long term. We must look at all issues from a broad, global perspective; we need to develop all-round policies, responding to the emergencies but also dealing with their deep causes; and we need to keep strengthening our cooperation with all relevant regional actors, for complex threats require coordinated responses. Crisis management is important, but it is not enough. Think of terrorism: in the long term, I believe that functioning and inclusive democracies, human rights, education and good jobs are the best antidote to radicalisation. As stated in your report, fighting terrorism must go together with supporting genuine democratic reform in the region. Some believe that countering terror requires repression. In fact it is the exact opposite: in the long run, a democratic environment is the only cure for radicalisation. Mostly this is about providing opportunities to the youngest members of society. Young people must be inspired by values that reject violence, create peace and build inclusive, open societies. This is why supporting education is so important. But education is of little use if we cannot also create jobs, and good jobs. This is vital to ensure that everyone finds a positive role to play in society. All communities must be given a chance to contribute to the social, economic and political life of their own countries. Entire religious and ethnic groups – Christians and others – are being forced to flee from lands they have inhabited for centuries. This has little to do with a ‘clash of civilisations’: the terrorists often know very little about the Qur’an. It is not a war of religion but a struggle for power and regional hegemony. The EU is doing all it can to halt and prevent this violence. We will not let sectarianism prevail. Moreover, I fully agree that the engagement and empowerment of women in the public, political, economic and cultural spheres is key to fostering stability, peace and economic prosperity in the long run. Women’s rights and gender equality must be basic components of the political and human rights dialogue between the EU and the MENA countries. The EU is committed to ensuring that human rights are mainstreamed in all its activities. Since 2012, the EU has engaged regularly with the League of Arab States, including the Arab Human Rights Charter Committee and the Arab National Human Rights Institutions. As you rightly point out, in the past the European Neighbourhood Policy sometimes failed to adequately take into account the specificities of each of our partners, including with regard to identifying civil society partners needing support and capacity-building assistance. The review of the Neighbourhood Policy that is on the way is an opportunity to introduce changes that will help the EU to be a stronger player. We intend to propose ways and means to further the European Neighbourhood Policy, to allow more tailor-made offers and solutions specially designed for each partner. I would also like to thank the European Parliament for the constructive input you have given and will, no doubt, continue to give. A comprehensive approach needs strong and reliable partners in order to be effective. Both Europe and the Arab world are targets for the terrorists. We need a truly global alliance to fight our common battles. As the report states, regional challenges call for regional solutions. In this sense, the report is very much in line with our commitment for closer co-operation with the League of Arab States and the Union for the Mediterranean. As agreed in the EU-League of Arab States Athens Declaration, we are working closely on counter-terrorism in the MENA region, on capacity-building measures and to address the ‘foreign fighters’ phenomenon. Before I leave you the floor, let me add something on the naval operation in the Mediterranean. After the mid-April tragedy, Member States asked the European Union to act against the human traffickers’ networks, to save more lives. In the space of two months, we set up and launched the operation. Countries from all sides of Europe are contributing. Things did not move on so smoothly on the domestic side of the debate. This tells us something. Our problem, most of the time, is a lack of political will. It is not our strength that is being tested, but our resolve. I look forward to hearing your views on this strategic debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 323, "date": "2015-07-08.json", "name": "Cristian Dan Preda", "mepid": "96838", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, I speak on behalf of the PPE Group. Our shadow reporting, Mrs. Manescu, is not available here.  I want to say first of all that it is no longer a secret that the Near East and North Africa are going through a very turbulent period. After the optimism generated by the Arab uprisings, today we are very concerned about developments in the region. We have states on the brink of collapse, redoubtable terrorist networks, millions of refugees and massive violence. Or Europe's security is inextricably linked to the stability and security of this region. That is why I would like to congratulate Mr Peillon on his report. This report proposes an in-depth analysis of recent developments and more leads to address security challenges.  I am also pleased that the High Representative, in her reflection paper on the revision of the European Security Strategy, recognised the need to redefine the Union's approach to the Near East and North Africa. I believe we need a comprehensive and ambitious approach that takes into account the causes of the rapid deterioration of the situation in the region. The threat of terrorism forces us to make consistent use of our internal and external security policies. Humanitarian assistance and development cooperation must also be harmoniously combined.  And, because we have spoken before about human rights, I would like to highlight a very important point for the PPE Group, namely the continued violation of religious freedom in this region and, above all, the freedom of Christians. Last week, our Group held a conference on this subject and we could hear shocking testimonies.

Of course any deal must be fair, credible and fully verifiable. But this is a week where we also hope there may be genuine progress in another set of long-standing negotiations which at times had seemed intractable: the reconciliation talks in Libya. What marks both sets of negotiations is the real human suffering caused by lack of agreement, and the huge political obstacles existing which obstruct agreements from being achieved. If they are – and tonight’s debate must encourage that – it will be a victory for patient diplomacy, where I am proud that the European Union is playing the leading role in both cases. In a third conflict in the region between Israel and Palestine – seemingly the most intractable of all – this Parliament should welcome and encourage the more active role in political diplomacy which the High Representative is prepared to play there. I look forward to the debate with her in September. Vincent Peillon’s excellent report recognises that there are issues of mistrust and resentment about Europe in the region, based on history and on sometimes justified criticism of double standards against European countries ourselves. We have to impress on the countries of the Middle East and North Africa, and their populations, that Europe does not want to return to colonialism. We have to learn lessons by being consistent in our support of respect for democracy and for human rights amongst the countries, despite any considerations of alliance. When I sit in this Chamber and listen to statements about migration and terrorism, these are proper concerns. But we need to articulate them in a way which shows the countries of the region that we want to support peace, prosperity and development for them and their peoples, in their own interest first and not just through the prism of managing issues which are problems to us. Our response to the Mediterranean refugee crisis is a true test of our good intent in that respect. The new phenomenon of ISIS-Daesh is a huge and terrible concern. I add my own personal condolences for the deaths of tourists in Tunisia who came from my own country, Great Britain, but also from fellow European nations Belgium, Germany, and Ireland too. We need a better security response. Territorial advances against ISIS in Syria and Iraq are important if they are to be denied the claim of statehood which their name of so-called ‘Islamic State’ implies. We have to be careful in our own words and actions not to add to the narrative of extremism – which is ultimately self-defeating – by generating radicalisation rather than diminishing it.  For example, at Parliament’s Middle East and North African working group, which I am proud to chair, the European External Action Service recently told us that reports that terrorists were entering Europe under the cover of being refugees are not supported by one shred of evidence. Let us learn by what I started with – the value of patient diplomacy – rather than ramping up the rhetoric as we deal with the countries of this region. Finally, whether in Yemen, which we were discussing earlier, or in Libya, which I have already referred to, and in several other countries, we have to recognise that religious sectarianism is a huge cause of conflict and instability. One thing we must do, as Europe, is to engage with political Islam – not to agree with them, but to talk with those who represent political Islam – if we are truly to have a dialogue to pursue the common interests of our continent and theirs.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 325, "date": "2015-07-08.json", "name": "Bas Belder", "mepid": "4507", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Exactly one week ago I was at the Golan Heights with some colleagues.

I have to tell you honestly that you get a sense of shame when you see how the killing continues while the world community is passive. Although the UN is present in southern Lebanon and on the Golan Heights, it is powerless. There's only Israel there. I would like to pay tribute to the medical service of the Israeli army. At night, so as not to be in danger of being shot by snipers, those wounded evacuate from Syrian villages – now nearly 2,000 – and offer medical care under mortal danger. The Israeli military often perform heroic acts there. That's what I want to say. Early this morning I read in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung an impressively penetrating interview with the expelled bishop of Mossoel. He was talking about us, too. He was asked how he looked at us. I quote: \"The people of the West are fighting for the conservation of species threatened with extinction. How, then, can they passively watch an entire people being driven out and massacred? How can they watch as a people slowly but surely disappears from the history of mankind? If a third of the Syrian Catholic Church is scattered around the world, it actually means the demise of this Church. I ask, I pray to the West and the world powers for help. Make an effort to drive IS out of our country. Today these warriors are with us. Tomorrow they will be with you.\" (End quote.) I would add: they are already here, the Syrians!

Our group is broadly supportive and, as rapporteur for my group, I am very pleased to see that our wording on social injustice and inequality, and on how that is a breeding ground for radicalisation, is included, as are security, instability and corruption and how they interplay. The wording on the Israeli settlements and their malign influence within the wider region is also included. The all-out oppression of the Assad regime within Syria, the use of drones, the strategic importance of the Nile and the need to accelerate human rights in the EU – League of Arab States dialogue, is, we think, all very positive wording. That is not to say that we are entirely satisfied. This is a report about the security challenges in the wider region, yet it does focus very much on Daesh – mentioning Daesh 21 times. Daesh is, of course, a dreadful organisation, but it is one organisation amongst many in a very complex picture. Often it is as much a symptom as a cause. I would personally like to see much more vocal criticism of Israel’s actions in the region, given that it is a recruiting sergeant for radicalisation. There are forces of progress within Israel, and we must reach out to them and assist them in their efforts to have a constructive debate within Israel and with Palestine. The EU could play a leading role in that, but we are not. We also call, in the report, on some states to refrain from exporting terrorism. I am not sure that is helpful language; I am not sure it adds much value either. We also call for the EU to provide a safe haven for Christians, in particular from the Middle East, in the EU. If we are trying to criticise sectarianism, we should refrain from it ourselves. The plight of any refugee, regardless of their ethnicity or their religion, is equally dreadful.

We are right to talk, as Mr Smith pointed out earlier, about some of the real and most fundamental causes of instability, which are poverty, marginalisation and discrimination. We are therefore looking for an approach which is political, economic, social and cultural and which is not limited solely to the security aspect. Clearly, I realise that theatre is in the throes of enormous instability and that providing a detailed analysis of every single context is impossible here. However, I wanted to stress the importance of putting the latent conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran in black and white and the need for a confidence building that must be strengthened over time and, above all, the strong call for Turkey to assume a less ambiguous role than we have seen in recent years. I also express, of course, my concern about Israel's settlement policy in the Palestinian West Bank and express the hope that this report will also encourage the parties to seriously restart a credible peace process, given that it is one of the historically, but also at present, most difficult and dangerous hotbeds to deal with. I would like to stress two fundamental concepts that we must always bear in mind if we want a lasting solution. Firstly, political Islam must necessarily be an interlocutor and must be the interlocutor that allows us to isolate extremism decisively. The second is that we must, in my opinion, focus a great deal on working with the model countries – I am thinking precisely of Tunisia but also of Lebanon, as well as Jordan – by focusing our attention on them and pressing for healthy cooperation with international cooperation organisations, such as the Gulf Cooperation Organisation, we can achieve important results.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 329, "date": "2015-07-08.json", "name": "Aymeric Chauprade", "mepid": "124752", "text": "  on behalf of the ENF group. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Mr Peillon for his report and add some geopolitical elements that I have not read in this document. First of all, the tragedy of the Middle East is the assessment of the Euro-American policy that destroyed the plans to modernize the Arab world and which has in fact strengthened Islam in Societies of Muslim culture. This policy then re-established the Shiite-Sunni divide, which turned into a war exacerbated by strategic competition between Iran and Saudi Arabia.  And then there is the \"Islamic State,\" which has allowed the United States to implement its oil strategy. In the summer of 2014, the price of a barrel, I remind you, ladies and gentlemen, collapsed sharply from $105 to $55, just as the \"Islamic State\" was putting cheap oil on the world market. This strategy of collapsing the price of a barrel directly hit states whose budgets depended heavily on high oil prices, such as Iran, Venezuela and Russia. Iran was pushed to negotiate on nuclear power and, as in the 1980s with Reagan and the USSR, Russia, which was already subject to Economic Sanctions by the European Union, suffered the brunt of the fall of the barrel.  These are some geopolitical realities that I invite you to reflect on and which I believe go beyond the wishful thinking that we all share for the future of the Middle East. The reality is that the destruction of the Middle East has largely served American policy to block the emergence of a multipolar world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 330, "date": "2015-07-08.json", "name": "Tunne Kelam (PPE).", "mepid": "28424", "text": "   – Madam President, we face a negative and destructive synergy in the Middle East and North Africa. What have been, for a long time, internal conflicts have spilled over to the whole region now. The most dangerous thing is the melting down of borders between states in conflicts. These conflicts have become now international and vacuums are being filled by Islamic State and other extremist groups. Lawlessness, extreme violence and terrorism have become a new normality in large areas of Syria, Iraq, Libya and elsewhere. By the way, Middle East countries represent only 5% of the world population but provide one third of world refugees. Eighty per cent of civilians are unable to meet their basic needs now. Eleven million children lack possibilities for education. They form the ever widening basis of a new generation of terrorists. There are two points I would like to make. Among the different minorities, Christians have suffered most widely. Violence against them presents existential danger for the future. As a result, this ancient community will disappear from the region where Christianity was born, mainly as a result of the determined efforts of Muslim extremists to cleanse this area of all other religions. This is something the EU should address with the utmost seriousness, providing them with active protection and probably safe havens. Secondly, the situation in Iran, which has been for years a source of the exporting of terrorism and instability. To hope that cooperating with the Tehran regime and its Revolutionary Guards would help the fight against ISIS is, I would say, naive and would be like attempting to oust the devil with the help of Beelzebub. Why has Mosul stayed for more than one year under ISIS? Because local Sunni minorities are equally afraid of Shia militias, who do not make any difference between them and ISIS terrorists. So, Iran has first to demonstrate credible political will that it is really interested in restoring stability, especially in Yemen and Iraq.

The result of the report is very positive because it maintains a good balance between what is general and what is specific, between what is regional and what is national, in the face of one of the most important challenges facing Europe today, which is to deal with the crises we face in the Middle East: from ISIS to the migration crisis , going through Libyan chaos, very different, interrelated things that directly challenge the European Union. The report covers all the great challenges that Europe has and it is very positive that it gives a multidimensional approach, that not only speaks of security, that it is not limited to that, but also talks about cultural issues, intercultural dialogue, poverty and inequality, something that is obvious: many times behind these great problems there are such solutions , so you have to go further or try to go beyond the surface. As for the Syrian crisis, first of all, it is right to support the actions taken by member states in the international coalition, but we must be well aware that military action will not be enough, not enough, to end ISIS. Of course it won't be. The European Union has allocated EUR 400 million in humanitarian aid to Syria and its neighbours, which is also not enough. It should be remembered that some countries such as Jordan or Lebanon continue to take in millions of refugees, while we are unfortunately unable to agree with States on a system of minimally solidarity quotas. On Egypt, the report calls on the Government to respect human rights and political freedoms. We appreciate the efforts that the Egyptian government is making in the fight against terrorism, but what cannot happen, as is happening, is that President Al Sisi hides in the fight against terrorism to systematically violate human rights and, in some cases, commit crimes, imprison peaceful protesters or sentence political opponents to death. As for the negotiations with Iran, on its nuclear programme, The High Representative, Federica Mogherini, now needs more than ever our support — we already know that it is not here today because it is working on this issue — a closed, clear and resounding support from the European Parliament, so that negotiations to end the current sanctions system come to fruition. It should be remembered that this new bridge we opened relocates all of Europe's geopolitical relations with the Middle East and within the Middle East itself. I want to talk, to finish, about the situation of the conflict in Israel and Palestine. We know that the status quo is absolutely unbearable, unsustainable, that we need to restart the peace process, that the composition of the current Government also does not leave much room for optimism, and that the European Union should consider additional measures. The system of labeling products from Israeli settlements is a minimum, as is also using some of the tools we have, such as the Union for the Mediterranean, something that we must take advantage of and which is in a fantastic city called Barcelona.

However, I would also like to raise a few issues that I think are missing. There are two issues in particular that I think are missing. The first is that no mention is made anywhere of Western Sahara, despite the fact that it is 40 years this year that the country has been occupied. The report that we are going to discuss after this, the report on the neighbourhood policy, which states that it is not acceptable for one country to occupy the territory of another country. But for some reason this is not true in the case of Western Sahara, because there we are constantly allowing a partner country to prevent the promised referendum. They are allowed to seize natural resources and they are allowed to change the population structure without any consequences whatsoever. The Sharians have chosen nonviolence. I believe in nonviolence, but we must also acknowledge them for the nonviolent work they do. We cannot forget them simply because they do not use force. The second issue that is also missing here is arms exports to the region. The report talks about the fact that there is a new situation throughout the Mena region and that we need to adapt our measures to the new situation, but we are not talking about what we ourselves are contributing to this region. Between 2010 and 2014, we accounted for 32% of all arms exports. In 2013, we sold arms for a total value of EUR 9.6 billion and in 2012 EUR 10.7 billion.

One of the things I find interesting about North Africa is that the countries we have not interfered with, such as Morocco, have a stable government and an emerging democracy. The more we keep out of interfering in those affairs, the better. But what we should be concentrating on is the threat from ISIS coming across the Mediterranean from North Africa. We should not be encouraging people to come across. We should try to stop that. There are far too many woolly words about people and refugees. This must be stopped for the good and safety of Europe, or we will have even more problems being imported into Europe itself. We should also stop arguing with Russia. With Russia we have a common enemy in a medieval, religious conflict which, quite frankly, we do not want to be part of. Russia has a similar problem in its southern republics to the one that we have. I think we were better off cooperating with Russia rather than fighting with Russia.

That is why I want to focus once again on the word Tunisia, which we discussed earlier. I had suggested that we consider whether we might convert our suspended EU Border Assistance Mission Tunisia-Libya into a border protection support mission directly for the Tunisian side, in order to stop the infiltration of terrorists, especially from Libya. Libya is my other catchphrase. I think we all know what the situation was at the time of the overthrow of Gaddafi. It was right, in my view, that we did not intervene there as an EU, but as some Member States. I still believe that we prevented a real massacre in Benghazi. But – and this is the big thing – after that, it was not desirable for us to take action on the ground with our tried-and-tested programmes, such as security sector reform. I believe that we could have done well, partly because the Libyans at least had money, and in return we could have carried out, among other things, a security sector reform. That did not happen. We know what the situation is there now, and that is why I think it is right that we support the efforts of the United Nations, but also the efforts of Algeria and Morocco to strengthen the internal Libyan dialogue. That is explicitly in this report.  And then, if it really leads to success, if hopefully we soon have a unity government in Libya, then we should come back with the offers and offer the Libyans, among other things, a reform of the security sector, but also other things to make state-building possible.

First, there is a clear refusal of the theory of the clash of civilizations, of the confrontation between a supposed Western essence as opposed to an essence of the Islamic world, which would be homogeneous and would be doomed to face each other. On the contrary, there is a very clear understanding of the complexity of the situation in North Africa and the Middle East. It is a historical reality of extreme complexity and marked by deep divisions – political divisions, religious divisions, cultural divides, social and economic divisions and which, in fact, today lead to a somewhat chaotic situation throughout that region.  And what should Europe's reaction to this neighbouring region be? The reaction must always be placed on the political and diplomatic level. And I believe that this is where the secret of our intervention has to be, and it is well placed in the report. Turn all this into an issue essentially at the political level.  The report deals with some of the most important issues: the conflict between Israel and Palestine, the issue of ongoing negotiations to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue, the call for the European Union itself to make a political contribution to improving relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia, to overcoming a conflict that is now a structural conflict in the whole region. It takes a very serious and realistic approach to what is now one of the biggest challenges we are facing in that area, which is the challenge of terrorism, and makes an assessment without any kind of contemplation. There are several answers to be given and none of them can be excluded, because they must, moreover, be articulated with each other. Finally, I would like to focus on an issue on which the previous speaker focused on me, which is the issue of Tunisia. Tunisia today is a special country in that region. It was in Tunisia, as we know, that the Arab Spring began. It is now very easy to challenge the Arab Spring and even launch the idea that, truly, those countries are not prepared for the construction of a rule of law and a true democratic regime and that the Arab Spring has increased conflict and increased chaos in the region. But the truth is that we cannot, as Europeans faithful to a certain set of values, remain insensitive to those who in these countries fight precisely for the construction of a rule of law, for the separation between the public sphere and the private sphere in religious matters, for the consecration of freedoms, for the building of a true democracy. It was in Tunisia that the Arab Spring began, and Tunisia is the example, so far the only successful example, of that same Arab Spring. And unfortunately, it's been attacked for that very. The recent attack there is an attack not only on the Tunisian people, but is an attack on a demand to build a democratic rule of law throughout that region. And the European Union has a duty of additional solidarity with Tunisia. Tunisia has expressed this will, it has made calls for enhanced cooperation, and we must be up to our responsibilities. It is a neighbour, and it is a neighbour which now means much more than its own historical-geographical dimension and therefore deserves special attention from the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 343, "date": "2015-07-08.json", "name": "Marek Jurek (ECR).", "mepid": "124892", "text": "   \"We describe the threats and challenges in the Middle East and North Africa that we face, but actually what answers we have.

So far, we have not requested united nations permission to act against their infrastructure where it is built: in ports. And let's really help those who need help.

It covers, of course, a very broad, very complex theme, also of particular topicality and, of course, there has been much effort that has had to be made to be able to compress this very broad reality in its text. I say of particular breadth and topicality because from Tunisia to Iraq and Yemen a long arc of instability, crisis, conflict has been opening up for years, including clashes in Libya and the war in Syria. Unfortunately, its end is not near - I am referring, for example, to the conflict in Syria or to the long Israeli-Palestinian conflict - because, despite the efforts made by the international community in these years, it does not seem to be going to be resolved any time soon. I also say that it is a complex reality because it encompasses very different situations, many of them linked, as has been said here, to the uprisings known as the 'Arab Spring', but serious differences of a religious nature are also present in some of these countries; I mean, for example, the opposition between Sunnis and Shia. And this is therefore a very important report for the European Union, because it refers in large part to the neighbourhood, to that neighbourhood, to those countries so close to those with which we are joined by numerous human, economic links, including, among these links, energy links. What happens there has an impact on Europe and we are seeing it; we are seeing it in the flows of immigration and also in the tragic threat of terrorism, which strikes not only in Arab countries, but also continues to do so in Europe, and notably in France.  That is why I believe that greater European involvement, greater attention to this area, is desirable. Consider the very serious threat posed by the so-called Islamic State or Daesh, which also has oil resources and which has an impressive territorial implementation above it, taking advantage of the weak state structures of the areas where it is located. European involvement is therefore necessary, with the difficulties that this has for Europe and without forgetting respect for human rights and our principles. I understand it's a difficult problem. We need intense dialogue, not only with Arab countries, but also with their organizations. I'm thinking about the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council.

The most important question we need to answer is how we can respond to this challenge and contribute to political stability in the countries of the Middle East and North Africa. Such an answer is not easy, but it is of great interest to us. Unfortunately, I believe that air and possible ground operations against the extremist group Islamic State should be carried out. But change has to come from within. Of course, I agree with colleagues who said: A solution must be found on the Palestinian issue. European countries should also improve cooperation with the collection and exchange of information with each other and with some of the governments of that region. Religious communities should be encouraged to cooperate with each other. A good example is those 800 Christian volunteers who joined the Shiite militia two days ago to take part in the action to liberate the Iraqi city of Mosul from Islamic State. The primary responsibility in the fight against fundamentalism should be on Muslim communities, and especially their distinction from the abuse of religion by terrorists.

On the one hand, this is the huge migrant wave that is flooding the European continent, threatening to destroy the economies of European countries and permanently change our continent demographically and culturally, religiously and every continent, and in a direction with which I disagree. On the other hand, statelessness in the region has become a boon for the development and rise of extreme extremist Salafist Islamist organizations such as al-Shabab, Boko Haram, al-Qaeda, Islamic State, etc.  They are all at war against us, against our traditions, customs, culture and values. They want to replace them with a caliphate. Today, they cut heads not just in Iraq and Syria, but in Lyon, France. It is high time we looked at this threat responsibly.

This is a completely new challenge.  On the basis of this very general observation, I would like to stress three points. The first is to remind all our colleagues that we are not facing a one-off crisis. We are facing a structural crisis, I would say tectonic, which is affecting all these societies in the Near and Middle East. The security dimension is only the most spectacular part of these sociological, economic and institutional changes. This phenomenon will last for years, perhaps even decades, and we must act and be prepared to act accordingly.  Second point, in this type of movement, it is illusory, unfortunately, to hope for developments that are spontaneously virtuous. This is a bit of a flaw in the reading of the Arab Spring, which was just one episode of these profound changes. Egypt will not become Sweden overnight. Therefore, we must also, again, not abdicate our values, absolutely not, or our norms, but we must prioritize our priorities, as well as the way we value the local interlocutors with whom we have to deal.  Thirdly, we must also recognize that our means of action are relatively limited, especially if we act in scattered order. None of our states alone are in a position to have a decisive impact on the changes in this region. So we have to act collectively, because it will encourage the countries of the region to act collectively, too.

Deputy Mayor Kobani Enver Muslim pointed out that winter is harsh in Kobani and time is short. The bravery of Kurds fighting Islamist terror is admirable, whether they are Syrian or Iraqi Kurds. I bow to the bravery of the Kurds. By redoing Kobani and pushing OUT ISIS, they have given the world a challenge – we need help, not just humanitarian aid.  Many countries have heard the Kurds. For example, my country, the Czech Republic, donated 500 tons of ammunition to the Iraqi Kurds last fall. The Allies helped the Syrian Kurds open the offensive by bombing ISIS positions. Of course, participants in the Brussels Kurdish National Congress welcomed such assistance, but I also heard urgent calls for a united military intervention against ISIS. That is why I would like to appeal to our strong ally in NATO, Turkey.

Rising tensions in the region are delaying the economic and social development of the peoples of the region and creating massive waves of refugees, which are now flooding Greece and Italy. Following the terrorist attacks in January 2015 in Paris, the fight against jihadists must be effective and based in the long term on supporting the democracy and economic development of countries. At the same time, however, the European Union must isolate those countries that support the jihadists in Syria, Egypt and Libya. During the recent election campaign in Turkey, the opposition revealed Turkey's co-operation with the jihadists in Syria.

That's why I think we need to find an answer, a comprehensive answer for the Mediterranean, the Middle East, the countries of North Africa, and I think the European Union can use its credibility today and maybe launch a new comprehensive initiative because, I'm afraid, whatever our priorities (relations with Turkey, relations with Israel and Palestine, relations with countries that are good examples: Tunisia, Lebanon or Jordan, relations with Egypt) , that individual things will still matter to us, but we may not be able to solve the whole problem.

All this has happened because until now the European Union has pursued a policy that did not serve its interests but was identified with the policy of the United States. So we need to change policy. We must demand that the governments of the countries govern in a democratic manner; We must also prevent the freedom of movement of terrorists and European citizens fighting on their side, and finally we must stem the flow of illegal immigrants.

Secondly, I would also like to ask you to pass on my gratitude to the previous Chair, Mrs Lunacek, as she has rightly clarified that the duties and responsibilities of our High Representative include raising her voice if it is necessary. One can disagree about the content, but the fact that she has to raise her voice is, I think, clear and should not be challenged in any way. Coming back to the debate, I would like warmly to thank you for an extremely constructive debate on the Middle East and North African region (MENA), a region that is most urgently crying out for the attention of the European Union and the whole international community. Despite accelerated transformations after the Arab upheavals in 2011, political, economic and social dynamics in the region prove that democratic transformation can only come after the consolidation of stability, a genuine conditio sine qua non for democratisation. As has been stated, instability has, sadly, become a common feature of the MENA region. Therefore the EU needs to work side by side with our partners to help in this process of change. We must therefore jointly address such a security challenge. By the way, I see Mr Gahler is no longer here but, as he has raised this issue twice today, I would like to clarify – concerning the idea of having a kind of border assistance management on the Tunisian side of the Libyan border – that this is something we will take into account and reflect on. But it also depends, of course, on the agreement of the host country. But quite honestly, I do not believe we have any choice, as friends, partners and neighbours. With a series of common threats ahead of us, we need to seek overlapping areas of consensus, forging an ever stronger link between the EU and the Arab and Muslim worlds, as well as others in the region. We can say without contradiction that we face regional challenges and that such challenges call for regional solutions and these solutions need to be carried out by, and with, regional actors. Bilaterally we have, of course, to express respect for diversity. Diversity is the core feature of our European history and it is our strength, but we should also show respect for diversity when we look outside our borders. We need to understand diversity and complexity. All this should be done in a comprehensive manner and not just with a focus on the hard security issue. Together with our partners in the region, we must jointly address the links between security and development, involving civil society in our cultural dialogue and fully respecting human rights standards with a view to widely tackling all horizontal issues, from migration to economic integration. We need to work in both bilateral and regional frameworks across the region. Everyone has a responsibility to contribute and everyone should be given a chance – Muslim, Christian, Jew or non—believer, Sunni or Shia, Arab or Kurd. Only inclusive democracies can navigate such tough times. Finally, let me reiterate that it is the common understanding of the High Representative, myself and all the other members of the Commission that, when it comes to our neighbourhood – in particular in the Mediterranean – we should be in the driving seat to resolve the problems; we should be there and take care of the situation. Of course we need some allies there, but it should be clear that it is our immediate interest and we should, once again, be the ones who are pushing hopefully sustainable resolutions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 359, "date": "2015-07-08.json", "name": "Vincent Peillon", "mepid": "28166", "text": "   Rapporteur. Mr President, anyone who might think that we can lose interest in our South is wrong. The problem of stability in the South is also the problem of stability at home, and as we have addressed it, the problem of economic, social, human and democratic development in the South will obviously have repercussions in Europe. Those who dream of making the European Union a fortress will be denied by history. It has not been like this in the past, it is not like that in the present, it will not be like that in the future. So we have, in our own interest to care about the South.  In these times of crisis in Europe with the Greek question, with the Council on Migrants, there is still an element of optimism in the work we have done, because we have avoided a number of banalities or repetitions. We have tried to build together, and I thank the various shadow rapporteurs again, for a common strategic vision. Of course, Europe can blame itself for things, but the instability of the Middle East and North Africa region is not Europe's sole responsibility. And Europe is expected.  I have heard some say that the European Union must have its own policy, but they are the same people who oppose a common foreign and security policy. The solution is that there is more Europe and that we accept a common foreign policy. This is not yet quite the case and it is clear that in this area too, a number of European states are playing their own partition. There is no common foreign policy without a common security policy.  We have developed this report in accordance with our principles and taking into account the multiplicity of factors we have mentioned. That is why we must support the initiatives of the High Representative and the Commission. First, more generosity towards migrants. What has been done is insufficient. President Juncker reiterated this this morning. He is right: we will not get away with it. Secondly, of course, we need more political initiatives and therefore more coherence between us.

I refer to specific examples: the Chaldean Catholic Church in northern Iraq, or the Jesuit Refugee Service in Syria, are currently responsible for the day-to-day care of hundreds of thousands of refugees. This is mostly done from own resources and international church donations.  Churches run proven projects and directly reach those most in need. However, the current EU aid procedure does not consider local churches to be partners and hinders their direct participation in European aid projects.

Coupled with the radicalization generated by the current world economic and financial crisis, the number of anti-Semitic manifestations in Western Europe has increased and the official EU positions on the Arab-Israeli conflict got tougher in consequence. The reality is much more complex: the Middle East and North Africa have become the object of a border-breaking process: Libya, Syria, Iraq and Yemen have now, for all practical reasons, fluctuating borders, nobody knowing how they will look in the future.  The attempts of ISIL – a product of an intra-Muslim bitter conflict – of filling the vacuum thus created is already contributing to the radicalisation of the EU Muslim communities, displacing the old Arab-Israeli conflict as the number one cause of it.

I call therefore in my report for us to go back to basics, to reinforce the creation of an area of prosperity, stability and good neighbourliness. We are facing new challenges in our neighbourhood: the crisis in Ukraine, developments in the southern and eastern neighbourhood, migration, terrorism, energy security. In a situation like that, the EU needs to be able to react promptly to changing realities. More than ever, we need a politically- driven neighbourhood policy. The EU needs to show leadership and vision. We need to be aware of the diversity of our neighbourhood but, at the same time, keep the single policy framework. It is understandable that countries in our neighbourhood have different ambitions and expectations. We need to be ready to differentiate between the partners but expect results in the shape of reforms from those who show a clear interest in closer relations with the EU. Faced with numerous crises, we need to use our foreign policy instruments in a more flexible way. We should be able to mobilise sufficient resources through our financing instruments. I call, therefore, for this policy review to be reflected in the mid-term review of the external financing instruments. More importantly, our know-how may often be more important than money. We need to look at the possibility of using it more efficiently in processes of state-building, transformation, democratisation or conflict resolution. Support for democracy, human rights and the rule of law needs to stay at the heart of the reviewed policy. We need to strengthen partnership with the societies in neighbourhood countries and promote the values which are at the core of the Union. The reviewed policy needs to include numerous aspects of security. Therefore, I propose including support for capacity-building and state structures able to deal with the security threats in countries affected. We also need to strengthen our partners economically. The EU is the model for economic development but also provides the opportunities for neighbouring countries to broaden their markets. Therefore, we have to be open to closer economic integration with our neighbourhood partners. The EU is a successful project of regional integration and as such should be at the forefront of supporting regional cooperation. We have a great deal of experience which can help our neighbours to work and come closer together. I support strengthening the platforms for such cooperation like the Eastern Partnership and the Union for the Mediterranean, but also cooperation at the lower level of local and regional authorities.

We have just come to the end of our public consultation on the ENP review based on the joint communication we published in March. The Vice-President/High Representative, myself and our teams have held consultations with Member States, national parliaments, partner countries, civil society, social partners, local and regional government, businesses, think tanks and academia. It is not often that Europe’s foreign policy is opened up to such a widespread debate. Of course, consultation, views and advice from Parliament have been a key part of this process, and I have greatly appreciated the opportunity for me and also my officials to meet you on several occasions to share information and ideas. In the consultation there has been a great consensus that events in the eastern neighbourhood and in the southern Mediterranean demand a new approach to the ENP. We need to rethink our approach and put our partnership on a new footing. Your own reflections have underlined the need for greater differentiation in the way we work with partners. This is a principle that has found a positive echo among our partners and with Member States. We need to find the right formula for each of our partners in a way that serves our own interests and theirs. It is clearer now even than it was at the start of the review that we need to work closely with our neighbours on common challenges such as migration, terrorism, extremism and energy security. This year, 2015, has given us ample proof that this partnership cannot be a one-way street but must be one based on mutual interests and need. Some of these partners are seeking a close integration with us and some do not currently have this aspiration. This is the reality to which we must adapt our policy. We need to identify how we can show our relevance to this diverse range of partners while at the same time remaining true to our fundamentals. Our aim is a prosperous stable neighbourhood. We will continue to support democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and efficient and accountable public institutions as essential ingredients for the neighbourhood we want to see. When I visit our partner countries I make a point of ensuring that I visit civil society organisations. I believe that they play an essential role both in ensuring accountability and the fair development of their societies and in providing vital advice to the European Union. Where we have successful cooperation in place we should pursue it, but we will aim to be more responsive and more flexible in how we can support those wrestling with painful reforms. We will work harder to make sure that our support is coordinated so that each country can draw maximum benefit from the help on offer from the EU and its Member States. Where partner countries want a more focused agenda of cooperation, we should be ready to offer this. I believe there are some key areas that are emerging as the natural focus for some of our partners: economic growth and decent job opportunities, particularly for the young; promoting business links in targeted sectors; circular migration that offers opportunity without draining talent permanently away from home, alongside the continuing efforts to tackle the challenges of irregular migration. We must do all we can to make sure that all our foreign policy and security tools are brought together to help resolve conflict and develop the resilience of our partners. Where we can, we must reach out for partners beyond the neighbourhood who share the EU’s interest in stability and development.

It is a report that examines the limits of the European Neighbourhood Policy, the one we have at our disposal today, and also proposes a vision of what the European Neighbourhood Policy should be. And I think here is our main problem - we need a strategic vision of the Union's relationship with both the southern and eastern neighbourhoods. Both face exceptional challenges in economic, political, security terms and, in order to be able to respond to these challenges, the Neighbourhood Policy must be strategic, focused, flexible, coherent and have a clear political direction.  In particular, I believe that we need to have very good coordination between our foreign and security policy and the neighbourhood policy, respectively. We need, in other words, a fine calibration of the principles of differentiation and more for more, respectively. Our partners who want an advanced level of engagement with the Union and who are working on reforms – like Moldova – must be rewarded. The prospect of becoming a member of the Union is the most important catalyst for reforms. We must not forget this.  On the other hand, supportfordemocracy, the rule of law and good governance must be the core of the revised European policy. Having a vision of the European Neighbourhood Policy is not enough.

It is clear that we need to rethink our policy. Looking at the security dimension today, conflicts are a reality to both the east and the south. So far we have decoupled the security issue from everything else, but security – even if outside the remit of the ENP – has an impact on the building of a well-functioning state and associated reforms. We need closer coordination between the ENP, the CFCP, the CSDP and development policy. The EU needs an approach which mobilises all available instruments and resources in a coherent way. On the issue of ambitions and membership perspectives, countries to the east have made radically different choices on their relations with the EU. We have to acknowledge this important change, and this can only mean one thing: we need to do more for those which have real and tangible European ambitions and have decided on the European path. This report also establishes a strong position on the false dilemma between values and interests. Democracy, the rule of law and human rights are in the interest of neighbouring societies as much as our own in terms of stability, security and prosperity. The social, labour and gender dimensions of the ENP have a crucial role to play in this regard. Let me conclude by thanking the rapporteur and colleagues.

The essential priority of our neighbourhood policy must be to strengthen the independence and national character of the states that originated in eastern Europe after the break-up of the Soviet Union. Of course, someone will say that this is one of the two main and not the only direction of the neighbourhood policy, but a policy that cannot select and prioritise is not a policy at all. We have a lot of work to do not only in the political sphere; strengthening Ukraine's independence is also a problem of the revival of its culture, strengthening Georgia's independence is a problem of the rule of law, not to mention Belarus, where there is a struggle for the national language at all.

I really enjoyed working as co-shadow from the ALDE Group. As a result, we  now have serious input from Parliament into the review process to be finalised by the Commission and the External Action Service. The European Union’s neighbourhood today is more complex, challenging and fragmented than ever. It would not be fair to blame the Neighbourhood Policy for all this. The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) was the right and timely response after the EU enlargement and accomplished a lot, in Eastern Europe in particular. Equally, we need a right and solid response at this stage. With all the positive things that I have to say regarding our joint work on the report, I must say, however, that I had wished for a more clear conceptual split into two dimensions of the European Neighbourhood Policy – the Eastern Partnership and the Southern Neighbourhood. I remain convinced that these two dimensions should be separated and allowed to develop in their own distinct direction and with no rivalry whatsoever. This split is dictated by reality on the ground and the processes that take place. Nevertheless, when it comes to the main principles of our new neighbourhood policy and our report, I believe that the ENP has to be ambitious, proactive and policy-driven in the first place. Anything else would be seen as the EU’s withdrawal, and this area would be used as a playing field for third countries, the neighbours of our neighbours right on our doorstep – the doorstep where our security, as well as insecurity, is placed. As we all agree, the differentiation principle is becoming key in the ENP. For countries in conflict, the EU should focus on conflict resolution, humanitarian work, migration and refugee challenges. The second group of our neighbours is those which currently have less interest in closer relations or in making long-term reforms. Here I believe the EU should place greater emphasis on better governance and building sustainable, democratic and stable countries. The third group of our partners are those seeking an advanced level of engagement with the EU. These are Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, our associated members. It is clear that they are far from ready for membership today and that they need to focus very seriously on implementation of the Association Agreements. We cannot deny their membership perspective in the long term. The Association Agreements are clearly not the final step in relations between the EU and these advanced neighbours.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has In its discussion paper on the reorientation of the Neighbourhood Policy, the Commission has raised the right questions, such as those about taking into account the social conditions and interests of the partner countries or the involvement of the neighbours of their neighbours. In her paper, it also indirectly states the failure of the previous concept of EU policy in the immediate vicinity – in both directions, south and east. Undoubtedly a piece of realpolitik in the question, but before its conclusive answer, the AFET Committee, contrary to the rapporteur's starting point, has ducked away in Mr Kukan's working document, as if the majority of the committee did not see the failure of the Neighbourhood Policy so far or was insufficient and wanted to remain in the beloved routine of standard reports and debates. I am in favour of linking the concrete social conditions of the partners to the developments there, which are accompanied by enormous social and cultural challenges. Accompanied by national, ethnic, religious and ideological contradictions, serious social problems, unemployment and poverty, and the significant exodus of qualified people from neighbouring countries. The continuing widespread corruption that is eating up the economic and social coexistence of states and only further erodes people's last confidence in state structures, as well as other human rights violations, require the fundamental change in the strategy of the European Neighbourhood Policy. One example is the situation in and around Ukraine in the east, the frozen conflicts in Transnistria, Abkhazia and Nagorno-Karabakh, for example. This, however, eliminates the very need for policy standards and their conditionality, as the report mantraically continues. I am also in favour of the approach of balancing interests with the countries of the neighbourhood as the basis of the ENP and of the involvement of their neighbours. This, in turn, would take us back to the international standards of cooperation agreed in the Helsinki Final Act, in their complexity of the political, economic, cultural and human rights dimension. In response to your questions in the consultation, Commissioner, I believe that we should also resolutely move towards a CSCE or OSCE 2.0 within the framework of the ENP, and make constructive and mutually acceptable proposals for this.

I personally enjoyed our work immensely and I thank you for that, Mr Kukan, together with the shadow rapporteurs. I rarely enjoy the luxury of two-and-a-half minutes’ leisurely time, but nevertheless I want to concentrate on one aspect which unfortunately was left out of the report. I would like to try to convince those who are still with me on the merits of it. We are all supportive of differentiation, flexibility, efficacy and coherence in our policies towards our neighbours. This is natural for us as well. We offer our full support for all measures that could strengthen our common policies. However, the valued principle of ‘more for more’ squares badly with conditionality and coherence once we observe that some of our neighbours happen to backtrack on development towards democracy. What are the options that we are left with if one of the neighbouring countries happens to imprison some political opponents or threaten them with the death penalty? As much as we like soft power – and its best expression is ‘more for more’, and we agree on that – unless we are able to say that we are going to offer less for less if backtracking takes place, then our policies are not going to be highly coherent. This is very important because our neighbourhood policies, as the report itself shows, have produced mixed results at best in the last couple of years. The failed state of Libya and the less-than-half success of the Eastern Partnership show that the new challenges in our immediate environment need new responses. These new responses are enumerated in the report and we offer support for all those measures.

With a cost of EUR 15.4 billion, might I respectfully suggest that, rather than looking outwards – and bearing in mind the current situation in Greece, which we have all heard about with vested interest today in Parliament – instead, the European Union would do better to put its own house in order first before seeking to expand its tentacles further.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 375, "date": "2015-07-08.json", "name": "Andrej Plenković (PPE).", "mepid": "112755", "text": "   – Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner Johannes, first of all thank you for your introductory presentation and for presenting the neighbourhood policy, the reform you are making, I would say, all this year.

I would like to thank my friend and colleague Eduardo Kukan for his dedicated work in drafting this report, which is the main document by which we, Parliament, contribute to your consultation process and the neighbourhood policy review you are doing and which I hope will be completed this autumn.  What seems crucial to me, and what we can say we have learned a kind of lessons in the past 10-15 years, is an individual approach to each of the countries involved in the European Union's neighbourhood policy. There are very specific crises that are affecting both east and mediterranean today. With regard to the Eastern Partnership, it seems to me that the differentiation is very clear. We must support the ambition of those countries that want towards the European Union and understand that other countries have not made this choice at the moment. But that doesn't mean we don't need to make available our instruments, contractual or financial, to improve those relationships and trust.  When it comes to the southern neighbourhood, I am very inclined to try, despite difficult circumstances, to reactivate in a certain way the Union for the Mediterranean, which was one quality and good idea, but in terms of the stalemate of the Middle East peace process or the new crisis, it is not allowed to develop.

In this debate, we are saying that we must not only continue trying to extinguish the flames, but we must also be better at stopping the fire from starting in the first place. It is true to say that, in the past, Europe has too often made the assumption that there would be steady, if sometimes slow, trends towards modernisation, reform and democratic development in our neighbourhood. But what we have seen, whether in Ukraine or in the stalled Arab uprisings, are sudden shocks and reverses which require Europe’s neighbourhood policy to have a much greater emphasis on and capacity for fast—moving political intervention and diplomacy. We also recognise that five of the six eastern partners are now confronted with unresolved or frozen conflicts, which require such intervention too. I support some of the principles emerging from the review. For countries which themselves choose to come closer to the EU – Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Tunisia and Morocco – yes, let us intensify our relations in a more differentiated approach, recognising the challenges that they still face. We say we want more people-to-people contact, more public diplomacy and more civil society dialogue. Frankly, we also need a sea change to massively increase this element of the policy compared to the past. ‘More for more’ is a good policy which should be maintained, but let us recognise that the incentives which we offered were insufficient. And, as we have just heard, the revised policy must also address the challenge of ‘less for less’. We need to be self-aware when we say at the same time that we want more partnership and local ownership but also that we want a better, more focused, defence of European interests and values. But I do have some fears that the journey from Vilnius to Riga means that this review is actually cover for reducing the ambition behind our European Neighbourhood Policy, and that so-called enlargement fatigue means there is a retrenchment of membership prospects for the countries in our neighbourhood. Both of these dangers must be resisted. So often I hear colleagues in this Chamber advocate a strong European common foreign and security policy, with Europe as a global player. The truth is that there can never be true respect for Europe’s global role if we cannot play a more dynamic and effective role in dealing with the problems of our very own neighbourhood. That is an argument for a more ambitious neighbourhood policy. Commissioner, you will have our support if this is the choice you make. Finally, we have let down those brave protesters on the Maidan.

The Russians are also actively playing into conflicts in the case of Georgia and Moldova, where they are either an active party or pursue policies that they use for their own political purposes. And in the South, we're dealing with the conflict in Syria and the ISIS offensive -- a barbaric organization that's growing in territory.

We have a common European security policy subordinate to the policies of the United States and NATO, and yes, there is talk of destabilization in our vicinity, but we do not come to our responsibility.

Neighbours, Algeria and Tunisia, must be counted on to support a national dialogue and also to continue to support the United Nations Special Envoy. Syria: we play gods again. We destabilize the country and contribute to the emergence of the largest terrorist group that threatens not only the entire region, but also us: the Daesh, which occupies parts of Syria and parts of Iraq. It is time to work with the Syrian government and in regional key. We must listen to Mr de Mistura and put pressure on our allies, those we were talking about earlier, Saudi Arabia or Turkey, unfortunately, too lax with these terrorists. You can't take down any terrorist groups just with bombings.

Because Morocco is the main recipient of funds from the European Neighbourhood Policy of the European Union, but instead there is no talk of the occupation of Western Sahara.

I believe that this is one thing on which as Europeans we must do absolutely self-criticism. I believe that the revision of The European Neighbourhood Policy is crucial. We must see all these things. We are obviously concerned, for example, that we do not leave abandoned all those young people who for so many months and even years have been on the street. I am particularly concerned that in Egypt there will be a regression of what had been a democratic aspiration, a certain return of a totalitarian regime, and that we are not able to react to that, that we settle down and that we do not face it.

Because in it you can find, Commissioner, as Mrs Mogherini too, answers to the questions they raised in the communication or questionnaire they launched a few months ago with a view to updating the neighbourhood policy. I believe that an ambitious neighbourhood policy, understood as a long- and medium-term strategic commitment, is needed, not mere crisis management; a realistic neighbourhood policy, differentiated by country, in dialogue with them, not imposed. In this regard, for example, I hold the recent meeting in Barcelona , although I remember in April , of the Foreign Ministers of the countries of the southern neighbourhood with the countries of the European Union. The unfortunate thing is that it took seven years. We also need a neighbourhood policy that takes into account the interests of the parties involved, their needs, without forgetting, of course, neither our values nor, logically, our interests. We are at a pivotal moment in our neighborhood. It has already been said: in both the east and the south we have very complex scenarios. We need to be active, have sufficient tools and means, dialogue, I insist, with neighbouring countries, and help them often at the institutional level, because their structures, usually their institutional or political structures, are weak or insufficient. I think we have to have a non-purely defensive view of the neighborhood. We are interdependent, their safety and prosperity is also ours. Many of these countries have a young population and abound in resources, also energy. We need them. And, therefore, I am in favour of a positive view of the neighborhood as well. We cannot get carried away by pessimism or the serious problems that now affect these neighbouring regions. Finally, we must strengthen the institutions we have endowed ourselves with. I am referring to the Union for the Mediterranean, the Eastern Partnership and other regional and subregional structures.

The most important thing is that this resolution confirms that EU policy should benefit the peoples of our neighbouring countries and not the political elite there. Nor should it be motivated by self-interest, such as stopping refugees. We are demanding reforms of the rule of law and guarantees for human rights for the simple reason that the people are better off in a just and well-governed country. This is even a duty for the countries of Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova, with which we have signed association agreements. These agreements go beyond just trading. They also have an important political component. Some politicians argue that the neighbourhood policy should only be a geopolitical tool. They want to keep a hand in the face of bad regimes and look away when fundamental rights are violated. They are not so strict with demanding agreed reforms. The geopolitical goal of stability in a troubled region, combating terrorism or reducing Russian influence justifies the means in this view, namely turning a blind eye to abuses such as selective justice, nepotism or human rights violations. A credible neighbourhood policy requires a political vision that is not motivated solely by geopolitics and is not merely based on spheres of influence. Take Ukraine, a country that deserves our full support and where the people have also expressed their desire to reform by EU standards. In these difficult times for the country, it is important that the European Union stands ready to help. I am convinced that this is not necessarily the best thing to do with huge sums of money, with muscle language towards Russia or with unrealistic promises of eu or NATO membership. The best thing Europe can do is to lecture the government in Kiev, ensure that agreements are made, and finally get through the reforms that the country so desperately needs and which the Ukrainian people also crave. The new policy must therefore be ambitious.

To the east and south of Europe there is a complete disintegration of countries, as typical examples of this are Libya, Egypt, Syria, Iraq. There, new dividing lines are created when it comes to values. The Christian values of European nations, or, say, European values, are opposed by the increasingly aggressive and force-gaining radical Salafist Islamism. The huge migrant wave that floods Greece, Spain, Italy and Bulgaria cannot be missed. This wave of illegal immigrants will hamper economic prosperity and threaten the stability and security of Member States.

Because a neighbor who looks at the other only from the perspective of his own interest cannot be a good neighbor.  As you would expect, this report advocates strengthening the association between the European Union's neighbourhood policy and the common foreign and security policy and the common security and defence policy. The perspective of this policy is increasingly militaristic intervention. Interestingly, and I quote: \"in the name of a more active role in the peaceful resolution of ongoing conflicts\". What it cannot fail to joke about, were it not for the European Union's own military intervention, and the unmanageable interventions of the European Union, the very cause of so many ongoing conflicts. Or were it not the countries of the European Union that provided war material and support and funding to the so-called Free Syrian Army, when in this Parliament we remember saying in hysteria that everything should be done, everything, to end Assad? Exactly, it was with this support that a monster was created today known as Islamic State, a terrorist threat to these countries, but also to the countries of the European Union. Or was it not also the precious help of the European Union to the Libyan people to end the regime, through armed external intervention, which ended not only the lives of many Libyans, but also the stability of the country, which created a non-state dominated by lawless mercenaries, chaos and more atrocious violence?

First of all, I would also like to thank my group colleague and friend Eduard Kukan very warmly for this outstanding report. Like many of the previous speakers, I believe that the European Union's neighbourhood policy does not yet meet the ambitious ambition of Article 8 of the Treaty. At the same time, the problems at the borders of the European Union show how right and at the same time important it remains here to continue to work towards a good and, above all, peaceful neighbourhood. In order to achieve the ambitious objectives of Article 8, I believe that three points are of particular importance, and that is what the report explicitly mentions.  Firstly, the European Union's immediate neighbourhood must remain a strategic focus of the European Union's external policy in our own interests.  Secondly, cooperation with civil society in the partner countries of the Neighbourhood Policy is very important, because its representatives and organisations are crucial to the development of democratic and constitutional structures. Thirdly, each country requires a tailor-made approach. Not all the enabial countries of the ENP want or can move closer to the European Union at the same speed and in the same policy areas.

Firstly, I would also like to thank my colleague, Mr Kukan, for his report, but I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that it has recently become apparent that the current European Neighbourhood Policy is not able to respond adequately and quickly to rapidly changing circumstances. That is why a differentiated approach and policies tailored to each country's needs are needed. I believe that attitudes must also be changed. We work with equal partners, and sometimes tone and attitude offend our partners. Sometimes it seems that this programme is only necessary for our partners, but the European Union is doing charity. That is not the case. For example, who is most interested in working together on borders – so that illegal migrants do not enter EU territory and smuggling – do we or they? Ecology cooperation : can we really believe that our strong borders will protect us from the ecological catastrophe that could happen in a neighbouring country?

The Helsinki process, which began 40 years ago, led straight to the fall of Soviet communism and, consequently, to the dismantling of the Iron Curtain and the emergence of today's unity in democratic Europe. It is a strange irony that, on this anniversary of the epoheaval Helsinki Final, Russia, which is one of the founders of the OSCE, cannot celebrate with the other founders. We are experiencing a serious decline in peace, security, dialogue and cooperation, just as the initial, encouraging results of the European Neighbourhood Policy have turned back in the meantime. As a result of the retracting Soviet imperial heritage, eu policy of the Eastern Partnership has been the main cause of a lasting crisis. The situation makes it entirely justified to review our European Neighbourhood Policy with strategic needs.

I believe, Mr President, that this neighbourhood policy cannot be successful if Europe is not united.  I am a little distreated that we have two very, very prepared Commissioners, Mr Hahn and Mrs Mogherini, who deal with these issues and are being negotiated by other European leaders instead in most cases, although obviously what they are doing is not useless either.

We should divide the processes of enlargement and of building neighbourhood relations. They require different activities. Neighbourhood policy tools should develop connections in some key areas, such as energy security, trade development, the common digital revolution, transportation solutions and fighting terrorism. All of those fields are crucial for growth. European neighbourhood instruments will have an impact on economic changes and also on improvements in the states’ functioning based on democratic rules, the rule of law, capacities for transparent administration and the development of civic society. All those measures and cooperation should change the quality of life of many people.

The huge challenges in both the east and south oblige us to rethink neighbourhood policy. A new policy must take into account changes-threats in the region. Unfortunately, not only is there no solution to frozen conflicts, such as Karabakh and Abkhazia, but new ones are being created, such as Crimea and eastern Ukraine.  In addition to conventional military conflicts and terrorism, we also observe hybrid, information and propaganda wars, external financing of anti-European extreme political parties. Such factors exploit our internal weaknesses. The European Union consists of democratic states that do not invest in propaganda but which have the right to respond with the truth.  Countries like Russia use the economy and energy as a tool for pressure and dependency creation, not for mutually beneficial cooperation, as it should be. For example, the proposal to expand Nord Stream and the Turkish and Greek flows under discussion create political disunity within the European Union. The aim is to create a contradiction between Brussels and member states, as well as between member states themselves and between companies and governments.  Unification makes power, not disunity, and \"Divide and Conquer\" should be our primary goal. We must firmly protect the rights of neighbouring countries for an independent choice of regional and international partnerships, strengthen cooperation with state organisations, with the non-governmental sector in this region.  We must use all possible tools to support civil society, such as the new European End of Democracy Fund.

I am here in the European Parliament today and it is a great honour to be together with you. So let's create a European perspective for those governments that want to join the European Union. Let us create and open these opportunities, but let us also create for those who may not want to do so today, because there are people in every country who want to see their country in the European Union.

At the same time it should be based on specific principles such as respect for democracy, the rule of law and human rights.  I want to focus a little on the Union for the Mediterranean, because at the moment, as we said in a previous debate, there is enormous instability. Huge waves of refugees, thousands of refugees, are now coming to Greece and Italy. There should be a very specific policy to deal with this phenomenon. Above all, there must be stability and peace in the region.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Conversely, I would like to thank all those who have so far persevered, expressing that this is indeed an important policy. I can also tell you that, by the end of the public evaluation, we have received some 250 written opinions from all over Europe and from the neighbourhood. This shows, therefore, the great interest that this policy has shown. I fully share the view of all those who say that the neighbourhood policy is part of foreign policy. Foreign policy also always means defending the interests of the country for which foreign policy is made. And we are making foreign policy for the European Union here. We must make our interests very clear. If you look at the current situation – and this has been sufficiently mentioned – then we do indeed have a situation in our neighbourhood that requires us to take care of our interests, that we focus above all on the solution or – and I would like to attach importance to this – on stabilising the situation. Because we have a situation in our neighbourhood where there is a territorial conflict in 11 of our 16 neighbouring countries, that there are a total of around 20 million refugees living in our neighbourhood, and that there is a very weak structure here, which is also very weak in economic terms, that is to say, all things that are suitable for Europe to be and indeed to be an addressee – as we know – , that people are trying to come to Europe from this neighbourhood, or that there are at least very intensive aspirations here for increased cooperation with Europe. That is also okay, and we accept it, and it is even welcomed. Therefore, it is important that we develop the ability and skill to respond individually to our neighbours, that we identify the common denominator of interests and, on the basis of this, finally come up with tailor-made solutions. However, I also think that, in the course of our revision of the Neighbourhood Policy, for example, we may have to work out something much more strongly, which is already in the draft and which has also been reflected in Mr Kukan's report. It is about the regional dimension, about the subregional dimension. This, too, is something that we need to address, that we are pushing for greater cooperation between individual countries in our neighbourhood. The founding idea of the European Union was to ensure, through increased economic cooperation, that there would be no further armed and military conflicts. This european Union's concept of peace has proved its worth, and it is worth transferring it to our neighbours as well. Overall, I believe that we must adopt a pragmatic approach. This does not mean, however, that we are abandoning or disregarding our fundamental values. Here I think that in many countries civil society is our natural partner. That is also why we have increased the corresponding budgets, because we believe that this is actually the way in which our fundamental foundations can be found, especially in those countries where the authorities may not have the attention we would like to see. Finally, I would like to reiterate the idea of stabilisation. In view of what I have described, stabilising the situation must be our primary task. In order to achieve this, we need maximum flexibility in our institutional, regulatory and, ultimately, financial possibilities in order to be able to react accordingly. I mention this because I do not rule out the possibility that I, together with the High Representative and Vice-President, will occasionally come to you in this regard. Because, as I said, flexibility means responding to new challenges and perhaps revising what has already been decided here in order to be able to respond better to new needs and also to act accordingly. Thank you again for your support so far, also for the kind words you have found today for our work. I am sure that this is, so to speak, only an intermediate step for further intensive work on the subject. Even if we finally have a communication, this is nothing more than a celebration of status.

It was the one which portrayed the EU as the military threat to its neighbours and the institution which causes all bad things in the neighbourhood.
