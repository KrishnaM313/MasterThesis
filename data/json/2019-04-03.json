To reiterate, Gibraltar is designated a British overseas territory under British constitutional law, and the term ‘crown colony’ is obsolete. The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) should be ashamed that a majority of their Members today supported the removal of the British MEP, thus allowing the Spanish Government to hijack a report that had no mandate from Parliament to question the sovereignty of Gibraltar.  In two referenda – one in 1967 and another in 2002 – 99% of the people of Gibraltar voted to remain British.

Unfortunately, as you know, the British parliament and government are still grappling with the issue of whether and how to exit the Union as we speak.  The European Council has expressed, among others, the willingness to adapt the political declaration, including in some of the directions consider during the indicative votes at the Commons.  The uncertainties and negative consequences therefore still remain as regards citizens, businesses and public authorities, with an already clear economic impact in terms of level of activity, investment and therefore jobs on both sides of the Channel.  At this very late stage, we are still determined to facilitate the conclusion of the withdrawal agreement. This should however not be to detriment of the solidarity among the Member States as regards, in particular, Ireland. We therefore need to continue to take all possible steps in order to facilitate an orderly withdrawal. This is why in March the European Council considered a UK request for a short extension on the Article 50 period and decided on a two-track approach. Either the withdrawal agreement could not to be approved by 29 March and the extension would run until 12 April, and the UK would have to indicate a way forward, or until 22 May if the withdrawal agreement is approved.  As you know, the withdrawal agreement has not been approved in time so the operating withdrawal date is now 12 April. The UK will have to indicate a way forward, possibly leading to a further extension, which would again required a unanimity decision by the European Council. Should the UK indeed come back with a request for a significant expansion, it should not undermine the operations of the institutions and would therefore have to foresee the holding of the European elections. On the EU side at the least, I am confident that our institutions will be able to complete the consent and conclusion process in a good time and therefore ensure a timely entry into force of the agreement, if the agreement is eventually approved in the House of Commons. The withdrawal agreement continues to be the best solution for both sides, including in terms of protection of citizens’ rights. We are, however, under no illusion that should a no deal be the outcome of the process in London, it will have serious consequences, and we might know it at the last minute. It is therefore all the more necessary to continue our preparation for all outcomes, including a no deal scenario. I’m so far encouraged by the significant progress made at the Union and national level, on preparedness and contingency. At this late stage in their legislative term, we should be pleased with a large number of contingency and preparedness related measures that our institutions have been able to agree, in spite of the heavy workload.  I am confident that with your cooperation it will be possible to complete the adoption of the remaining contingency measures in good time.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 18, "date": "2019-04-03.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "MYMEMORY WARNING: YOU USED ALL AVAILABLE FREE TRANSLATIONS FOR TODAY.

One could say ‘better late than never’. We now need to see if these talks will produce a credible way forward or if they are just another political exercise. We have always said that a closer EU—UK relationship would be beneficial for both sides and that, without touching the Withdrawal Agreement, the political declaration can be swiftly upgraded. So far, it has been Theresa May’s red lines that have made this impossible. We will see, this afternoon or the next day, if she is now really prepared to change these red lines and whether her party is prepared to follow her approach, whoever the next leader is. Talks alone are not a solution until we see a credible and viable positive majority in the House of Commons before 12 April. This means that the threat of no deal has not disappeared. Politicians must act responsibly and do everything possible to avoid this scenario, which would be bad for everyone but a disaster for the UK. However, if this situation was to materialise, our group would work to ensure that the rights of all EU citizens were ringfenced in any circumstances. Citizens cannot pay the price for the failure of their politicians, and, if the UK Parliament continues to fail to deliver a solution, then the British people deserve the right to have their final say. (Applause) This is the reason why a longer extension cannot – and must not – be ruled out. If there is a request in this respect, it will have to be well motivated and the obligation of loyal cooperation should be defined and respected. But, in these circumstances, this request cannot be rejected. UK citizens are, and remain, European citizens, and their voice and their rights are not, and will not go, unheard in this House. But why do we have this deadlock? Why do we have this constant difficulty to deliver a solution? And why are we now seeing in the opinion polls that at an increasing number of people are signing the petition to revoke Article 50? The truth is that Brexit is a tragic mistake. It is a lose—lose solution built on a mountain of lies. Because European citizenship is a concept full of substance, and losing it reduces, rather than increases, sovereignty. So what we can do, if Brexit takes place, is minimise this reduction of rights. But we will never say, in any circumstances, that Brexit is a positive solution. And whatever this Group can do to avoid this outcome, we will do it.

I too am a Conservative, and we were not elected for our charm and our intellect. We are elected because we have the word ‘Conservative’ stamped next to our name. And to those remainers, who have done everything to overturn the result and have now left our party, I say: ‘bye bye’. Power brings responsibility, and we can’t always have everything we want. Conscience and principles are a luxury we can’t always afford and are normally found on the benches opposite. Tough times demand tough choices, and that takes real courage. Regrettably, Mr Corbyn has been the problem and not the solution. He despises us and will do anything to gain power. He won’t argue with me on that. He’s already ditched free movement in an indicative vote, so I’m not holding my breath. But I live in hope. And to my loyal friends, the Unionists, I say: ‘He is not your friend’. The Withdrawal Agreement is still on the table, and I truly believe it is the solution. So Messrs Barnier, Juncker and Tusk: a tweak could have been quite helpful. No more than a paragraph could have perhaps resolved the issue. But now, again, we’re having to ask for your patience so we can find a way forward. Finally, this is not a game. The British people are demanding that we deliver on Brexit, not hold a European election. I think that’s a relief to colleagues in this House.

(Applause) That is the problem. Everybody knows that and, moreover, we are all following every day the voting inside the House of Commons. I can tell you that the sessions of the House of Commons have become more popular in Europe even than the matches in the Premier League. The only difference is – well, I can tell you – it’s always a draw there in the House of Commons, while there are more goals scored, fortunately, I should say, mainly by some players, in the Premier League.  So let’s be very sincere with each other. Let’s hope that these cross-party negotiations that start today give a solution in the coming days. We, from all sides, have said it, we are open to change the political declaration to make that possible – customs union, free trade arrangement, a common market 2.0, maybe something else – we are open to do so. But it has been done before 12 April, and before 12 April, Ms Foster, there has to be a meaningful vote in the House of Commons, so that we have a basis to do so. Secondly, we also need a roadmap so that we can be sure that everything is implemented in the secondary legislation in Britain by and before 22 May. My last remark that I want to make: I know that a number of colleagues are thinking, ‘ah, maybe a long extension’. Don’t be under any illusions. The fact that we should create a situation where Britain is with one foot inside the Union and with one foot outside the Union is a tragedy. It is bad for the European Union. Can you imagine a little bit the new prime minister of Great Britain, Mr Johnson or Mr Gove, both the architects of the Brexit disaster, having the keys in their hands to the future of the European Union? I cannot think about that happening. It will be a disaster for the European Union and it’s not the way to go forward.  Finally I think – and that is what my colleague Mr Gualtieri said – the only advantage of Brexit, Mr Gualtieri, is in fact the following: people can see for themselves now what it means when populists and nationalists take power in a country and make an image of a country and a future that does not exist in that country.

Three times ‘no’ to the Withdrawal Agreement. ‘No’ to a no-deal Brexit. ‘No’ to an outright revocation of Brexit. ‘No’ to a Customs Union. ‘No’ to participation in the single market. ‘No’ to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. ‘No’ to the free circulation of people. The House of Commons increasingly sounds like Monty Python’s Knights of Ni – sorry, Knights of No. You might think that, short of the ability or will to make up their minds on what they want, they will hand over the decision to their constituents on that crucial matter that Brexit is. But there again, the answer is ‘no’. At this stage, the audience is left wondering whether Theresa May will find a shrubbery that will please the Knights of No. One might argue that one’s place in history can be secured by saying ‘no’. So it was in 1940 when the United Kingdom stood up against Nazism. But the fact is that the greatness of the United Kingdom has been primarily built on positive choices, such as when the United Kingdom decided to be a founding member of the multilateral order we know today: the United Nations, NATO, World Trade Organization; that when it decided to join the European Union, when it decided to support the enlargement of the European Union, this is when the UK was at its best. And so it goes for any great achievement of humankind. The British Parliament now has to rise to the challenge and say ‘yes’ to a way forward. Theresa May’s strategy of running down the clock has run its course. She waited until the 11th hour to reach out to the main opposition party. We can only guess whether a majority will be found for a future relationship that will include a customs union. But I’d like to remind everyone that this outcome presupposes the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement. There is no way round this. Neither is there one around the fact that a no-deal Brexit is what will happen by default unless a positive alternative can be adopted. But the choice is not just between orderly and disorderly Brexit. Now that what Brexit means is becoming apparent, one can realise it is a negative-sum game for all players involved. Let it be known that the door remains open for the UK to remain a full member of the EU. With my British Green and European Free Alliance friends, we believe that the heart of Europe is where the United Kingdom belongs. On a daily basis, we see the positive contributions that your country has made to the EU and, likewise, millions of UK citizens see the positive contributions the EU has made to their own country. As Democrats, we believe that making such a momentous choice for the country should be left to the people.

It has been your misfortune almost as much as ours to be dealing with the worst prime minister in British history, someone who stands for nothing and can deliver nothing. When someone is so passive about having sand kicked in their face, it takes a restrained kind of bully to walk off the beach. We know from its dealings with Greece and others that the Commission is not a restrained kind of bully. But you would be making a terrible mistake to assume that Mrs May is representative of the British people. You have men like Tony Blair whispering in your ear about the dream of the British suddenly embracing your project of integration. Do not believe it. We are a different kind of European nation. We have a different history, a different geography and different modern networks too. You should ask why Blair, in his pomp, could not risk a referendum on euro membership. You should ask why Brown could not risk a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty and you should ask why Cameron, when he was forced to hold a referendum on membership, lost it to the greatest number of British people ever to vote for anything. Finally, you should ask yourselves why – after being threatened with no food, no water, no medicines and no jobs – the latest polls show that more British people wish to leave the EU with no deal next Friday than to remain. Once you’ve asked these questions then you should look ahead. You should imagine how Mrs May’s successor would seek to rebuild shattered Tory support before the next general election if we have not left. He or she will be leading a party whose potential support is overwhelmingly formed of leave voters. Do not expect consistency from the Conservatives, by the way. The Tooting Popular Marxist Front will not last. Instead, the answer is obvious, Guy Verhofstadt is right. The successor will seek to rebuild support by making your lives a misery through vetoes and political sabotage, by rejecting every proposed development of your project.

Every time Mrs May gets up to speak, we think that she may say something to resolve the situation. Instead, she just sinks lower into tragedy and farce. Now she’s handing the Brexit hot potato to Jeremy Corbyn, and apparently the European Union will decide whether we take part in the European elections or not. Has the whole Brexit process fiasco been an elaborate conspiracy between Mrs May and the EU, or is it just due to her monumental incompetence? Either way, we have to hand it to you, Mr Juncker and Mr Barnier. You have done what Philip of Spain, what Napoleon, what Kaiser Wilhelm and Hitler couldn’t do: you have brought Britain to its knees, without firing a single shot. But you could not have done any of these things without the connivance of the traitors, quislings and collaborators in the British Parliament and British establishment. As Seneca said, a nation cannot survive treason from within – and treason it is. Mrs May and the Tories planned to betray Brexit from the start. They have betrayed it by means of delaying and impeding, with the intention of finally overturning it altogether and setting aside the decision of the referendum. Many of the 17.4 million people in the UK who voted Leave now believe that their vote is pointless. But Britain is still nominally a democracy, and the vote is the only weapon that ordinary people have. Those 17.4 million people can still vote for Brexit, and they can make a start on 2 May when the UK Independence Party is fielding candidates up and down the country in the English and Welsh local elections. Mr Juncker, if I heard you correctly, you said that there will be no extension to Article 50 beyond 12 April, and if there is no agreement on the withdrawal deal, then we leave by default and go on to WTO terms. I think that’s one of the few things you’ve said I actually agree with. Good: let’s bring it on. But if Britain is forced to take part in the European elections on 23 May, then UKIP will field a full complement of candidates in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. There will be no deals or alliances with opportunist parties and their daily allowance-grabbing candidates. UKIP will stand on the policy of unilateral and unconditional withdrawal. No compromises and no surrender. And UKIP will carry forward that policy into the next general election. UKIP will accept no agreement on any other terms. We stand for a complete and total exit from the European Union. The struggle to set Britain free from the European Union continues. UKIP leads that struggle. Vote UKIP.

Not only is Mrs May ignoring her party and the electorate in trying to force a vassal state deal on Britain, she’s also negotiated her way into enacting the Remain-minded policies of the Labour opposition. Now bearing in mind the attitude of the British people to the EU project to date – and imagine what it would be like after a complete Brexit betrayal – shall I call on you all to do Britain and the EU project a favour?

For 129 days we have had a withdrawal deal on the table and we now have a European Council decision regarding extension until 12 April. So it is dramatically late, but not too late, and there is still a chance to avoid no deal by accident. But that requires the UK to set a workable plan with a clear end result. It is the last chance for Prime Minister May to establish, with the leader of the Labour Party, a common approach, based on what has been lacking so far, which is trust – a common approach that would allow the UK to move forward and avoid no deal. This is crucial because the future of citizens is at stake. All the concerns we see coming out of the House of Commons relate to the Political Declaration, and we are ready to look at different options to accommodate British worries about the future.

But it’s significant that, in the indicative votes that took place in the House of Commons, the one that gained the highest number of votes was the proposal to have a confirmatory referendum putting it back to the people.

The institutions there have not coped successfully with the challenge of addressing how Brexit, once endorsed by the British people, should be defined and then how negotiations about it should be conducted. However, it is illusory to believe that the current fiasco – and worse any diplomatic crash that could result – will impact mostly on the UK alone. The fiasco, and potentially worse, could create deep fissures within the Union itself. These would reinforce existing levels of distrust, not least between east and west. Moreover, further ripple effects could ensue in the same direction, not least about issues of financing, cohesion and freedom of movement. Clearly, the framework provided by Article 50 for withdrawal from the Union is not fit for purpose, as I have argued right from the start of the Brexit talks.

But of course, my focus today will not be on our past but on our future. I believe that we must step up to defend our fundamental values in the European Union, and the most strategic way to fight the forces that challenge those values is to deliver results in the areas of employment, security, migration, climate change, and thus to create hope for the future. So that should be our core mission: the defence of our democratic values and our young people’s dream. There are people that say that idealism is the preserve of the young, and that when we enter into the world of adults, we learn that nothing is black and white and realise that self-interest and cynical trade-off rules the world. I believe that narrative is wrong. My parents took me in as a foster child. They taught about shared responsibility, about respect for every human being, about solidarity, and during both my trade union and political life as an adult, I have had to compromise and make tough decisions in difficult situations such as economic downturns – but also terror attacks. That has not made me forget my values. It has only deepened my belief in the importance of having a moral compass to guide you through these tough times, because if we didn’t let our values steer our decisions, if we didn’t feel that our choices were leading us towards the kind of society we believe in, what would be the point in making decisions at all? The same applies to the European Union. Our Union is based on values. The whole idea of creating a common market and joint responsibility for coal and steel production was to tie our countries and the people closer together. We wanted to fulfil Friedrich Schiller’s sentiments in the Ode to Joy that ‘Alle Menschen werden Brüder’, with equal rights, equal value and which, put to the music of Beethoven, became our common anthem. And now that our Union has grown in size and has grown older as well, we, just like the individual, need to remember our most fundamental values. For what would be the ultimate point of our work, the ultimate point of our Union, if we did not promote the values that we believe in? And this, my friends, may also be the best thing we can do for the world. We are living in a time when the multilateral system is being shaken to its core. The United Kingdom wants to leave our Union. The transatlantic link is being questioned. Meanwhile, China is on the rise, and several economies in South-East Asia and Africa are ready to follow in its footsteps and redraw the entire global economic map. And at the same time, Russia is acting in a revanchist manner, in flagrant contempt of international law. So, now more than ever, it is time to stand up for common principle-based solutions and a world order where might does not come before right. But the EU can only be a strong voice for democracy in the world if all of us Member States stand up for the principles of democracy – also at home. We can only be a credible actor in the Middle East if we fight anti-Semitism and Islamophobia in our own countries. We can only be a force for free media and the rule of law in our neighbourhood if we have a free media and independent courts in our Union. For every democratic principle that is weakened in the EU, the EU’s voice in the world will be equally weakened. (Applause) Therefore the EU must stand up for our fundamental values, both externally in our world but also, of course, internally in our Union. And this is more than about our place in the world. This is about the whole future of our cooperation. If the principles contained in our most fundamental contracts are not adhered to, how are we then to trust other agreements on the single market, on free movement – everything that does so much for our prosperity? If our promises to each other are to be trusted, if our cooperation and our economy are to continue to grow, then pacta sunt servanda must apply to the most fundamental contracts of all. And therefore, Sweden will work to defend the EU’s core values in the budget negotiations, in our support of the Commission’s work, and my government will propose to the Swedish Parliament that Sweden will join the European Public Prosecutor’s Office to contribute in the fight against corruption and the embezzlement of EU funds. (Applause) We support also the Belgian proposal, or something similar, to establish an EU mechanism for the peer review of adherence to the rule of law. And I will devote my efforts in Europe to defending the values that I have borne since my childhood: of the equal value of all people and of solidarity. I will give my all, side by side with so many of you, to refute and fight the extremist forces who deny these values and those forces that are doing everything they can to tear apart the Union that defends them. And of course, EU is a compromise: probably one of the most successful compromises in world history. But there can be no compromising on human dignity. There is no reasonable level of anti-Semitism, no acceptable level of racism, no tolerable level of misogyny or homophobia. Never will we compromise on these values. (Applause) The defence of democracy is also the defence of young people’s dreams. Is there anything more dangerous to society than its young people ceasing to dream? It is in societies that have lost hope that both political and religious extremism can grow the strongest, and this is not only crucial in the fight against extremism, but also in the work to uphold broad, popular support for our Union. I believe it is crucial for all of us in the current Brexit negotiations, for example, that the UK and the EU have the ability to move on as friends and create a close, strong and long-term relationship. But the only way for the EU to avoid similar exit ordeals in the future is to constantly prove its worth to people’s everyday lives and to their dreams for the future. And that is why the EU should not only benefit the market but, preferably, benefit its people. It is also why the work for a larger market can also be the work for a stronger democracy – if that can create jobs and hope for our young people. Over the past two years, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and I have co-chaired a Global Commission on the future of work for the International Labour Organisation. And there is no doubt that in the future, work will be more advanced, more automised, more digitised, and that demand for skilled workers will soar. This is good news for the EU. We benefit from a global competition that is based on knowledge rather than lower wages. But we cannot rest on our laurels, because everyone wants to be in the same position. China has long been educating more engineers than the United States, Germany and Japan put together. So in this respect, our European cooperation will have an incredibly important role to play in the creation and sharing of world-leading knowledge and innovation. And there are always many competing interests in budget negotiations; you know that better than most. But my country has learned the very hard way that it is only with strict priorities and a budget that is under control that democracy actually can deliver in the long-term and with stability. And that is why, given all the competing interests, we do not propose a larger budget, but rather the stronger prioritisation of innovation, new jobs and the digital, educational and physical infrastructure required to make them possible. It is our responsibility, for our young people’s dreams, to take advantage of this opportunity. Our solution can never be to lower wages or raise protectionist walls. We should not shut ourselves off from the world. We should lead it. Therefore I am proud also that young people now in Tallinn or in Bratislava can listen to hip hop from Paris or Fado from Lisbon on Spotify from Stockholm. But I also know how hard Spotify had to work to get launched in Europe. Compare that to a start-up company in Silicon Valley. They can launch a product on the US market and reach more than 320 million people immediately. So our only chance of competing with this is to make it just as easy to reach all the citizens in the European Union at the same time. And believe me, anyone who has lived through a dark Nordic winter knows that we can not compete with California when it comes to weather. For generations, people from our continent have travelled across the Atlantic in search of a better life. But the young geniuses and IT geniuses of today and the future should not have to go west, or east for that matter, to realise their dreams. They should be able to do so here in Europe, in a digital market open to everyone. Friends, it is now almost a treat to visit the European Commission website and see that one priority policy area is the European pillar of social rights. Of course, my pride is not diminished when it also says that we launched this work in the Swedish city of Gothenburg. I’m grateful to President Juncker, the Commission, to the European Parliament, to the Member States and the Council for all of our work to create a social pillar and establish 20 key principles that strengthen the social rights of all the citizens of Europe. But no worker will or should thank us, unless these 20 principles also become reality across the EU: until we stand up for collective agreements and fair wages, until we put a stop to rule-breaking and tax fraud, until we secure gender equality and women’s right to a full wage, a career without glass ceilings and the freedom to decide over their own lives. For this very same reason, Sweden will actively promote new free trade agreements, because we know how many jobs these agreements can create. But all these agreements should also be favourable to people as well as to the market. The agreements must respect our environment, our health and the rights of workers. And there is an enormous potential for the European services market if it’s opened up and shaped with concern for social rights. The EU labour market must be defined by all of the positive freedoms: the freedom to study abroad, learn languages, work throughout Europe – but never the freedom to set workers against workers. (Applause) Our common labour market should not crush workers’ dreams; it should fulfil them. I know that, if you are to have hope in the future, you must also feel safe here and now. ISIS and terrorism are dreadful security threats that must be dealt with together, but unfortunately that’s not the only challenge that we have. I recently met the leadership of Europol at their headquarters in The Hague and their virtual command post. Europol has done an amazing job, not least breaking up and arresting paedophile networks. This type of crime – every nation and nation’s police service can see their part, but we can only see the whole and crush it in cooperation with others. A single nation would not – even if it really wanted to, even if it poured in resources – be able to solve that alone. So Europe is borderless for criminals as well. They read up the European laws looking for the weakest national legislation and for the new national markets to enter. That is why Sweden wants to deepen European efforts to fight organised crime as well as cyber threats. We want to strengthen our cooperation on security and defence, increase our ability to implement joint civilian and military crisis management operations, and have a European Union that cooperates with strategic partners and builds security together. I also know that there is a broad agreement in this Parliament and on this continent that the EU must never again lose control in the way it did during the refugee crisis. Chaotic migration affects the confidence of the whole of society and the reception of refugees, but it affects the refugees themselves worst of all. The only ones who benefit are right-wing extremists who are able to use the situation to inflame hatred of migrants. The EU’s free movement of people requires shared external borders and a shared responsibility for orderly, regulated migration, built on three pillars. Firstly, strong cooperation with countries outside the EU, so that fewer people are displaced and more people can have better living conditions, so that new migration crises can be reduced or prevented entirely. Secondly, the control of all external borders, which is now taking place through the strengthening of Frontex, creating greater security and saving lives. Thirdly, the fair distribution of those who arrive and whose grounds for asylum are to be examined, with that work carried out as a shared responsibility by all Member States. It should not be possible to benefit from all of the advantages of the Schengen cooperation and then refuse to share the responsibility for its maintenance. And we have, in this respect, a huge task ahead of us. Sweden will do its best to support the completion of that task, and I’m under no illusion that it will be simple. But if we fail to deliver, the Schengen Agreement will be weakened, and in the long run, so will the entire European Union. So it’s time now to step up for orderly and regulated migration in Europe. It is in the best interest of us all. Dear friends, as Swedes, we’re often asked: ‘Do you know Abba? Do you know Zlatan Ibrahimović?’ Now we’re getting ready for a new question: ‘Do you know Greta Thunberg?’ We’re proud of the demonstrations that she has inspired, which gathered over a million young people all over the world. But one thing we must never forget in their message is the following: it is not up to their generation to solve the climate crisis, it is up to us: all generations, here and now. (Applause) Sweden is ready to be in the lead of that work and show what is possible. We have a climate framework for our society which will lead our efforts to cut emissions quickly and powerfully and achieve net zero emissions by 2045. But it’s us together that must implement the Paris Agreement – without any ifs, without any buts, without maybes – in order to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5°, and as part of this work, the EU needs to adopt a goal of net zero emissions by 2050 at the very latest. This is also a great opportunity for European industry, as the whole world is crying out for new solutions. So this is not only the right thing to do morally, it is the smart thing to do economically, and it is crucial to our survival. To conclude, Mr President, this is what I want to say to you today: idealism is not only the preserve of the young. Our common values have been the basis for the EU’s fantastic history, and they must guide us now, so that we can have an even brighter future. And in these times, when people say that the EU must prove its worth, there is no better task for our Union than defending our democratic values and by delivering on jobs, security, migration and climate change, defending the dreams of our young people. An EU that can deliver this not only gains greater legitimacy but also a stronger voice in our world. It is indeed a difficult task, but that is why it’s so alluring, and that is why it’s so perfect for us.

At the start of next year, we will celebrate 25 years of Sweden taking its rightful place at the heart of our Union. In this time, Sweden has brought so much to the European Union, from its rich culture to its unique social model.  In many ways, a Swedish way of doing things has become both an example and a guide for our future. Sweden is a country that does more than simply talk about European values. It puts them right at the heart of its society through its strong social protection and high—quality education and health care for all, and it is a country that always looks forward. For instance, Sweden was one of the first countries to pass a Climate Act with the explicit goal of being carbon neutral by 2045. It is also well ahead of the rest when it comes to embracing a new digital world. Stockholm is now home to more one billion plus companies, or so—called unicorns, per capita anywhere in the EU and is the most important tech hub of this kind outside Silicon Valley. We can learn from all of this. But, as we look forward, there is another Swedish concept that I believe should be central to the future of our Union. For many Swedes, lagom is a lifestyle and a habit of mind. It is a Swedish philosophy of moderation and balance, of avoiding both excess and extreme. For many, it is the secret of a balanced, sustainable and happy life. As we look to our future, Europe should inspire itself from lagom to find the right balance for all of its Member States and all of its citizens. It means focusing on the things that matter most to Europeans and doing less elsewhere. It means tackling the big issues by being open to compromise and finding balanced solutions to common challenges. In this spirit, I want to commend the Prime Minister and all of Sweden for the way they responded to the migration crisis in 2015. Ever since, it has been leading efforts on a long—term and comprehensive reform of our asylum system so that it offers protection for those who need it. The solution we need must balance solidarity and responsibility. The Commission has put the package of asylum reform on the table, and Europeans now expect their leaders to make real progress. We count on Sweden to continue leading those efforts. Sweden has also been at the forefront of efforts to make our Union more socially fair for all, an issue which is second nature to your country. I want to thank the Prime Minister for his personal leadership on the European Pillar of Social Rights launched by President Juncker in Gothenburg in 2017. It is a shared and future—proof commitment to support a fairer and more equal society across Europe. Once again, it’s about finding the right balance. This is, of course, mainly a national competence, and the EU does not interfere with the crucial role played by the social partners. But there is a lot we can do together and, thanks to the Social Pillar, we already have. We have ensured equal pay for equal work in the same place. In recent months, we have agreed new rules to improve the work—life balance for parents and carers. We have agreed to set up a European Labour Authority to make the labour market fairer and support the 17 million Europeans who work in another Member State. And we are investing in skills to help people get on the job market or find new opportunities in today’s rapidly-changing world of work. When it comes to the future of our Union, there is no more important priority than the fight against climate change. Millions of young Europeans in Europe, and increasingly beyond Europe, are marching. Politicians – at least European politicians – are listening to the young people. They tell us that every year of their lives has been one of the warmest recorded. Indeed, 17 out of 18 of the hottest years on record all occurred in this century, and we see with our own eyes the damage that this is causing. We saw devastating forest fires and hugely costly droughts in Sweden and elsewhere last summer and, just recently, we had another tragic reminder of this in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Sadly, this is not a freak event or a one-off. By 2050, climate change could force more than 10% of the global population to flee their homes. The world needs to respond, and Europe needs to continue leading the way. We did that with the Paris Agreement, which we are implementing at home and helping others to do the same right across the world. For example, the Commission has already proposed to devote a quarter of the EU’s budget to climate—related action as of 2021. But public finance alone will not be enough to meet our ambitious climate and energy targets by 2030. The financial sector needs to play its part in the fight against climate change. This is why we put forward an Action Plan on Sustainable Finance to incentivise private capital to flow towards green projects. We immediately followed up with three legislative proposals, two of which have already been agreed at EU level. But fighting climate change takes more than targets, and it will not stop in 2030. We must look further ahead. This is why the Commission has set a long-term strategy to be climate neutral by 2050. According to our estimates, this would lead to clean technology solutions, boost our GDP by up to two percent, and take off as much as EUR 3 trillion from our energy import bill while ensuring a just and socially-balanced transition for all. It is good for people and it’s good for the economy, and, for me, that is what European leadership looks like in the 21st century. The world expects, and we must deliver. This is why we have focused our proposals for the new Multiannual Financial Framework on areas where European action can have the biggest impact. To respond to the future challenges, the Commission has proposed a modest increase in our long-term budget to an equivalent of 1.11% of the EU 27’s GNI. We hope that Member States will support this approach, which is a minimum to fund our joint European actions. As Sweden, for example, has long called for, we have put forward programmes that are modern, flexible and focused, and we are investing where there is the greatest potential for our future. Funding for research and innovation will be increased by 50%, to reach EUR 100 billion. A new Digital Europe programme, worth EUR 9 billion, will support Europe’s digital transformation and create new opportunities for Swedish tech companies like Spotify or Klarna to flourish, and, as I mentioned, we will ensure that 25% of the budget will support our climate and sustainable development targets. There is no greater return on investment than a clean planet for future generations. Prime Minister, honourable Members, it is only by working together to make our Union stronger that we can collectively tackle the issues which individually we never could. The last 25 years of Swedish membership of the European Union should be our template. It shows that a stronger, more sovereign Europe means a stronger, more sovereign Sweden, and it shows the virtues of showing true responsibility and solidarity. As we look to our future, this should inspire us to help us to find the balance – the lagom – that we need in our Union.

Yes, one of the strongest social welfare systems in the world. Yes, a huge tradition of social compromise, strong trade unions and, from the early days of your democracy, the capacity to strike alliances between different social groups in your society. What you have done during the last decades is also built on this early compromise encompassing both industrial workers, in metropolitan areas especially, and farmers and rural areas, for the value of nature, the value of natural resources, has always been acknowledged in the Swedish debate. That makes you prominent. That puts you in the front row when it comes to the answers today to the challenges to Europe and the challenges to the world – sustainability and also fairness, equality, especially with respect to gender, and acceptance – not only acceptance, but the idea – of the necessity of putting women on an equal footing and granting them full rights in civic life as well as in the labour market.  So you can find the Swedes in the lead in this modern world, and we can also see that from the very issues of our debates today. Greta Thunberg has rightly mentioned, and we have praised, the commitment of the young generation. But there is a direct line to Gothenburg and the summit in 2001, when we saw António Guterres, under the Portuguese Presidency in 2000, coming forward with this grand idea – I would still say grand idea – of the Lisbon Strategy to have a new modern, holistic approach to economic policy. And it was the Swedish Government which, a year later, added sustainability as a crucial element in this discussion. Gothenburg 2001, the Gothenburg of the social pillar and now Greta Thunberg, always leading the progressive discourse.  My neighbour to the right, Ms Maria João Rodrigues, had the pleasure – and we thank you very much for that – of contributing to both Gothenburgs, as an essential player. So this was well done and still makes us proud today.  Nachhaltigkeit, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen, ist das Thema, dem sich meine Fraktion verschrieben hat. Denn wir werden Europa nur dann weiter in einer führenden Position erleben, wenn wir unsere Wirtschaftspolitik auf die Erfordernisse der Umwelt einstellen und wenn wir unsere Umweltpolitik auf die Erfordernisse der Menschen, der Arbeit und des sozialen Zusammenhalts einstellen. Das ist die Politik meiner Fraktion. Von dieser Politik, Herr Vizepräsident der Kommission, möchten wir gerne haben, dass sie die dominante Politik der nächsten fünf Jahre der Europäischen Kommission wird. Deswegen kämpfen wir für das Szenario 1 der Nachhaltigkeit, wenn es darum geht, unsere wirtschaftspolitischen Instrumente zu renovieren, weil wir nur mit einer inklusiven Politik, nur mit einem ganzheitlichen Entwurf das leisten können, wozu Europa aufgerufen ist. Ich danke dem Ministerpräsidenten von Schweden, weil er deutlich gemacht hat, dass Idealismus keine Altersfrage ist, sondern eine Frage des Herzens, unseres Verstandes, unseres Lebensgefühls. Ich habe nur eine Bitte, weil mir das gelegentlich Sorgen macht: Ich weiß um die Stärke unserer nordischen Mitgliedsländer, ich weiß um ihre Kraft, ich weiß um ihre historischen Errungenschaften. Ich habe nur eine Bitte an Stefan Löfven, wenn wir alles das sehen: Seid nicht ungeduldig! Seid nicht ungeduldig mit den anderen Mitgliedstaaten in der Europäischen Union – auch wir, auch alle anderen müssen sich auf eure Standards entwickeln –, und bleibt die großen Internationalisten, die ihr immer wart, weil Europa euch braucht. Europa braucht Schweden, Europa braucht diesen fortschrittlichen Geist aus den nordischen Ländern. Der darf uns nicht den Rücken kehren, auch wenn es manchmal Enttäuschungen gibt. Wir brauchen euren Impuls, wir brauchen eure Kraft. Bleibt die mutigen Internationalisten, bleibt die mutigen Europäer, die ihr immer wart!

You will immediately see the difference between the European Parliament and the Swedish Parliament. In the Swedish Parliament you would never have somebody saying ‘I don’t like Sweden’. You have never had that in the Swedish Parliament. In the European Parliament we have that. Mr Lundgren is a typical example, explaining why he is so bored to be here in Europe and why he is against the European Union. The only thing is his salary: he doesn’t complain about that.  But thank you for your leadership, certainly in the fight against climate change. I want to explore three examples that you have given, to examine with you what is not going well in the European Union. There has to be a reason why you’re saying we want a European migration policy and we don’t have a European migration policy or an agreement on Dublin. I have here the rapporteur, Ms Cecilia Wikström, the rapporteur for the European Parliament. We have an opinion. The Council doesn’t have an opinion and therefore we cannot conclude this reform of this migration package, and especially of Dublin.  The same goes for the other issue. You say ‘the values I will not compromise on’, but the European Council is compromising on values every day. This is not an attack on you, it applies to you and your colleagues. The 28, tomorrow the 27, in the European Union are compromising all the time. We have two Article 7 procedures against two countries, one initiated by the Commission against Poland, the second initiated by the European Parliament against Hungary, but the European Council has never put that point on the agenda for the Council, whereas it is obliged to do so whenever the Commission or Parliament has taken such action. So it’s not a criticism of you, but when you say you will not compromise – no. The European Council – and you are a member of the European Council too – compromises every day on this issue and is not capable of dealing with it; it is closing its eyes. And I’m talking about everybody, about all political families and all political parties …..  And the third example that you have given is Spotify. You know that it is Swedish, I know that it is Swedish, but most people outside think that it is American because a number of years ago the headquarters went from Stockholm to New York. And you have indicated why. It is because we don’t have a digital single market. We have no one regulator, but 27 or 28 different regulators. What Spotify got was problems, obstacles, inside the Union. They had to make 130 agreements with 130 mobile operators before launching the fantastic idea of streaming music, which today is something very normal. In the end they had enough. They said OK, weʼll move our headquarters from Stockholm to New York because there it is far easier. You have one regulator, the FCC. You have three big operators on mobile. They made an agreement and rolled out the fantastic model and there are a world company today. And then they came back to Europe and the other countries to make the same model, working in France, in Germany, in Italy, in Belgium, everywhere in the European Union. It’s a good example: Spotify is the example of what is not going well in the European Union. We don’t have a European Union in digital and the reason is very simple. The reason is that there is no one regulator. The reason is that we have 130 mobile operators. Why do we have 130 mobile mobile operators? It is because, yes, we have ministers of finance here in the European Union who want to keep the money for themselves: spectrum selling – 3G, 4G, tomorrow 5G. So if we really want – and this has to be the conclusion, I think, and Spotify is a good example – to change something, then we need to do a number of important things: stop unanimity; putting values back on the agenda of the European Union; creating and really completing the single market. I have enough of all the documents that are produced on Digital Single Market of the European Union, and the reality is that there is only one European in the 20 big internet platforms worldwide.  Let’s take an example. When Ericsson – you remember that, Prime Minister? – was successful, together with Nokia, it was when there were European standards, GSM for mobile. Then we were successful, and that is what we need. OK, I agree with every priority that you have mentioned, but we also need to be courageous and say that more European cooperation, European strength, is the only way forward to be successful.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 56, "date": "2019-04-03.json", "name": "Dennis de Jong", "mepid": "96748", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. – Mr President, I would like to welcome the Prime Minister of Sweden. I think many of the things you said took me also back to what you said as a reaction to the outcome of the British referendum on Brexit. You said in particular that we need a Europe that works and delivers and focuses on the issues where people expect us to deliver results. That includes, among other things, joint responsibility for refugees and, not least, to create jobs and do it with decent wages and conditions. On behalf of my Group, I couldn’t agree more with you. At the same time, if you look back over these past three years, Europe hasn’t been very successful in these respects. Guy Verhofstadt already referred to the negotiations on the reform of the Dublin system for the responsibility of asylum applications, and it’s not Parliament that’s blocking them – it’s in the Council that we see that no progress is being made. My question to you, Mr Prime Minister, is: what does Sweden do to unblock the situation? If I look at the national legislation in Sweden, I see that you have actually a Swedish act temporarily restricting the possibility to obtain residence permits in Sweden. Is that a helpful way forward to a joint responsibility system for asylum? Parliament is waiting: waiting for you, waiting for the Council. As far as creating jobs with decent wages and conditions is concerned, I read in your statement of government policy of 21 January that the Swedish labour market must be characterised by security and flexibility. Well, we all know how the concept of flexicurity worked out in the EU. I dare say that the rise of the extreme right-wing populism in many EU Member States – unfortunately also in Sweden – can at least be party attributed to this concept. People who are uncertain about their jobs or have to combine various precarious jobs to make a living are easy prey for populism. Unfortunately, the EU doesn’t help very much in this respect. Let’s have a look at the internal market together. For years we have been asking, together with European trade unions, for a social progress protocol. Whenever there is a conflict between the rules of the internal market and social rights, the latter should prevail. And you could ask then: what are the social rights? You yourself mentioned the European social pillar; but in practice the Council made this into purely political commitments. Fortunately, we also have legally-binding instruments like the European Social Charter, the ILO conventions, and it shouldn’t be too difficult to develop a framework to really put all EU legislation to the test. Is it advancing social rights? Is it really contributing to people feeling secure and protected? Such a social progress protocol is more urgent than ever before – also because, and you mentioned this, Mr Prime Minister, workers from various Member States are made to compete with each other. Look at the tedious discussions we are having and the votes we are probably having tomorrow on the so-called mobility package. Mr Prime Minister, what is your detailed vision about creating jobs and doing it with decent wages and conditions at European level? Do you agree that a social progress protocol is indispensable, and what initiatives can we expect? A few words on the militarisation of the European project. Sweden has indeed a longstanding tradition when it comes to the protection and promotion of human rights globally, and I would say Sweden’s international diplomacy in this area used to be famous. These days, however, the Swedish Prime Minister is strongly encouraging the arms build-up in the EU. Does that mean that, instead of relying on multilateralism, instead of relying on your diplomats, also Sweden is now relying more on force and violence? Shouldn’t the question be how we can avoid an endless arms race instead of participating in this project? Finally, I think business and human rights is another area that Sweden could be very active on. I shall be short, because I am running out of time, but the UN is working on a binding instrument, and can we expect some initiatives also from Sweden, given its tradition, to unblock the situation? Because the EU hasn’t done anything yet in that respect.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 57, "date": "2019-04-03.json", "name": "Ska Keller", "mepid": "96734", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Prime Minister for joining the debate on the future of Europe. Prime Minister, I’m very glad that you talked about the need to have a more social Europe. Indeed, I agree with that. I think the next level that we need to put the European Union on is to have a social union, because one of the key promises of the European Foundation has been the promise of prosperity, and we haven’t really been getting very far with that. While some countries and regions have been benefiting a lot from European integration, other countries and regions have benefited less, and we still have a lot of social inequality in Europe. Almost every fourth person in Europe is at risk of poverty or social exclusion, and that includes 25 million children. That’s really a situation that’s not acceptable. The Social Pillar is fantastic, but the thing is we need to make it binding and not just have a nice declaration of things that we should do. We have to do them. We cannot, of course, talk about social justice without talking about climate justice and environmental justice, because it’s always the poorest people who are hit the hardest by the climate crisis, no matter whether it’s inside the European Union locally, or globally. It’s them who are most affected by severe weather events that, for example, destroy their homes and their small businesses. It’s the poor people who live in big cities that will face more and more heat, and this heat will also worsen the air pollution situation. Again, poorer people will be hit by this, while they actually contribute less to CO2 emissions than rich people do. So climate justice needs to go hand in hand with social justice. Just one example and one area where this needs to be fulfilled is the area of mobility. We need to make sure that mobility is climate-friendly, available, affordable and existent. Europe is a rather small continent. You would think it’s possible to have a train network, for example, that connects European cities. Right now, that’s not really working yet. It shouldn’t take more than 20 hours to go by train from Stockholm to Brussels. One of the things that needs to be done in order to have easily accessible and affordable trains, I think, is to make it easier to book cross—border trains. We very much hope that your government will back the proposal by us Greens, which was actually adopted by this plenary in November, to allow open data for train bookings that would allow you to book your train tickets across the border without much difficulty. And if you’ve tried booking your train ticket cross-border, it’s crazily difficult. It shouldn’t be more difficult than booking flights, as is currently the situation. Maybe a sort of Skyscanner for trains is the next European big start—up platform to make it possible to have train rides within Europe. Another important issue, of course, is the Emissions Trading System (ETS) for climate action, and there it’s very good that the Swedish Government, actually on the initiative of the Deputy Prime Minister, Isabella Lövin, has proposed in Council to cancel about three billion carbon emission allowances. That’s about 50 times Sweden’s yearly emissions. That has been adopted in Council, which is very good, because it finally contributed to the reform of the ETS and at least tried to bring the prices for CO2 emissions to a more reasonable level in order to really make polluters pay. Talking about jobs, Europe could indeed be the frontrunner in climate-friendly jobs, but right now we’re leaving the innovation to other regions and countries in the world. That is a problem when solar panels are being produced in China, as well as battery cells, and electric cars are being produced in South Korea. It should be Europe where this innovation is done. The climate crisis is real and it’s happening  This is the one planet that we have, and there are also no jobs on a dead planet. So we need to act quickly and decisively. We can still decide how to make that economic transition, but we need to make it fast.

Sometimes I do not believe that we are so ‘lagom’, but we do think the balance is important. I think that balance is also important in the European context, in which we meet and have different opinions, but we also need to recognise that no one has ‘the’ single answer: we have to balance and compromise. Compromise is not as bad as some people think. It’s a good way forward, never forgetting values of course: these are, as I said in my statement, what should steer all that we’re doing.  Several of you have mentioned social rights. I will touch upon that issue, which, yes, I think it very important to address. For many people today, not least the members that I used to work for when I was a trade union leader, the transition of the labour market, of the global economy, is scary, and that is because they feel insecure about what will happen. I know I strongly believe in a social market economy because we need a market economy that has the best incentives for raising productivity, giving us a greater possibility of prosperity, but that change, that transformation, also needs to be brought about in a socially just way, otherwise people will rise up and say no, we will not be in favour of change. And if we have a workforce that is not in favour of change, then we will slow down in our economic development.  So this is about a morally right thing, but is also economically smart. Those who totally reject the social perspective of the European Union or economic development are making a huge mistake.  Now we can combine that and we have a treaty to adhere to as well. So the pillar of social rights has not changed the treaty. Before and after the social pillar rights, the decision-making is exactly the same, but what we’re saying is that we should cooperate on these 20 very important principles within three themes. One is to make sure that people get a job in the first place, given that the unemployed would be the most desperate people: the longer the unemployment, the greater the desperation.  The second is what kind of job do we want? Do we want jobs in which workers are supposed to compete with one another with lower wages and bad working conditions? Is that the future labour market? No, it’s not. So therefore it is in our mutual interest to make sure that things also move in the right direction with the national decision-making. Nothing has changed.  And the third is social security in a broader sense. Is that too much to ask?  This European Union, in my opinion, is made for the people. The market is very important for us. Creating this huge market gives us a possibility to compete with China, with the United States, with India and all the big players. But that other purpose must be to improve people’s daily lives.  (Applause) Otherwise, we’re on the wrong path. So I think that we can definitely work with social rights in a balanced way too. Regarding the budget, Mr Commissioner, I guess that the discussion needs to continue; I see that we have certain differences here. But let me just explain the Swedish position. During 2015 we received 163 000 asylum-seekers. Not everybody gets to stay. Some need to go back because there are no grounds for their asylum.  But we have ahead of us now huge investments in our country: in schools, in eldercare, in our health sector. I’m telling the Swedish people, look, we can handle this. We’ve now reduced immigration. We can handle this. Those who can stay in our country will be integrated in our society as soon as possible, but they need somewhere to live. They need a job, eldercare, everything. We can handle that.  But when I say that, I cannot also tell them, look, at least 50% of the space we have for future reforms needs to go to Brussels in increased fees to the European Union. That is not possible. We are eager to work to develop the European Union and do our best; we will contribute as best we can. But what I have just said is impossible because it would mean that the legitimacy of the European Union would be ruined. I cannot even deliver that answer to the people.  So we will do our part, but that too needs to be in balance.  When it comes to Mr Weber and the values, yeah, let’s look into how to strengthen that and make sure that the values are adhered to. I guess we agree upon that. We need to make sure that they are adhered to, otherwise we will weaken the European Union.  So I can’t say in detail what it requires, but, yes, we are interested in looking into it.  Several have touched upon the climate and environment. I share most of the positions and the policies. Once again it’s so crucial now for us to show young people that we have understood. We understand what is happening. Not only do we understand, but we will act to prevent a catastrophe. This is our duty, but it’s also our opportunity, and that’s a fine thing.  We need to turn the climate, the combat against climate change, from a burden into an opportunity, because this will provide the new jobs. The new technology is here and that is what we are going to develop. So we’re going to create new jobs and more wealth and combat climate change, and that’s why we also need to talk to people to show them that this is not a burden. We’re going to do this together. We’re not going to let you have the burden as an individual, weʼre going to do it together and we are going to be fine. We’re going to show our children and our grandchildren that we understood what was happening and we did something about it. Peter Lundgren. Nu ska jag prata svenska, Peter Lundgren. Jag pratar gärna engelska också. Men jag ska prata svenska.  Jag nämnde ingenting om hemska människor. Det var du som gjorde det. Jag respekterar alla människor. Alla människor ska respekteras. Men jag kommer att bekämpa åsikter som går tvärs emot mina värderingar.  Jag vet inte vad du refererar till med en retorik som jag då ska använda, men om det är när Sverigedemokraternas företrädare säger att judar och samer väl inte kan vara svenskar, då reagerar jag. Och det kommer att fortsätta göra. För jag tycker det är långt, långt... Det är inte i enlighet med våra värderingar och vi har dessutom en strid ström utav sverigedemokratiska företrädare som gång på gång på gång avslöjas med den här typen av uttalanden och statements. Sen är det dessvärre så att era rötter är i vitmaktrörelsen. Det är inte så länge sedan. Så, så länge de här värderingarna inte respekteras så kommer jag att bekämpa de åsikterna. Men människor ska respekteras. Det är viktigt för mig.  Mr Verhofstadt, on migration. Yes, you’re right: that is the problem right now – that we cannot reach a decision. We need to reach that decision. We’ve been pushing for it for a long, long time, for years now, ever since I started almost as a Prime Minister. So that is what we’re struggling for. And the problem is not the Council. The problem is that we have a few of our colleagues that do not want to share that responsibility. That’s the problem, and as long as we have that problem, we will be stuck. But we also need to find a solution. So, let’s work on that solution. We talked to Mr Weber earlier, and we need to see what is a way forward, because we cannot have this being dragged along for another five years. That’s impossible. Regarding Spotify, just to clarify one thing. Spotify also has an office in Stockholm. It is already there. But there are a lot of Swedish unicorns that need to grow. And they grow globally, and some of the activities need to take part also on the other side of the Atlantic. But I guess we agree on the point that the services market as well as the digital market need to be much more efficient, and that is why we are pushing for that. In the last European Council that we had just a few weeks ago, we were at 17 countries that wrote to the Commission and said we need to speed up this now and implement what we already have decided. So, in general, I agree we need to do much, much more. To Dennis de Jong on Swedish migration, the point is, as I said, we received 163 000 asylum-seekers in 2015. We needed to handle that situation. It was not sustainable. That’s the simple truth. Therefore, we changed our legislation to the same level as the European Union in general. Now, we need to stick to that legislation and, at the same, time work with this common European legislation so that, if we have that in place, all the Member States can also change their national legislation, and then we will have sustainable legislation for all of us. But once again, I think we need to make sure that we also share the responsibility. So that’s an issue for us. You were also asking how we create jobs. On the one hand, that’s why the market is so important – the huge market, because that will give our companies fast access to 500 million people. That’s a good thing, and that is why we need to implement the services market, make sure that works, the digital and all these things, but then to invest together: invest in innovation, invest in training, invest in those things that actually create jobs so that we always, constantly can fill new jobs, new jobs, new jobs, because old jobs will go, so we need to keep the pace with creating the new jobs. I think we can do that, and not least during that transformation, to make sure that people can follow at that pace. We need training, we need education, and this is a really important mechanism for making sure that we can create jobs and, by that, trust in the future. When it comes to arms build-up, there are two paths we need to follow. One is, as the Prime Minister of Sweden, I need to tell the people that we are doing what we can to make sure that we can handle any military threats in a good way. I cannot say: ‘We’ll see what happens’. So that’s important. But on the other hand, perhaps the most important thing (I think in that sense, I think we can agree) we can do as leaders is to decrease tensions. So we need to work with diplomacy. We are active right now also in Sweden working for more peace, to make sure that we can reduce the number of nuclear arms, for example. We need to have the debate that we are having today because I cannot see the reason why the ultimate protection would be arms that can destroy the earth. Because that’s what nuclears are all about, and that is not so smart. So we need to work on that together, but, until we’re there, I need also to show the Swedish people that we’re working with their security. So, Ska Keller on social issues. We have the Treaty, as I said. We’re moving this step by step, and that is why I work hard and, once again, I do also commend Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and everybody else who has worked with it (I guess you also worked with it), so we have taken this step. But let's see what the next step is. But we need to make sure that social security is something that people in our Member State can say: yes, this is for me as well. On mobility, you mentioned trains specifically. We are working on that right now, also in Sweden. How do we invest in such a way that our trains can move in a better way than they do now? But also the ticket situation, because you’re right, it’s too difficult now to travel, and it shouldn’t be difficult. Going by train should be easy and accessible. So we need to work with that. Lastly, ETS. You know what our government did? We actually cancelled allowances. The government before us sold them, made money on them. We cancelled, them and if you cancel those, the price will go up. So that’s what we did, at the expense of the Swedish taxpayers, and that’s what we think was right to do. The moralists and the moral question: well, sometimes it’s a complex world, but on migration I would like to say this: we need to stick to the three-pillar strategy that was chosen. First, work to improve conditions in our neighbourhood so that people don’t have to make these very dangerous journeys in the first place. Second, make sure that our external border is functioning. And third, make sure that we have a shared responsibility between the Member States within our Union. If that works, if we get that in place, we will have a sustainable migration policy. Mr Vilimsky, the climate: we need to be active, but the reactor in Slovakia, I cannot comment on the Slovak reactor. Every Member State needs to decide by themselves what kind of energy mix they will use. There is an important European perspective also given the Energy Union, but we not have any mandate – the different Member States decide on their own what kind of energy mix they want.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 61, "date": "2019-04-03.json", "name": "Gunnar Hökmark (PPE).", "mepid": "28124", "text": "MYMEMORY WARNING: YOU USED ALL AVAILABLE FREE TRANSLATIONS FOR TODAY.

Prime Minister, in your home country, Sweden, you have a very large number of trees, you have big forests – in fact you do trees and forests exceedingly well. Those trees and forests are all soaking up carbon emissions, and increasingly you’re using your wood to make products that go into the construction industry, which also continue to soak up the carbon. One of your biggest markets is the United Kingdom. Your neighbour, Norway, now has the tallest wooden building in the world, at 18 storeys, and the opportunities to build big and tall in wood are there for everyone to see now.  Recently in the United Kingdom we unfortunately had a horrific fire in London, in the Grenfell Tower, where over 70 people lost their lives. One of the consequences of that fire is that the British Government is looking at banning the use of wood in buildings over eight storeys tall. I think that would be an overreaction and a mistake. It would mean you would lose an important market for your cross—laminated timber and other products. I wondered if you’d be open to intervening with the British Government to point out that this is maybe the wrong road to take in response to Grenfell, because the need to tackle climate change means we need to build much more in wood in future?", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 63, "date": "2019-04-03.json", "name": "Marek Jurek (ECR).", "mepid": "124892", "text": "MYMEMORY WARNING: YOU USED ALL AVAILABLE FREE TRANSLATIONS FOR TODAY.

In the energy area for example – electricity – we have now one Nordic market because we are starting to integrate. We are employing more renewables than ever and we should be a model for Europe. But I want to ask you, in concrete ways, what do you think the European Union could do more to develop from a coal and steel Union, as you mentioned, to become a real, true climate Union? A Union where we put climate first in all of our policies. And secondly, Prime Minister, this response needs to be just, responsible, where all people are included, so how do we ensure, in your view, that in the face of globalisation, we integrate people more?

It’s not that we have the same opinion; that is not true. We have different opinions on these issues, because I believe strongly that social security is important – not least in the transition. This is something we have argued within Sweden for decades, for centuries, and all the improvements that have been made have also been fought against by the Conservatives. That’s true.  That is why we also disagree at a European level. We need to have an ambition and make sure that the population, the people, in our Member States also see that, yes, we have a strong market, but we also have a strong social dimension that makes us – everybody – winners, because today that’s not the case. That is not the case at the global level either. The case is that too many people feel they are the losers and that they don’t have a place in the future product. Our task is to show that everybody has a place, and that also goes with social security and social responsibility. It is a common task. I guess we will have to debate this in the coming decades as well, but I do not give up. We need a social justice. When it comes, Mr Brannen, to CO2 emissions and wood, we have another argument, and that is that wooden constructions and wooden buildings are not more dangerous in terms of fire. It could actually be the other way around, but that is up to the experts to continue to decide. I will not intervene in British decision—making, but I would say this: that we will continue in Sweden. We need to build more using wood rather than other materials for exactly the reason that that was mentioned: the climate. So we need to use more of our wood.  I do not think I cannot go through everybody.   Federley, när det gäller svenska statsråds närvaro, jag kan inte det i detalj. Jag kan bara säga att det är klart att man ska vara närvarande så mycket det går. Det är vi helt överens om.  Mr Papadimoulis, yes, we need to do more of that and that is why we believe it’s very important that we have a goal. There was also another question on the same issue – what more can we do for the climate – from Mr Kofod. We need to set goals and that is why I said in my speech here that in Sweden we decided that we should be zero neutral in 2045.  We think it’s important that the European Union make a similar decision, and we have suggested 2050, at the latest, because that’s the first goal. You need to decide that this is where we’re going and then you can adapt the goals for 2030 or 2025, look at the transport sector, the construction sector, industry, and then you’re starting. So you need the structure and the clear decision and then of course you need the tools as well so that we make it easier, also for individuals and organisations.  But I can also say this: we have a lot of businesses in Sweden and a lot of companies and enterprises that love to be in this project. They are in many ways ahead of us, telling us that we need to go faster and that they want to do more. So I think what it’s all about is creating the ‘people’s movement’ for combating climate change and making sure that we do our best for climate.  Max Andersson om skatteflykt. Nej, det är inte alls det det är frågan om, utan det finns ingen annan ambition än att här ska det betalas skatt. Naturligtvis efter förmåga och vad man har tjänat, utan vad det här handlar om är också att vi ser till att vi ska ta ut skatterna nationellt. Så det här är en fråga som är mycket mer komplex än så. Men ingen tvekan på att skattefusk ska bekämpas med alla tillgängliga, lagliga medel. Several of you have been touching upon the subject of corruption and mentioned different countries like Malta, Slovakia and Romania. There is only one answer to that: corruption, wherever it takes place, is not acceptable. That means that, a Prime Minister of Sweden or as a party leader of the Social Democratic Party in Sweden, it doesn’t matter who is guilty of what, we will combat that: nobody gets away with saying that they belong to a certain family. Corruption and misuse of financial resources are never, never accepted, and I can assure you that we are also dealing with that, being very clear on that issue because this is about the legitimacy of democracy and of our system. We cannot undermine that so it doesn’t matter who is responsible. We will combat that.  Sällström om föräldraförsäkring. Det är ju precis det här vi säger hela tiden. Det är ju inte så att fördraget i EU har förändrats på en enda punkt med pelaren för sociala rättigheter. Inte ett enda mandat, för då krävs det en fördragsändring. Så de förslagen hade ju kunnat komma när som helst ändå och föräldraförsäkringsdirektivet har väl varit på plats, jag gissar nu, i väl över 20 år. Jag kan inte i detalj, men det har varit på plats väldigt, väldigt länge.  Det är en sak vi ska vara väldigt noga med här och det är att se till att hålla jämställdhetens flagga högt. Vi vet att om kvinnor skulle ha samma sysselsättningsgrad i EU som män så skulle vårt BNP kunna öka med 12 procent. Det är en massa resurser det faktiskt, och det är så vi skapar resurser och ser till att kvinnor får samma möjligheter på arbetsmarknaden, i livet, hemma. Det är det det här handlar om.  Det här är en jämställdhetsfråga och den är inte till bara för kvinnor. Den är till för dig och mig också som män. Den är till för hela våra samhällen. Men inget mandat har flyttats från den nationella nivån till EU-nivån så att vi ska fortsätta att slåss för jämställdhet och där hoppas jag att vi kan kroka arm. We should not negotiate our values, I totally agree. I talked about the climate so we agree on that.  Mr López Aguilar, on the UK and Brexit we share the worry. We have to respect the referendum and what the UK will now decide and we try to be as pragmatic as possible, but there is also a line, of course. But let’s see what happens now during this, and next, week.  Ms Gomes, on the moral compass, I agree. There was also a question about future financing. As I said, if we put more people into work, we will have more finances. Sweden is a net payer right now and we’re fine with that. That’s okay. We are a relatively rich country so we can contribute more, and that’s okay, but we cannot increase the fees so high that we cannot fulfil our obligations at home. That’s not possible. So that is why I would say that we also need to think about how to relocate resources. We cannot just add new tasks and new missions and then increase the fee. That is not possible because there is a limit. But let’s relocate. I fully agree on drugs because we need to cooperate more to combat drugs, because that is something that will definitely – not will, is right now – poisoning our society. So the more strongly we combat drug dealing and drugs, the better for us. That is also why I went, for example, to Europol to see what we are doing together here. We’re doing a lot, but I guess we need to do more.  Ms Kirton-Darling, about the trade agreements: we need to have trade agreements that also include these kind of rights and they are doing so. The agreements that we are negotiating right now also include, as far as I understand it, social rights.  Fjellner, inrikespolitisk fråga. Men okej, jag tar den också. Då är det så här, att sedan vi tillträdde så har polismyndigheten inte haft mer resurser. Vi ser till att de får bättre verktyg. Det sitter fler busar i häkten och i fängelserna nu än det har gjort på många, många, många år.  Problemet är att det fylls på i unga åldrar och då är vi tillbaks i det sociala ansvarstagandet så den ena sidan att vara stenhård mot brotten, det är viktigt och det kommer vi att vara. Men den andra sidan, det är att se till att det är sån social utveckling för människor också i utsatta områden att de känner hopp för framtiden och att ungdomar inte dras in i brottslighet. De ska ha bättre skolor, bostadsområden, deras föräldrar ska in i arbete och det är det arbetet vi har påbörjat nu. Nu går det snabbare för människor som kommer till Sverige att komma in i arbete och då ser deras barn och ungdomar att det är den vägen vi ska gå.  Så det sociala, det mjuka, är väl så viktigt som det hårda. Det är de båda två spåren vi måste förbättra och därför var det inte bra att Moderaterna, Kristdemokraterna och Sverigedemokraterna röstade för en budget när just den satsningen togs bort. Inte bra.

It has allowed us to secure a political agreement in one single trilogue, on 12 February.  The European Parliament strengthened the robustness and European Union oversight of the new legal provisions of the Gas Directive. My special thanks reach out to the rapporteur, Jerzy Buzek, and to all the shadow rapporteurs involved. With the amended Gas Directive, we will be in a position to ensure that European Union energy legislation will apply to all pipelines connecting the European Union market with third countries. No such pipeline should be operated in a legal void or only according to the rules of a third country. This is important for European energy security, for European sovereignty and for European solidarity. In practical terms, it means that the key principles of European Union energy legislation, such as third-party access, tariff regulation, ownership unbundling and transparency will apply to gas pipelines with third countries. Let’s recall: the European Union imports 77% of the gas it consumes, and the great majority of this gas, almost 90%, is reaching us via pipelines from third countries, onshore and offshore. The provisions of the Gas Directive will from now on be applicable to all these gas transmission lines, both onshore and offshore, in the territory and the territorial sea of the Member States. This is a major step towards a well—functioning, transparent and competitive European Union internal gas market where all suppliers are acting under the same European Union rules. Exemptions for new infrastructure are only possible under strict procedures and conditions. These procedures and conditions are already well established under the current Gas Directive. The European Commission plays a decisive role and has extensive case practice. Each exemption decision has to be approved by the European Commission via a binding decision. The European Commission may grant the exemption, reject it or grant with appropriate modifications. The text agreed by the co—legislators also ensures transparency and cooperation among competent national authorities, for instance by requiring consultations among regulators before granting exemptions for new infrastructure.  Existing interconnectors with third countries will be eligible for a time—limited derogation to be granted by the Member States, for a period of up to 20 years – based on objective criteria – and all derogations shall be notified to the European Commission. The final text of the compromise preserves the possibility for Member States to conclude bilateral agreements with third countries on the operation of gas interconnectors, subject to authorisation by the European Commission – the so—called empowerment procedure. But such agreements must comply with European Union law and they cannot change the rules of the Gas Directive. Based on the European Parliament’s amendment, an additional step was added requiring authorisation of the European Commission for the conclusion and signature of such agreements to ensure adequate oversight is in place.  Together with the previously agreed rules on security of gas supply and intergovernmental agreements in the energy field, the Union has given itself a strong set of tools to deal effectively and collectively with our external energy suppliers. This has always been one of the main objectives of the Energy Union. I am looking forward to the debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 86, "date": "2019-04-03.json", "name": "Werner Langen", "mepid": "1928", "text": "MYMEMORY WARNING: YOU USED ALL AVAILABLE FREE TRANSLATIONS FOR TODAY.

Mr President, it seems quite remarkable in my opinion that EU institutions have not yet learnt their lesson. Euroscepticism is rising all over Europe. People ask to be heard. Nevertheless, this House, just like the unelected EU Commission here in Brussels, seems to be living in a parallel reality, far from the poor householder that cannot afford their energy bills. You are willing to sacrifice the needs of ordinary people to achieve a greater, yet highly expensive and unreliable energy goal. I think it is time to put the EU project aside and admit that EU energy legislation has impoverished Europe and its industries and households. Member States should be focusing their agenda and finances on discovering local energy sources. It is time for Europe to become independent from its green-driven agenda.

Of course we need to face up to this challenge, but we don’t even need to think about those challenges in order to see that it is quite natural that we shall have the same rules for the dominant actors on the internal market for energy as well as for the smaller actors. Gazprom will, with Nord Stream, be a main supplier with nearly 30% of their natural gas going to Europe. Why shouldn’t we apply the same rules regarding competition? How to decouple production from distribution as for all other actors on the European energy market? I haven’t heard anyone who sees any big problems with this. Why should we see it as some sort of diplomatic action?  We apply the same rules to everyone – to the big producers and the big distributors and the small producers and the small distributors.

I would like to express my thanks to President Buzek for his work. I think this is a step in the right direction. This directive aims at extending the main principles of the energy union also to the gas infrastructure, gas pipelines that come to the Union from third countries; this is very important. These are the principles that ensure that competition is fair and free – unbundling of ownership of gas pipe pipelines and gas itself, free access of third parties to the infrastructure, regulatory oversight over tariffs, and also transparency of contracts. This is all good but, unfortunately, when I look at one very controversial project that has been already discussed here – the Nord Stream 2 – it is exactly an example of a project that breaks all these rules. We have at the same time the ownership of the gas pipeline by Gazprom, which is also the owner of the gas that is going to be transported through this pipeline. We don’t see evidence of transparency of contract, and we see the most important thing: increasing dependence of the European Union on gas supplies from one supplier. This is not ideology. We don’t want simply to be dependent on one country, on one source, be it Russia or the United States. This is the question of our security. And my question to the Commission is this: on what grounds will the Commission grant exemptions from this directive in the case of the Nord Stream 2, given the fact that we have spare capacity in the existing infrastructure to bring more gas from Russia, existing pipelines are not yet fully used, and at the same time we have this policy by Russia which is based on using gas as a foreign policy tool for the Kremlin.

This Directive, among others, forms a firm and clear regulatory framework to ensure affordable and sustainable energy for all European consumers. This is achieved by ensuring a level playing field for those involved in the EU energy market, as well as security and predictability for the potential investors, and this is extremely important as well. But it is not enough just to have energy security and economic and sustainable energy. Investments that are compatible with the directive should be exploited and supported – supported in geopolitical terms, in geostrategic terms and in geostrategic balances. Such an investment is also the EastMed pipeline, which has major challenges to face. However, a firm political decision by the EU to support it will send a clear message of European determination to promote energy security in the southeast Mediterranean.  Beyond the ambitious plan, such as the EastMed pipeline, I should also mention the very positive development of the approval of the EUR 33 million funding of the Gas Interconnector Greece-Bulgaria (IGB) pipeline that will interconnect my country, Greece, and Bulgaria for the first time, diversifying the energy mix in the region and enhancing competition. The final beneficiaries will be European citizens. While it is worth noting that IGB will also be interconnecting with the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), widening even further the European demand (inaudible).  This is the way in which energy security becomes a reality: with a robust legal framework and strong financial support, but also firm political will.

I compliment the efforts made by Jerzy Buzek and Commissioner Cañete and others to try and bring that about. One of the statistics that the Commissioner mentioned is worth repeating. He said 77% of the gas is imported, and 90% of it by pipelines. So, obviously common rules would have to apply here, otherwise you’d have a complete distortion. But that also brings into question our security of supply in the sense that we need to diversify. We should definitely have more LNG, which gives us greater variety and choice. As well as that, of course, I have been involved in the renewable energy file. Over the next few years we have to incentivise renewable gas within the European Union.

Definitely over the period ahead, that is one way of ensuring that we will be more independent and won’t have to worry as much about pipelines into the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 108, "date": "2019-04-03.json", "name": "Miguel Arias Cañete", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank the House for this important debate.  Today’s debate has shown again that, as the European Commission, we can count on this Parliament as a strong ally when it comes to defending the principle of solidarity in our energy policy. This has been a major strength in our cooperation over this entire mandate. It has been our longstanding objective that when it comes to our external energy relations, the European Union should speak with one voice. With the legislation we have passed during this mandate – the IGAs Decision, the Security of Gas Supply Directive, and the amended Gas Directive discussed today – we now have the tools in place to do just that. As regards the Gas Directive, Members raised a number of important issues. I would like to respond to the most important points raised. Mr Langen raised the issue of whether this legislation is discrimination against Nord Stream 2. I have to say that the revised legislation concerns all gas pipelines to and from third countries, and Nord Stream 2 is only the latest example of such pipelines which all operate under different legal and regulatory regimes. The recent legal and public debate concerning Nord Stream 2 only underscores the value of providing legal clarity on this issue across the European Union. Project promoters, including those from Nord Stream 2, should welcome the legal certainty the amended legislation will create. Mr Krasnodębski and Ms Wiśniewska raised the issue of the exemptions that can be given to Nord Stream 2 and who will decide on such exemptions. I would have to say that Nord Stream 2, like all new pipelines, could apply for an exemption under Article 36 of the Gas Directive. The conditions for such exemptions are clearly set out in the directive. The national authority with jurisdiction over an exemption decision will be the authority of the Member State where the first interconnection point is located. In the case of Nord Stream 2 it will be Germany, but the draft decision by the national authority must be notified to the Commission, which takes a binding decision. It may grant, reject or impose changes for the exemption decision by the national authorities. Finally, Mr Rosati raised the issue of what the criteria are for granting an exemption. If Nord Stream 2 files a request for an exemption with the national regulator, it will be subject to strict conditions. As I said before, the final decision as to whether to grant an exemption stays with the Commission.  The exemption conditions include the following criteria. First, the risk level is such that the investment will not take place without an exemption. So if the investment cannot take place without exemptions it will go that way. Second, the new infrastructure must enhance competition in the gas market, and also it has to enhance security of supply. These will be the criteria that will be applied objectively by the Commission when agreeing whether to grant an exemption. I would like to conclude by thanking you again for your excellent cooperation. The new rules ensure that European Union law will be applied to pipelines bringing gas to Europe and that everyone interested in selling gas to Europe must respect European energy law. I think that we have all made a major step forward in the creation of a truly integrated internal gas market, which is based on solidarity and trust, with full involvement and oversight of the European Commission. I trust that in your vote tomorrow you will maintain that spirit and adopt this very important piece of legislation with a broad majority, as has been shown in the debate this afternoon.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 109, "date": "2019-04-03.json", "name": "Jerzy Buzek", "mepid": "28269", "text": "MYMEMORY WARNING: YOU USED ALL AVAILABLE FREE TRANSLATIONS FOR TODAY.

Although it gives the Commission a supervisory role in the approval of process regarding all pipelines linking the EU and third countries, it is too little too late when it comes to Nord Stream2. By continuing with this project, Germany has unfortunately chosen to sacrifice Europe’s security and long-term strategic goals over the potential short-term benefits of cheaper energy. However, once we are further locked into increasing Europe’s dependency on Russian gas, we are at the mercy of the man at the other end of the pipeline. Since this project makes no commercial sense, as there is no lack of capacity in existing pipelines, there is a clear ulterior motive. For Putin, 11 billion is a relatively cheap price to pay for financially harming Ukraine and Poland, reducing Europe’s energy security by increasing our dependence on Russian gas and dividing Western allies. Russia clearly demonstrated that it is ready to use energy as a political weapon when it restricted gas flow through Ukraine in 2006 and 2009.

The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund should continue to support the objectives of the common fisheries policy and the implementation of the Union’s maritime policy after 2020. Therefore, the Commission has proposed a budget of EUR 6.140 billion in current prices for the next programing period, which will allow us to tackle the challenges ahead and achieve our ambitious objectives. Support for the achievement of the objectives of the CFP remains a core priority. Such support should ensure that fishing activities are environmentally, economically and socially sustainable in the long term while they can contribute to the availability of food supplies. Hence the need for strong conditionalities for secession measures and leaving fleet renewal to private investment. However, support from the EU budget is necessary to help achieve and maintain sustainable fishing, based on the maximum sustainable yield and to reduce the impact of fisheries on our maritime environment. This includes support for innovation and investment in low impact, climate resilient and low carbon fishing practices and techniques. The EMFF is also a tool to support fisheries control and scientific knowledge. The Commission has proposed to ring fence amounts for these areas of support to ensure that sufficient funding is dedicated to this cornerstone of fisheries management. I would also like to insist on the importance of giving preferential treatment to small-scale fisheries. In particular, under the Commission’s proposal, small-scale fishers would benefit from a 100% rate of public aid. Food security and nutrition are also of the utmost importance. Fisheries and agriculture both contribute to this objective. An important challenge is therefore to encourage the consumption of fish protein produced in the Union, which meets high-quality standards and is available for consumers at affordable prices. Therefore, the EMFF can support agriculture, including fresh water agriculture and the processing and marketing of fishery and agricultural products. The EMFF may also support the development of the sustainable blue economy by creating conditions for the development of the sector, removing bottlenecks to facilitate investment and market development. Lastly, the EMFF will support the Union’s international action to promote and improve the international governance of the oceans. This is essential to guarantee healthy, safe, secure, clean and sustainable management and specially manage seas and oceans worldwide, in line with the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, in particular Sustainable Development Goal 14. Our proposal for the EMFF simplifies the delivery of the fund, compared with the rather complex architecture in the current period. This simplified architecture will not pre-define eligible measures at Union level, but will give flexibility to Member States in designing these measures. Our proposal for a new EMFF represents an evolution rather than a revolution of the current regulation, with an important element of simplification.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 119, "date": "2019-04-03.json", "name": "Eider Gardiazabal Rubial", "mepid": "96991", "text": "MYMEMORY WARNING: YOU USED ALL AVAILABLE FREE TRANSLATIONS FOR TODAY.

Fishing is changing rapidly. It is becoming an industry of even greater skill than ever before as ships are computerised and mechanised. Yet, because of Theresa May’s determined betrayal of Brexit, there are generations of young people who will be denied the highly skilled opportunities their French, Danish, Norwegian or Icelandic contemporaries enjoy, and instead of enjoying renewed investment, the wealth of coastal towns will continue to ebb away as it has done since we joined the European bloc.

But Scotland’s experience in the common fisheries policy (CFP) has not been entirely positive in every aspect. The CFP has been grossly over—centralised and inflexible over most of its existence, to the detriment of many parts of our catching sector. Indeed, the CFP has often been used as a justification for Brexit.  But we should never forget that the CFP has been constructed over the years with the full agreement of UK governments, and if Brexit goes ahead the UK Government has decided to retain fisheries powers at Westminster. The record of UK Governments in betraying Scotland’s coastal communities does not give me much confidence for the future. We’re expected to believe now that, all of a sudden, UK governments will prioritise Scotland’s coastal and island communities. I don’t believe it, and I think independence for Scotland is the answer.

I have taken due note of the various points raised during this debate which will be shared, of course, with my dear colleague Commissioner Vella.  The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) should be a tool for implementing our policy commitments under the common fisheries policy and maritime policy. Therefore, public support needs to be targeted at the challenges of these policies, in particular delivering healthy fish stocks and reducing fish waste through the implementation of the landing obligation and key topics for which EMFF investments are available.  I would like to insist on the very serious risk of introducing support for vessel construction and capacity—enhancing investments. This would be detrimental in terms of fisheries conservation and our maximum sustainable yield target. This would not only contradict the CFP, but also our international commitments under the sustainable development agenda under the WTO. It would crowd out investment into more important areas such as improvements to selectivity.  It is therefore important to spend taxpayers’ money in line with our policy objectives and commitments.

The agreement reached between both co—legislators on 4 February is a historic achievement for the Mediterranean. It is the first EU multiannual management plan in the region. Based on the common fisheries policy, this plan provides a balance between environmental and socioeconomic aspects. It will introduce a limitation on fishing time per day and provide for a progressive reduction of up to 40% during the first five years. This should bring us closer to sustainable fishing by 2025, from which point in time fishing limits will have to fully respect maximum sustainable yield.  For the first time, control measures for the fishing effort regime will fully apply as from next year, 2020. With this new plan, closure areas will also get an even more prominent role in the Mediterranean Sea. From the entry into force, we will have a three—month closure for all trawl vessels and more closures are to follow in the coming years. This will ensure protection of nursery and spawning grounds for demersal stocks such as hake. Another step forward is the integration of recreational fisheries and co—management into the plan, the latter being very popular for managing fisheries at the local level in the Mediterranean. When I look back to 2016, when we embarked on the path towards sustainable fisheries in the Mediterranean with our MedFish4Ever Declaration in Catania, I realise the long road travelled to get the multiannual plan adopted and the tangible increase of ownership and awareness generated. I’m very grateful to see such great progress and that the final result, the multiannual plan, forms a comprehensive package of measures that will contribute to restoring demersal stock and ensuring that fishers have the necessary tools to address the transition towards better profitability, as in other sea basins. A new era in the western Mediterranean Sea will start with this plan, one in which concrete measures will be progressively implemented to reduce fishing mortality until we reach sustainable limits. I am confident that this new plan is the right way to go. It will ensure that fisheries have a prosperous future in this sea and that fishermen and fisherwomen will be the first ones to benefit from that.  The plan serves as an important testimony of the possibility to progress in the Mediterranean when there is a political will to do so. It should therefore pave the way for other ambitious plans to advance from both the side of the EU and multilaterally in the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean. During the trilogue, the Commission committed to making three statements relating to the best available scientific advice, the inclusion of depth intervals as a criteria for the segmentation of the fishing effort, and regional cooperation. These statements are part of the final compromise and the Commission will submit these statements for the minutes.

This type of management system fits well the mixed fishery prevalent in the sea basin and is easier to control and monitor. With this plan we have struck a good and realistic balance between the conservation and socio-economic dimensions through a progressive reduction of the fishing effort to achieve maximum sustainable yield. This balance is also a factor of the additional measures provided for in the plan, chiefly the closure areas that contribute to reducing fishing mortality and improving selectivity of fishing. Going forward, the Commission services will work closely with the Member States towards the implementation of the plan. In parallel, Member States will have the opportunity to review the operational programmes under the Fisheries Fund and introduce measures to facilitate this implementation. Allow me to say that, at a time when the Commission mandate is coming to an end, we are very proud to be part of the adoption of the first EU multiannual plan in the Mediterranean Sea.

National authorities responsible for issuing ID cards must undertake fingerprints and facial images, as far as possible, in a gender—sensitive manner. Fingerprinting persons in a vulnerable situation, including those who have experienced gender-based violence, requires particular attention.  There is a difference between sex and gender. The disparity between the sex on someone’s official document and the gender presented in person can lead to discrimination and harassment.

It requires that the documents we use when exercising this right are secure and reliable. A number of Member States still issue ID cards that do not meet international standards. Some even issue paper ID cards and many such ID cards remain in circulation. Weak ID cards represent a serious security gap. They can easily be falsified and could be used by terrorists and other criminals to enter the EU. That is why the Commission proposed a regulation to strengthen security features for ID and residence documents in April 2018 as part of a wider package of security measures. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gérard Deprez, for his excellent cooperation on this initiative. His efforts to find acceptable and workable solutions were tireless and, in the end, successful. Let me also thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their hard work and commitment. Last but not least, let me thank the Romanian and Austrian presidencies for their efforts. I would like to stress that the regulation does not oblige Member States to introduce ID cards if they do not already issue such cards, nor does it make ID cards mandatory in those cases where they are optional. In these situations citizens will continue to use a passport instead. Also, the new rules on ID cards cannot serve as a legal basis to introduce national databases containing citizens’ biometric data. Regarding biometrics, I know there have been intensive discussions on whether ID cards should contain a chip with the fingerprints of the holder and whether this should be compulsory for all Member States that issue ID cards. We have consistently argued that fingerprints are a necessary security feature. The inclusion of biometric identifiers, and particularly the inclusion of fingerprints, renders documents more reliable and secure, and having secure and reliable ID cards is in the interest of citizens.  Fingerprints on ID cards is also consistent with the approach for passports. Many Member States already include fingerprints in their ID cards or may be planning to do so, but only an obligation at EU level can make sure there is no weak link in our area of free movement without internal border controls. At the same time, we agree with Parliament that robust data protection and fundamental rights safeguards are essential. Thanks to Parliament’s efforts, the text makes clear that Member States are fully responsible for the safe handling of citizens’ data. Changes introduced by Parliament will also make sure that the keys necessary to verify biometric data stored on the chip are exchanged between the Member States. To summarise, the new common minimum standards will make sure that EU citizens can rely on secure and reliable documents.

I’d like to make a very short comment related to the mandatory fingerprints. They were included in the preferred option as it was decided to give more importance to the criterion aimed at improving security. At the same time, there are several very important safeguards introduced in the proposal.  The safeguards in the text ensure the protection of citizens’ personal data. In response to the requests by Parliament’s representatives, many recommendations by the Fundamental Rights Agency have been included in the text. As suggested by the Fundamental Rights Agency and the European Data Protection Supervisor, the text makes it absolutely clear that it does not provide a legal basis for databases for the storage of biometric data.  We fear that the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor might have been based on some kind of misunderstanding of the encryption used for fingerprints on the chip of ID cards. Contrary to what is stated in the opinion, the fingerprints on the chip can only be accessed by authorities with the necessary certificates. We believe that the safeguards introduced in the text ensure the protection of citizens’ personal data, and we welcome Parliament’s effort in this regard.  I am convinced that this piece of legislation is a very important contribution to our overall efforts to strengthen the security of our citizens.

This is reflected in the recent dynamics of high—level EU-China meetings. In March, the European Council discussed overall EU relations with China in the global context and gave guidance on the future strategic priorities for the EU.  The key task for relations with China is to have a coordinated European approach toward China as a strategic partner, but also as a competitor and a rival. The essence of the relationship should be reciprocity in all areas so as to underpin our common economic interests. The upcoming EU-China summit on 9 April will be a good opportunity for the EU to push for its core priorities, notably in terms of trade and investment, human rights, global challenges and foreign policy. Indeed, EU—China trade relations, on which I will concentrate today, are part of a wider political and economic relationship with China, touching upon issues relating to competition, industrial policy and internal market rules. China’s model of state capitalism has led to a number of imbalances. These imbalances in the level playing field are not unique to EU—China relations, as observed in the current US—China standoff on trade. The situation will inevitably have an impact on the EU and we will need to remain vigilant.  Parliament, in its resolution of 12 September 2018 regarding EU—China relations already touched upon the various aspects of our trade and investment relationship. The European Council also discussed this issue at its meeting in March. Clearly, we cannot ignore that China is – and will remain – a very important strategic market for EU exports of both goods and services, as well as for EU investment. China is the EU’s second biggest trading partner after the US, and the EU is China’s biggest trading partner. Generally, both economies are closely interlinked, including a fast evolving presence of Chinese companies in Europe. It is therefore important for us to reflect on how the EU can seize the opportunities that China provides, while at the same time addressing the numerous challenges in the relationship.  We also need to remember that China is indispensable as a partner if we are to deal with global challenges, which can only be addressed together. Climate change is an obvious example. We need close trade and investment links for our own economic growth and prosperity. At the same time, our economic relationship needs to be more balanced. Here we come to the heart of the matter.  A decade ago, our main focus was on how to improve access to the Chinese market and deal with the different barriers that exist. Today, the challenge of China’s state capitalist economic model is far greater as it creates systemic competition with liberal market economies. This had led to a lack of reciprocity and the absence of a level playing field in our economic relationship with China, which is pursuing its ambition to become the world leader in a number of key sectors, including key technologies. It has achieved this through massive market distorting subsidies, resulting in a dominant position of state-owned firms through forced technology transfer, industrial policies and non-tariff measures that discriminate against foreign companies, through poor protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights, and through strategic investment in key sectors in the EU or other third countries. In addition, the EU is being kept out of the Chinese market in sectors where the Union is strong, while China has wide-ranging access to the EU market, such as in the area of foreign direct investment or public procurement. Unfortunately, in aiming at realising its global ambition, China has no intention or constraints to play by the same rules as other players. We therefore urgently need to look at the EU toolbox to address Chinese behaviour in the area of trade and investment. Trade defence instruments or the new regulation on foreign direct investment screening are important here, but we also need to look at competition rules, state aid control, industrial policy and internal market rules more widely, while keeping the interests of consumers in mind. We also need to see how best to navigate between US—China rivalries and steer the dynamics of the triangular EU—US—China relationship. The US has been clear in its view that China has benefited massively from its WTO accession and thus it now needs to meet its commitments. The upcoming EU—China summit on 9 April will be a good opportunity to urge China to address existing asymmetries and the lack of reciprocity, as well as to encourage China to live up to its responsibility to pursue policies that support an open, balanced and inclusive global economy which is beneficial to all. This includes assuming its responsibility in the WTO to contribute to a comprehensive collective effort to WTO reform, in line with its economic weight. China’s engagement to reform the WTO in certain key areas is therefore to be welcomed. For the EU, market distorting industrial subsidies should be dealt with as a priority. Such subsidies are often channelled through state-owned enterprises and are currently not adequately captured under international trade rules. Forced technology transfer policies are another aspect that we would like to see effectively eradicated. We should continue with our efforts to convince China to address these irritants. In this regard, I hope that the EU—China Working Group devoted to WTO reform will start delivering quickly. Bilaterally, the EU is currently negotiating a comprehensive investment agreement with China. This agreement is meant to be ambitious and comprehensive. It will be a crucial tool to level the playing field, rebalance our investment relations and secure equal treatment for EU companies operating in China. Provided the substance is there, we would like to see the negotiations on this agreement concluded next year. The negotiations also come at a crucial moment when China is revising its domestic laws on foreign investment. These negotiations have therefore become an important tool to help push regulatory changes in China.  The negotiations on a bilateral geographical indication agreement with China are now in their final stages. The conclusion of these negotiations will help ensure mutual recognition of geographical indications in each other’s markets. It is disappointing that progress has stalled, despite the commitments made by China at the last EU—China summit to conclude the negotiations by the end of October 2018. China has raised new issues and has backtracked on others. We therefore expect the upcoming summit to provide additional momentum with respect to both the comprehensive agreement on investment and the geographical indication agreement. This will be important if we want to maintain the credibility and ambition of these negotiations.

Lately, there’s been increasing awareness in the EU that China is unlikely to change its economic model where the state and party have a strong influence in the economy. If China doesn’t change, then the question arises as to what we in the EU can do to change our approach towards China. To answer this question, in a recent joint communication the Commission and the High Representative have therefore reviewed the EU’s relations with China in five broad areas and proposed 10 concrete actions to better respond to the opportunities and challenges we have with this partner. Firstly, we should engage more strongly with China to promote an effective rules-based multilateral order to fight climate change and to improve the governance of the oceans. The EU and China can be effective partners in doing so. We both realise the importance of upholding multilateralism as the best way of finding solutions to global problems.  We also both agree on the negative impact that emissions, pollution and unsustainable use of resources has on our planet, both on land and in the oceans. We have therefore decided to act resolutely on these fronts, but can and should, do more.  Secondly, we want to deepen our action in support of international peace, security and sustainable development. Building on the positive cooperation with China on the Iran nuclear agreement, we want to work with it, for instance, on the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, the peace process in Afghanistan, or in addressing the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar. China should, however, accept binding arbitration rulings issued under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea relating to its maritime claims in the South China Sea.  We also want to cooperate with China and promote high governance standards, sustainability and a level playing field in respect to investment and economic cooperation with third countries in Asia, the Western Balkans or Africa, in particular in the fields of infrastructure.  Thirdly, we need to achieve a more balanced and reciprocal trade and investment relationship with China. With more than one billion euro of trade in goods every day, the EU and China are strategic markets for one another. However, distortions in the Chinese economy, where the state retains a strong influence, have negative spillover effects in the EU, notably when overcapacity leads to dumping. China’s state-driven industrial policy and ambition to develop domestic champions is also problematic when it leads to non-reciprocal market openness and an uneven playing field for EU companies.  We therefore want China to deliver on its commitment to reform WTO rules and accept stronger discipline on industrial subsidies and forced technology transfer. We also have a shared interest to conclude our bilateral agreement with China on investment by 2020, and aviation safety or geographical indications in the near future. Finally, we call on the Council and the European Parliament to adopt as quickly as possible the international procurement instrument, which will help to ensure more reciprocity with their countries in the field of access to the public procurement market. Fourthly, the EU must strengthen its competitiveness and ensure a level playing field in Europe. Let me be clear that this is homework the EU needs to do regardless of China and is not directed against China. What we want to avoid is having global competition on state subsidies. In order to ensure fair competition, EU state-aid rules limit strictly subsidies that Member States can grant to private companies. However, they do not apply to foreign subsidies and WTO rules on subsidies are less stringent than EU state-aid rules. This is why we want to reform and strengthen WTO rules on subsidies. But we also need to be able to act on our domestic market. The Commission will therefore identify before the end of 2019 how to address more effectively the distortive effects of foreign state ownership and state financing in Europe and fill the gap in EU law. In order to promote high standards of quality, security, sustainability and social responsibility, the Commission will also publish guidance on the participation of foreign bidders in the EU’s procurement market and conduct an overview of the EU’s procurement framework. Based on renewed EU industrial policy strategy, the EU will encourage the development of strategic value chains and key technologies in Europe, such as we do with the Action Plan on Artificial Intelligence. Finally, we encourage co-legislators swiftly to agree on the Horizon Europe programme which will support innovation in Europe, while also including clear rules on exploitation of results and reciprocal access to research and development funding when we cooperate with third countries. Fifthly, we must strengthen the security of the EU’s critical infrastructure and technology. 5G networks will provide the future backbone of our societies and economies, connecting billions of objects and systems, including sensitive information. The Commission therefore adopted on 26 March a recommendation for a common EU approach to 5G security networks.  We have called on Member States to start preparing for the implementation of the new EU foreign investment screening system that will enter into force in April 2019 – this year – and will allow detecting and addressing this year the security that may be posed by foreign takeovers of critical assets, technologies and infrastructures.  Finally, we called on the Council to adopt swiftly the EU modernised rules on export control of dual-use goods. All these steps will reinforce EU resilience and security regarding potential risk in critical sectors.  Let me conclude by saying that the upcoming EU-China Summit on 9 April provides a good opportunity to take stock of the progress achieved since the summit of last July and to insist on China’s more substantive engagement on all issues of EU interest. Until now, China has continued to downplay concerns raised by the EU and sought to keep the focus on areas of common ground. Its interest is in a feel-good summit with the EU to display EU-China cooperation to the world. However, a feel-good summit is only possible if China is able to deliver concrete results. We are doing our utmost to prepare well for this event.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 187, "date": "2019-04-03.json", "name": "Godelieve Quisthoudt-Rowohl", "mepid": "1055", "text": "MYMEMORY WARNING: YOU USED ALL AVAILABLE FREE TRANSLATIONS FOR TODAY.

In 2017 China’s exports of goods to the EU were EUR 375 billion. This gigantic figure is roughly equivalent to the entire economy of Nigeria. And now some more key facts. China is not in the EU’s single market. There is no Customs Union between China and the EU. There is no regulatory convergence beyond those goods that China actually sells in the EU. There is no free movement of people between China and the EU. China does not have a trade agreement with the EU. Nevertheless, China has access to the EU’s single market. Indeed, access enough to sell these goods in this massive volume. How come? Perhaps this is permitted because the EU has a trade surplus with China? Far from it. The EU’s trade deficit with China in 2017, including services, was EUR 160 billion. This deficit was roughly equivalent to the entire economy of Romania, if you would pay attention.  So there you have it. China has full access to the EU’s single market. By comparison, the EU demands of the UK, for example, payments of GBP 39 billion that the UK does not even owe, the supremacy of the European Court of Justice, which should really be called the European Court of injustice and, worse still, the effective regulatory annexation of the province of Northern Ireland. Well may the representative of the Commission snigger away. And this is in return for access. It is as if the EU was asking of China the same regulatory annexation of the province of Sinkiang.  From this debate, it seems that the EU would like good trade relations with China. A great idea, but one question: does the EU want, let alone seek, the same good trade relations with the UK? It certainly does not seem that way.

This converges to the EPP Group’s position, which I have recently expressed in the Committee on International Trade (INTA). Our calls to see concrete changes on the ground will intensify and I am glad to observe that the Commission also addresses much attention to trade—related aspects in this recently retitled communication. A robust trade policy is key to the future relationship with China. The three main priorities of the EPP Group are already very well—known, but let me just reiterate them. We want improved conditions for European companies to better market access, we want concrete action to level the playing field on the Chinese market, especially concerning state-owned enterprises, and we highlight the importance of reciprocity in our trade and investment relations. Concerning the upcoming EU—China summit, we urge the Commission to maintain its assertive position. Indeed, also at last year’s summit the joint declaration included some clear promises which have yet to be met by our Chinese partners. So, our message to them is very clear: the time to act is now. China needs to start delivering on the promises it has made numerous times, especially on advancing the investment treaty negotiations while addressing the issues related to state—subsidised industries and technology transfers.

The One Belt and Road Initiative is China’s reaction to the Bretton Woods system and in their quest for a historical relaunch Chinese are now winning strategic structures in the EU, but sincerely we cannot blame China for promoting its economic interests if we do not even have a truly European trade strategy towards it. Instead, we call it an economic competitor and a systemic rival, giving away our playing cards into the hands of Trump. As a result, EU countries will pay the bill of trade wars between China and the United States. Paradoxically, in order to resist the Chinese economic offensive on the EU, we must ease the tariff tensions we have with the United States of America.

Even though there have been some differences in views, I would say that that we have a relatively unified position which is attitude-free. By saying this, I mean that it’s not wise to have any particular negative attitude in our relationship with China; what is needed is an honest assessment of the current state of play. That’s why our communication is based on the assumption that our future relationship with China must be based on fairness, multilateralism and reciprocity.  It’s supposed to be very easy to defend by everyone. As I said before, and as everybody should know, China and the EU are strategic partners. We have cooperated, and will cooperate, and want to cooperate with China very closely on various foreign policy-related issues – and also in security-related issues – upholding and enhancing multilateralism on trade.  It’s also worth acknowledging that Chinese companies are sometimes better than our companies. They can compete with our companies even without state subsidies. But it’s equally important to acknowledge that this is not always the case. We have to make sure that Europe can improve its competitiveness, as China will be a major player in the global economy in the coming years, and we have to make sure that our economies can develop so that we can compete on an equal footing when there is a level playing field. Even without China, we have to improve our competitiveness when it comes to innovations and other dimensions of competitiveness. China wants to be seen as a developing country. To a certain extent, it is a developing country. When looking at the number of poor people or at democracy or other dimensions of the society, there are features which we can acknowledge as features of a developing country. But, at the same time, it’s fair to say – and honest to say – that China is a military superpower, it’s a political superpower, it’s a technology leader, and it’s a market leader in some areas. That’s why we have to treat China as a normal competitor and strategic partner and cooperating partner. There’s nothing bad and unfair about expecting reciprocity. Strategic partners are supposed to provide and base their cooperation on a reciprocal way to cooperate.  Multilateralism and rules-based systems are very often mentioned by Chinese leaders, and when I have had a chance to cooperate with many Chinese authorities and leaders, I generally believe that they believe that multilateralism is a good basis for international cooperation. Having said this, it’s also honest to acknowledge that sometimes China is using multilateralism and a rules-based world order rather selectively. Again, we as strategic cooperating partners must agree that multilateralism means multilateralism, a rules-based system means a rules-based system, and we have to make sure that reciprocity is respected.  Our relationship with China is very active, and we are willing to deepen this relationship in various fields. But, at the same time, whilst technology, the market and China have developed positively, there are new challenges in our relationship and we want to solve those challenges. We have not chosen the same way as the United States to deal with China. We want to be constructive but fair, and expect reciprocity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 212, "date": "2019-04-03.json", "name": "Melania Gabriela Ciot", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, this has been a useful debate and I would like to thank you for the Parliament’s continuous engagement and interest in this topic. To conclude, China brings immense opportunities but also important challenges for the EU. Addressing this, we require a long-term engagement, both bilaterally and multilaterally. Without losing sight of the areas of positive cooperation, it is clear that we need to reflect on how to engage China to undertake market reforms, how to ensure a level playing field, and how to tackle systemic challenges linked to the WTO reform process. Also, it is of utmost importance that our cooperation with China is based on agreed principles and that it fully respects EU values. This is why human rights are one of the issues to be addressed in our forthcoming summit with China. Finally, maintaining EU unity both the within the EU institutions and among the Member States is of crucial importance.

I am replacing Commissioner Moscovici, who was not able to join us for the debate, so please accept his apologies. On his behalf, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, Ms Grapini and Mr Pospíšil, for their outstanding work on these files. The Customs Union celebrated its 50th anniversary last year. It is the foundation of our single market in which goods can circulate freely. Customs help to safeguard the financial interests of the Union and its Member States while protecting them against terrorism, health, environmental and other threats. This can only be achieved through a deep and operational cooperation between the national customs authorities. These authorities are constantly faced with new challenges arising from rapidly changing technologies, increasing volumes of trade, and persistent transnational crime and security threats. We are here today to discuss the two Commission customs proposals that will support customs authorities to answer these challenges. These programmes represent the main EU instruments to achieve the objectives of the Customs Union. The proposed customs programme is indispensable for the work of the customs authorities. It supports their cooperation, capacity—building, networking and modernisation via information technology development. The programme is the natural continuation of the existing Customs 2020 programme and its predecessors which have proven their added value and have been highly appreciated by Member States. The proposal for a customs control equipment instrument is a brand new initiative. It addresses the long—standing calls of the Member States for support to finance adequate and modern soft detection equipment to control goods crossing the EU’s external borders. It also aims to improve and harmonise the quality of customs controls throughout the EU and contributes as such to the different customs services functioning as one entity. We should not forget that the Customs Union is as strong as its weakest entry point. The Commission therefore welcomes the support of Parliament for the two proposals and is grateful for the quality of the reports that offer numerous constructive and valuable adaptations to its text. We are pleased that Parliament quickly took action following the adoption of the negotiation mandate of the two co-legislators at the beginning of the year and that intensive and constructive work between the three institutions took place. We regret that these efforts were not able to materialise in an agreement despite the significant progress made and, while an agreement was within reach, the negotiations could not be finalised. Today’s joint debate gives us an opportunity to have further discussion and hopefully ensure that we will equip the European Union with the programmes of the highest quality. I’m looking forward to the debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 221, "date": "2019-04-03.json", "name": "Arndt Kohn", "mepid": "186884", "text": "MYMEMORY WARNING: YOU USED ALL AVAILABLE FREE TRANSLATIONS FOR TODAY.

Without it, we will never achieve our ambition of a Customs Union free from both physical and practical obstacles. Therefore, I welcome these efforts to improve cooperation, both in terms of money and equipment. By modernising custom procedures, we will make sure that goods can flow more freely and efficiently, achieving more efficient trading with the rest of the world and throughout the Union, and bringing benefits to our citizens and consumers through cheaper and safer goods.  Given the importance of this file, it is regrettable that the Council did not manage to bring this file to the end. This forced us to seek to conclude the first reading and secure our position in a future negotiation. But, despite this setback, I believe that the progress we made set us on a good path to achieve our aim of a seamless Customs Union that brings benefits to European citizens, businesses and consumers.

The Commission fully shares the view of the European Parliament and its calls aimed at further integrating the work of the different customs authorities, allowing them to function as one entity. The proposals for more convergence of controls can only support an increased overall performance of EU customs. Based on the debate, I do not see major blocking points. I am sure that our experts will easily find common ground and that solutions will be found with the appropriate wording.  Let me conclude by expressing my firm belief that the progress achieved in the negotiations so far and the exchanges in plenary today will be used as a platform to reach an agreement for the benefit of European citizens, businesses and customs administrations.

There are way too many people losing their lives on our roads. That’s a fact. It is of little comfort to know that we are by far the safest area in the world, because none of us want to be part of the statistics.  The safety and quality of road infrastructure contribute significantly to accidents and fatalities, and its contributing factor is over 30%. This is why I am very glad that we are, together, taking concrete measures to address the road safety situation in Europe. I can say that we are finally walking the talk in a very systemic way.  With a preliminary agreement reached on 21 February on the revised directive on road infrastructure safety, we have made a very substantial step forward to improve safety on European roads. Safe infrastructure is one of the three key pillars of our safe system approach, in addition to safe vehicles and safe road use, our behaviour. I would therefore like to use this opportunity to thank you all for the excellent cooperation and your continued support throughout this process. I thank in particular the rapporteur, Ms Aiuto, and all the shadow rapporteurs. They were very constructive in this process and strived for an ambitious result. I am proud of the result and I think you can all be as well. With the text as it stands now, we will deliver concrete measures that will, without any doubt, be a major improvement compared to the current road safety situation and, what really counts at the end, we will save lives.  How? First, thanks to the wider scope of the application, more roads will be covered, as already mentioned by the rapporteur. So far our rules covered only Ten—T motorways, which are, by definition, the safest roads accounting for only 8% of fatalities. With the new text we agreed to target specifically primary roads where we are recording 39% of fatalities. Here I have in mind, especially national roads with really heavy traffic.  Second, we are also moving towards a more proactive approach to road safety with a network-wide assessment. What does this mean? It means that the European road network should be assessed proactively and the stress is on proactive activities to identify potential risk sections, for example, black spots on our roads, and ensure appropriate follow-up. We don’t want to wait for accidents to happen. This will help us to detect potential danger and act before people become part of statistics. Network-wide safety assessment will also bring transparency and will focus investment on where the returns are the greatest. In other words, this will be used as a criteria for investment.  Last, but not least, special attention will be paid to vulnerable road users like motorcyclists and cyclists, for example, by focusing on visible markings, dedicated bike lanes and similar.  We have laid the basis for making our road infrastructure fit for purpose, for accommodating new driver assisted technologies and, later on, for autonomous mobility. There, the Commission will work with Member States’ experts to prepare common specifications for road markings and signs.  That brings me to the point where I want to make a link with the General Safety Regulation, the second important proposal from the Third Mobility Package. I am glad that our negotiations managed to reach a preliminary agreement last week, on which I want to congratulate you as well – 15 new features in vehicles of all price ranges in order to improve the safety of our citizens. This is something very concrete and deliverable for our citizens and ourselves as well.  Indeed, the Infrastructure Directive and the General Safety Regulation are two sides of the same coin, as the latter can only unfold its full potential and its benefits if the road infrastructure is ready to accommodate those new technologies that vehicles will have on board in the future. Altogether, we expect these two sets of rules to save about 10 500 lives in the period between 2020 to 2030 and also around 60 000 serious injuries. This is what we’re here for, and this is why it’s worth cooperating in order to deliver on this very clear result.  It will therefore be of the essence that the new provisions of the Road Infrastructure Safety Management Directive can be implemented as swiftly as possible so that the revised legislation delivers its benefits quickly. This is why I am counting on you to ensure the adoption of the text as previously agreed at the trilogue on 21 February. I understand that any changes resulting from the linguistic review that will be carried out over the summer will need to be formally endorsed by the European Parliament, hopefully as early as September. In this way, we expect the directive to be published and to enter into force by October of this year. This would be great news for our citizens and the Commission will do its part in the follow—up. We will establish the working and expert groups very quickly, some already in May this year, as we promised, and drive the process forward with clear determination.

Unfortunately, the main advantage of workers from eastern Europe is that they work for a lower wage than workers in western countries. Temporary work in another EU country for these people is an opportunity to earn money for their families. Introducing restrictions supposedly for their protection means a significant amount of them will no longer be invited to work in a rich country. This means that they will have to stay in their country and they will receive much less pay for the same jobs than their colleagues from western countries.
