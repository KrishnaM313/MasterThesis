First of all, I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and my co-rapporteur on the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO). These are not just hollow words; I think that we have had a very fruitful and constructive cooperation, and the result of that cooperation is before you and will, hopefully, command a large majority when we vote later today. I note that the only party that is actively campaigning against my report is the Front National, which I find reassuring in a way. The European Commission will today present its working programme for 2017. Commissioner Timmermans always says that the European Commission has to be big on big things, and I very much agree with that. But I do think that democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights are a big thing. We Europeans have something to be proud of: we have been leading for many decades in the area of democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights, so we have a heritage that we can be proud of. So let us now take the opportunity to further deepen and strengthen that culture of democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights in the European Union as a whole, because the EU is more than the sum of Member States. Democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights (or DRF, if I may coin a new abbreviation in EU jargon) is key to the functioning of the European Union. It is key to policy areas like police and justice cooperation, and asylum and refugee policies, but also the internal market and, as we have seen recently, international trade. We are all aware of the so-called Copenhagen dilemma. In other words, when a country wants to join the European Union, it has to meet the highest standards – but Member States of the European Union cannot be held to those standards. We do not really have sufficient means to enforce our standards of democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights, but we do feel that the need for a mechanism for upholding DRF is growing. One of our colleagues, Viviane Reding, who was a Commissioner at the time for that purpose, took the first steps to the creation of the rule of law framework, which is now triggered by Mr Timmermans. We have seen the creation of the Rule of Law Dialogue in the Council, the creation of the friends of the Rule of Law Group in the European Council, and Mr Timmermans, when you were still a Minister of foreign affairs in the Netherlands, you yourself called for the creation of a rule of law mechanism. We have the European Commission Rule of Law Framework, and that is very important. I think it is very good that you have triggered it in the case of Poland, but that same case also illustrates the weaknesses and the shortcomings of that mechanism, and therefore the European Parliament has proposed the DRF pact. The principles, I hope, will find their way into the proposals that the Commission will, hopefully, put forward. The principles are that the pact, or the mechanism, should be applied to all Member States equally. They should all be assessed on the same basis, and also the EU institutions. It should be a permanent mechanism and not crisis-driven, as we have now in the case of Poland. There should be ongoing monitoring. It should be objective, evidence-based, and not politically motivated, and it should also be building on existing instruments and be realised under the current treaties. Finally, our mechanism foresees close involvement of the national parliaments. I am very much looking forward to the debate, and I very much hope that the European Commission will join the big majority in the European Parliament and come forward with proposals that build on the report that we will adopt today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2016-10-25.json", "name": "Frans Timmermans", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   First Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to thank Parliament for today’s debate on the establishment of an EU mechanism on democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights. In particular, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Sophia in ‘t Veld, for her personal engagement and the important work that has gone into the preparation of the report. She is passionate about this and we could see her passion reflected in the report. We can all fully agree on the objective underlying the report, which is to ensure that our common values and rules are respected and, if need be, enforced. The key issue for discussion is not about the objective itself but about the best means to achieve that objective. There is much in the report I can fully agree with, such as the suggestion to follow an inclusive approach with all stakeholders – EU institutions, Member States and civil society. The idea of an interparliamentary dialogue between the European Parliament and national parliaments equally merits support. National parliaments are involved in many of the rule of law related problems that we witness in Member States today. We need to work towards a common understanding of our values at national and at European level. This interparliamentary dialogue could, as a first step, lead to a discussion on the different options and means which are currently on the table to ensure that our common values are respected and enforced. The Commission and I assume that the Council will want to be involved as well. However, there are also a number of points in the report on which I have questions and I would very much like to hear your views. For instance, I have questions about the need and the feasibility of an annual report and a policy cycle prepared by a committee of experts. I also have doubts about the feasibility of an interinstitutional agreement on this matter. Some elements of the proposed approach, such as the central role attributed to an independent expert panel in the proposed pact, also raise questions of legality, institutional legitimacy and accountability. Moreover, from a practical and political point of view, it may also be very difficult to find common ground on such an interinstitutional agreement between all the parties concerned. I hope we can all agree that a long institutional debate on new mechanisms is the last thing we need right now. We have a range of existing tools and actors that already provide a set of complementary and effective means to address rule of law issues. Duplication of existing mechanisms is something I think we should avoid, and if I understood Mrs in ‘t Veld’s introduction correctly, this is something she wants to avoid as well. As you know, in March 2014 the Commission adopted a rule of law framework. We are currently applying this framework in the case of Poland for the first time. Mrs in ‘t Veld referred to this.  The Commission takes protecting the rule of law very seriously. We are grateful for the support Parliament has shown in its resolution of 14 September and we need that support if we are to be successful in our approach. The Commission also organises an annual fundamental rights colloquium, involving European institutions, Member States, international organisations and civil society. This year the colloquium will take place on 17 and 18 November and will be devoted to the topic of media pluralism and democracy.  As you know – and as Mrs in ‘t Veld mentioned – in December 2014 the Council established a rule of law dialogue to debate rule of law issues and – as Mrs in ‘t Veld has said – in a previous capacity as Foreign Minister, I was one of the people who took the initiative, together with the Foreign Ministers of Denmark, Germany and Finland. We also have a number of other actors, apart from the Council – the Council of Europe, the Venice Commission, the Agency for Fundamental Rights and a host of NGOs active in the field of fundamental rights. They all contribute to the monitoring of the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights in our Member States. We should make their contributions stronger. We should also make the best possible use of these existing instruments, evaluate them, look where we see deficiencies and then take steps towards the creation of a new mechanism – only after that evaluation, I would say.  I very much look forward to hearing your views. Let me assure you that the Commission will examine your request for a proposal very carefully, in line with Article 225 of the Treaty, and give this report the serious response it deserves. But let me also stress again what I think is crucial. We need to avoid division around our common values as clearly set out in the Treaties and work with our various partners to build a consensus. Protecting the fundamental values of the Union is a collective responsibility of all institutions. The existing treaties give us the tools so let us use them. At the end of the day, this is a very political process.  But let me repeat here what I said last week in the committee discussion we had on that in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE). Without full integral application of the rule of law across the European Union, the European Union is doomed because the rule of law is the fundament upon which this construction is built. If we disregard the rule of law, there is nothing to keep the European Union together, other than naked power politics. That will be to the detriment of the smaller, of the minorities, of the weaker, and of the individual citizens. We cannot let that happen.

A human rights mechanism has three necessary conditions to meet if it is to be successful, and this is what I would very much like to see myself. First of all, it must have a legal base, giving it immunity from political interference. It follows that this mechanism will only acquire legitimacy if it is not used to target Member States in order to punish them. Secondly, the mechanism must be completely even-handed as between Member States. The slightest hint of different treatment will delegitimise it, so no cherry picking, no opportunistic targeting. This, of course, will require continuous monitoring. The third is consistency of implementation, but here a balance has to be struck between subsidiarity and all European practice.

It is even more fundamental if I hear the First Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Timmermans, telling us that there may be difficulty to find common ground on the topic throughout the institutions. That to me is the best proof that this is exactly the moment in which we need to kick off a process of engagement towards finding a veritable and a true European logic of governance, because we may not be there yet, as we discover far too often when we see governance trends in certain European countries, as has been the case over the last month and as may be the case again.  Who, at the end of the day, is going to protect us from what happened in the inter-war period – when one country after another, for reasons of their own, drifted off into extremely problematic governmental orientations – with what we have now. With the generalised unanimity requirement that is on the table to engage whatsoever with respect to any sort of state, we would be doing essentially nothing and that would be dramatic.  It would be dramatic as a sign to the millions of Europeans who nowadays look towards Europe and to this House as the only – the only – buoy of stability; if it is about guaranteeing that elections in the future change policies, yes, but not the nature of their state. This is something that is aimed at ensuring continuity of statehood, of institutions, of impartiality of state against electoral result, if need be, and against those who believe that saving the Occident is more important than saving their own citizens from arbitrary governance.  This is a necessary mechanism. This is something that we can now embrace. This is something that we now should embrace and this is something for which Parliament has taken time to converge towards but it is good that it has finally done so.

I would also like to thank the rapporteur, first of all, but also the whole team of shadow rapporteurs for the excellent work we have done together at many meetings. The rapporteur presents as much as possible, what we need and what is also the answer to your speech, Mr Timmermanns. You mentioned what the European Commission and the European institutions have at their disposal today. But the result is that it is not all working, and that is why this report is here, and that is why this new proposal is here. There are currently several negative pieces of legislation that are being prepared in several Member States of the European Union. Poland has already been mentioned here, in the past it was also Hungary. However, their consequences are that they threaten and undermine the protection of the fundamental rights of citizens of the rule of law. And I must tell you that I will honestly watch very closely how the procedure you initiated against Poland begins or ends, because I am more pessimistic about this. These are also changes to media laws, an amendment to the Civil Service Act, or insufficient protection for the fundamental rights of the LGBTI and many others. The European Commission's existing monitoring and regular evaluation tools, including the cooperation and verification mechanism, anti-corruption reports and media monitoring, which already exist today and which you yourself mentioned, are put in place and do not sufficiently guarantee sufficient protection of fundamental rights and values. which the European Union professes. The European Union therefore does not currently have any legally binding mechanism that can successfully monitor the compliance of Member States' legislation with Union values ​​and fundamental values. Although there are instruments that you have mentioned, they are currently unable to draw attention to the serious risk of infringing fundamental rights and freedoms, and we must focus on a clear and precise definition of criteria that are sufficiently binding on infringers and discouraging to be more prompt in the future. could prevent the violation of the rule of law, fundamental rights.

While working on the report, I made proposals that were more in keeping with the ideas of trust, mutual trust and dialogue between states. I wanted an annual pan-European conference with European institutions and governments. I would also like to point out, responding to the voice of my predecessor, who called for a binding and effective mechanism, that such a mechanism is defined by the Treaty of Lisbon.

There is a long way to go to this report and there is going to be a long way to go since the vote, today, by the Commission, and I hope led by Mr Timmermans. We shake off the self-satisfaction that yes, that we are European, that we have built a long period of peace and prosperity, that we have strong values. But, look, I was born in a place where the solid values ​​of peace and coexistence did not exist, where people were persecuted for having different ideas, where the rule of law was turned upside down. And we need these mechanisms because - as a Spanish intellectual says - the crisis we are experiencing is not limited to the terrifying disorder of our financial system or the breakdown of a model of economic growth. We also suffer the consequences of a loss of pulse with respect to our values. And that is why it is good to update; and that is why it is good to ask ourselves these problems; and that is why it is very good that Mrs in 't Veld had the courage and enthusiasm to shake off the harshness that we usually have in these institutions.

The new mechanism has this purpose and for this reason I consider it positive, since the beginning of the great crisis there is no talk of anything other than doing homework, but the tasks are only economic, constitutional democracy is almost never among the primary duties. I hope that the mechanism shifts the accent a little, that it helps to recognize the effects of austerity on rights, such as that to health, to work, to transparent and blameless institutions. A similar mechanism was missing. Article 7 of the treaty is unusable because it is in the hands of governments, therefore not impartial. In the negotiations, I asked that the European institutions be screened like the States. The result satisfies me only in part, because such vigilance is promised but not guaranteed.

How often we hear these days that European values ​​are in danger!

We don't want that, we want to preserve our sovereignty. Many governments and many in the population forget that we created these European values ​​together - the Charter of Fundamental Rights, everyone agreed to it at the time. And we have to defend that. In the past we have not succeeded in creating a sense of togetherness with the existing procedures; that the index finger is no longer pointed at a state, a government, but that we say together: We want to change that, because we do not want democracy, fundamental rights and the rule of law to be in danger. It is also important to me, with this report, with this request, to make it clear that this is not only going against the so-called new Member States - that is, Poland and Hungary. There are also things that are not in order in the old Member States: the state of emergency in France, the ban on demonstrations in Spain or, under Berlusconi, the media power of the Prime Minister at that time a few years ago. That wasn't okay either. We need such a joint pact. We have to do this together.

It was necessary because, despite Europe's ancient tradition in the field of the protection of fundamental rights, despite the rule of law, fundamental rights, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which has been adopted, unfortunately there are different institutional actors and several non-governmental organizations that continue to denounce the numerous violations occurring on European territory. It is evident that a duplication of mechanisms is not necessary, something new is not necessary, but something new is not necessary when what exists works. To date, if these violations continue to occur, it is clear that something is wrong and it is clear that we need something different. This mechanism is necessary because it must be prevented. When it comes to fundamental rights, we cannot wait for the violation to occur and then take initiatives, we must prevent and protect fundamental rights throughout Europe.

The in 't Veld report now claims to supplement it. This report poses both a legal and a political problem. The legal problem arises from the fact that it upsets Article 7. As the Council's legal service explained in an opinion of 27 May 2014, Article 7 in effect gives the Council, and it alone, the power find that a member state violates human rights. However, the in 't Veld report disregards this exclusive competence of the Council by seeking to give the Brussels Commission concurrent powers of assessment by adopting reports and recommendations. On the other hand, the in 't Veld report poses above all a political problem by dealing a new blow to the sovereignty of States. It allows experts without democratic legitimacy to rate states as children according to three degrees of rating symbolized in its initial presentation by a set of three colors: green for good students, yellow for those who can do better and red for those who must be sanctioned. However, in the spirit of the in 't Veld report, the states which must be sanctioned are obviously those which dare to resist the diktat of the European Union. The report does not even hide it since it openly aims to punish two states: Hungary, guilty of resisting the Union's migration policy, and Poland, guilty of refusing to allow its family policy to be dictated by the LGBTI lobby.

It is the Brezhnev doctrine of limited sovereignty, revisited, supported by the so-called liberals, the Greens, the socialists, the Christian Democrats, the Communists, all united. Mr Juncker, I believe, said after Syriza's victory in Greece in January 2015: \"There can be no democratic choice against European treaties\", clearly meaning that no change of government could induce a change of policy . Today it is up to Hungary and Poland to attack, not because human rights are allegedly daily or systematically violated, but to punish these two countries for having elected governments skeptical of the benefits of the crazy European policy of forced redistribution of millions of so-called refugees. The real threat to democracy is the European institutions, which despise the expression of the peoples who do not accept to submit to the Europe of Brussels or to globalism.

Therefore, the proposed mechanism for assessing democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights is Parliament's call for the effectiveness of European institutions against the most serious violations in the Member States.

We call it fundamental rights through the EU system, and that is exactly what it is. Human and civil rights are the basis. Therefore, the defense of these rights must also take precedence over all other considerations. Unfortunately, we often see that it is the opposite. That is why I am glad that this report today leads us to focus on the foundations of EU construction: fundamental rights, where the rule of law is also the basis of democracy. There is a lot of talk about Poland and Hungary today. It is quite true that the development has gone far too far in the wrong direction in these countries. I believe that an Article 7 procedure must be initiated against both of them if the EU is to continue to be taken seriously as a defender of the Union's own fundamental rights. It is important to recall that violations of fundamental rights can occur in all Member States. France deports EU citizens. Sweden restricts free movement with border controls. The Czech Republic and Slovakia segregate children in schools. In 2000, EU sanctions against Austria ended in failure. Almost 17 years later, we are in practically the same situation. Long before I took my seat in the European Parliament, I was on the Barrosso Commission on the candidate countries' respect for human rights.

I have been a Member of the European Parliament since 2004, and unfortunately since then I have seen bitterly the fact that the concern for the rule of law and human rights is measured by a rather double standard, a game of daily political intentions and power relations. For example, in the last 13 years, no infringement of a serious national minority has been understood or echoed by the Commission. The omission was justified by reference to the competence of the Member States. In the same way, no violation was established in 2006, just 10 years ago, when atrocities and brutal violence were perpetrated against people peacefully celebrating in Budapest, as evidenced by the people of the then socialist government. At that time, EU decision-makers were not worried about the state of the Hungarian rule of law. In contrast, there has often been a campaign of the rule of law since then, when the political interest so desires and Hungary can be unjustly attacked, while no specific violations can be identified.

First of all, the realisation that free societies rest on a tripod – democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights – pre-dates the European Union. It pre-dates the Treaty of Rome and is something that free European societies at the end of the 1940s came to realise as a consequence of what they had seen happening before and during the war, when democracy was used to impose tyranny and the rule of law was used to take away fundamental rights from individuals. So what I want to say is that when we talk about democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights, we should make it very clear that this is what free societies are based upon, having been established at the end of the 1940s within the Council of Europe, when the Iberian Peninsula was suffering under dictatorship, the Iron Curtain was coming down and half of Europe was under Communist oppression. That is when free societies realised that we need to avoid the mistakes of the past and bring freedom to everyone – the tripod of democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights. And whenever one tries to use democracy against the rule of law or against fundamental rights or vice versa things will go wrong: that, I believe, is the basis upon which we should found our work.  Because at the end of the day everyone in Europe belongs to a minority. Whether you are a minority or a majority depends only on your perspective. It depends on where you stand. At the end of the day in a democracy you may be in the majority today, but you will be in the minority tomorrow if the voters so decide. And if you use the majority to marginalise or push away the rights of the minority you might receive the same treatment yourself after the next round of elections. So we have a fundamental reason to fight for this tripod and the need is going to be permanent, because there are always going to be challenges.  Now, what do we need to reach that goal? That is the question that we need to discuss today. I have listened very carefully to all the points made today. After your vote we in the Commission will think about how we will react, but let me make it very clear that, to my mind, the goals which we share should not dictate the means that we use to reach those goals. We will be constructive in discussing the report with the European Parliament, but, speaking as a pragmatic man, I believe that we should work towards a position in which we can make sure that fundamental rights, the rule of law and democracy are protected everywhere in the European Union and look for the best means to do that.  I say this also against the backdrop of xenophobic incidents increasing across the European Union – east, west, north and south. I say this in a public debate which is turning sour in quite a number of Member States, putting minorities, and sometimes even majorities, on the receiving end. Women and political, ethnic, religious, and sexual minorities are all under pressure today, and we have the obligation to make sure that everyone’s rights are protected.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 65, "date": "2016-10-25.json", "name": "Sophia in 't Veld", "mepid": "28266", "text": "  rapporteur. – Mr President, I would like to thank my colleagues for a very interesting debate and for all the support. I would just like to briefly say to that side of the House (which has largely disappeared incidentally): I have heard a lot of hysterical language about dictatorships and imposing values, tyranny, submission, treason. I would just like to point out that 28 countries decided to join the European Union voluntarily.  They signed up to the Treaties voluntarily and the Treaties include Article 2. For those who have read the articles: Article 1 in the Treaties basically says ‘Hello, everybody’ and then Article 2 is about what we are all about as a European Union – a community of values.  The irony is that we have endowed the European Union with the instruments to enforce all the other policy areas: competition policies, police and justice cooperation, foreign policies, etc. But our core values are not protected by instruments that are sufficiently strong to make sure that the values are upheld throughout the European Union.  I very much concur with what Commissioner Timmermans just said: it is all about the objectives and not so much about the means. But I do hope that I misunderstood when I thought I heard you say in your initial presentation, Commissioner Timmermans, that you think that the existing tools are sufficient, because there I disagree and I think that has been echoed by everybody in the House.  I think that we all expect that the mechanism you have triggered against the Polish Government is not, unfortunately, going to lead to an improvement in the situation in Poland. Nobody expects that by the end of this week the Polish Government is going to say: we are going to follow up on your recommendations. I would have hoped that they would, but they are probably not going to do that. So we do need a mechanism that has a preventative arm that applies to all the Member States. I think that is really a key principle. Also, in response to your question: yes, I do think it should be on a regular, preferably an annual, basis and not be incident-driven, because if it is incident-driven then there is the inherent risk that decisions to intervene will be politically motivated, and we want to avoid that. One final remark about the panel of independent experts: I hear people expressing concerns about this. I would recommend people read the text because it is very clear that the lead is with the Commission. The Commission will adopt the annual report but it will do so in consultation with the panel of independent experts that will be partly nominated by the Member States and partly by this Parliament. Finally, I would like to remind the Commission, and colleagues, that it is not as if we are reinventing the wheel. We already have the justice scoreboard, the corruption report, the corruption and verification mechanism (CVM) for Bulgaria and Romania, the media pluralism monitor, the fundamental rights report, the reports on access to documents, the Schengen evaluations, etc. These mechanisms also include panels of independent experts and country-specific recommendations, so we are not inventing something new.  I look forward to the Commission’s proposal. I hope that we can have a constructive dialogue, as we have had inside this House in the political groups, the same dialogue between the institutions and come up with something that will really serve democracy, the rule of law, and fundamental rights throughout the European Union.

It is unfortunate that they did not include references to the Christian roots of Europe, which were so much talked about by the founders Schuman, Adenauer, De Gasperi. That is why the EU is experiencing a crisis of values ​​and respect for rights, having lost the right starting point that existed at the time of the formation of the European Community. The treaties are lifeless, so it is no surprise that so many Member States and their citizens do not accept the technocratic enforcement of the rules and regulations enshrined in the EU treaties. The proposals in the report, which, with the help of the EU institutions, in particular the European Commission, are trying to give the Member States a decisive say on issues relating to values ​​and norms, are not a good solution. The societies of individual states must be given the opportunity to decide their own destiny through referendums or constitutional revisions without undue outside interference.

It is the first occasion that we have had to meet here in the margins of this important debate. Commissioner, your portfolio is extremely important for the Security Union and we, as a Presidency, are very keen to work together with you. Honourable Members, many thanks for giving us the opportunity to express the views of the Council on this very important issue. I would like to start by recalling what the honourable Members Hohlmeier and Gonzales Pons have mentioned recently, to the effect that we have managed within the last year ‘remarkable legislative progress’ to prevent and fight terrorism. I think this is very important and should be recognised right at the beginning.  But, of course, the urgency of putting in place measures to prevent and fight terrorism, while maintaining an open and free society, has only increased following the many attacks which have taken place since then. Even if security is, let me say, primarily the Member States’ responsibility, political expectations for the EU and its citizens to deliver and ensure security are very high. The first point I want to make is on information exchange. The Council is highly committed to implementing the renewed Internal Security Strategy for the years 2015-2020, and one of the most important elements here is improving information exchange and accessibility, especially by ensuring the interoperability of different information systems.  The Council in June endorsed a roadmap on information exchange and information management in the Justice and Home Affairs area, and will regularly review its implementation. It contains 50 practical short and medium-term actions and long-term orientations. Their aim is to make sure that practitioners, such as policemen and border guards, have speedy and effective access to high quality information.  A number of actions of the roadmap will be taken forward by the High—Level Expert Group on information systems and interoperability. This group will play an important role in developing a long-term vision for the future architecture of the EU information systems and databases by ensuring their interoperability. While of course we should never be complacent, I daresay that there has been substantive progress over the past year. Let me give you two examples: (1) via the Europol Information System (EIS) and (2) the Schengen Information System. In the EIS, the number of terrorism-related objects has increased in the third quarter of this year by 20% (to a total of over 13 000) in comparison to the second quarter. The number of searches, and this is important, conducted in the EIS in the third quarter sets a new record, and brings the total number of searches performed this year to more than one million for the first time in the history of the system. As for the Schengen Information System (SIS), the number of alerts on persons under Article 36 of the SIS II Decision has nearly doubled since 2014, reaching almost 90 000. As regards information sharing by the security services, Europol has created the possibility for counter-terrorism units to communicate bilaterally using the secure information exchange network, SIENA, and is now upgrading it to EU confidential level. The European Counter Terrorism Centre (ECTC) has been operational since January 2016 and is also contributing to stepping up information-sharing and operational cooperation. The second point, on radicalisation: this must obviously be addressed, primarily by the Member States, but also, in order to be effective, by coordinated support at European level in accordance with the Treaties. As a follow-up to the Commission communication of June this year, the Education Council that will take place in November will adopt conclusions on preventing radicalisation leading to violent extremism. These conclusions reflect the broad approach that we need to take and highlight also the preventive role of education and youth work. Another important conference will be organised by the Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN), in cooperation with the Commission, and it will also take place in November. Furthermore, it is crucial to focus on online initiatives and the work of the Europol Internet Referral Unit. Cooperation with service providers has proven successful, and approximately 90% of the content considered illegal was taken down by service providers. We look forward to the new initiatives of the EU Internet Forum to be launched by the Commission in December this year. In order to fight online radicalisation, nevertheless, we need to build the most effective partnership between government and industry.  I would like to mention two more issues very quickly – I am aware of the time limit, but it is important. First, on the victims of terrorism, the recent terrorist attacks have once again reminded us that our emergency services must be prepared for rapid and efficient interventions in very difficult security conditions. This requires enhanced cooperation between different actors at national and EU level, including emergency and security services.  Terrorist attacks are likely to cause a high number of victims requiring very specific medical treatment, not to mention psychological support which has to be provided, not only to survivors, but also to the families of the victims and to the witnesses of the events. I could continue on this but I would like to say we are paying attention also to the consequence management of terrorist attacks. Let me remind you of the Union Civil Protection Mechanism which was adopted in 2013. Secondly, and this is my last point, on irregular migratory flows, which is also very important in the current context of the migratory crisis, the Council has, in particular via the Integrated Political Crisis Response mechanism, worked intensively with relevant Member States, the Commission and EU agencies, to ensure an adequate response to the possible abuse of refugee and migration routes by terrorists. Of course, the most important points when it comes to the current routes are in Greece and Italy, but there are different types of security checks going on here and they are conducted in the various places on the work floor in these hotspots. One of the priorities in this area was the recruitment by Europol of national police officers who will be deployed together with Europol officers in the Greek hotspots, and also in Italy, as soon as possible.  Mr President, I took a bit longer than expected, but this is a very complex issue. There are many more important elements that should be mentioned, but this was the most important part, which I wanted to share with you.

I hope this will become a regular fixture for future plenaries. My colleague Dimitris Avramopoulos would very much like to have been here this morning, but he sends his apologies. So this first report looks at the period from the Commission’s April 2016 communication, which also launched the Security Union, up until October, and it focuses on home and justice areas in particular. In future, the scope of these reports will be broader, given the cross-cutting nature of the Security Union, which is, as you know, an initiative that encompasses a broad swathe of the Commission’s work. Indeed it brings together more than 20 directorates-general. President Juncker’s idea when he created this role was to drive the delivery of work in this vital area, and I will work with my colleagues across the Commission to make sure that we deliver what we have all signed up to, to plug the gaps, and to make sure that our response keeps pace with the constantly shifting threats we face. We need to act simultaneously on two fronts. First, to close down the space in which terrorists and criminals operate and to deny them the means they use – money, munitions, movement. This also includes working on prevention of terrorism and working to counter radicalisation. Second, to build our resilience, to strengthen our information systems by making them more joined up, and to reinforce our critical infrastructure, particularly our transport, energy and cyber security, which are too often targeted by terrorists and criminals. As I have said before, all of this only works if it respects our fundamental rights and values. These are the very rights and values that terrorists in particular are setting out to destroy. In terms of the fight against terrorism, I welcome the commitment of this Parliament to conclude as soon as possible the negotiations on the counter-terrorism directive. I would like also to assure you of my strong support for your efforts to finalise the work on systematic checks on external borders. It is important that we do this, given the risks associated with the possible return of foreign fighters. As regards the means used to support terrorism, I am glad the co-legislators have started work on the amendments to the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive. The majority of measures in the action plan against the illicit trafficking and use of firearms and explosives have now been implemented or are in hand. The implementing regulation on firearms deactivation entered into force in April this year and will cut substantially access for terrorists to such firearms. But I wanted to add that the co-legislators now urgently need to close the remaining gaps in the trilogue, which I think is taking place today, to reach agreement on the revision of the Firearms Directive, to take military assault weapons off the streets. It is nearly a year since the Paris attacks. The Commission produced its proposals rapidly and they have been thoroughly discussed. Our citizens will simply not understand a continuing delay. Fighting terrorism also means tackling the causes of terrorism, including radicalisation. We have to fight ideas with ideas. Identifying and taking down terrorist propaganda is vital, as has been said, but developing persuasive counter-narratives that offer a clear alternative vision, backed up by opportunities and incentives, is the only way of tapping into the same idealism which radicalisation exploits. We have to target the people the recruiters are targeting and offer them a different and better path. That means education, employment and inclusion. The Commission is helping – funding work on counter-narratives through the RAN, through targeted use of Erasmus+, the Youth Guarantee, and financial support through the European Social Fund. Tackling this challenge takes time. I visited Mechelen, near Brussels, earlier earlier this month, a place with similar demographics to Molenbeek – but in the case of Mechelen there are no foreign fighters. This reflects 15 years’ worth of investment led by grassroot initiatives, combining a tough approach on law enforcement with sustained work on prevention and deradicalisation that has given young people a greater sense of self-worth and a greater sense of their community. I am happy that this long-term sustained approach is shared by Parliament, and I am looking forward to contributing to the debate which the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) will hold on combating radicalisation later in November. As well as taking the fight to terrorists and criminals, we need to build our resilience, to protect our citizens and our society, to strengthen our information systems, as has been mentioned, to reinforce our infrastructure, to reduce vulnerabilities. This means work on the interoperability of our information systems, where will be accelerating the work of the High Level Experts Group to produce an interim report and actions before Christmas. It also means developing a system of robust risk analysis, security research and the systematic cooperation between law enforcement agencies and the private sector. During my hearing I was very clear about the need to ensure appropriate implementation of what we have already agreed. We have got to deliver what we agreed, however hard and occasionally unglamorous that may be. The Commission is ready to support national authorities with technical assistance, exchange of best practice and, in many cases, financially, but Member States need to do their part. The PNR Directive is a case in point. This is a key instrument in the fight against terrorism, with the transposition deadline of May 2018. Few Member States yet have in place the necessary infrastructure to handle the data. A number have plans and projects underway, but 11 Member States have yet to start work. In other cases where the deadline for Member States’ transposition has already passed, the Commission will not hesitate to launch infringements – as was the case this September, when for the first time the Commission initiated infringement procedures for non-transposition of elements of the Prüm Network. Finally, let me stress another recurring theme. We need to make full use of the existing instruments we have at our disposal. Our agencies need to be strengthened and their support should be better used. For example, after the Paris attacks, Europol assigned 60 officers to support the French and Belgian investigations in Taskforce Fraternité. Data provided to Europol by Belgium and France enabled it to come up with 800 intelligence leads and more than 1 600 leads on suspicious financial transactions. Eurojust also played a key role in the aftermath of these attacks in what were legally complex cross-border investigations, and the new Europol regulation that will enter into application in May 2017 offers us new opportunities that we should seize. I realise I have spoken for too long, but as you can see, this is a broad range of work that we are reporting on, and initiating a monthly reporting cycle should allow us to be able to discuss specific issues in more depth in the future and ensure that all institutions have an updated picture on the state of implementation of these important initiatives.

First of all, I would like to thank you for giving you the impression, at least for the first time, that something is really going on, where we discussed information exchange years ago, about the use of the SIS system, that actually the relevant people or also Things are registered. That the member states inform each other better that Europol can function better as a coordination body - that seems to be getting underway step by step and is becoming much more complete. What I am still concerned with is the fact that I am observing the negotiations a great deal - I will now take my own terrorism directive - the difficulty of the Member States making commitments. For example, if I take the exchange of information and, in addition, the obligation of the Member States to exchange relevant information, the Member States are still very reluctant to commit. When I think of the question of how we deal with the fact that we have a huge number of weapons that, from the former so-called Yugoslav war up to the present day, play into terrorism and the arms trade - and on an unbelievable scale - then I believe that we not only have to observe the arms trade as a whole, but above all the Darknet, and prevent that huge amounts of trade are carried out within the Darknet that we do not want to have.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 77, "date": "2016-10-25.json", "name": "Birgit Sippel", "mepid": "96932", "text": "on behalf of the S&D Group. -  Mister President! In order to fight cross-border crime, including terrorism, the cooperation between our Member States needs the exchange of relevant information. What is decided jointly on this must also be implemented everywhere. I remember - it has already been mentioned - the Prüm decision on the exchange of vehicle and DNA data. The implementation should take place in August 2011. Here the Commission had to initiate infringement proceedings against 5 Member States. There is also a lack of implementation and information exchange in other areas. It is therefore imperative that we focus our work on applying the measures that have been decided. But in fact something new is always asked for. Example: European Passenger Name Data Collection - insanely important, or maybe not. This is because 11 member states are currently unable to meet the 2018 implementation deadline. I myself consider this directive in its adopted form to be contrary to fundamental rights and that brings me to a further challenge. Terrorist attacks target our open societies, freedom and democracy. But it is precisely these that need to be sustainably strengthened and defended. Massive collections of more and more data potentially suspect all citizens. The simultaneous neglect of data security and data protection offers criminals attack surfaces and endangers our fundamental rights. Particularly when it comes to the interoperability of data collections, their necessity and data protection issues must be carefully examined. In principle, the discussion about new measures and more and more surveillance carries the risk of creating a latent feeling of constant uncertainty. That, too, can nurture the soil for far-right forces - including hatred, threats and violence. In fact, politicians and their families, voluntary citizens, people with a migration background, police officers and many others are currently being massively threatened from the right - probably not only in Germany. The killing of a police officer in Bavaria last week is just terrifying evidence. The fight against organized crime and terrorism must not obstruct the view of other challenges. The defense of the rule of law and open societies does not need action, but a sense of proportion, because whoever gives up freedom in order to gain security can ultimately lose both.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 78, "date": "2016-10-25.json", "name": "Helga Stevens", "mepid": "125105", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. - When we talk about security within the Union, I am also thinking of certain marginalized population groups in which the phenomenon of Muslim extremism unfortunately occurs prominently, for example young people from high-risk neighborhoods, who are encouraged by criminal friends or charismatic radicalized figures. Terrorism often follows crime, but community and the sense of identity also play a significant role. The terrorist Abdeslam, for example, moved to Brussels after the attack in Paris and immediately found shelter with a family: with a father, mother and son in Molenbeek. That is why I wondered how those communities can be taken out of marginality. Since 2005, the EU has systematically supported Member States in their efforts to combat violent extremism. The 2015 Security Agenda builds on this, after which the Commission launched seven new priorities in mid-2016. A toolkit was also announced to better detect and combat extremism and thus keep our society open, free and inclusive. It is important that victims and disillusioned terrorists are also involved. These are good measures, but the best means for a cohesive society is nevertheless activation and participation in the form of language training and counseling in finding work. Mandatory integration is also an absolute key point in the fight against terror. In Brussels, for example, an integration program is still not compulsory.

Commissioner, I very much welcome your intention of giving us a monthly update. On the evaluation, I also very much appreciate your emphasis on the need for evaluation of the implementation, and indeed the PNR case demonstrates that. Although I personally voted against the directive, I think it is extremely silly to pass laws which are not then implemented. I also wonder where the rush came from, if now the Member States are not acting six months after the adoption. I think we should also get a bit more information about the – in total now – EUR 130 million which are being spent on PNR. But we should not only evaluate the implementation but also the effectiveness. If you compare it to the war on drugs, that has failed dramatically. Is the war on terror any more successful? I do not know, because we have passed so many laws and spent so much money, and the threat levels seem to be going up, not down. We seem to get less of a grip on the phenomenon, not more. We should also evaluate the impact on fundamental rights and the rule of law, as you have mentioned. But I would also like to see included in your monthly updates the need for democratic and judicial oversight and more transparency and accountability, because I think that is sorely lacking. While defending our democracy and rule of law against terrorist attacks, we seem to be throwing the baby out with the bathwater. So I really hope that you are going to focus more on that. Three final remarks. First of all, on prevention: I also welcome your statements on that, because I think that so far we have done a terrible job on prevention. I think we have made matters worse by creating deep divisions in society. Secondly, we all agree on the urgent need for more information-sharing. But, as I said in the previous debate, information-sharing is a lot more than just interconnectivity. That is the technical side of things, but we now need to actually share information, and not on a voluntary, ad hoc, random basis, but systematically. Finally, in the report that this House adopted in 2011, we stressed already very heavily the need to invest a lot more in what they call HUMINT – human intelligence, people on the ground. I think that the situation in Belgium and the investigation that they did has shown that the real problem is insufficient capacity.

Instead, they hoard billions of data for illustrious security measures, such as a magpie collects glittering objects in its nest. And you think a lot helps a lot. Your policy really suffers from two fundamental flaws: On the one hand, you invest incredibly little in the preventive area, which you thankfully talked about today, but you rely almost exclusively on repression. Both prevention and repression are disproportionate, and you are doing nothing really relevant to drying up the sources of finance for terrorism. Your friendship with Saudi Arabia and all the other dictators is worth a lot more to you. On the other hand - and this is very important to me - you do not have the proportionality between security and fundamental rights on your agenda. Fundamental rights such as the right to informational self-determination are being sacrificed for security without hesitation, billions of data from citizens are stored and filtered, fundamental judgments of the European Court of Justice are ignored, and citizens simply become a minor figure.

On the exchange of information, the PNR or the “anti-terrorism” directive, states are constantly playing a double game. Last spring, they told us that it was urgent to adopt the PNR, hinting at us as irresponsible. This report reveals that almost no Member State has made progress in its implementation. Ditto for the “anti-terrorism” directive, on which we are currently working. While the Member States urge us to adopt it as soon as possible and believe that we do not have time to carry out an impact assessment, these same States want a transposition period of two years instead of .

Citizens are tired of being made fun of, they are tired of being invaded by thousands of illegal immigrants who steal, peddle, commit crime. It is hell!

In fact, each Member State of the Union has a different level of internal security, depending on factors, the majority of which depend on the internal conditions of each state and the form of its society. The European Union has done nothing more than add problems to countries. One can very easily start from the Balkans and find oneself in Denmark by road, transporting all kinds of illegal goods, from drugs to weapons, ready to be used in terrorist attacks. The so-called border controls that have been imposed, apart from creating traffic congestion at the border, serve nothing more, as they are not just controls. Finally, how many of you in here can responsibly say that we have seen the end of terrorist attacks? Worse, how many can say that we have done or are ready to do everything in our power to prevent past or future terrorist attacks?

My view is that we need to focus on updating, terrorism and prevention. Who are our enemies? How do they equip themselves? How do they recruit new members? Where do they get funding from? How do they work together? How do they organize? We know very well that we have an asymmetric threat, as we know we are vulnerable. You just said that there are eleven Member States that do not yet have sufficient or no infrastructure to implement the PNR. But what interests the European Union and us here is which Member States do not want, do not have the will or are unable to implement what we decide. It is certain, Commissioner, that the policies we are pursuing run counter to some ideologies that want to believe that personal freedoms are being falsified by security measures. What we all need to understand is that, wherever terrorists come from, this threat is to the European Union, to the European mentality, to the way of thinking, and that the greatest security, organized security, is itself the one that ensures civil liberties.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 86, "date": "2016-10-25.json", "name": "Tanja Fajon (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "96911", "text": "- Security is a value that is very important to European citizens. In a recent Eurobarometer survey, more than 80 percent of citizens said they wanted more action at Union level. But security is multifaceted for me: security against junk food, protection of privacy, independence of the media, effective rule of law. And we must not forget another aspect, namely protection against excessive security, which would infringe on fundamental rights. In its response to the terrorist attacks, the Commission has responded with a number of new measures. While I welcome proportionate, truly necessary and effective measures, many are also moving in the direction of undermining fundamental rights. And I believe that the very fragile relationship between security and other measures in the Union has already been broken. We need to make much more effort, as you yourself mentioned, to combat the radicalization of young people. Suburbs like Moellenbeck are a big challenge and we have good practices in the European Union, Denmark for example, on how to help young people who are pushed to the margins of society. Commissioner, at our meeting and in the LIBE Committee, you called for a thorough review and evaluation of the effectiveness of all existing security measures. We at the European Parliament will keep your word - we are still awaiting this review. And until there is cooperation between the security intelligence services, the authorities, the police and the judiciary, no new measures will help us. The same applies to the pointless establishment of a series of databases if personal systems are not interconnected. In Europe, we are somehow building, these days it seems, a fortress, impermeable borders. We are renovating the asylum system, which will be completely inaccessible to people in need of protection. And Mr King, I very much regret that the Commission will take a positive decision today on the extension of internal border controls, although you yourself acknowledge that there are no valid reasons for them.

In this regard, Commissioner, I look forward to, and I hope you will take care of, a Commission proposal to harmonize the security features of European identity cards.

You need a police force close to the citizen, that gives people a feeling of security. Second, we need an effective security policy and measures. The studies show very clearly that the investigation rates and crime statistics will remain at about the same level if we continue to rely on surveillance without cause, if we rely on data collections on unsuspecting people. If we start specifically with incident-related investigations, cross-border investigations, there will be improvements, and if we invest more in the police. Last, third point: structural security.

Ladies and gentlemen, future challenges are linked to the increase in terrorism. The weaker the terror is in the occupied territories and in failed states, the more it will hit Western targets. The security of a Member State is the security of the Union as a whole. Therefore, we must give a global response. But first of all we must tell ourselves the truth: we do not have a common security policy; we don't have an intelligence community; we do not have a common judicial space; we do not have a common defense policy.

I also visited Mechelen, Commissioner King, and in fact, the more youth jobs are destroyed, the more inclusive social policies are destroyed, the more recruits the European Union Member States are offering to violent extremist groups. The Council may well be concerned with the return of foreign fighters or the infiltration of migrants. The terrorists who hit us in Paris or Brussels were European-made. In addition, by fueling the business of traffickers' networks and organized crime associated with the lack of opening up legal and safe access routes to Europe for immigrant refugees, in addition to the serious human rights violations that we have already experienced on European soil, including thousands of unaccompanied minors who have disappeared, all this only demonstrates the inconsistency, ineptitude of the so-called anti-terrorist policies of the Member States. Two other fundamental problems persist: firstly, the resistance of States to share information, to interoperate services, as Commissioner King said.

In preparation for this, are you working, at least on behalf of the European Commission, to ensure that these gaps do not arise and that the 500 million citizens can count on complete security?

I will also have an opportunity myself to go into a little bit of detail on some of these points with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) early in November.  As Mrs Fajon said, more than 80% of our citizens are looking for more reassurance from EU—level activity in support of our Member States on the security agenda. As Mr Albrecht said, people want to feel more secure and there are a range of things that we can do at EU level to help and support Member States. I am reassured that Mrs Hohlmeier thinks that we are starting to get some things done on terrorism, on cybercrime and on organised crime, as Mrs Ferrara underlined. We need to do what we have collectively agreed. I am in no doubt about that. As Mrs in 't Veld and Mr Deprez, among others, underlined, that is crucial not only because of the importance of the individual measures, but also to reassure people about the credibility of our work in this field. I am also absolutely convinced that we need to focus on what works and that involves a critical assessment of what we have been doing. Mrs Joly and others underlined that. I take that very seriously. I gave a commitment during my appearance in front of the LIBE Committee that we would work on an evaluation of this policy area, and we will. I agree with Mrs Stevens, Mrs Gomes and others that we need to continue with an intelligent and sustained approach to prevention, as well as taking the fight to terrorism and serious criminality. In all of that I am completely committed to full respect for fundamental rights, because we have a clear objective. Our objective, as many of you have said, is to defend our open societies and that is to act grounded in the rule of law.  I will make two points in response to questions that have come up. On implementation and the particular case of the implementation of PNR underlined by Mrs Sippel and various others, we are not in infringement territory because the transposition date is Spring 2018, but we do need to work together with all the Member States to achieve the common shared objective of effective implementation by that date. To that end, I am going be producing an implementation roadmap in November, which will set out in concrete terms the steps that need to be taken and how we can work together to achieve them. My last particular point has regard to a number of comments made this morning about the relationship between migration and terrorism.

This is undoubtedly a question of the disastrous Arab springs and the decisions of the French, British and Italian authorities to support the rebels. Another equally important factor is the hybrid war that Russia has waged against the West. I do not only think about Ukraine, but also about cyber attacks and disinformation directed at the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, including my homeland, Poland.

We have therefore rightly increased the competences of Europol and Eurojust, since a more effective fight against terrorists requires a revival of international cooperation.

For example, after long discussions, it was decided that the EU countries and the United States would automatically exchange information about air passengers.

The penalties must be proportionate and therefore cannot be based on the value of the goods, as this could lead to a disproportionate system whereing a minor infringement committed in relation to a high-value commodity could have disastrous consequences for the company.

On the other hand, distortions of competition arising from disparities between national legal regimes are much less harmful than those resulting from the social, environmental and fiscal dumping practised by some Member States within the European Union itself. Dumping helps accelerate deindustrialization in Western countries, resulting in increased unemployment, poverty and social inequality.

The Council stalled the proposal which was presented by the Commission two years ago.

Within the EU, the different enforcement of customs legislation makes the effective management of the Customs Union harder.

The adoption of such an approach is also in line with the EU's WTO obligations to adopt convergent sanctioning systems.  The Commission's proposal calls on Member States to have efficient, proportionate and dissuasive customs sanctioning systems converged by the application of a modernised customs code and the use of electronic means. These measures would encourage trade and increase compliance, ensure penalties commensurate with circumvented taxes and distinguish between criminal and civil penalties.

This is what the report emphasises by designing their penetration with foreign direct investment, even focusing on specific sectors, such as automotive, aircraft manufacturing, energy infrastructure, renewable energy, etc. On the other hand, 'human rights', as the EU perceives them, will continue to be a pretext for political pressure, which will facilitate the aspirations of business groups.

This has left a regulatory and operational vacuum at European level, facilitating the transnational activities of organised criminal groups. The current EU political cycle to combat organised crime must therefore place the emphasis on combating associative crime and provide for the criminalisation of membership of a criminal association regardless of the consumption of fine crime. Among the priorities, in order to put in place a genuine European anti-corruption strategy, the fight against money laundering, corruption and trafficking in human beings must also be included.

When it comes to respecting the fundamental principles on which the Union is founded, all too often the Member States are reluctant to follow the Commission's invitations, in its role as guarantor of the Treaties, or openly refuse. All this leads to an erosion of mutual trust and public confidence in the institutions. The time has therefore come to develop a systematic, impartial and comprehensive procedure that monitors and guarantees respect for the founding values of the Union, both by the Member States and by the European institutions themselves.

The Work Programme is the Commission’s commitment to you, and to Europeans, about what we will do in the coming year. There are no surprises in what we announce today. The Work Programme makes concrete the policy priorities that President Juncker set out in his State of the Union speech and which we confirmed in the letter of intent. This is a focused agenda centred on the big things, a principle this Commission has applied since the start of the mandate. It reflects our commitment to the ten priorities on the basis of which you appointed us. Like you, we have listened closely to people’s concerns. The challenges for our Union today are well known, and citizens feel them in their daily lives: jobs; inequality; the still nascent economic recovery that has yet to deliver for all; migration flows which have tested our external borders – and, I may add, our internal cohesion; the terrorist threat; ongoing instability in our neighbouring countries. Europe cannot be the answer to all the problems, but Europe certainly needs to be part of the solution to the biggest and most pressing issues. Together, we have a shared responsibility to deliver where it matters most and where only working together can make a real difference. To protect Europeans’ interests and quality of life, as well as the security, fairness and well—being of our societies; to empower citizens and give them a perspective for a sustainable future for themselves and their families and to defend people’s rights – we already had a debate about that this morning. The 21 new key initiatives we propose today are grounded on the ten priorities and the strategies we have presented to implement them. We commit to delivering on these proposals by the end of 2017. Our agenda has been enriched by our dialogue with this House, by the discussions we have had here in plenary and your resolution of July, as well as a day and a half of intensive and constructive exchanges between the College and the Conference of Committee Chairs, which I think was excellent. It is also in line with the priorities identified by 27 Heads of State or Government in Bratislava. This broad degree of consensus about what we should be doing is very welcome indeed, but announcements and proposals are not what matter. Results do. We are therefore committed to working intensively and constructively with you and with the Member States in the Council to reach timely and ambitious agreements on the many proposals that we have already presented. We have listed the most important proposals, as we see them, in the Work Programme. The new interinstitutional agreement on better lawmaking includes a commitment by the three institutions to agree a joint declaration, to be signed by the three Presidents, on priorities for the coming year. We look forward to working with you to jointly agree to move ahead quickly on the proposals that can make the most difference on the ground. We have already seen, with the European Border and Coast Guard and with European Fund for Strategic Investments, what we can achieve when we all put our full efforts into negotiations. Agreeing proposals is just the start of the story. In the coming year, the Commission will put a particular emphasis on implementation and enforcement work, making sure that EU rules are properly applied and enforced across all policy areas, including the internal market and the environment. We will also continue our efforts to improve existing legislation and make it more fit for purpose, more proportionate, and better able to deliver on the policy goals it is supposed to achieve. In the next year we will integrate regulatory fitness in our key initiatives, as well as bring forward a further 18 refit proposals to improve existing law, taking into account the input we have had from stakeholders and Member States in the REFIT Platform. We have also published a short brochure which shows how REFIT is an integral part of delivering on our ten priorities. We are also proposing to withdraw some 19 pending proposals, which are outdated or are no longer needed for technical reasons, and to repeal 16 pieces of obsolete existing legislation. Let me end by recalling what I said at the start. The focus of this Commission is squarely on delivery, but we cannot do it alone. This is a joint responsibility, a responsibility to ensure that our Union makes a real impact and protects, empowers and defends Europeans. This Commission looks forward to working with you in the next weeks and months to make that a reality through the results we deliver together. The last couple of years have been really encouraging for our mutual cooperation in many areas that are very important today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3273, "date": "2016-10-25.json", "name": "József Szájer", "mepid": "23821", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, in thanking Vice-President Timmermans for his presentation of the Commission Work Programme 2017, I would like to follow from where he left off by saying that the Commission should not, and does not need to do it alone, because in Parliament this year there was an exemplary procedure for preparation of the Commission Work Programme 2017. Basically the Groups tabled in Parliament, in time to influence the Commission’s decisions this October, the joint resolution on the principles of the Work Programme 2017.  I think also there are some new elements in this process because the new modified or modernised interinstitutional agreement is also something which is aimed at making the cooperation between the three institutions much better. I would like to underline that we would agree with the content which you presented, Mr Timmermans, and which was based very much on what we have been bringing together here in Parliament among the different political Groups. I also agree, and my Group agrees too, with the method and the better law-making method, but in general, as well, that the Union should be big on big things and small on small things. The main important thing is that the single market is a great achievement and source of satisfaction but it still needs to be expanded and the digital dimension is where we should go the most. Economic recovery, as you have mentioned, is still fragile. The strategic investment plan has already shown results and should be managed in the future in a more effective way. Conditions to modernise the labour market and facilitate mobility. And here is the issue of migration where we are still here, discussing what to do about the distribution of migrants inside and how to stop this crisis and how to create the necessary conditions.

We believe that the Commission Work Programme this year cannot be defined as business as usual. Europe needs a new road map, and the Commission Work Programme is just a first step in this direction. We can recognise many of the concerns of the European Parliament strategic resolution adopted on 6 July, but let me underline the concerns which are not clear and not presented strongly enough in the Commission adopted document. First of all on the social pillar. It is not enough to have a social pillar updating social standards. We need to have the means to really deliver on these social standards. Secondly, when it comes to growth, investment and jobs, it is not enough to speak about the European Fund for Strategic Investment and the Youth Guarantee. We need to have a much more comprehensive investment strategy led by Europe 2020 and sustainable development goals, and this should be translated into industrial and trade policy to be updated in Europe. This should be translated into a pro-growth economic policy; it must be translated into a Community budget with higher ceilings; and it should be translated into a proper fiscal capacity ensuring convergence inside the Eurozone. So these points must be more clearly committed by the Commission before Parliament. Then of course, we believe that if we have strong internal cohesion with European citizens, it will be easier to deal with external challenges – hosting refugees, managing migration and addressing security concerns. We believe we do need these new tools for defence and security, but to have a proper road map in Rome, we need to go beyond the one which was sketched out in Bratislava.

We need to focus on what is needed, not just on what is urgent, and there are many issues. On the borders of Europe we see war and violence, precarious relationships with our neighbours, especially Russia. Many European countries have witnessed the horror of terrorism and many people are still facing real economic hardships. Our leaders are changing too. We will soon have a new US President and then elections across much of Europe, so we will need new relationships. And then there is the issue of Brexit. A new relationship is needed between Britain and the EU. I hope it will be, I wish it to be, a cooperative one. There is a lot of work to be done.

I would like to start by noting that the Council, except for the honourable gentleman here, seems to be absent for the debate, although you refer specifically to the Bratislava declaration in the document on the priorities, so I think it would have been proper for the Council to be present in greater numbers. I always find this kind of debate very difficult because we talk about matters or issues that we all find very important, but for some reason I get the feeling that most citizens do not really care that much. I commend the European Commission for trying to cut red tape, focus on the essential, etc., but I wonder if that is really what citizens are lying awake over. Repealing a law for energy labels for vacuum cleaners, fine, but is that really what is keeping people awake at night? I think that people are terribly concerned about the way that the European Union is working and one of the things, I think, that should be at the top of the list is transparency and accountability. You mention it in the document and yet I know that in practice, when we ask for documents, when we want to get information – I am not talking about you personally, but within the Commission, the Council, and yes, the European Parliament too – there is still a culture of confidentiality and secrecy. If we really want to regain the trust of citizens, that is something that we should address and should, I think, really put at the top of our list. Secondly, better law-making, in my view, is not only about cutting red tape and repealing legislation that is considered unnecessary. It also means passing legislation that will stand up in court. Now we have seen safe harbours and data retention scrapped, and as regards PNR and Canada we do not know. We see that the Council is now making all kinds of agreements with Turkey and other countries, and these seem to have no basis whatsoever in the Treaties. We do not know who anyone is accountable to; we do not know who is exercising oversight. That is not better law-making: it is terrible law-making. It is neither democratic nor transparent nor accountable. So if we really want to regain trust, those are the issues that we should be focusing on, and that includes ourselves: we can be critical of ourselves rather about subject headings.

Indeed, I also only received it 30 minutes before 3pm so I also had the privilege of a long reading time of more or less half an hour now.  Looking at what is on the table and what First Vice-President Timmermans was explaining to us in plenary, as to how we are going about things, I think we should just scrap this self-congratulatory tone. We are in a serious situation and still there are not so many people who feel involved and feel that the European Union is there on their behalf. I think that is still our biggest concern, for us all. We want a European Union that works for our citizens, for our consumers, and I think a lot of things need to be improved there. That is also why I get a bit tired when people say we have to focus on the big things: Europe should be big on the big things and small on the small things. Well let’s just conclude today that we all agree on that. The political discussion is what you call big, and what I call big, or what someone else calls small, which I call big. That is a political discussion. Let’s not hide as if a Commission work programme is a technical analysis. This is about priorities and political decisions, on where the European Union is focusing, and there are good things. If I look at what the Commission wants to do on the social pillar side, I think that looks good, but, how exactly is that going to look? Here I would like to subscribe to what my colleague from the S&amp;D Group was saying. On the other and, if I look at the trade part, it is just business as usual, it is just continuing: ‘we are doing a great job so we continue’. Well sorry, but maybe some people have noticed that there is a huge debate on which direction the EU is going with its trade deals. We are not discussing trade deals more. CETA stands for Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement. It is more than just a trade deal. That is why you are now having discussions with national parliaments. That is why there is now such a huge discussion, and the Commission is saying, we will just continue with it because it is working fine, which is just turning a blind eye to what is going on outside. I think that should be mentioned far more in the work programme. The last point is on REFIT and this is a question to the Commissioner. I know there will be some discussions also on ecodesign and I know that you are a very good person who can convince people, so can you convince people also within your Commission how important it is to reduce our energy use? That is a big thing. With the vacuum cleaners we have saved energy equivalent to four coal-fired power plants. That is good for the environment, that is good for our economy, and it is good for our self-reliance on energy. That is what the Ecodesign Directive is about and I am sure that you can convey that message, rather than what a lot of tabloids are doing in portraying this as a regulatory burden, because I as a consumer do not mind what the rules are, but if in the end if I buy appliances that are much more energy efficient that is a good thing for us citizens.

Whatever the final configuration of the 2017 working program, therefore, certain aspects cannot be disregarded. First of all, mass emigration: in recent weeks Italian ships have rescued twenty thousand people and the attack in Mosul will aggravate the emergency. The numbers leave no room for indecision, and even less can be shown indecision when internal security is at stake, because security is the first right and the first need that our citizens are asking us to protect.

The other task after Brexit is to find a new form of cooperation between European countries, because it is quite clear that there is no alternative to this cooperation, but the process of moving more and more rapidly after Lisbon towards the creation of a centralised state must have an alternative, and if this is not recognised, it will lead to the disintegration of Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3283, "date": "2016-10-25.json", "name": "Cristian Dan Preda (PPE).", "mepid": "96838", "text": "   Mr President, I would like to welcome the adoption of the 2017 work programme by the Commission and say that the title of this programme is particularly well chosen to reflect the challenges we are currently facing.

Protection without protectionism means working for growth, job creation and opportunities for young people. It seemed to me to read that, in view of next year's White Paper in Rome, the emphasis is placed on stability when it comes to reviewing the Stability and Growth Pact. I think where you have to put the emphasis is on growth, not so much on stability.  Secondly, it is also possible for citizens to improve their real life, their social life, their daily lives. And that implies concrete measures when it comes to social union.

A few suggestions, maybe more Christmas.  First. This is overcoming the European Union's identity crisis. It is no longer possible to stand at a crossroads between the federalist European Union and the national States of the European Union. And self-determination must be swift and clear: it is necessary to forget any federalist challenges, to abandon the ideology of globalism and to push the bulldozer into decisions of dubious value for the citizens of European countries.  Second. Change attitudes towards migration policy. Abandon quotas by redistributing the countries of the European Union to the refugees. Strengthening the European Union's external borders by sending a clear message that economic migrants from third countries will be closed. And actually close them.  And third. Democracy is not the dictatorship of the Brussels institutions for the members of the Community, under the guise of supposedly worrying about its fate.

I think that we are talking about a rapid solution to the problem of immigration, about tackling the problem of relocation, when all the news throughout Europe through euronews, gives us pictures of what is happening even on the Italian coasts, where 4 000 of them landed yesterday and 500 to 700 to 1 000 disembark every day and Europe is incapable of seriously tackling it. So this is a completely illusory program starting with immigration. Moreover, if we move on to the international issue, let us see what the Commission intends to do with regard to Africa, we do not see any serious, incisive measures, for example for the implementation of the Cotonou Agreements, which require African countries exporting immigrants to take back their economic immigrants when they are not eligible. But that is not because Europe counts for nothing.  Mosul is being shot, Aleppo is being shot, there are important interests there in a strategic area, including economic and also military interests for the Member States of the European Union, but where is Europe?

Indeed, the greatest danger that threatens us is that of immobility, when every day seems to bring a new crisis and distrust is deeper and deeper. For this to happen, the work programme must be a combat programme, a fight for the re-industrialisation of our continent, the recovery of the economy and the fight against unemployment that undermines our societies.  I am pleased to see that the Commission is making the space sector one of its industrial priorities. The use of spatial data and the independence of our access to space are essential for our industrial fabric. I also put all my hopes in a European defence or in an ambitious digital plan. The fight must also be fought for the convergence of our economies and the protection of the euro area. In this area, we must make up for the chronic lack of investment, despite the Juncker plan on our continent, by strengthening the banking union and that of the capital markets.  I also advocate for more fiscal and social justice. The Commission's proposals to combat tax evasion and tax havens are in line with this.  Finally, I say that we must lead the fight to promote high standards of environmental and health protection.

I came here immediately after the College decided on the Commission Work Programme. We immediately sent the Commission Work Programme to every single Member of Parliament and I immediately came here before going anywhere else – not talking to the press, not talking to anybody else – to make a statement on the Commission Work Programme out of respect for your Parliament and out of respect for your work. If you do not want that, just let us know and we will not do it. I will go and talk to the press and we can talk to each other later on. This is how I am trying to show respect for the European Parliament and give you, before anybody else, the Commission Work Programme. Of course this is not the moment that we go through every detail of the Commission’s Work Programme. I am not expecting you to have read everything in 15, 20 or 30 minutes. That is not the point. The point is that I believe that if we have a decision in the College on the Commission’s Work Programme, you should be the first to hear about this and to be informed about this. I think this is a sign of respect and certainly not a sign of disrespect. Secondly, on many of the things you said there will obviously be extensive debates in the months to come. But let me just pick up on some of the points that were made. This Commission is very much aware of the fact that people in Europe see Europe as a source of insecurity, as a source of injustice and as a source of globalisation that takes away their rights and that takes away the securities they had.  We need to change that paradigm into a different paradigm, where Europe can show that, by doing concrete things, we do indeed improve their lives, we do indeed improve employment, we do indeed improve Europe’s competitive position worldwide and we do provide protection by being very concrete in concrete measures there where we have a competence at European level. That is what the Commission Work Programme is focused upon again this year. My second point is that, in the preparation of the Commission Work Programme, we have gone extensively through debates with your Parliament, starting with the debate on and after the State of the Union address by President Juncker leading up to the letter of intent; comments were given and the discussion was held in the Conference of Committee Chairs. That went extremely well and what we see today is completely in line with what we have discussed before so there can be no huge surprises. Obviously, because you are a political institution with divergent political views, not everybody will be equally happy with the content of what we did. This is where we will come to the debate in the months to come with all my colleagues. On transparency, perhaps we could work, for instance, on the interinstitutional agreement on the mandatory Transparency Register to improve transparency. Perhaps Ms in 't Veld can then convince her Group to vote for the Giegold report on this, which would help us to bring it forward. So, in that sense, we can continue to work together to improve transparency.  Yes, we need a pro—growth policy and, yes, everybody would agree worldwide that what Europe lacks most is investment. That is why the Commission Work Programme for next year puts a lot of emphasis on increasing the possibilities of investment, of increasing the possibilities – especially for the younger generation – for getting people to take up a job, to take up an internship, to take up a course of study, which has been a successful approach and we need to expand on that. I can assure Mr Eickhout that I am not about self—congratulation. Frankly, I remove every sentence that says ‘oh, we are so great’ in any communication coming out of the Commission on my behalf. So do not worry about that. I know where we are. I think I was the first, also in my own country, to announce that I saw the extent of the problems that we are in. I have also said quite clearly that this is a project that could also fail if we are not very careful. So in that sense I am very far from being self-congratulatory. I think we have quite a number of issues we need to solve.  Indeed I believe eco—design makes a huge contribution to solving some of our issues and to getting our economy to where it is going to be completely sustainable and therefore very competitive in a world, in this fourth industrial revolution, which is changing very quickly to a sustainable economy. The quicker we do that and the more we invest in that, the better we will come out of this, also in terms of employment and competitiveness. Of course, the issue of migration will be first and foremost on our minds in the year to come. That is beyond any doubt but, there again, everybody needs to accept their responsibility. This is somewhere where we cannot have a European Union of à la carte solidarity. If we have a problem that is faced by the Union as a whole, every single Member State will have to take their share of the responsibility in solving the problem. That is the gist of the proposals the Commission, in close collaboration with your Parliament, has made and will be continuing to make.  And there I like the phrase ‘protection without protectionism’, which is something I think could be the core of what we need to do. Europeans want more protection. They want to regain control of their destinies. That was the core of the debate during the Brexit campaign. That is what we see in every single Member State and we, with the limited possibilities we have, based on the competences we derive from the Treaty, should offer some solutions for the protection people are looking for. That is, I believe, the gist of the Commission Work Programme.

It is alarming that the Commission does not give priority at all to the problems relating to excessive macroeconomic imbalances and asymmetric effects between Member States generated by the single currency, the technocratic drift of decision-making mechanisms, or the lack of democratic legitimacy in the instruments of economic coordination, or the failure to reform finance on the basis of lessons from the crisis, and the lack of consideration of the general interest of European citizens in decisions indirectly determining their lives.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3319, "date": "2016-10-25.json", "name": "Kristalina Georgieva", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, as you know, the Commission has tabled a proposal for mid-term review revision of the financial framework in mid-September. I would like to express our gratitude to Parliament and especially to the two rapporteurs for the own initiative report, Ms Thomas and Mr Olbrycht, as well as for the work you have done to prepare a draft resolution, which we are pleased to see incorporates many of the proposals the Commission has tabled. Thank you for that. We all recognise that we are taking on this task at a time of multiple, successive and overlapping crises, and in that environment it is absolutely paramount for the European Union to demonstrate the capacity to act. In our proposal we focused on two dimensions of this capacity to act: the financial dimension (additional financial resources) and the flexibility aspect. I will go through those two in some detail. In terms of beefing up our capacity to fund priorities with very strong focus on jobs and growth and dealing with migration, we are proposing to make EUR 6.3 billion available. This is funding for very important objectives. For example, more young people in regions affected by particularly high levels of unemployment to find targeted support for integrating or reintegrating into the labour market. For giving more young people the chance to participate in actions supported by Erasmus+. To allow the European Research Council to finance more high-quality projects in frontier research. They are also about achieving a more effective management of migration flows so we can help refugees to integrate in their host countries, secure a better control of our external borders, fight illegal immigration and address the root causes of migration. But in itself this amount does not reflect the full level of the proposed refocusing of EU spending, because we have also taken a very careful look at how we can realign financial resources, for example, in our support for the Connecting Europe Facility, which has very broad endorsement here in Parliament. We have topped it up with EUR 400 million but we also are proposing to shift EUR 1 billion from financial instruments to grants under the transport strand of this facility. A big share of the proposed top-ups goes to instruments that have a significant multiplier or leverage effect: COSME, EFSI, the new European fund for sustainable development, the increased EIB external lending mandate, the Union’s instrument for macro-financial assistance to our neighbouring countries. And we have done that looking into every possible source, but within the parameters agreed in the 2013 multiannual financial framework (MFF). Secondly, on flexibility. Given that we continue to face a particularly volatile international environment, opting for an extension of flexibility is the responsible thing to do so we can act swiftly in crisis situations. This MFF runs until the end of 2020. This means more than four years still to go, with our existing flexibility already stretched to its limits. So for this reason we are proposing to double the size of the flexibility instrument and the emergency aid reserve, as well as to establish a European Union crisis reserve financed from decommitments we have fully taken on board, and that is a proposal from Parliament. And just to say that, if we had had this crisis reserve in place at the beginning of this MFF, it would have allowed us to finance the refugee facility for Turkey entirely. In other words, it would have avoided seeking complex, off-budget satellite solutions; we would have had the resources available to us. Let me stress in closing that our proposals are not only about the tangible things I have described. We are making a very serious effort to simplify the rules by which the Union’s programmes are implemented so as to reduce administrative burden for beneficiaries and public administrations, to make the EU funds more predictable and more flexible and the results of their deployment more visible to our people. We are, of course, at your disposal – Parliament, the Council – to engage so we can make the mid-term review a very prudent and helpful for the Union exercise. Of course, we look forward to the debate. We will be listening very carefully to all of you.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3320, "date": "2016-10-25.json", "name": "Jan Olbrycht", "mepid": "28288", "text": "  On behalf of the PPE Group. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by The Multiannual Financial Perspective Regulation provides for the first time an obligation to carry out a post-election review of the entire financial perspective. This obligation is fixed for the duration of 2016 and we are therefore debating this today.  The Regulation provides that if the review shows the need for amendments, i.e. where necessary, a revision should be made, i.e. a revision of the multiannual financial perspective. Without waiting for its treaty commitments, the European Parliament has already decided to review it in order to construct its proposal for a financial perspective. I stress this because it is not only a question of the European Parliament's ambition that it wants to carry out a review, but the European Parliament, through its Committee on Budgets, has carried out a partial review, with the help of the European Commission. As a result of our debates, public hearings, but also information from the European Commission, the European Parliament's Committee on Budgets has come to the conclusion that a revision is absolutely necessary, and that is how we constructed our proposal, which we submitted as an own-initiative report. In our proposal, we make it clear that there is a need for a review of concrete changes.  We were very pleased to learn that the Commission actually agreed with our opinion and, when presenting its proposal, also proposed a revision. While we would expect even bigger or significant proposals for change on some issues, we believe that this is a very good starting point for negotiations. We therefore expect the European Commission to also try to convince the Council that what the Commissioner has proposed and talked about, namely the changes that are contained both in the draft budget 2017 and in the so-called Omnibus, a set of legislative amendments, as well as in the proposal to change the financial perspective, that this whole complex of changes will find its place in the coming months.  We see that these changes are proposed in different places, we are ready to work in different areas also binding these matters together. We are therefore ready to discuss with the Council immediately the Council's position, which will be presented to Parliament. We are ready for these talks, we are prepared, we are full of goodwill in terms of the need to regulate the necessary changes in order for the budget to function properly.

This draft revision of the Commission confirms Parliament's lucidity about the need for a genuine review. Thank you, Madam Vice-President. This is a first budgetary first in the history of the European Union and I welcome the position of the Commission, which, like Parliament, is finding after consideration that we cannot continue with the current framework. This is a first victory that calls for others. However, there is one notable absence: the Council, which should be with us to present its position and listen to that of parliamentarians.  The Council must quickly present its position to us without waiting for the last day of conciliation, at the risk of delaying the budgetary procedure. We therefore wish to be able, without delay, to sit together at the same table to open these negotiations. What is in the resolution presented tomorrow to the vote of parliamentarians? It highlights a certain convergence of views of the three institutions on the priorities of the European Union: the fight against youth unemployment, measures on migration and refugees, COP 21, agricultural crises, underinvestment and internal security. The debate is about the main European priorities. This debate is no longer to be said. Indeed, I believe that today we are speaking with one voice. The question now is whether we are left with statements or whether we are giving ourselves the financial means.  The Commission's draft revision provides some solutions, notably on flexibility, which allows for better use of all the means of the financial framework. These flexibility instruments, which were wrestled out of the European Parliament's 2013 negotiations, proved to be life-saving in the first years of the MFF's implementation in order to deal with the unforeseen events and crises we are going through. How could the current migration phenomenon, Brexit or the new internal security challenges be foreseen in 2013? These tools of flexibility have been very much in demand and, without revision, they will simply not be enough to deliver on the commitments we have made to our fellow Europeans.  Our resolution welcomes the Commission's proposals on flexibility extensions, although we believe that more needs to be done, particularly for the strengthening of the emergency aid reserve and the flexibility instrument. With regard to the Union's crisis reserve, we welcome the fact that this idea, proposed by Parliament, as you said, Madam Vice-President, is being taken up by the Commission. We will have to think again about its scope and its funding. Budgetary flexibility is neither a luxury nor a whim, as has been demonstrated. It is a powerful tool, in long-term budget programming, which aims to respond to situations that we cannot anticipate. We also support proposals for the use of statutory releases within the European budget. These appropriations to be spent under the EU budget must logically be maintained in this budget and not leave it. As for payments, as we said in July, the ostrich policy would lead us to serious disappointments at the end of the period. We have to take responsibility. The credibility of the European institutions, but, more seriously, the situation of the beneficiaries, whether it be local authorities, businesses or students with Erasmus mobility, would find themselves waiting for the European Union to be able to pay the bills due to them. This hidden deficit, if I may say so, is against the treaty. The revision should resolve this issue by calculating, outside the ceilings, special instruments and by re-flexibilizing the overall margin of payments.  The solutions are on the table and the discussion must now open with a common objective: every bill from the Union must be paid on time. However, let me still make a few criticisms. We regret in particular that the Commission's draft does not propose to raise the spending limits for heading 1a on Competitiveness for Growth and Employment, heading 1b on economic, social and territorial cohesion and headings 3 and 4. We must break the deadlock in the announcements without Funding. I will take just one example: the fight against youth unemployment. It's a shared priority. The Commission has just assessed positively the youth employment initiative, which is recognised as a success, not a total success, but it is never the case. However, while the six billion appropriations of this programme are exhausted, the Commission's proposal provides for only one billion euros to strengthen until 2020. This is notoriously inadequate in the face of the tragedy experienced by 25% of young Europeans under the age of 25. At a minimum, the same amount must be added, i.e. EUR 6 billion by the end of the budget period. The debate on the substance of the revision has only just begun. In Parliament, we are ready to open negotiations. We know that the Commission is, too. We are now waiting for the Council and, as we said in July, and as we reiterate in the resolution which I hope will be voted on tomorrow, Parliament wishes to conduct parallel negotiations on the 2017 budget and the revision of the multi-year financial framework. The amending letter No. 1 on the 2017 budget demonstrates that the revision will necessarily have an impact on the 2017 budget. These two files must therefore be negotiated at the same time.  Madam President, all I have left is my conclusion, if I may.  To this end, Parliament has set up a single negotiating team on both issues. We have our mandate, adopted in July, which we are completing today. It is now up to the Council to accelerate.

We must also ask ourselves in principle: is it the right way to call for more money? Where is the proof that with more money and still more money, we are actually finding better solutions? Instead, we should ask ourselves: should we not really strengthen subsidiarity and only tackle the tasks in the EU that we can solve better than the Member States? If we do that, then we will have a lean budget, and we can also set new priorities that can respond to the new challenges. But not just more money.

Mr President, the debate on budgetary frameworks in the European Parliament is not democratic accountability, as you pride yourself. It is legitimising huge redistribution, theft of popular toil, with budgets by definition and demonstrably unpopular ones, such that Juncker has also confessed to launching unemployment and poverty. You make fun of it when you talk about money that supposedly gives away the European Union. The source of EU and national budgets is the taxes paid by the people. The winners are the monopolies, which are exempt from taxes, are given billions as incentives and for their interests there are wars with millions of refugees. The contrasts concern which state, which monopolies will be strengthened the most. Increased or reduced budgets, one or the other targeting profitable sectors, a strict or flexible stability pact, all have one condition for restructuring. For every euro that goes to monopolies, wage, pension, social rights. Anyone, like SYRIZA, who has claimed that the European Union is changing has proved equally unpopular.

My feeling is that we are coming to the end of a cycle and that the revision of the multi-year financial framework must put an end to two hypocrisies. The first is the levers of flexibility, the famous special instruments. During the negotiations on the financial outlook for 2014-2020, it was agreed that these special instruments, facing exceptional circumstances and crises, would be above the ceilings. Then, on the test, we found that the Council did not want to admit that, if there was a inclusion above the ceilings for commitments, there would have to be a corresponding inscription above the ceilings for payments. The Council refuses this version and that is how we dig the rest to liquidate and we will find ourselves tomorrow facing a major difficulty.  The second hypocrisy concerns the practice of hiding our impecuniousness by multiplying budget satellites: Juncker funds for strategic investments, facilities for Turkey and other trust funds. This practice insults the principle of fiscal unity and creates a blind spot for parliamentary control. The resulting galaxy is a mirage.  The revision of the multi-year financial framework is an opportunity to restore order to the budgetary house and to infuse sincerity into a budget that has lost all legibility.

However, Mrs Georgieva, the scale of the current economic and refugee crisis affecting Europe requires greater amounts of spending and active solutions in order to be adequately addressed.

The existing multiannual financial framework has failed to address challenges that emerged in the first half of its implementation.

It is, if anything, foolish to plan the allocation of financial resources over seven years, using ceilings and enforcing their observance, while at the same time pursuing growth and innovation. This tactic leads to distortions of political priorities and strategic objectives, but also to the sluggish response to emerging threats. The existing multiannual financial framework does not have the flexibility and structure to deal with an armed conflict, for example, between a member country with a acceding third country.

It is a moment in the implementation of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) that we cannot possibly miss in terms of introducing adjustments that would allow us in the next four years to respond to priorities. We all agree on those priorities. I heard in the debate those who say that our proposals go too far and I also heard in the debate those – and actually there were more voices in this category – who said that we are not going far enough. It is true that, when we look at the capacity to operate in a very tight budgetary environment in Member States, we know the restrictions that unanimity places on us when we go forward for the revision. The notion that some may have that we are going too far is understandable, but let me just remind all of us that our budget is just one percent of GNI and yet it has such a massively important purpose, especially in these very turbulent times. Those who think that we are not going far enough have, of course, very legitimate reasons for saying that. It is true that we are still struggling to overcome the impact of a prolonged economic crisis, especially as it affects our youth. I just want to flag that, in addition to what we have in our proposal to address the most pressing needs of recovery and employment, we also have been able to provide three of the most affected countries – Italy, Greece and Spain – with a boost coming out of the adjustment of EUR 4.6 billion. I certainly hope that these countries will indeed direct as much as possible of this funding to tackle unemployment and all three also need to deal with the impact of migration. Beyond the proposal there are some other elements that we should take into account. When we look into the viability of what we have put forward, actually we are convinced that it is possible to reach an agreement between the Council, Parliament and the Commission on a way forward. It is not only possible but is of paramount necessity, so that we can continue to function in a way that delivers to people. I want to respond to two points that were made: one by Mrs Thomas on the importance of putting forward a more detailed proposal on how the new reserve could be created and what the implications may be. We agree with that and we have actually already offered during a presentation in a meeting of the General Affairs Council that we might elaborate a bit further on the link between the decommitments – how they may be made, how we guarantee that there would be no perverse incentive to have more decommitments – and, on the other hand, how high a limit would we set in order for the reserves to be used when it is indeed absolutely necessary? We will of course share this proposal with Parliament as well. Secondly, a number of points were made with regard to payments. I could not agree more that, while we have got on top of the issue of insufficient payment appropriations in the past and we have cleared the bills that were to be paid, we are now unfortunately facing this year – and we expect the same next year – insufficient payments coming our way. Mr Novakov also made that point. We can only work as hard as possible to accelerate implementation and call on all of us to push all the buttons there are for this to happen.  We do have enough payment credits should we apply all the flexibility of the global margin for payments and should we reach an agreement on where the payment for the special instruments belongs – above the ceilings, as Parliament and the Commission have been arguing for, or under the ceilings? But this is work to be done in a pragmatic way to bring everybody together so we can have a review and revision that results in a more potent budget for the next four years in front of us.

It is regrettable that both EP proposals stand by the parliamentary report adopted in the July plenary vote, which pre-commented on the review of the 2014-2020 MPM. In this case, despite the unified opposition of the MEMBERS of the People's Party, MEPs from the Hungarian left-wing parties voted against the interests of the country, and all Hungarian citizens were attacked in the back with their decision in support of forced resettlement. MePs from hungary's left-wing parties voted in favour of forced resettlement and harsh financial sanctions against countries that rejected it by voting in favour of the European Parliament proposal. At the same time, the overwhelming majority of Hungarian voters have a clear position: they said no to forced resettlement. Therefore, Fidesz MEPs will only accept a financial framework review and an EU budget in which these penalties are not even at the level of an idea. In the review, the European Commission proposes an increase of EUR 12.8 billion. This is only partly a new resource, much of it an unused budgetary margin in the framework and the draining of reserves. We must avoid the liquidity crisis under the previous seven-year financial framework, when the Commission was unable to pay the invoices submitted to the Member States for the projects implemented.

Today, the multiannual financial framework is implemented in the context of the migration crisis, threats to internal security and still unacceptably high levels of youth unemployment, which require significant additional funding from the European budget. Special instruments have been mobilised to address these challenges in recent years, ing to the limit the possibilities of the current multiannual financial framework. All this shows that the mid-term review of the framework is extremely timely and necessary. The current budgetary difficulties further threaten citizens' trust in the European Union, which is already badly shaken. It is therefore important that Member States assume their responsibility and support their words with deeds, ensuring a predictable and reliable EU budget for the remaining years of the current programming period.

Madam President, Vice-President Georgieva, Kristalina, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs President-in-House, who has been a mazed at the work she has done. Minister Lesay, welcome to the European Parliament! You have been sorely missed in the debate on the medium-term financial framework. Do you know what I'm really fed up with? I really am fed up with the attitude of the governments of the Member States when it comes to financing the European Union. Either we follow the finance ministers, then we would cut the Commission's budget estimates so that the EU saves and does not spend as much money. Or we can follow the other members of the same governments of the Member States, who are constantly demanding more from the EU and therefore also from the EU budget, and who are garnishing this with the demand that the EU must be big on the major problems. To add the krona, the Member States have already agreed to the current budgetary situation. The medium-term financial framework sets the ceilings and the objectives to be financed. And because all this is the case, President Schulz is so right to say that hypocrisy in the capitals cannot be surpassed when it comes to the European budget – agree in Brussels and then criticise these decisions in the capitals, euroscepticism is produced. So no matter what we do, we always get it wrong. Because we are not following the finance ministers at the reading of the budget, we must now again accept the accusation that we were too generous with taxpayers' money. No, Minister, we do not deal with the money too generously, we just want the EU to be really big – and as big as possible – when it comes to the problems that the Council of the European Union sees as central as we are: the creation of growth and jobs and the resolution of the refugee crisis. And because we are in the process of doing so, I have looked at the figures for the last five budgets and compared the Council's proposal with the figures that we actually needed at the end of the year in the financial year, and five times the Council was too short. We needed a lot more money. In the sixth year, finance ministers still do not know better.  The EP will adopt an ambitious draft budget tomorrow. We want to show what can be done by mobilising the budget and making full use of the available opportunities. We propose mobilising the money needed to guarantee the Juncker Plan as part of the revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework. And for that we are reusing all the sums that have been used for the guarantee.  In this way, we are funding research and the financing of cross-border transport routes. We provide money for small and medium-sized enterprises. While others here in the Chamber are making colourful balloons rise and promising every young person an interrail ticket for their 18th birthday, we are increasing the funding for the Erasmus programme so that more Europeans can get to know the neighbouring countries. So that I am not misunderstood, I am very much in favour of young people in the EU being mobile and able to gain experience abroad. But it should be financially viable.  So, if we really get more extra money from the Council under the MFF revision, I can imagine ten better things that can be done with around EUR 1.5 billion than distributing interrail tickets. For example, strengthen the European Youth Initiative. After start-up difficulties, this has a positive effect. 70% of young people who have taken part in measures find follow-up employment, youth unemployment is falling and the programme is working. Let's make it stronger!", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3358, "date": "2016-10-25.json", "name": "Indrek Tarand", "mepid": "97136", "text": "  rapporteur. – Madam President, the 2017 budget as proposed by the co—rapporteurs is stronger, greener and more democratic. Stronger because it includes several targeted top-ups: restore the EFSI, related cuts, move forward Horizon 2020, SMEs, Erasmus, LIFE+, the Youth Employment initiative and DCI, and more to tackle the migration crisis. Greener because it includes some targeted and specific increases for sustainable programmes such as LIFE+. After the ratification of the Paris Agreement, the EU should go much beyond these increases, but it is a first step in the right direction and I thank everyone who was involved. It is more democratic because it includes a reserve in the budget of the Commission in order to force the Commission to come up with a stricter code of conduct. After both Barrosogate and Kroesgate, EU citizens cannot simply accept that ex-Commissioners are not bound by strict rules and are not accountable anymore. Colleague Geier mentioned Inter-rail and foresaw some other good uses for the money. I am obliged here to bring you the words of my honoured colleagues Rebecca Harms and Michael Cramer who think that mobility across borders is one of Europe’s biggest tangible successes. We want to ensure that all European people can equally benefit from mobility across Europe and explore Europe first hand. To this end, we are asking the Commission to issue a competition for free Inter—rail vouchers that young people can apply for in European projects. Basically, I agree with Michael Cramer that there are better ways than that of spending EUR 1.5 billion, but for youngsters to see different European corners, to travel freely to meet each other, make love, not war, that is a good idea, I think. I will skip the parts of the European Parliament’s own budget because it is a delicate matter covered by a gentlemen’s agreement which no one has ever seen and whose text no one has ever held in their hands – and I must say, Barroso was a gentleman, please don’t interrupt me. The thing is, we have here a problem of calculation of the establishment plan which we agreed to reduce, and then we have the increase in political group staff which we do not count as staff, but to whom we apply the Staff Regulations. I must say that I was warned not to stick my nose too deeply into this issue if I want to have a political career, so let it be. Let’s close my political career but I am against it. A few words about other sections. As you know, we tried to take a position, and we will vote on it, to restore the budget line on other sections. However, I witnessed very recently a presentation of the Annual Report by the Court of Auditors in Brussels in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I was absolutely pleased to see all of the national Members of the Court of Auditors sitting there in three rows, with their only duty being to applaud after Mr Lehne’s presentation. That is not a well spent working day even though it is a very festive one, and if I see them here tomorrow, I will make a proposal to cut their budget. Thank you for giving me the floor and I will come back in the closing remarks.

We have already had the occasion to exchange our views on the draft budget for 2017 on 13 September, when the Presidency had the honour to present to you the Council’s position on the draft budget proposed by the Commission. On that occasion it was underlined that the main thrust of the Council’s position was the prioritisation of EU expenditure. This means that we have to finance adequately investments to spur growth and jobs and to provide sufficient funding to tackle the still ongoing refugee, migration and security crisis. At the same time, it was the Council’s explicit wish to create sufficient margins to enable us to cope with the unforeseen situations that we will certainly have to face in the course of the next year.  I take due note of the various amendments to the Council’s position that you will probably debate today and intend to vote tomorrow. Please allow me to make just some preliminary remarks in this context. First of all, the Council is very concerned at the significant increases of appropriations proposed by Parliament, in some cases going beyond the ceilings fixed in the MFF. If we look at the details, the Council notes that substantial reinforcements are proposed for Horizon 2020 and the Connecting Europe Facility. These would bring us one year back, actually, to when negotiating the regulation establishing the European Fund for Strategic Investments, and this is not consistent with the agreement we reached together on this. As for the strengthening of the Youth Employment Initiative, the Council prefers not to pre—empt the Commission’s examination on the best way to give continuity to the initiative, which indeed has made good progress this year.  As you are all aware, 2017 will be the last year to reach a target of reducing the staff of all institutions and other EU bodies by 5%. I am confident that Parliament also shares the same objective and agrees that it should be reflected in the next year’s budget for every section. Overall, the difference between our respective positions totals EUR 6 billion in commitment appropriations and 4.2 billion in payment appropriations. We do need to work constructively during the conciliation procedure in order to bridge this gap. The Council is ready to stick to the calendar agreed between our institutions on the budget negotiations and to reach an agreement within the deadlines set out by the Treaty. The Council will do so in good faith and without setting any preconditions for these negotiations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3360, "date": "2016-10-25.json", "name": "Kristalina Georgieva", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Geier and Mr Tarand, and Minister Lesay, for their opening comments. As we all know, the budget proposal for 2017 was tabled back in June. It is a disciplined proposal focused on the two priorities that are defining the parameters of what we do: jobs, growth and investment, and migration, refugees and security. I want to thank Parliament and the Council for aligning with the Commission’s proposal on the package of measures for migration and security. I would also like to welcome the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets to restore the cuts made by the Council in the readings. I hope that this will give us a chance to make progress in the negotiations to have the funding that is necessary. I also want to recognise that, on a number of items, the Parliament has gone further than the Commission’s proposal – to reinforce appropriations to promote jobs and growth and also actions in the external domain. This lifts us up above the ceilings and, from the perspective of the Commission, it would be important to address these amendments in the executability letter so that, ahead of the vote, we can make a sound judgment on how far it is practically possible to go.  I want to say a couple of words about Amending letter number one, since this has a direct relation to the draft 2017 budget. This has three main objectives. Firstly, to apply the assessment under the mid—term review and revision for reinforcement of some spending programs under Heading 1a. These are successful programmes. They contribute, in our view, to more dynamism in our economy, and the amount proposed is EUR 200 million plus EUR 500 million for the Youth Employment Initiative to be integrated in the course of the year. Secondly, to step up action on the external front to address the root causes of migration, and here we have EUR 750 million to support the partnership framework process – these are the so-called compacts – and EUR 250 million to provision the European Fund for Sustainable Development. We also, on the internal front, have proposed some adjustments in increased staffing for the European Counter Terrorism Centre within Europol. Thirdly, to update agriculture expenditure. We have announced EUR 500 million for our dairy sector. This is in addition to EUR 100 million that is already in the budget for certain fruits and vegetables. So we have these actions proposed. What would they mean? They would mean a recourse to the contingency margin for an amount of about EUR 1 billion, which would allow us to make use of the flexibility available in the current financial framework. We have in this Amending letter a great deal of convergence with the amendments that were proposed by the Parliament. I will not list them, as I am sure you have recognised where this alignment has taken place. We believe that the necessity to apply judgment on the 2017 Budget, as we also debate on a separate, formally independent, track the midterm review and revision. This necessity is very obvious when we read the Amending letter number one.  What it means for us in the Commission is to state clearly that, while these two processes are separate, we have to be sure that they go on a parallel track in time so we can complete during the conciliation period our negotiations on the 2017 Budget. Let me say just a word on payment appropriations: we provided you with the latest state of play just last week. Our best estimate is that the proposal from Parliament to restore most of the appropriations to the level of our draft budget are actually aligned with this most recent clear estimate. In conclusion, we have work to do; so we will do our part to be available to provide detailed information to answer any requests that may come from Parliament and the Council. I hope that, as we do so, Parliament would be able to agree with the 2017 Budget without reserves. That would be very helpful, so as not to hinder implementation. Finally, the clock is ticking and 16 November is approaching, so let us use this discussion productively to get a budget for our economy, for our people.

Less than six months ago, this House backed my proposals to establish stronger ties between the EU development community, the DCI and the private sector, legislating a revolution in development financing and one not reliant on the age-old method of simply spending more of the taxpayers’ money. At a stroke we turned 4.8 billion into 68 billion through leveraged finance with the private sector. Yet this budget, I seem to think, takes no account either of my report or of the state and aspirations of the Juncker plan. Far from encouraging public-private sector partnerships, we have chosen just to increase spending by a further 2.8 billion.  We have chosen – or it would appear that we have chosen – to ignore the manifest potential of the private sector to bridge an admittedly daunting funding gap, and to bring local expertise to our project. If the Juncker plan is to be anything but a fantasy in Mr Juncker’s head, then the Commission must embrace fully the potential of private—public partnerships and the financial potential this begets.

It is a budget which promotes growth and jobs through investment in innovation and infrastructure. We will only have more jobs if our economy is competitive, strong and trustworthy in the eyes of investors. At the same time, this budget will address the current migratory and security challenges that we are facing. How will we make Europe safer? How will we manage the refugees that came to Europe over the course of the past two years? And how will we stop illegal migration through, of course, making our external borders safer? No matter how pressing these new challenges are, we will not compromise on the longstanding priorities of the Union, which are jobs and growth. This is why we proposed to restore the cuts made to Horizon 2020 and the Connecting Europe Facility, and we expect the Council to follow suit on this. We allocate more money for students, for researchers, for youth and for SMEs through the programmes Erasmus, COSME and the European Research Centre. We are glad to see that the Commission proposes exactly this in its amending letter number one – to allocate more money to these very categories which I just mentioned. The amending letter from the Commission shows that our reading anticipates the real needs of the EU budget. If new challenges which were not anticipated in 2013 when the MMF was agreed are to be addressed, new money is needed. New priorities should be financed with new money.

Budgetary resources are, in a way, the political fuel of the European Parliament. I therefore ask all my colleagues to support this approach to give the European Parliament weight in European governance. Parliament will be awakened at this price and our institution will thus play the democratic role that must be its own.  Of course, on administrative issues, reduction commitments will have to be kept, but not jeopardize the various representative institutions. I am thinking in particular of the Economic and Social Council, which oversees social issues; The Committee of the Regions, which oversees territorial issues; Court of Justice and others. Finally, security issues will indeed have to be provided with the necessary funds for the protection of both persons and property. As a member of the Committee on Budgets, I would like to remind you that the budget should not be a matter of specialists, but must be at the heart of European policies. Neglecting the budget means neglecting community policies, deserting the public sphere; it is, in the end, abandoning European citizens and the very idea of Europe. The draft 2017 budget as adopted by the Committee on Budgets, which uses all the flexibilities, including the revision of the MFF, is a budget that could suit us in the current context and must be taken into account in its entirety by the Council - and I stress this very much. If this were not the case, we would jeopardise the holders of cohesion projects, the farmers, concerned by the common agricultural policy, but also the very existence of Europe in the world, especially in view of the issue of migrants. Finally, we would not take into account the problems of employment, particularly youth employment. However, we must not lose sight of the need for new resources. We cannot put new policies in place forever without funding them.

Mr President, I would like to thank the There are many positive areas in this draft budget. For example, it is good that we are spending more money on migration, but also on security. Nevertheless, we in the ECR Group do not agree that the budget should be increased, contrary to the proposals of the Commission and the Council. Parliament's proposals now even provide for spending limits to be exceeded in some lines, contrary to the 2013 agreements. We have made proposals for savings of more than EUR 500 million, which, unfortunately, were not approved in the Committee on Budgets. In particular, we believe that some of the funds for the EU's agreement with Turkey on the migration crisis should be re-entered into the reserves, because we must first see that this agreement is implemented in the same way as it is envisaged. That is not the case at the moment. If that is not the case, however, then we should not simply pay for these funds indefinitely, as originally envisaged. What we also need, in particular, is greater transparency for our budget. It is not right that we should make more and more financing through special funds, which will then no longer be under Parliament's control. Nor is it right that we should make financing slated to make a eur five, ten or even twenty euros out of one euro, through any leverage effect of the European Investment Bank. This does not lead to more transparency, but – on the contrary – to greater transparency. We must also ensure that the co-financing we do is genuine co-financing and that we do not have so-called 100% co-financing. That is completely inconclusive in the word in itself.

We believe that the draft before us proposes significant budgetary improvements to address the major challenges facing the European Union, which are necessary objectives.  There is a need to boost growth and investment, in particular by strengthening support for Horizon 2020, the Interconnection Mechanism in Europe and the COSME programme, which is strategic for SMEs.  It is necessary to support dairy farmers, victims of lower prices and the Russian embargo.  It is necessary to send a positive message to European youth by strongly supporting the extension of the youth employment initiative and by increasing Erasmus' resources.  It is necessary to deal effectively and humanely with the migration crisis. That is why we strongly support the strengthening of the AMIF Fund's resources and the creation of the instrument to provide emergency humanitarian aid within the Union itself. There is a need for better control of the Union's external borders. That is why we support the strengthening of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency.  More intervention is needed to address the root causes of migration flows and to sustainably stabilize peripheral regions experiencing violent convulsions.  Finally, we need to increase our vigilance to prevent and neutralize terrorist threats. That is why we support strengthening the resources allocated to the Internal Security Fund. We also call for strengthening the human and material resources available to Europol.

First of all, I will say a few words on the treatment of the mid—term review or revision of the multiannual financial framework in the context of the negotiations related to the annual budget procedure. First of all, I would like to stress that the multiannual financial framework on the one hand, and the annual budget procedure of the EU on the other hand, are governed by different Treaty articles, establishing notably different decision-making processes. The Council is fully aware that, pursuant to Article 312 of the Treaty, the consent of Parliament is required before any modification of the MFF regulation. Concerning the review or revision of the MFF, the Council is diligently examining the various Commission proposals, and as far as the annual budgetary procedure is concerned – this being the file I am tasked to conduct – the Council is currently examining, besides the amendments of Parliament to the position of the Council, amending letter No 1 to the draft budget for 2017, adopted by the Commission last week. The Council will certainly have a position on all these various elements during the forthcoming conciliation procedure. The Council is aware that Parliament wishes to reach an agreement on the review or revision of the MFF before concluding the negotiations on the draft budget for 2017, and the Council is for keeping these two procedures separate. We should avoid any linkages that could render timely agreement of the draft budget for 2017 more difficult. The second point I would like to make is on the amending letter. This was only presented by the Commission on Monday 17 October. The Council preparatory bodies are currently analysing the proposal in detail, but at the current stage there is no political agreement on it. The Presidency will endeavour to get a position on this letter of amendment before the first conciliation meeting with Parliament. Having analysed the mood of Member States on the letter of amendment, it is very likely that the Council will strongly distinguish between its regular components on the one hand, which address, for instance, Heading 2, and on the other hand, top-ups for 2017. These can be materialised only once we have a deal on the MFF mid—term review or revision. The Council is of the view that we cannot prejudge the outcome of the MFF mid—term review or revision, and thus top—ups stemming from MFF revision could be addressed through a draft amending budget once there is a legal basis for additional appropriations. By way of conclusion – I am running out of time – we have been listening carefully to the arguments raised during this debate, and I will inform my colleagues in the Council accordingly. The debate has certainly helped clarify the European Parliament’s position and the issues that are the most important to you. The Council will do its utmost in order to engage in fruitful negotiations, allowing us to come to an agreement on the 2017 Budget and all open budgetary questions within the deadlines foreseen by the Treaty. Finally, let me stress that for the Council, the 2017 EU budget negotiations and the mid—term review or revision of the MFF are two different exercises which should be dealt with separately. As far as the mid—term review or revision of the MFF is concerned, the negotiations in the Council are held by the General Affairs Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3420, "date": "2016-10-25.json", "name": "Jens Geier", "mepid": "96833", "text": "   Rapporteur. Mr President, I would like to thank the I would like to thank all my fellow Members who have had constructive discussions on the European Union budget. Above all, I would like to thank the Members who have supported the approach I have taken as general rapporteur. I would like to return to a point which, I believe, has played a somewhat too little role in the debate. Colleagues from the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Development have mentioned it, and I will come back to this. One priority was a little too short in the debate. That is the question: how do we combat the refugee crisis? In this context, I very much welcome the amendment proposed by the Commission. Mrs Georgieva, I believe that this amendment contains a great many positive approaches and that important instruments of foreign and development policy have been strengthened. However, I would like to make it quite clear once again that what is not possible is that two important instruments of the EU's foreign and development policy are negligible as a matter of this amendment. The one thing that is particularly close to our hearts is the UN Refugee Agency for the Palestinians. In other words, we have called for a significant increase in this; the Commission's amendment does not take this into account.  I believe it is important that we also look at the situation of the Palestinian refugees in their camps, because if the children there can no longer be educated, these people will lose their perspective and will head towards Europe. This is a situation that we want to avoid. That is why we believe that strengthening UNRWA is essential. This also applies comparatively to humanitarian aid. So, as Commissioner, you are also responsible for this. I know that this is close to your heart. I am very concerned that if we limit the EU's humanitarian aid resources to the emergency reserve that already exists, we will actually cut ourselves off in terms of humanitarian aid. In this house, the European Parliament will certainly not give in to supporting its request. We are ready for the negotiations.

First of all, I would like to congratulate the Slovak Presidency, which has taken a huge step towards understanding the complicated nexus between revision of the MFF and the 2017 budget. A week ago we were not that far advanced; now we are. Of course I agree that these are parallel processes but each railway has two parallel rails, otherwise the train cannot be driven on them.  Secondly, there is some good news I read in the Politico newspaper, where they say the parliament budgetary authorities are doing the right thing: hitting former Commissioners where it hurts, in the pocketbook. I am sorry, really, that it took so long and the involvement of bigwigs like Barroso and others to take us that far because I have for more than two years now been dealing with Mr Kallas’s breaches – minor breaches – of the code of conduct: being a former Commisioner, being a special advisor to Commissioner Dombrovskis and being the lobbyist of a software company – all simultaneously. Of course, who would know better than he, because he was proud of presenting the transparent lobby register many years ago and, as an author, he obviously knows where the loopholes, the dark shades and all those areas are.  That is why I am absolutely confident that putting this money to reserve encourages the Commission, and Vice-President Georgieva is definitely made of different material from the above-mentioned.

In addition, the migration crisis, which understandably requires sufficient resources, is coming. However, prioritisation does not automatically lead to a higher budget? Is it not in reason to reduce non-priority expenditure? The European Court of Auditors called for this thematic concentration. We find very little of that in the budget. The European Commission, like most EU institutions, has been working on the agreed staff reduction of 1% per year. The European Parliament pretends to abide by it, but makes an exception for different categories of staff that are growing in size. The fact that the 3.4% increase in the budget is obscured by the veiled use of language in the resolution does not give a good picture of how the majority thinks it can package it.

Education is the key against radicalisation. That is why I call for the 4% to be at least respected and increased in 2017. I also call on the Member States to immediately recommit themselves to the target of 0.7% of GNI for official development assistance and to present a timetable for gradually increasing the funds so that the 0.7% can be achieved by 2030 at the latest.

Even when they disagreed with the compromises reached, they all made extremely valid contributions to the work at hand. The draft report presents the latest reflection on the state of European economies from the perspective of the European Commission’s recommendations to Member States on how to run their national economic systems so as to deliver growth and stability. During the last two years, the Commission streamlined its recommendations in parts by making them leaner and more focused. The change in approach was commendable. The aim here has been to follow up on it by concentrating on a few themes rather than to stretch over the whole width of policy concerns that the European semester covers. For, with a few exceptions, the state of the European economy still remains less than satisfactory. While growth has now emerged, it remains uneven and sluggish, even as doubts persist about European competitiveness. While unemployment is retreating overall and new jobs are being created, the situation on the jobs market remains bleak, not least for young people. While the pessimism about the future that was prevalent a few years ago has retreated, investment still is at historically low levels. The draft report considers this last concern as critical to the situation that we face. No matter what policies are adopted, if the investment that is generated remains insufficient, economic performance will lag on all fronts. For this reason we have concentrated in this report on investment issues. It is true that on many areas of economic management, we have among us divergent views, but at the level of a desire to encourage greater investment in Europe, we all share a commitment to make this happen. The situation as of now is that there is a very significant shortfall in investment, both public and private, compared to what were used to in the not so distant past. To be sure, this investments debt is not happening just in Europe, but across the capitalist world. Still, it is of interest to us all to reflect about what can be done to reverse the trend. Now personally I acknowledge the intellectual validity of arguments made by those who believe that current European governance structures, especially at the level of the eurozone, are sub-optimal. In and of themselves they serve to inhibit investment. So long as they prevail it is illusory to believe that significant long-term investment can be generated, so such arguments go. Nevertheless, the reality is that with the same existing governance structures, the European system has succeeded in the past to generate much higher levels of investment than at present. There is every reason, therefore, to seek to attain at least those past investment levels since experience shows they are attainable. We have therefore sought to highlight those Commission recommendations, as well as the Commission’s own initiatives, that focus on investment issues; there are quite a number. Naturally, within the boundary conditions for our discussions, these issues have to be framed coherently, with adherence to the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, such as budgetary discipline, implemented with the appropriate flexibility that the same rules allow. Meanwhile, the need for ongoing structural reforms has to be underlined, on the understanding that such reforms must be sustainable and socially fair. Beyond these considerations the need remains to show support for all growth-centred proposals that will increase the propensity to invest across the Union as a whole. Among others there are: proposals relating to access to equity and bank lending; to research and innovation; to education and training; to the promotion of SMEs; to EFSI and other funds that mobilise capital for new investment with a renewed structure aiming for a complete regional outreach of such funding; and on such lines also, the concept of green investment with environmental protection at its core.  However, one cannot avoid making a remark that has become almost ritualistic in Parliament reports on the Commission’s country-specific recommendations, which is that these recommendations will remain less than effective if governments and stakeholders in the respective national economies do not feel committed to them – if they do not own them as the jargon goes. On this point, the draft report emphasises that in order to arrive at such a sense of ownership, sub—national and regional authorities should be brought fully into the process by which country-specific recommendations are envisaged. On the ground, these bodies are now responsible for 60% of public investment proposals. They also have an extensive interface with private investment across a wide range of economic sectors. I will surely be most interested, Mr President, to hear the views of all colleagues on the challenge of using investment that Europe faces.

But we have gone even further, arguing that these indicators are on an equal footing with existing economic indicators, ensuring that internal imbalances are better assessed and increasing the effectiveness of structural reforms.  This whole process should aim at creating jobs and the prosperity of the population, guided by the necessary budgetary responsibility that guarantees the sustainability of social Europe, not putting at risk the younger generations in a process of good economic governance oriented towards growth, which is incompatible with the application of sanctions on Portugal and Spain that jeopardise their investment capacity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3430, "date": "2016-10-25.json", "name": "Ivan Korčok", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, thank you very much for holding this debate. I want to begin by reiterating the importance of the European Semester. It is indeed the framework within which we are coordinating our economic and fiscal policies. The challenges are clear and you have identified them in your report: a deteriorating international environment, the legacy of the crisis, with high levels of debt and unemployment, and diverging economic and social performances amongst Member States.  An economically strong Europe is first of all a Europe that invests in infrastructure, in innovation, but of course, above all, in its people. The Council is now examining the proposal to extend the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), to agree promptly on its position in light of the evaluation expected next month.  It is a Europe that embraces the digital age to ensure that our industries are seizing the new opportunities of the digital world. It is also, of course, a Europe that is designed to meet the aspirations of its young generation. Therefore the Presidency intends to present the Council conclusions on youth employment in December, following the Commission Communication on the Youth Guarantee and Youth Employment Initiative. Furthermore, I should mention other areas that are key, like the need to match the current needs of labour markets for a suitable set of skills and of course we are striving to ensure the rebuilding of trust in the future of the economic and monetary union. It is needless to stress, as the rapporteur has mentioned, that stability comes, of course, from respect for fiscal rules. A lot can be achieved at European Union level, but what matters at the end of the day is the delivery by Member States. I want to underscore that the implementation of the country—specific recommendations is therefore critical. Like you, I fully support efforts to ensure greater national ownership, including the Commission’s engagement with capitals to create a shared understanding of the challenges facing Member States.  The Council discussions at political level on the implementation of recommendations are very important in that respect. But it is through the involvement of a broad range of stakeholders that we can truly strengthen ownership. To that effect, discussions with national parliaments and today’s debate are all essential contributions to build a common vision of a Europe that delivers hope and prosperity.  It is obvious that the reforms called for by the country-specific recommendations are substantial ones. They cannot be achieved in one year, even under the best economic conditions. But what matters is that all the stakeholders, as I have mentioned, are committed to these reforms so that they can yield long-term benefits. Finally, I would like to recall that the revamp of the Semester introduced last year was also aimed at facilitating the implementation of the recommendations, for instance by focusing on a limited number of key priority areas. The early publication of country reports also allows for more comprehensive discussions at national level.  So I would end on a positive note by commending the Commission for this.

The Commission welcomes this constructive contribution to the European Semester. Democratic debate is an important element of the European Semester and today’s debate is very timely as we will soon launch the next Semester and set out the economic policy priorities for the year ahead. The Commission shares many of the findings and concerns mentioned in the report. Indeed the recovery in the EU and the euro area is still fragile and large divergences persist across Member States. Our autumn forecast, coming at the beginning of November, will provide a detailed update of the economic situation and outlook. It is clear that the EU needs stronger and more inclusive growth. To achieve this we have to progress with our three policy priorities: boosting investment, continuing structural reforms and pursuing responsible fiscal policies. These three policy priorities will again be at the heart of the Annual Growth Survey which will be presented by mid-November.  Now I will come briefly to the topics of the three priorities. First, on investment, we fully agree that a resurge of investment is crucial to support the economic recovery and reap the EU’s full growth potential. Despite low interest rates and ample liquidity, investment in Europe remains subdued. In that context, the Commission’s investment plan provides a most needed boost for Europe’s capacity to invest in future prosperity.  The projects so far approved for financing under the European Fund for Strategic Investment are expected to have mobilised around EUR 138 billion across 27 EU Member States. The Commission proposes to extend the duration of the Fund and to increase the financial capacity to at least half a trillion euro in investments by 2020. This would provide the necessary certainty to promoters and thus continued mobilisation of strategic investment. The Commission is also working to improve the overall investment environment, but it cannot succeed in this alone. All Member States must deliver on their side by stepping up their efforts to remove national obstacles to investment, as also stated in your report. The Member States should improve their business and investment environment in areas like insolvency, public procurement, judicial systems and the efficiency of public administration or sector—specific regulations. These priorities are well reflected in the 2016 country reports and the subsequent country—specific recommendations (CSRs). The Commission shares your assessment that further measures are needed to increase financing opportunities for businesses and to reduce the levels of non—performing loans. The latter weigh on banks’ earnings and their ability to finance new investment projects. The Commission is set to present a proposal on business restructuring and second chance, key elements of an appropriate insolvency framework.  I welcome your encouragement to address employment and social challenges and count on your support in delivering on these objectives. Structural reforms are essential to sustain the recovery and boost long-term growth. Economic change and reforms are not detrimental for our welfare: the opposite is true. Yet we need to pay attention not only to the benefits of reforms, but also the distribution of their impact across society. Increasing fairness and addressing inequalities is important, as significant employment and social challenges remain in spite of recent welcome improvements. Let me recall that employment in the EU has increased; since its lowest level in mid-2013, almost 8 million people found jobs with 4.5 million in the euro area. The EU employment rate for those aged 20 to 64 years is now at about 71% – back to its 2008 level – but there are still very large disparities among Member States like Greece. In Greece it stands at 56% versus Sweden where it is 81%. Unemployment in the EU is at the lowest rate since March 2009 and stays at 8.6% with 1.6 million fewer unemployed people in the EU compared to the same time last year. Long-term unemployment and youth unemployment also continue to decrease. Nevertheless, in August 2016, more than 4.2 million young people were unemployed and there were around 10 million long-term unemployed (unemployed for more than one year). While we are far from the Europe 2020 target of lifting at least 20 million people out of poverty or social exclusion by 2020, the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion is falling to the level of 2008 where we started off. Only last year, 3.5 million people came out of poverty.  Against this background, we emphasise the balance between flexibility and security in labour markets and we encourage the Member States to modernise their social safety nets and give a stronger role to activation measures. And we believe we need to go further. This is why we have launched a broad consultation on the European Pillar of Social Rights aimed at screening our acquis to see how we can modernise our labour market and social security systems and make sure that there are not only better opportunities for job creation but also better support for citizens. A third element of our policy triangle is responsible fiscal policies, balancing the need to avoid pro-cyclicality on the one hand and reduce public debt on the other. The EU’s average government deficit is forecast to continue decreasing this year and next. It is expected to stand at 2.1% of GDP in 2016 compared with 2.4% last year. The EU’s average public debt to GDP ratio is forecast to stabilise at around 86% of GDP in the EU this year and to start to decline gradually in 2017. Here I am referring to the spring economic forecast; as I said, the autumn economic forecast will be available in the first half of November. At the same time, when the economic cycle is taken into account, the fiscal stance in the EU is considered to be slightly expansionary: the right balance between keeping public finances healthy, while also recognising the subdued economic context.  The Commission values your support for the changes and improvements introduced in the European Semester since 2015. We have streamlined and simplified it, improved its democratic accountability and strengthened its social dimension.    We now present country reports much earlier than in the past, allowing a substantial discussion with the Member States. Fewer country—specific recommendations compared to the past result from better prioritisation on areas that require urgent attention. Social priorities, including two issues linked to unemployment and social inclusion, now occupy a greater place. The same is true for education and its links with the labour market. We now publish country-specific recommendations for the euro area at the same time as the Annual Growth Survey, allowing all euro area countries to develop a common understanding of the key macroeconomic challenges.  We have strengthened the dialogue with the Member States, the European Parliament, national parliaments and social partners. Personally, I systematically visit Member States and engage in discussions with all key actors at the national level and my colleagues do the same.  But even if the Semester has been improved over the past years, the degree of implementation of CSRs remains low. In the spring we found that the Member States made ‘limited to some progress’ in addressing the issues identified in the CSRs issued in 2015. And this progress varied across policy fields: most significant progress was observed in the areas of financial services and actual labour market policies, while definitely much more was expected to ensure a business and employment-friendly environment. In order to support a stronger reform implementation, the Commission’s Structural Reform Support Service stands ready to provide technical support upon request from a Member State. Our proposal for the Structural Reform Support Programme is now being discussed in the European Parliament. I trust in your support to bring it swiftly into place and make it available to all Member States in need.  The report we are discussing today also touches upon the Stability and Growth Pact and the ‘flexibility’ contained in its rules. The Commission will continue to use the ‘flexibility’ built into the Pact. This means, for example, taking into account the budgetary impact of the exceptional inflow of refugees or exceptional security needs. Let me also stress that a number of Member States benefit already from the ‘flexibility’ granted in relation to the implementation of major structural reforms and investment. The Commission will continue to apply these provisions where the conditions are fulfilled. However, all Member States should pursue responsible fiscal policies, in compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact, putting public finances on a sustainable track and addressing the still high public debt in many Member States.  All Member States could still step up efforts to achieve a more growth—friendly composition of public finances: make their tax systems fairer, more transparent and effective in providing incentives for job creation, and also ensure that the money is spent in the most effective way. The high tax wedge on labour should be addressed as it weighs on labour costs and reduces the net take-home pay for employees. Your report also points to this issue. Euro area Member States have submitted their draft budgetary plans as planned, by mid-October. The Commission is now analysing these plans and will come up with an assessment as required by the regulation.  We will table a comprehensive policy package in November. I am confident that it will provide an answer to many of your concerns. We will publish the Annual Growth Survey accompanied by a Draft Joint Employment Report and the Euro Area Recommendations. Under the macroeconomic imbalances procedure we will publish the Alert Mechanism Report. It will identify the Member States for an in-depth review in the context of the country reports.  Finally, as announced in President Juncker’s State of the Union speech in March 2017, in time for the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, the Commission will set out a vision for the long term on how to strengthen and reform our economic and monetary union. You will, of course, be continuously involved in the European Semester, as will the national parliaments.

It is quite trivial – to put it this way – to recognise at an early stage whether there are any aberrations in the Member States that could lead to states being unable to carry out their own tasks in the long term. That is why I am very grateful to the Commission for taking up, in the context of the country-specific recommendations, what we as a Parliament have also called for, namely a focus on really few points, and also to address them clearly. I would like to express my thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Sant, who has also taken up this idea of focusing on what can really be achieved in the context of the semester process, and to do so. For us as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the triad is important in achieving structural reforms for greater competitiveness. I believe that this is vital if we want to create permanent employment not only for young people, but for all people in the European Union. It is about creating an environment that triggers investment. I am very grateful, Mr Vice-President, for pointing out once again that the European Central Bank has done its job. But in a number of Member States, not everything has been fulfilled, so that the central bank's low interest rates flow into the real economy as low interest rates, thereby triggering investment and creating jobs. That is a very important point. We cannot solve this by creating more investment by the public authorities alone. That is why, Mr Sant, the dual tone of private and public investment is important, not just public investment. Thirdly, it is important for us as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to have a responsible budgetary policy, which is the core element of the European Semester. And it is important to measure one's against the strong, not against the weak. Then we are on the right track.

And this is because the European Semester has to consist of more than just coordinating a list of good wishes, of things that we will have to implement. It must truly be a set of measures that we implement quickly, forcefully and effectively and, moreover, fairly because, in the end, the biggest problem we have identified and have been detecting in this European Parliament is inequality, which is also the common cause of almost all the ills we analyse from the European institutions: populism, Euroscepticism , even protectionism — which is now increasing in the European Union in the rejection, for example, of trade agreements — of inequalities that produce fear, inequalities that cause paralysis and inequalities that produce Europhobia.  And we therefore need to do many more things than are in the hands of the Member States, mainly in terms of three aspects: reducing inequalities by improving the quality of employment, not only by creating jobs, but by improving quality, mainly wages.  We are living at a time when we are also seeing growth from exports slow in the coming times. And so it is not a question of social justice, but also of economic efficiency, raising wages to improve domestic demand and to increase recovery.  We also need a fairer taxation which, as I say, is serious not only to middle and working income but also to capital incomes and to redistribute wealth more, by the way, also combating poverty.  That is why we are telling the Member States again today that it is essential that they already set a minimum income at Member State level in order to take out of poverty the 120 million people who are now at risk of social exclusion. By fighting poverty, fighting inequalities, we will do a better economic semester, because not only will we be increasing the recovery but we will make it fairer and more decent.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3438, "date": "2016-10-25.json", "name": "Joachim Starbatty", "mepid": "124827", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to take back from the ECR Group.

That is the central problem, and we have also discussed it with Mr Sant. Mr Sant was a very fair and open rapporteur. But there was a central conflict, which he himself named. Namely, that the eurozone is a suboptimal currency area, or as I put it, the euro is driving eurozone members apart. In some countries the euro is overvalued, in others it is undervalued. In the undervalued countries, exports are subsidised. It is taxed in countries with an overvalued currency. It is clear that nothing neat can come out of this. It is necessary that we devalue or upgrade it. This is not possible, but instead the labour market must provide compensation. The labour market is the toughest adjustment instrument we know. That is why we need to move on to a different policy. We must no longer try to save the eurozone, but to save countries. What is necessary for this? Countries that have no growth, no employment should leave the monetary union. We need a debt cut and we need start-up financing.

Without name and shame, or name and price, Member States will not react and will care even less about our reports.

The most serious thing about the whole European Semester process I think is, at the moment, the lack of democratisation, which partly explains its poor results. I think we have a very serious problem and we need to associate more with national parliaments and, of course, to associate more with social actors, other words this will always be seen as an imposition with very poor results. The results are in those countries where there has been a memorandum and absolutely insane reforms have been forced. But the European Semester obviously has a relatively low level of compliance. First problem. Second problem. The economic policy approach of recent years has been totally wrong. From the triad that is always presented to us: investment, structural reforms and fiscal consolidation, we have in recent years had fiscal consolidation at suicidal levels. It has only now been reduced in the end by the policies of the European Central Bank. These are devaluative reforms that have also had a very high social cost and totally non-existent investment.  I think the report is right here to say that we need to put the focus on investment because the investment ratio for GDP, which fell a lot between 2008 and 2013, has only fallen slightly since 2014, but we are still at still very low levels: in the European Union 2.6%, below pre-crisis levels. And FEIE hasn't been an answer to that. I therefore believe that here, of course, there is a call to increase public investment to those countries with a large trade surplus: to boost their domestic demand. The report says that, and I am glad, and also a very important thing, which is that we have to make an aggregate calculation of the whole euro area, of what is the fiscal situation of the whole euro area, not of the countries one by one. I think that's extremely important. We must invest in education, human capital, innovation and R&amp;D, because if the only competitiveness strategy in the euro area is to compete for low wages, this is a real disaster.  I would like to point out here that it is very important to defend collective bargaining and minimum income, and to stop wage competition at once , as the report also points out. And I just add to what the President of the European Central Bank himself said: \"It's time to raise wages in the European Union.\" I think that should be clear. And finally, the last thing I would like to point out is that the report has not included any of the amendments that my group had tabled in relation to the Semester environmental indicators that this House has voted on, and I would like to call for these amendments to be voted on in favour tomorrow, because those indicators are extremely important.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3444, "date": "2016-10-25.json", "name": "Marco Valli", "mepid": "124778", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to take advantage of the presence of the Commission and the Commissioner to ask them what they are waiting for to enforce European rules with regard to the trade surplus, given that in the Union, in this report it is also sanctioned, there are imbalances due to economic and monetary union, which is not complete. These imbalances generate an excessive trade surplus, sanctioned and also highlighted by the reports of the Monetary Fund and the OECD. Well, Germany and the Netherlands have repeatedly violated these rules, but you continue to be strong with the weak countries: let us block the funds from Spain and Portugal, let us break the boxes for Italy, but Germany and the Netherlands continue to make this distortion. In addition, also with regard to the deficit, if we look at it, there is Mr Juncker who goes to say that France is France and therefore can do what he wants with the rules. So the rules don't work, just like the semester doesn't work. And I can understand the position of germans like Ferber, the colleague who has dealt with this report with me, who are in favour of austerity, in favour of the Stability and Growth Pact, but I really cannot understand why the Socialists are still in favour of what is written in this report, because always the usual mantra for two years now : more rigour, more austerity, more reforms, liberalisations of services, the labour market, private investment, wage devaluations, protests. But you have taken the votes to change this dogma relating to the Stability and Growth Pact, you have taken the votes to do one thing, instead you have rulers like Renzi, in Italy, who go around saying that they want to change the rules, then there is they put it in the Constitution in 2012 supporting a budget balance. Further constitutional reform now in 2016 still the European constraints stressed in the Constitution. But what do you want to change? You are unique in this European project which, if it does not put the debate on the euro and imbalances at the centre, as Stiglitz said, will unfortunately founder and founder unfortunately not neatly.

Control and personal responsibility are inextricably linked. Anyone who is currently calling for more Europeanisation in fiscal policy is at odds with the member states' claim to sovereignty. That is the reality. This is the reality of our current European treaties, and it is therefore important to strengthen the existing system, namely the system of ownership and control.

There are three messages in this report that the European Parliament directs to the Commission. The first is that the Commission should make the most of the flexibility allowed by the rules of the euro. The second is that we need to strengthen the Juncker Plan, but also ensure that it benefits the less developed regions, rather than aggravating divergences in Europe. And the third is that the Commission should take into account parliament's position when deciding on the suspension of funds for Portugal and Spain.  The majority of this Parliament has already spoken clearly against this suspension which would be unfair, contradictory and counterproductive.

This leads me to the next point which is of particular concern to the Commission: we are talking about accountability and irregularities. Since the Commission considers the deficits of the Member States to be an anomaly, it should, in a similar way, also regard the surpluses of the Member States as an anomaly.

A number of issues were raised during this debate, including how to facilitate investment and this is indeed one of the three priorities in our European Semester. The intention of the Commission is to continue to follow up on how we can promote investment through the Investment Plan for Europe, but also through the rules in the Stability and Growth Pact, which specifically allows for deviation from budgetary targets to promote more investment.  Issues related to the social dimension, dealing with the problems of poverty, of inequality, addressing the issues in our labour markets, are also featuring more prominently in the European Semester than was the case in previous years and the Commission intends to continue and follow up on this. The question of current account surpluses was raised and this is indeed also the question which is being addressed by the Commission to countries like Germany and the Netherlands. It is something which is the reason why the Commission is pursuing in-depth reviews of the economies of those countries and also finding them to be experiencing macroeconomic imbalances. So this is certainly part of the picture.  In any case, the Commission intends to continue its work along the priority lines which have been set up, promoting investment, structural reforms and fiscally responsible policies.

This was indeed quite a valuable stock-taking where we could hear your views on how the European Semester is functioning and, above all, what we can achieve together within the European Semester when it comes to our common efforts to work on jobs and growth and economic prosperity.  Now we know where we are finding ourselves. First of all I would like to once again recall how much we value the revamped European Semester. I think that the changes the Commission introduced in 2015, last year, are very good because they help us better transform what we agree in the European Semester and then transform it into action at national level. I remember when the Semester started; it can hardly be compared in quality with the Semester that we are having right now.  Secondly, many of you have rightly pointed and appealed to Member States to better implement. This is once again well understood and legitimate. Nevertheless, I represent the Member States and you would agree with me that implementation is not a bureaucratic exercise. At the end of the day, it is hard to convince our people – our voters – to support reforms and structural reforms, how to observe fiscal rules that we have established ourselves, and this is very painful. So please understand why we have committed to better implement. At the same time, bear in mind that this is a very demanding process back home.  Lastly, I hope we will be able in the Council to draw on lessons from this year, this 2016 Semester, when preparing the next one. And the next one, I would like to announce, will be for the first time on the agenda of General Affairs Council in November.

If anything, I hope that our work together in preparing for this report, as well as the debate in plenary, have served to underline once more the challenge of investment in Europe. When we talk about investment we are really talking about the future, for investment builds the foundations for future progress and for new achievements. We are also talking, however, about the present, for investment replaces and renews those resources which we need now to maintain the living standards of people. When we say resources we mean material ones, human ones and those resources that relate to knowledge and techniques. The sad truth is that in Europe, as elsewhere, but certainly in Europe, investment in real terms has fallen well below the levels that it had reached, let us say, ten years ago. The shortfall covers both investment to replace what has been used up, as well as investment in new resources and utilities. Whatever our views about the available policy options, we have shown that we care about investment, that we consider it to be a priority. Perhaps there is also agreement that more must be done to promote and enhance it, though there is disagreement about how this challenge can be achieved.  I would like to acknowledge and support the emphasis that the Commission, in its initiatives and in its country-specific recommendations, has given to the topic of investment. Still, the Commission needs to do more, perhaps much more, and not simply by widening the EFSI instrument. It also needs, in my view, to affirm the need for more public investment that is sharper, better focused, better planned, better implemented. However, about this, not all agree.  Finally, I would think that from the debate that we have held on the country-specific recommendations, two other main issues can be underlined. First, there is the importance of allocating more resources to create a European investment culture, to renew investments in education and knowledge-based activities, not least in the digital field but also in the basic sciences, all tying into research and development as well as the quest for innovation. Secondly, there is the need to ensure that the country-specific recommendations are meaningful to all relevant actors so that they also own them. A central involvement should be given to subnational and to regional authorities.

It is about promoting investment, particularly in innovation and research, as well as for SMEs, creating sustainable jobs to counter persistent unemployment, and socially balanced structural reforms combined with responsible fiscal policies. In this context, the report explicitly emphasises that the number of recommendations made by the Commission to the Member States should in future be limited to priority issues of macroeconomic and social impact.

Unfortunately, indebted Member States, with levels of public debt around one hundred percent of gross domestic product, and some well over one hundred percent, such as Greece, Italy, Portugal, do not yet want to act decisively to reduce indebtedness. In this way, I maintain the state of instability for the whole euro area. While economic growth is still anemic, reducing public debt requires clear measures to restructure public expenditure, bringing budget deficits under control. The theory that if you spend more, increasing public debt, you'll get economic growth that will help you then reduce debt doesn't work when you're over-indebted.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament and the Commission are strong allies in the drive to reform corporate taxation in Europe and to do so with ambition and determination.  The strength with which you have seized on this subject, combined with our initiatives, which I believe are ambitious, have already made very significant changes. Today, we are closer to fair and effective taxation in the European Union than we were two years ago and, indeed, more than ever.  We have pushed tax transparency step by step on the practices of Member States as well as those of multinationals. We have built new barriers against the manipulation of taxable bases and the transfer of profits through new anti-abuse rules that will become binding throughout the European Union.  The package, which the Commission adopted today, is much more than just a package of new measures. It is more than an extension of what we have already done together. It is a comprehensive, structural and structuring framework for corporate taxation in Europe, a new framework that looks to the future and in which corporate taxation will by definition be fair and pro-growth. This framework will enable companies and investors to develop their activities in the European Union, not through selective tax breaks or secret tax rulings but simply because they will benefit from a tax environment that will be simple, readable, stable and also, of course, favourable to economic activity. For me, transparency and competitiveness go hand in hand. Finally, it is a framework in which all businesses, large and small, pay their taxes where they make their profits and create wealth.  At the heart of the package adopted today is a project which is, I know, strongly supported and even wanted by this House: the relaunch of the consolidated common corporate tax base, namely the ACCIS. The CGTA aims to tax businesses in a way that reflects the true spirit of the single market, namely, first, uniform rules for calculating taxable profits; second, a one-time tax return to be completed through a one-stop shop; and a system of distribution of profits between Member States, which can then tax them at their national rates. Businesses will also be rewarded for their growth-oriented activities with important new elements in this version of the ICSC, because we have chosen - and I think it was rational - not to represent the same text that was rejected by the Council, given the debates that took place and also the new context in which we are working. We have put in place a great deduction for research and development. I want to emphasize this point because we are really making a tremendous effort in this area and we are making a very powerful commitment to research and development. In other words, companies that invest in research and development will be able to deduct one and a half times what they have spent from their taxable base. This incentive will be even more generous and will go up to 200% for start-ups, which will be able to deduct the amount of costs exposed to this height. We have also introduced a measure in the CTAis that will promote corporate financing in the capital markets, which is consistent with our search for a single capital market, by correcting the debt bias that exists today in the majority of corporate tax regimes. The goal is to promote and promote healthier financing, stronger capital markets and greater economic stability. The VAC WILL also have the advantage of eliminating many cases of double taxation. However, until this consolidated common base is in place, we will still need an effective solution for non-CSA companies. There are more than 900 cases of double taxation currently being disputed in the European Union, which of course generates huge costs and a lot of legal uncertainty for the companies concerned. That is why today we are also proposing an improved system for resolving double taxation disputes. We want to guarantee companies a predictable and definitive solution in the long run when they are taxed more than once on the same income.  THE ACCIS is a powerful tool to prevent and counter corporate tax evasion. As the As the European Parliament has asked us, we have proposed that the ACCIS be mandatory for the largest multinationals. The ACCIS will incorporate the measures already adopted by the Member States in the Directive against Tax Evasion and today we are adding to these provisions a final measure to combat hybrid schemes with third countries and therefore outside the European Union. Why relaunch the CSA? I know that this Parliament has waited a long time for this project and has long supported the benefits that must flow from it. I also know that companies are looking forward to implementing this scheme as quickly as possible. And I can understand that some people doubt the chances of success of the CCTA, given the lack of agreement on the previous proposal.  Let me try to instil a little optimism on this point because this time it is different. It is different because we have a better proposal, a better approach, a more favourable political environment as well, given all the events that have taken place in recent years and the progress that has already been made in corporate taxation.  Our proposal is strengthened. Its obligatory nature makes it a powerful tool in the fight against tax evasion, while the incentives, which I have already mentioned, improve the ability of our taxation to support jobs, growth and stability.  Our approach is not only strengthened, it is also more pragmatic. We propose a two-step approach. First, Member States need to define the common base in order to start quickly reaping the benefits it offers. Second, consolidation will also need to be implemented quickly. Nevertheless, I would like to stress forcefully - because I know that this is a subject that can be questioned and that it may be a temptation in the forthness of the coming discussions in the Council - that these two stages are closely linked. For the Commission, there is no question of abandoning or delaying the consolidation which, on its own, will give full scope to the common base. It is indeed a comprehensive agreement in two phases that we want and not a first phase, and then another which would be postponed to the Greek calendars and could be split.  My goal is that this consolidation will be in place by 2021 at the latest. I am counting on the European Parliament to continue to put pressure on our Member States to achieve this goal because, as I said, we have your support, that of businesses and NGOs, but the ball is, as usual, in the Member States' court. I'm getting to my very last point. Today, I believe that we have the ideal, if not ideal, environment to revive the ACCIS. Given all the benefits of this project, we expect Member States to work quickly to adopt this proposal. I will conclude by thanking this House for this long-standing support of the ACCIS project and inciting you - but is it necessary? I am well known that it is not to play your full role and to weigh in the adoption of the proposals presented today.  Today we have the opportunity to build a fairer and more stable Europe and a more competitive corporate tax system in Europe for the good of our citizens, our businesses and our Union as a whole. At a time when Europe is under attack and populism is soaring, this is a project that is part of a more transparent and just tax approach that our citizens understand both the necessity and the usefulness of. This is one more good proof of Europe that I invite you to support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3466, "date": "2016-10-25.json", "name": "Dariusz Rosati", "mepid": "28394", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I welcome the Commission’s proposal for a single set of corporate tax rules for doing business in the EU. The present situation with 28 different corporate tax systems co-existing within one single market is untenable. It puts an unnecessary administrative burden on companies, reduces their international competitiveness and creates ample opportunities for them to engage in aggressive tax planning practices. Why would you oppose the harmonisation of national tax rates across the EU? There is clearly a need to harmonise national regulations in the area of corporate tax base. Firstly, we want to be serious about fighting tax avoidance and tax evasion in the EU. We want to make sure that taxes are paid where the value is created. That is why we need a common framework for corporate taxation that is simple, effective and transparent.  Secondly, we all want our companies to fully exploit the enormous potential of the single market. For that we need common European rules on corporate taxation, which would facilitate trade and investment across the EU, and eliminate unfair tax competition. That is why a European directive on common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB) is urgently needed. Let me draw your attention to three interesting novelties that were mentioned by the Commissioner here. The first is the very generous tax treatment on R&amp;D expenditure, the second is the preferential treatment of innovative start—ups, and the third is a rule against the debt-bias.

We wish you more luck than your predecessors who, on March 16, 2011, put the previous proposal on the table.  As you pointed out, the context may have changed. The idea that tax evasion must be tackled and that the lack of a consolidated corporate tax base promotes tax evasion has made its way. The idea that, basically, between our economies, since we are always told about competition between our economies, it is better to know what taxes are paid, which is not the case today. The proposal you are putting on the table seems to us to be a good basis for discussion, but you have anticipated the three or four points on which, of course, in the eyes of the European Parliament, there could be debate. You insisted that consolidation would take place in parallel. However, it is the essence of the project, because it is the one that effectively fights tax evasion. I therefore hope that this Parliament will be as firm as possible to ensure that the two go hand in hand.

You have set a turnover threshold of EUR 750 million, a mandatory threshold, but you may be able to expect that some in this Parliament will want to lower this turnover in order to broaden the consolidated base of this tax.

In the European Union, losses as a result of this process are estimated at EUR 50 to 70 billion per year. So it is time to create a fair tax system without grey areas and tax ruling practices at pan-European level. All Member States of the Union should take measures to ensure that multinational companies are taxed in the country where they make their profits and to stop turning to tax havens such as the Netherlands or Luxembourg.

We also have BEPS, and today we have the latest proposals on CCCTB. Indeed, there are positive aspects to this proposal and it will help to further tackle tax evasion, but there is a price. Yes, tax rates will be untouched, but tax sovereignty will be eroded. Member States will no longer be able to decide what is deductible and what is non-deductible, for example. Ministers for finance will not be able to change certain tax provisions during budgets, even if they believe it will benefit their economy. So this proposal asks Member States to hand over significant new powers to the Commission.  The other issue that concerns me is where corporation tax will be paid. Has any analysis been done to see what countries will lose corporation tax revenue and what countries will gain corporation tax revenue under your apportionment model? This model means that Member States with small domestic markets like my own, Ireland, or the Netherlands, who have secured significant foreign direct investment, will lose out on corporation tax revenue. It is absolutely essential that figures are produced so that Member States know the extent of the changes. This proposal has merit, but there will be winners and losers.

Indeed, when it comes to the conclusion of free trade treaties, the Commission and the Council show an unwavering determination to move as quickly as possible, even if it means using intimidation to bring back into line those States that would be a little too recalcitrant. But when it comes to combating tax evasion, the pressure suddenly drops, as if by some miracle, by at least ten notches. The forced march, which is de rigueur in trade treaties, suddenly gives way to a kind of optional hike. Wallonia is now under maximum pressure because it is vetoing the signing of a trade treaty tailor-made for the interests of multinationals, but it has been almost five years since Ireland, Malta, Cyprus and the United Kingdom blocked without any pressure the project we are talking about this evening. It is as if, when a blockade serves the interests of multinationals, it is kept low profile, whereas when a blockade is opposed to the interests of multinationals, all means are allowed to lift it.

If you reduce tax competition between states there is no incentive to keep the public services efficient and the government will continue to plunder taxpayers’ hard—earned money.

We say yes to tax competition within the European Union itself but in transparency, fairness and loyalty. This is the goal of your project. The experience gained in the TAXE committee leads me to make two recommendations. I address the first to our Parliament: let us build on the relationship we have had with the relevant committees of both houses of the United States Congress. On taxation, it is Congress that decides, not the administration. However, U.S. legislation is the primary source of tax optimization schemes. Second, I give advice to our governments: our direct taxation is a century behind.

I believe that this directive is crucial, because in the future a multinational will be able to comply with a single regime within the Union to calculate its taxable result rather than different schemes specific to each of the Member States in which it operates. THE ACCIS provides a comprehensive solution to the current problem of corporate taxation in the European Union and contributes to improving the business environment in our single market by making it simpler and cheaper for cross-border activities. The ACCIS is above all a powerful instrument to combat corporate tax evasion by removing disparities between national systems and establishing common provisions to combat tax evasion. I will add a few points, Commissioner. Having said that, the Commission now wants large groups to subscribe to the CSA on a mandatory way. This is a first step forward, but unfortunately, as my colleague Pervenche Berès has said, the threshold for defining large groups is EUR 750 million. We are obviously arguing for it to be reduced to EUR 40 million, as is the case for banks. If this threshold is not lowered, large companies such as, for example, Jeff de Bruges, a well-known chocolatier in France, would not be considered a large group, although it is well known that this company makes more than 600 million profits per year and is established all over the world. I don't think our citizens would understand.  I am also a little sad that the consolidation of the tax base is only done in a second phase. One text would have been more coherent, but we are obviously counting on you to have these two texts voted together. Finally, it is clear that for tax rates, we must have a European reflection, as we do in other parts of the world, for example in the United States. We could very well consider a European fixed rate and a limited variable rate.

Otherwise, this rule could offer a tax model to large corporations that allows them to compare the different countries even better and promote even more tax dumping and even more tax evasion. That is why I ask you, Commissioner, if it is to be done seriously and that it also deal with the free movement of capital, and therefore by regulating it, and to deal with tax havens, ending with them.

For many years, the Green Group has been campaigning for strong political action to achieve tax justice, so we are delighted to welcome the re-launch of the Commission’s proposal for a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base and we welcome the message it sends: that the political institutions are listening to people again, and that they are not continuing to chase after corporations who are always one step ahead. This is the sort of action we need if we are to rebuild people’s confidence, both in the European institutions and in our democratic politicians. The way we currently tax companies, treating subsidiaries from the same company as if they are completely independent entities, does not reflect the reality of their operations. Implementing a common and consolidated system for taxing companies across the Union would be a crucial step towards ending tax avoidance by global corporations. But I would also stress, as other colleagues have done, the importance of moving towards a minimum corporate tax rate across our continent, bringing an end to the race to the bottom on tax rates.

Tax should be paid where profits are made, and I think that is a really good guiding principle. In our single market, the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) is fundamental to an effective non—bureaucratic tax cooperation for our Member States, for our companies, and for growth and jobs in Europe. We need to get rid of the 28 Member States’ different national systems that blur up things. It is also a crucial step to end big corporations’ tax dodging in the EU and to deliver more tax justice for our citizens. Tax avoidance and evasion is threatening our welfare state in Europe today by eroding the tax base. Tax dodging, illuminating massive tax injustices for our citizens and SMEs that pay their fair taxes, is destroying jobs and growth in Europe because of unfair competition and an unlevel playing field for companies in our single market. SMEs create more than eight out of ten jobs and should not be punished but rewarded in our market. We have witnessed numerous scandals – LuxLeaks, Panama Papers, Bahamas Leaks – and this has revealed a corrupt and unfair tax system. This is only the tip of the iceberg. Therefore transparency, simple and better rules and effective cooperation need to replace this broken tax system. The European Parliament has applied real pressure to ensure this and several times asked for an effective CCCTB. This means that both the common corporate tax base and consolidation should be adopted as one package, and the threshold of EUR 750 million should be lowered to make the system more comprehensive and more effective. I also very much welcome the simple and clear rules regarding R&amp;D that in particular support SMEs and start—ups.

We need transparency, we need a single Community corporate tax base as the basis for all competition. Those who are opposed to this transparency can really only be concerned with maintaining the lack of transparency – the shaming that enables artificial small-scale calculation of corporate profits.

I have listened to everything that has been said here and I really take your remarks as an encouragement.  Together we want to put in place a fair and effective corporate tax system within the Union. THE ACCIS - and you all measure it - is really a revolutionary project that will achieve the much-needed single business tax market. I really look forward to your support to move this issue forward and I thank you for showing it here.  Some of you have raised the issue of the fiscal sovereignty of the Member States. That is precisely what we are trying to do with the package presented today, which is to restore the fiscal sovereignty of the Member States.  With the ACCIS, the European Union, which remains the world's leading trading power, will be able to impose its tax rules on these economic giants that are multinationals rather than to be satisfied, at best, with their alms. Thus, the fiscal sovereignty of all Member States will be restored. It must not be a word, it must be a truth. There will be no winner or loser. The consolidated base will be distributed according to objective criteria that reflect the economic activity of the companies. The principle that we defend - you know that I am pushing it methodically in all the texts I propose - is that of effective taxation whereby profits must be taxed where they are created. It is on this principle that we have structured this proposal.  I hear what you are saying, both of which, about rates. Some want us to harmonize them, others fear them. As such, I have to do the desirable and the possible. I do not comment on the desirable, but I know what is possible given the unanimity rule. I would therefore like to say that we will not touch the rates , and I say this in the clearest way - and that we will never touch them until the Member States themselves want to do so or as long as the rule does not change, but I do not see a fierce appetite for treaty changes at this time. Therefore, the most important instrument, which allows states to manage their tax revenues, will remain intact.

The Commission's proposal for a uniform method of calculating profits is a first important step towards tax justice. Taxes must finally be paid where profits are made. In order to achieve this objective, I see a need for improvement: the separation of the tax base from consolidation into two separate directives must not lead to consolidation being postponed until the last day. This is the only way to impute profits to the Member State in which they are created. The common tax base must also go hand in hand with EU-wide minimum tax rates. Currently, corporation tax is 25% in Austria, but only 12.5% in Ireland, for example. Without minimum tax rates, we cannot put an end to tax dumping. Only companies with a turnover of more than EUR 750 million per year will be affected. This would affect only 1.6% of multinationals.

This is because of the hard work of this House and thanks to the true leadership of the Dutch Presidency, which understood that this piece of legislation is vital.  Europe is now not only on the cusp of a digital revolution, but we are in the middle of it. It is the policy of the Union that every sector, both private and public, should be digital, and that by going digital we will renew growth in Europe and make life easier for our citizens. If our digital services are not accessible to all of our citizens, we are not helping them but are instead holding many back and introducing new barriers. There are more than 80 million Europeans with a disability. As we age, every one of us will have either a temporary or permanent disability at some point. This is as true for those digital natives among us as it is for those born before the internet. Making digital information accessible is as much in our own individual interest as that of society as a whole. I am proud that, as of tomorrow, web accessibility will be the law of the land in Europe. Every government website and – maybe more importantly – every government application will have to be accessible. This law applies not only to the public, but also to internal government websites, meaning that it will help the millions of government employees with disabilities and help open new job opportunities for others. This law means that all online and digital forums and all payment systems will have to be accessible. It will end the outlandish situation whereby we require people to pay their taxes online, only to create a website that not all people can use. Today, we are saying that e—government must be open and service all citizens. For this reason, I am proud. Is this the final step? No, Mr Commissioner, it is not. There are still some limitations to making this law proportional, but, if something is not accessible, governments will now be accountable to give a clear reason why it is not, and that reason cannot be that it would simply cost too much. Every citizen will have a right to challenge such a decision. It is also not the last step because the digital world is more than government websites alone. We still need a strong European Accessibility Act that covers both the digital and physical worlds. Parliament has a good voice for this in my colleague, Mr Løkkegaard. We need to adopt the Accessibility Act as soon as possible. When it has been adopted, the two combined will mean that we can say that we have served our citizens well and done everything we can to help all of them. I am proud to have my name attached to this legislation, and I look forward to its adoption tomorrow.

The Web Accessibility Directive is a major step towards an inclusive digital single market and digital society. As the European Union population ages and the number of people with disability is expected to increase to 120 million by 2020, the internet is an essential way to access and provide information and services. It is therefore more important than ever to make sure that everyone can benefit from it. The directive will make the internet more accessible, especially for people with disabilities. It will help people left behind in the digital society to have the same opportunities online to participate to a fuller extent in the digital society, and it will lead to a more independent life. It will make websites and mobile apps easier to navigate, interact and use. People with disabilities, such as those with visual or hearing impairments, will be able to better access, perceive and understand digital information and services, for example through subtitles or audio descriptions. the directive will not only benefit citizens, it will bring economic benefits to our societies as a whole. In particular the directive will benefit to market this with positive spill-over or effect, not only for public sector bodies but also for other players producing products and services relating to the accessibility of websites and mobile applications. The directive shows the commitment of the European Union and its Member States to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in promoting access to new information and communications technologies and systems of public sector bodies. Since the adoption of the Commission’s proposal four years ago, technological development has in the meantime required some adaptation. We welcome the work of Parliament and the Council to give a wider scope to the directive. Extending it to nearly all public sector bodies’ websites and also covering mobile applications will make the directive more pervasive and future-proof. The Commission will work to support the effective implementation of the directive. They count on the cooperation with Member States, a cooperation that has already been proven to be efficient in the past. President, honourable Members, that you very much indeed for such excellent cooperation and for your attention.

I am therefore very pleased that we can finally vote on this issue tomorrow. The agreement, after almost four years of deliberations and negotiations, is more than overdue. Public institutions and municipalities are already doing a lot to improve barrier-free access to information and eGovernment services in the course of digitalisation. But much more needs to be done to give people with disabilities equal access to public services and websites. With the text now before us, we have found a balanced compromise that requires a great deal, but also offers sufficient flexibility. For example, all public sector websites fall within the scope of the Directive. It was also very important to fully integrate public sector apps, because people with disabilities in particular are increasingly using their smartphones and therefore need accessible apps. In return, a clear and unambiguous list of exceptions was negotiated and a disproportionate clause was introduced. It was important to ensure that excessive demands are not placed, because a reduction in online content and services due to disproportionately high requirements would have had a negative impact on all European citizens and would not have led to an improvement in the situation and fair participation. The outcome of the negotiations was a way of taking account of all sides.

This would meet the four criteria of the barrier-free Internet: perceptibility, usability, comprehensibility and robustness.  It is just as important as access to websites to be able to use apps without discrimination. That was one of Parliament's successes in the trialogue negotiations.  Once implemented, the directive means a great relief to everyday life and an improvement in their participation opportunities for more than 80 million people who are physically or age-related. Particular mention should also be made of the establishment of a feedback mechanism through which users can notify the public authorities of shortcomings in the accessibility of websites or mobile applications. Member States must designate a competent authority to monitor and enforce compliance. This also guarantees that the whole thing is more than a nice declaration of intent.

Unfortunately, there are around 80 million EU citizens who cannot benefit from this advantage, cannot benefit from the digital society, and I can even say that it will be cumulatively disadvantaged from not being able to achieve these benefits. We should have a goal of being accessible to everyone. In 2016, talking about the fact that there are people who cannot enjoy these benefits – I think – is a task that needs to be solved very urgently.

Secondly, I believe that we have struck a good balance between accessibility on the one hand and, on the other hand, avoiding disproportionate burdens on public authorities.

I would particularly like to pay tribute to my shadows and thank them for all their work, for their positive approach and for their cooperation over many months. This regulation will strengthen our phytosanitary security and our biodiversity through a proportionate and risk-based approach that provides quicker decision-making, faster action and better collaboration between Member States.  Our problem is that pests and diseases do not respect national borders. That is why it is so important to have an EU-wide agreement. At its most basic, this regulation aims first to prevent the entry of plant pests into the EU, then to eradicate harmful organisms when they are found to be present and, finally, to contain the spread of any outbreak when the first aim fails.  So this agreement updates rules that date back to 2000, in order to provide a modern, responsive and effective regime for plant health. It provides better protection at import, against high-risk trades, it provides increased surveillance and financial support, including better prioritisation of the most harmful of organisms, it introduces stricter eradication measures, it harmonises plant passports and it gives clearer rules for protected zones.  In 2015, the value of crop output in the EU amounted to over EUR 200 billion. It is a key sector for European agriculture and it represents the livelihood of thousands of farmers. We need only look at the devastation caused by Xylella fastidiosa to see both the socioeconomic and the environmental damage which can be caused by pests. Xylella has affected thousands of acres of olive groves in southern Member States and caused severe economic losses for farmers. Another example is Chalara or Ash dieback, which has spread rapidly across continental Europe. In the UK, this fungus was first confirmed in 2012 in trees growing in nurseries or in recently established plantations. It has spread so rapidly that it is estimated that 80 million ash trees could be affected.  It is crucial to protect EU agriculture, horticulture and forestry and as a continent our defences are only as strong as the weakest link. New pests and diseases are emerging all the time as a result of globalisation, climate change and the increasing volume of imports from new parts of the world. All this increases the risk of future outbreaks of harmful organisms. So the challenge of how best to respond to these risks has led to significant political differences amongst the Member States and across Parliament.  I believe the compromise we reached represents the best agreement possible to bridge these differences. It strikes the right balance between facilitating legitimate trade, on the one hand, and protecting the EU from pests from third countries, on the other. A new article was inserted, introducing the possibility of a preliminary assessment on the basis of which high-risk plants, plant products or other objects would be prevented from entering Union territory until a full risk assessment was carried out. Presuming the safeguards for defining high risk are appropriately applied, then the scope for introducing a closed system via the back door is negligible. I really strongly recommend this agreement to Parliament.

This is a very important piece of legislation. It is the result of a great deal of hard work by Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Its outcome is, I believe, a credit to all three institutions. We all share a deep and common understanding of the fundamental importance of plant health and its link to the protection of our people’s health, agriculture, food chain and environment. Furthermore, we collectively recognise that outbreaks of plant pest will occur from time to time. This is inevitable due to the intensification of global trade as well as climate change. The case of the outbreak of xylella fastidiosa in Italy, France and, to a small extent, in Germany, is the most recent reminder of the serious threat that pests pose for our farmers, agricultural production, environment and the livelihoods of so many producers. Another example is the pine nematode outbreak in Portugal, affecting our forestry industry. We must ensure we are best prepared to deal with future outbreaks of plant pests and also make sure that our territory remains protected from the entry of non—European pests. The new regulation has been drafted and negotiated while taking into account all of those concerns. In this view it will introduce more protective rules for the early detection and eradication of dangerous plant pests, if found present in EU territory, and more proactive tools and actions such as the prioritisation of pest action plans for eradication. Contingency plans and simulation exercises allow the European Union to adopt a more proactive policy against the entry of pests from other countries and the import of high—risk plants and plant products; harmonise and simplify the rules concerning certification of plants and plants products, thus facilitating their production, marketing and controls; and specify the responsibilities of the producers through legislation and authorisation before they produce, market and certify the health of their plants. All those new provisions are based on the concept that we have to do more in order to suffer less from the devastating effects of some plant diseases. I take the opportunity to recall that Member States remain responsible for import controls and surveillance in their territories to avoid the presence of those pests. Therefore more resources need to be allocated by the Member States to cope with those important tasks. Otherwise this EU law will not bring the expected benefits. In the coming years the Commission will focus its inspection programme on import control audits and will check whether European Union plant health rules are implemented in the Member States in an effective and harmonised manner. All the elements included in this new framework are well thought out and have been thoroughly discussed with all interested parties. I therefore look forward with both hope and expectation to a broad agreement and endorsement of this file.

The history of plant pathology is full of examples of plants that bear no symptoms —disease carriers—but that, when imported to other latitudes, wreak havoc on other species and other genera. This risk is compounded by the single market, as the Commissioner has very well said, because one country is imported and another crop suffers the damage. As an example we have the annoying Xylella, which you have also mentioned, which continues to dramatically affect Italy, France, and also Germany. By all indications, this plague arrived in Europe through an ornamental coffee plant imported through the port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. That is precisely what we are trying to avoid with preventive measures to combat imported pests.  The new Regulation introduces a new mechanism to combat the emerging risks of epidemics unknown to the European Union through temporary action applications.

First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur and my fellow shadow rapporteurs for the constructive work we have done in the European Parliament. However, I would also like to briefly explain our position as an ALDE Group, because trade brings prosperity but is under pressure in every way possible. The debate is being conducted with a lot of rhetoric, with no proper look at the content.  Since the 1970s, we have been assessing imports of plants from third countries for the possible risks involved. That's what we call an open import system. This allows us to strike a healthy balance between protecting against plant diseases and protecting our important commercial interests. As early as May 2013, the European Commission wanted to address weaknesses in the current system without jeopardising the open import system. The European Parliament wanted the same thing in April 2014.  However, the outcome of the negotiations now jeopardises this: tightened rules and vaguely formulated criteria allow the possibility of banning imports of plants and plant products from third countries, without adequately assessing the risks. In other words, we may be at the mercy of member states that block imports for political reasons. I find this unacceptable! That is why, on behalf of the Liberals in the European Parliament, I have tabled an amendment not to support this agreement.

But we also need mechanisms to detect the presence and development of pests of invasive species entering the European Union with imports of other agricultural products, as happened with Vespa velutina. That is why we are asking for a European strategy in which farmers and farmers are recalled for early detection, monitoring and research, and to establish the necessary actions to prevent, eradicate and prevent pests of invasive species from extending.

It was necessary to update the Regulation that prevents the entry of pests and, therefore, we welcomed this proposal on which we have worked, especially my colleague Jordi Sebastio, which I replace, to make it as safe as possible. However, we call on the Commission not to take a decade to draft the implementing acts of the new Regulation to exempt low-risk seeds, the exchange of seeds between farmers and the conservation of genetic biodiversity.  The consequences of pests such as black spot or citrus chancro are incalculable and we are very concerned that lately the Commission will try, through an implementing act, to amend Directive 2000/29/EC, to limit controls on citrus fruits from third countries, which would leave our producers helpless.  I therefore ask that the intention of the Regulation which we are going to vote on in this session be respected and that the Commission does not seek subterfuge to limit controls on the importation of citrus fruits.

Northern Finland and Cyprus are unlikely to sing from the same song sheet in this respect; the EU will, however, expect them to do so. Controlling pests requires pesticides. The EU institutions are doing their best to reduce the active ingredients that may be used. The latest victim are the endocrine disruptors, and their demise will reduce the number of materials available from 400 to a little over 300, creating more pressure on those that remain to succumb to increasing resistance from the target pest.

Madam President, the European Union is now a sieve open to the four winds. In this open area, how can we monitor if organisms are slipping into import products? This dogmatic refusal to control has in fact allowed the entry of plant pests. In the past, the tomato miner, then the Asian gnat and, more recently, the Xylella fastidiosa have been able to colonize our territories. However, we continue to import products from countries that do not have our trust, have neither our standards nor our requirements, and whose management is more than opaque. So let the states decide!  The risk of isolation and the spirit of cooperation should be sufficient, in my opinion, for everyone to put in place an intelligent and secure health policy. We say 'yes' to increased controls, to the traceability obligation we keep asking for, to the establishment of a list of potentially at-risk countries, and to all these precautionary measures, especially if they are decided by sovereign states in a spirit of cooperation. On the other hand, we do not want the Commission to rule by distributing the right points and punishments to the states or regions. Alas, as is often the case with UERSS, the worst is expected.

I think we all recognise the importance of bio-security to the EU. This agreement modernises the regime, both for imports from third countries and for intra-EU movements of plants and plant products. It strengthens surveillance, eradication and containment and improves prevention at import. And it does this without needlessly burdening growers or the horticulture trade. The strengthened surveillance elements in this agreement are particularly important.  Currently, co-financing is limited to costs for eradication and containment but not surveillance. The new regime introduces annual surveys to check for the presence of pests and also the listing of a new category of union quarantine pests. For trade, the delegation of responsibilities to private operators to issue plant passports has been a major step forward. The new rules aim to restore trust in the system by harmonising the format for passport information and extending the scope to cover all plants for planting except for certain seeds. This agreement has undergone years of negotiations. We adopted a first reading position in April 2014 and, thanks to the tireless work of the shadows, over seven trilogues, we finally reached agreement just before Christmas. The agreement we reached strikes the right balance: protecting trade while allowing us to respond to threats in a coordinated and effective way across the EU. It is crucial to protect European agriculture and forestry from pests and diseases, and it is essential to put in place this legislative framework with its new stronger provisions without further delay.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3545, "date": "2016-10-25.json", "name": "Ivan Jakovčić (ALDE)", "mepid": "124754", "text": "  Written. – Pests on the inn know no borders.

Madam President, Commissioner Andriukaitis, ladies and gentlemen, Minister, I am speaking on behalf of the 7 co-signatories of the resolution tabled following two questions with a request for a written reply. Trans fat acids are unsaturated fats found in many industrially produced partially hydrogenated vegetable oils. TFA legislation is one of the priorities for the European Parliament, which reiterates here its concern about the risks posed by TFA to human health. The consumption of these oils is in fact associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Recently, in fact, a study has been published showing a significant correlation between the consumption of trans fatty acids and cerebral ischemic events. There are also strong suspicions that such acids may contribute to a large extent to arteriosclerosis processes and thus increase the risk of myocardial infarction.  Who and FAO recommend reducing intake below 1% of daily calorie intake through diet, while EFSA, the European Food Safety Authority, recommends that as little as possible be taken. Parliament therefore considers that it is not appropriate to act only at national level and that action by the European Union is needed to reduce the average intake of trans acids significantly. Trans fatty acids are used by the food industry for their characteristics, giving the products the desired consistency and ensuring a long shelf life, but above all they represent an inexpensive production factor. Foods currently produced with these acids are mainly foods consumed widely among young people. It is precisely the lack of consumer awareness of the negative health effects of TFA that makes mandatory labelling for these acids an important, albeit incomplete, tool. We call on the European Commission to introduce a legal limit in the European Union as soon as possible on the content of industrial TFA, both as ingredients and as end products in all food products, in order to reduce intake by the entire population. We also call for this proposal to be accompanied by an impact assessment introducing the costs of industrial reformulation to be incurred in the event of the introduction of a mandatory limit and the potential spill-over of these costs onto consumers. Finally, we call on the Commission to work with Member States to improve nutritional literacy, encouraging consumers and enabling them to make healthier food choices and engaging industry to promote healthy product reformulation. As representatives of the citizens, we have an obligation to call for the adoption of useful tools to enable consumers to make healthier choices about the foods they consume and the diet in general and which could promote the provision of healthier food options to consumers, including, in this case, the provision of information on trans fats or restrictions on their use.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3548, "date": "2016-10-25.json", "name": "Ivan Korčok", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, honourable Members, let me thank Parliament for the interest it has shown in this issue. You have been involved in highlighting all the scientific, practical and political aspects, and the consequences of an excessive consumption of trans-fatty acids or trans fats in the Union. The Council fully agrees that the risks entailed by excessive consumption of trans fats in the Union, and in particular the increased risk of coronary heart disease among the population, raises a serious public health problem. Preventive measures aimed at avoiding chronic diseases and at promoting healthy lifestyles, including incentives to healthier diets and processed food reformulation, are topics that have been the subject of many discussions by the Union health ministers in recent years. Again, a few days ago at the meeting organised by the Presidency in Bratislava and in the presence of Commissioner Andriukaitis, ministers had an opportunity to highlight their concerns related to an excessive consumption of trans-fatty acids in the Union.  I would like to remind you that, as early as 2011, during the negotiations on the Regulation on food information for consumers, the issue of informing consumers about the presence and levels of trans fats in foods was raised. At that time, however, we were faced with a technical obstacle: the absence of a calculation method that would allow us to determine the amounts of natural or ruminant and industrial trans fats in foods. Against that background, there was a risk of condemning foods that are an essential part of a balanced diet. On the other hand, certain Member States have indicated their preference for other measures to reduce the consumption of trans fats, namely the introduction of a legal limit for the presence of industrial trans fats in food. In that context, the legislator felt the need for a more thorough analysis which would enable us to find the most appropriate method to achieve the intended purpose, namely reducing the consumption of industrial trans fats. The Commission was therefore asked to prepare a report on the presence of trans fats in foods and in the overall diet of the Union population. In this report, the Commission concluded in December last year the need to continue and expedite work in this area by collecting more information and by developing a fuller analysis of the magnitude of the problem to be addressed and the different possible solutions, in particular the option of legal limits for industrial trans fats. Another issue raised was the effectiveness of labelling and the appropriate nutrition literacy of consumers. The Commission stated that it intended to launch a public consultation and carry out a fully-fledged impact assessment, which would allow an informed policy decision in the near future. On 7 December 2015, the Council agreed with the report’s conclusions, in particular as regards the need for further research aimed at finding a more adequate solution to attain the desired objective. Based on the results of the impact assessment it is currently conducting, it will be up to the Commission to determine which measures would be the most appropriate in order to reduce the consumption of industrial trans fats. It should, in particular, consider the opportunity to propose any necessary amendments to legal provisions in force. To answer your question, the Council will only be able to assess how best to reduce the consumption of industrial trans fats once the impact assessment has been finalised and the Commission has submitted concrete proposals to achieve the intended objective.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3549, "date": "2016-10-25.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, trans fats are a particular type of unsaturated fatty acids that are present in foods. It is undisputed that they have a negative effect on human health. Their consumption increases the risk of heart diseases more than any other nutrients. Given that heart diseases are the leading cause of death in the EU, it is no surprise that trans fats generate deep concerns not least here in the European Parliament, and I share these concerns.  Let me briefly recollect the content of the report on trans fats adopted last year by the Commission. Trans fats can be produced industrially and their primary source is partly hydrogenated oils. They can also be naturally present in foods derived from animals, in dairy or meat products for example. Industrial trans fats are present at levels of concern in certain foods, and their intake is excessive in certain Member States and for particular population groups such as low-income citizens or students.  Our report reviewed different policy options to reduce trans fats intake in the EU. A limit applied to industrial trans fats in foods emerged as the most promising solution. In that same report, however, the Commission acknowledged that further investigation was required to implement the better regulation principle. I am sure you would criticise the Commission if it proposed an initiative without looking at its impact. Similarly, honourable Members would raise concern if actions on partly hydrogenated oils pushed operators towards alternatives that are not environmentally sustainable. This is why we are carrying out an impact assessment on trans fats. Only at the end of this process will I be in a position to tell you exactly how the Commission intends to proceed. But please be reassured: the impact assessment will now finally start, and we can build on all the data already collected for last year’s report.  Earlier this month the Commission published an inception impact assessment on its Better Regulation portal and in invited feedback from stakeholders. This document is a preliminary version of the impact assessment. It contains a first analysis of the policy options under consideration. I can confirm that one of these options is indeed the establishment of a limit on industrial trans fats in food. The other options are: mandatory trans fats labelling; a ban on partly hydrogenated oils; and self-regulatory instruments.  In the coming weeks we will launch an external study on the impact of these policy options on operators, consumers and the environment. Special attention will be paid to small and medium enterprises. In addition, in the coming months, we will open a public consultation, giving the opportunity for everyone to provide their views. I am fully aware of the need for urgent action on trans fats and I am grateful to the European Parliament keeping this topic high on the agenda. I trust I can count on your cooperation and support in order to advance this file as quickly as possible.

Even where it has been reduced, consumption is still far too high in some population groups – as has already been said – for example among young people or even among people on low incomes. However, the purpose of our resolution is not to talk badly about the staple foods of milk and meat. It has been said, and this is true: milk and meat from ruminants also contain natural trans fatty acids, but of course this cannot be prevented. Consumption of these natural trans fatty acids is so low that it does not pose a health risk. No, we do not want to talk badly about these staple foods or even warn against their consumption. To be quite clear, my group has withdrawn Amendment No 1. But it is important for me to say that Ees must not be about misanely talking about the food industry either. In the resolution, we simply state that we are now aware of the negative effects of trans fatty acids and that it is time to act, and that is why we are calling for this limit value.

Madam President! Industrially produced trans fat is an incredibly dangerous substance for the heart. It's scientifically proven. Trans fat significantly increases the risk of blood clots. There is therefore no good reason to add this to food or cakes. We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have been calling for years for action to be taken against this form of trans fat, and that is why it is also a step in the right direction when the European Commission is finally considering taking action. So what needs to be done? In the Socialist Group, we propose that we should have EU legislation that significantly reduces the permitted amount of trans fat in our food. We call for consumers throughout Europe to be immediately protected from this industrially produced trans fat, and we call on the Commission to bring forward such a legislative proposal. Is that possible? Yes! I come from Denmark and for many years we have had a law that has reduced the use of industrially produced trans fats, and this has saved lives, and it has not had any negative effect on business.

Although the intake of trans fatty acids in the EU is generally quite low, we find a particularly high concentration in certain foods. A thoughtful approach is therefore permeated. Experience from Denmark, among others, as we heard earlier, shows that a binding limit value is an effective instrument. The Danish measure has a demonstrable positive effect on public health, without a negative impact on the food sector. I also think a limit value is a realistic measure. After all, it is not about zero tolerance. By allowing a minimum, natural trans fats are completely excluded.  Finally, I would like to stress that a trans fat measure must, of course, be part of an integrated approach to healthy eating and be compatible with other agreements, such as voluntary agreements.

Science has proven that trans fats are dangerous for human health, that they worsen the state of health, and unfortunately this is especially present in young people who, due to their diet, often fast food products, ingest large amounts of trans fats, which certainly later affects their health.  The science is completely clear about this, but the market is something else. Trans fats are cheap, but they are harmful. We would say that trans fats can also be delicious because they give the product firmness, but they are harmful. We, your honored commissioner, must start with the fact that trans fats are harmful. How to replace them? Palm oil is one of the possible sources of saturated acids. However, we know about the problem of palm oil and everything that happens in terms of environmental damage.

So not only did we have a year’s delay in coming forward with the legally required study into different policy options, but we have also failed to make the proposals which the Commission themselves acknowledge would be the most effective for public health. It is now well overdue that the Commission comes forward with legal mandatory limits as the best option for minimising trans fats in food, which we have seen been so successful in Denmark.  So I call on the Commissioner to listen to this motion, and indeed its own study which showed that mandatory limits were clearly the most effective measure in reducing the risk posed by trans fats to citizens, including those on lower incomes.

So here it is quite clear that the consumer must be protected here. For once, WHO and EFSA agree on this: action must be taken. That is why I do not understand why we are now letting more time pass in order to finally get an effective regulation. Nor is it enough just to get labelling, because three out of four consumers do not even know what trans fats are. Trans fats are the cheap-makers in junk food, as my colleague has just said quite rightly. We can replace them without major problems. Therefore, as I said, let me explain, dear Commission and dear Council, why you refuse to act at that point and allow even more years to pass. The United States is fooling us.

All foods that for the most part are eaten by children.

Tell us a timetable today, here, in response to this debate and tomorrow's resolution, tell us the timetable in which the Commission is already going to introduce legislation as required and as we have all demanded.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3566, "date": "2016-10-25.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to thank everyone who participated in this lively and stimulating debate. I am pleased to know that Parliament shares the Commission’s concerns, and that there is cross-party support for the European Union to act quickly to reduce intakes of industrial trans fats.  I have listened carefully to the discussions and have taken careful note of your specific views and concerns. First of all I would like to say once again the limits must be introduced only speaking about industrial trans fats, not about ruminants. Second, I think that some of you mentioned that the United States have just introduced some measures, but I would like to draw your attention once again to the fact that the Jean-Claude Juncker Commission has made a strong commitment to better regulation, which means evidence-based policy making. Today’s debate show that many aspects still need to be carefully considered before acting. Members of the European Parliament mentioned: the economic impact on small and medium enterprises; the environmental impact related to use of palm oil; the increased cost for consumers; and so on and so on. The impact assessment is aimed at taking all of these aspects into consideration.  It would be irresponsible to act before having systematically analysed all the evidence available. I fully agree with you that the quicker we act on trans fats the higher the benefit will be for European Union consumers. At the same time quick action should not come at the detriment of proportionate action.  And of course I can assure you that this will be considered in detail in the context of the impact assessment, and I agree that the quicker we act on trans fats the higher the benefits will be for European consumers. At the same time, however, I would like to say that we will do our best as we see possibilities – as you asked about the timetable – to conclude our impact assessment at the end of 2017 to help you sum up our legal proposals.

The honourable Member Mr Häusling has a point: there are obviously risks entailed by the excessive consumption of industrial trans fats in the European Union. That is true; I do not think anybody in this House, and the debate has clearly shown this, questions that. At the same time the Commission is absolutely right, we are operating within a framework, but clearly we have to assess the impact of our regulation on the internal market, on SMEs, on everything – in other words on better regulation. So the Council can only say that we are waiting for a serious impact assessment and, once you come to the conclusion that we have to regulate here, the Council is ready to act.

Their excessive consumption not only increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, but is also associated with morbid obesity, as well as type 2 diabetes. Mandatory labelling and voluntary commitments by industry alone do not provide sufficient protection for consumers. Similar conclusions have been reached in the European Commission's report published in December 2015: the most effective means of prevention may be to limit the content of industrial trans fats by law. Hungary was one of the first to act when, in 2014, denmark and Austria by regulation regulated the highest acceptable levels of trans fatty acids in foodstuffs. It is not possible to place on the market food which, in 100 grams of its total fat content, has a quantity of trans fatty acids exceeding 2 grams. The Hungarian example has since been followed by Latvia. Following the introduction of binding legislation, the proportion of foods containing trans fatty acids in quantities above the legal limit in the countries concerned has decreased significantly in a short period of time, with significant public health benefits.  It is noteworthy that the food industry is playing an increasingly important role in reducing trans fatty acids, recognising its social responsibility. Taking advantage of the consensual situation, it is therefore important that the European Commission proposes EU limits for these artificial fats as soon as possible. On this basis, I voted in favour of this resolution.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3569, "date": "2016-10-25.json", "name": "Pavel Poc (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "96715", "text": "  Writing. – I welcome the initiative of my colleagues and support the reduction of industrially produced fats containing trans fatty acids in food. Since the adoption of Regulation 1169/2011, it has been confirmed that such a restriction has a positive impact on the health of the population. Moreover, the Commission's December 2015 report assessed that this is a quick and effective way to achieve this. This is certainly good news in a situation where intake of fats containing trans fatty acids continues to be one of the main risk factors, particularly in terms of the development of coronary artery disease, but prevention needs to continue to improve. The disease is estimated to cause around 660,000 deaths a year in the EU, about 14% of the total. In the EU, 4 million people die from cardiovascular disease every year, which continues to represent almost half of all deaths. It is therefore striking that, within the framework of its mandate, the Commission has not assessed the need to put forward a legislative proposal aimed at excluding in the long term fats containing trans fatty acids from the food supply chain in the EU by introducing either a mandatory marketing of these fats or an EU legal upper limit for industrially produced trans-fatty acid fats for all foods. The immediate introduction of EU-wide legislation has long been supported by leading experts, especially associations of European cardiologists, consumer organisations, but manufacturers also agree on it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3570, "date": "2016-10-25.json", "name": "Dubravka Šuica (PPE)", "mepid": "119434", "text": "  Written. – Trans fats are found naturally in food derived from ruminant, in some plants and in human breast milk. However, most of the trans fats consumed are produced in an industrial way. Thus, the intake of trans fats is mainly associated with the consumption of industrial food products.  There are data on the health risks resulting from the consumption of trans fats and are the cause of human obesity. I believe that the European institutions should take certain measures to protect the health of European citizens, which primarily relates to better information through the education system. I also believe that a policy aimed at limiting the proportion of trans fats in foodstuffs should be implemented.  I see this resolution proposal as a step closer to more efficiently informing about the harmful consequences of consuming industrial trans fats and starting a strategy aimed at limiting their use.

In this way, low-income or 18-year-olds will no longer be at risk of exceeding the WHO's 1% threshold. Obviously, the labelling of trans fats becomes necessary in the context where medical specialists and nutritionists consider trans fats to be the most dangerous type of fat, because they increase the level of bad cholesterol (LDL) in the body and decrease the good one (HDL). However, there is also a need for a system for reading and interpreting labels of processed foods so that, knowingly, Europe's citizens can improve their diet by developing appropriate nutrition and nutrition programmes.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3572, "date": "2016-10-25.json", "name": "Marc Tarabella (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "29579", "text": "  In writing. Cardiovascular diseases, infertility, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes and obesity: these are the risks that European citizens consume excessively of trans fatty acids in their diet. The problem is that only 30% of consumers know what trans fatty acid (TRANS) is, which exposes the other two thirds of Europeans to potentially serious medical problems. That is why, by the vote this afternoon, we want clear labelling, but this is not enough: we must also limit the presence of these acids. Consumption of TFAs increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly coronary heart disease, with an estimated 660,000 deaths in Europe each year, or 14% of European mortality. Through the text voted today, we therefore support the imposition of mandatory limits on trans fatty acids produced industrially and excessively present in the diet.
