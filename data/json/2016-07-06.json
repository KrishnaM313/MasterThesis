I warmly welcome the President of the Council, Prime Minister Fico.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Robert Fico", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Let me start by saying very simply that the European Union is an amazing and unique project. It is a project that has brought peace, prosperity and security to a continent plagued by centuries of hatred and bloody wars between European nations. He was born on the wreckage of two brutal war conflicts with tens of millions of needless victims. Please, let's not forget that! No other integration attempt has ever and anywhere in the world done better. And I am very pleased that Slovakia can be a part of it. The European Union has given Slovakia a lot of positives – 12 years of membership has made our country stronger economically, socially and geopolitically. It is therefore a great honour for Slovakia that, for the first time in six months, it can make a greater contribution to the events and progress in the Union than ever before.  A debate on how to make the Union better and more effective for all of us is essential. The European Union is for the people and must be built by the people. The outcome of the British referendum confirmed this to us. The Union has decided to leave one of its key members. The departure of the British is not only an expression of their position, but probably reflects the failure of the European Union to clearly achieve and communicate its concrete contribution to citizens.  This gives us a clear signal that the European Union must better listen to critical voices. It must become more flexible, less bureaucratic and more receptive to diversity. And he must get rid of the punch of elitism and insuprehensibility for an ordinary man who often perceives her as distant and torn from his usual problems. The Slovak Presidency will not only be the first for us historically. It will also historically be the first to face the first disintegration of the European Union ever. That is also why we will approach the future organisation of the Union's relations with the United Kingdom actively and responsibly. It will inevitably become one of the dominant themes of our Presidency. We want the negotiations to be as constructive as possible and that the comfort of all those affected by the UK's departure from the EU is maintained.  The process will undoubtedly take time, but it cannot be postponed, otherwise there will be room for different disinterpretations and nervousness that will not add credibility to the European Union. Moreover, people in both the UNITED Kingdom and the European Union deserve to know exactly what the British decision to leave the Union will bring to them. Ladies and gentlemen, the path to state decisions in such a historically and culturally complex territory of Europe is not straightforward. Unfortunately, we have reached a stage where we have to overcome fear. The fear of our citizens – of migration due to the possible loss of cultural identity, of terrorism because of a weakened sense of security and of economic problems, that without work they will not be able to take care of their family with dignity. But we must also overcome our fear - of political leaders - that we will not be able to cope with the current crises. And I have the impression that our citizens are most afraid of this. That is also why their confidence in the European Union is falling.  Fear is the worst counsellor. It tends to kick-start centrifugal forces in the European Union, thus contributing to its fragmentation and fragmentation. It tends to shake up both its institutional base and our European values and ideals. Fear is also reflected in the current rise in popularity of extremist and nationalist tendencies in Europe, which offer simple and radical solutions. Although we feel that Europe has been consumed by Europeansimism, this is not quite the case. Surveys confirm that the citizens of the vast majority of Member States rate their membership of the European Union positively. This means that they still believe in the European project. It is also because the European Union is not perfect, but it makes sense and, above all, it does not have an alternative. However, it needs a new investment impetus, new jobs and, above all, new confidence. People are asking for it, as well. That is also why, within our Presidency, we want to focus on better use of financial instruments. The EU budget for 2017 must be flexible and balanced. It is essential that it reflects the Union's priorities and responds to the challenges that we are already facing or which may await us in the short term. In the framework of the mid-term review of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020, it is also necessary to create the right conditions for greater added value of investment. The completion of the Capital Markets Union or the completion of economic and monetary union and banking union can also contribute to restoring confidence in the economic strength of the Union. Ladies and gentlemen, unity and cohesion are a prerequisite for the meaningful functioning of the Union. With the immense diversity of European nations, mechanical administrative assessment of problems will never prove successful. None of the current and future crises will be solved by uncoordinated individual national measures either. No Member State is strong enough for this. We need a common European approach and a visionary approach. We cannot therefore focus only on crisis management, but must also offer our people a long-term vision of the functioning and organisation of the European Union. This has also been confirmed to us by the migration crisis. Although views on migration policy often vary from one Member State to another, there are a number of common constructive solutions that can move the agenda forward. Our Presidency will focus on them – on achieving long-term solutions.  Protecting the EU's external borders, the security and functioning of Schengen and eliminating the causes of migration remain our main priorities. During our Presidency, the European Border and Coast Guard should come into force. At the same time, we must work closely with third countries, especially transit countries and countries of origin. Moreover, the migration crisis is not a seasonal regional issue, but a generational global problem. That is also why it is desirable that the Union's joint and coordinated voice be heard very strongly and clearly at the UN summit in September. Of course, we must not only look inside the Union, we must also look out to our eyes, to the Place of the European Union in the world. The Union's global vision for the next period should be ensured by a new European global strategy for the common foreign and security policy. The European Union must work to ensure that our relations with our neighbours, as well as with distant allies, serve as a backbone for the stability and prosperity of the Union.  Within the framework of the Eastern Partnership, we must place emphasis on reforms, the implementation of association agreements and visa liberalisation. At the same time, we must work to increase the resilience of our neighbours to external threats. The unresolved Ukrainian crisis is a constant reminder of this. To the south, in turn, we must strive to contribute to a diplomatic solution to the long-term conflicts and crises in the region.  It is a Slovak experience that enlargement policy is one of the most effective tools of transformation available. Traditionally, it leads to increased security and stability not only for the Union as a whole, but also for its neighbours. Our ambition is to enhance the credibility of this process, thereby mobilising support in the Member States and candidate countries.  Furthermore, it is important to continue the tradition of protecting the stability and prosperity of the Union through the strengthening of trade relations with global partners. During our Presidency, we are interested in contributing, in cooperation with the European Commission, to successful negotiations on free trade agreements with the United States and Canada or other countries.  Ladies and gentlemen, we all agree that the European Union needs a new vision. A vision that is built on the strengths of the Union and eliminates the weaker ones. A vision shared by the people who live in the European Union. And which also takes into account the history and diversity, as well as the real possibilities and capacities of each Member State. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the European Parliament, Slovakia welcomes and thanks, at the same time, that its initiative to organise an informal summit of prime ministers and heads of state of the 27 Member States of the European Union on 16 September 2016 in Bratislava was adopted and broadly supported. The summit will be the most appropriate opportunity to discuss such a vision. The talks so far show that the summit is linked to huge expectations and will undoubtedly be the culmination of the Slovak Presidency. Although, of course, we can define the topics that leaders need to talk about, we cannot underestimate anything, and we must use the next two months to prepare the summit consistently, so that it is not just an end in itself.  I want to reassure you all that the Bratislava Summit must be organised and prepared in cooperation with the European institutions. Likewise, the Slovak Presidency would like the summit's conclusions to sufficiently balance the extreme views on the functioning of the European Union. It must be frankly acknowledged that there are views that excessive criticism of our common European policies would only give the truth to Eurosceptics and outshow opponents of the EU.  However, it would be totally counterproductive and literally harmful to our European vision if we broke up in Bratislava on 16 September 2016 saying that everything is fine, only citizens do not understand us. We know the truth is different. Such a conclusion would only fuel other referendum movements, the fragmentation of Europe with unedithed consequences. On the other hand, it is necessary to take a very cautious approach to considering the need for fundamental reforms, institutional changes and even changes to the Fundamental Treaties of the European Union.  Slovakia has always been one of the most euro-optimistic countries. Although, because of the financial and economic crisis, the migration crisis and other problems in our Union, trust in the European Union has also fallen. And that is being exploited by extremists and insicient anti-Europeans. However, trust in the European Union is still among the highest in the European Union and my government wants to strengthen it.  Today's generation of twentysomethings, thirtysomethings or fortysomethings takes peace, the common market, the free movement of goods, capital, services and especially people for granted. The fact that certain elements of the functioning of the Union are not viewed positively by the public, and now it does not matter whether deservedly or undeservedly, cannot mean that we should now resign to all the institutions, rules, policies based on the common values that these vast historical the results have made it possible. Our first common response to the wave of Euroscepticism must be to bring the sense, substance and real achievements of the European integration project closer together. We need to define quickly what is the Eurosceptic mythology, the curvature of bananas of which has become a symbol, and what are the real problems with the functioning of our Union, which are the shortcomings or failures of our uni union policies and institutions.  From this point of view, for all of us in the 27 Member States of the Union, the campaign ahead of the British referendum is a straight-line laboratory. There we can find both myths, open lies and half-truths used by the Union's opponents, but also strong arguments about the Union's advantage, and we can translate them into our specific national realities.  However, in the British campaign, we can also shed light on the real concerns and uncertainties felt by the British people who did not want to stay in the Union. We should agree to carry out analyses by the informal leaders' summit of 27 in Bratislava so that we do not deceive ourselves and know what arguments and instruments those politicians who have bet on provoking anti-European sentiment, on primitive nationalism, on the illusion that the institutions and rules of the European Union can simply be abolished and then we will continue to have a free market. , four freedoms, cooperation, solidarity, cooperation between our states and, above all, that we will be guaranteed the peace we have enjoyed for 71 years. Ladies and gentlemen, as one of your colleagues recently said in his essay, europe's cement is its history. This determines our sense of belonging to one family and a sense of European identity. It was this feeling that was the driving force behind Slovakia's many years of integration efforts. We wanted our common values, such as human dignity, security, prosperity, freedom, peace, democracy, to become a reality for us in Slovakia. And we owe that to the Union, too. But we can't just live in the past because we're changing and the world around us is changing.  Take, for example, the single market. The four freedoms of movement for goods, persons, services and capital are among the European Union's greatest achievements. However, in order to reach its potential, the Single Market must reflect the reality of the world in which we live. That is also why, if we want to keep up with the accelerating digitisation of life, we need a digital single market. This trend in the use of digital platforms and e-commerce services presents new opportunities, but let us also – let us admit – new risks. It is our task to ensure the free movement of European Union citizens in the digital space and the free enjoying of its benefits without fearing users for their data. If we want to go with the times, our aim is to ensure an affordable supply of sustainable clean energy. For this, we need an Energy Union. It is at the heart of diversifying sources, suppliers and transit routes. However, we do not just need an Energy Union. Overall, we need to bring new energy to the European Union. In our opinion, the European Union of the 21st century is demanding fresh winds. It needs openness, sincerity and simplicity, and of course a follow-up responsibility in actions and ideas. That is why, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the European Parliament, our Slovak Presidency wants to open up a profound reflection on what the new one wants and must offer the European Union to the European public. And we have to be creative. Both in identifying problems and in designing solutions. But we also need to be realistic and pragmatic. We therefore want to focus primarily on a positive and beneficial agenda. And traditional, but also new, attractive topics. It is essential to focus on what unites us, that is, on the topics on which we agree, and we can send a positive impetus to the public. We will make every effort over six months to prevent fragmentation in the Union. We will therefore propose solutions that are acceptable to the Member States as well as to the European Union as a whole. During our Presidency, a citizen of the European Union will be at the heart of our agenda. We want to deliver tangible results with a concrete impact on his daily life. Only in this way can we regain people's trust and combat growing populism, separatism and nationalism. But we have to, and this is a huge challenge for us, to simplify the way we communicate with people. The European Union is unique. Its benefits and the benefits of its membership are indisputable. I am all the more sorry that we often cannot explain to our citizens what the excellence of the European project is. That we cannot explain that a stronger Europe is not in the interests of Brussels, but that it is in the interests of all of us. And perhaps it will not harm every single time the mere question of where an EU citizen is in our activities and considerations, and, above all, what concretely and positively this will bring to him. I think it's time to end initiatives that ordinary people often twist their heads over. Either because they don't understand their language, or because they don't see their meaning and contribution to themselves or their families. After all, how are they supposed to understand this, when, let us confess, we ourselves find it difficult to navigate the European agenda and the shame.  Let us therefore put insidible terms and heavy bureaucratic language with sincerity spontaneity. And empty and often useless ideas with specificity and benefit. We will do so, ladies and gentlemen, during our Presidency. Please support us and join us in building our Union together on new foundations. Even better for the peoples of Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Frans Timmermans", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Erster Vizepräsident der Kommission. – Herr Präsident, sehr geehrte Mitglieder des Parlaments, meine Damen und Herren! Die slowakische Ratspräsidentschaft wird eine sehr wichtige – so viel können wir schon vorab festhalten –, und zwar nicht nur für die Slowakei, weil sie zum ersten Mal die EU-Ratspräsidentschaft übernimmt, sondern auch, weil wir in den kommenden Monaten entscheidende Weichen für die Zukunft Europas stellen werden. Das wird zwar oft gesagt, aber diesmal stimmt es mehr denn je. Schließlich sind wir dabei, große Herausforderungen wie die Flüchtlingskrise zu meistern, und jetzt haben wir darüber hinaus noch eine Scheidung zu bewältigen. Doch ich weiß, dass die Slowakei bestens vorbereitet ist. Das Land hat seit seiner Unabhängigkeit Bemerkenswertes geleistet und ist auch jetzt auf Kurs. Ich habe deshalb auch größtes Vertrauen in diese EU-Ratspräsidentschaft. Ministerpräsident Fico hat uns versprochen, ein Vollzeiteuropäer zu sein und Verantwortung dafür zu übernehmen, unterschiedliche nationale Standpunkte zu einer gemeinsamen europäischen Linie zusammenzuführen. Genau darauf setze ich jetzt. Ich freue mich, dass die Prioritäten der slowakischen Regierung die der Juncker-Kommission genau widerspiegeln. Wir müssen eine positive Agenda setzen und uns jetzt erst recht auf das konzentrieren, was die Menschen von uns erwarten. Sie wollen spüren, dass Europa ihnen etwas bringt und ihre Zukunft verbessert. Europa ist mehr als bloß ein großer Markt, es ist eine soziale Marktwirtschaft, die allen zum Vorteil gereicht. Damit die Menschen das wieder spüren, müssen wir vor allem Arbeitsplätze und Wachstum schaffen und dort Lösungen anbieten, die über nationale Maßnahmen hinausgehen. Herzstück dafür ist die Investmentoffensive, deren erste Früchte wir jetzt ernten können. Denn in bereits in den ersten zwölf Monaten hat diese 107 Mrd. EUR an neuen Investitionen mobilisiert. 148 000 kleine und mittlere Unternehmen werden von einem besseren Zugang zu Finanzierung profitieren. Das heißt, die Investmentoffensive leistet genau das, was sie soll. Sie kurbelt Investitionen, Ideen und Innovationen an und schafft so Arbeitsplätze und Perspektiven. Im September, während der slowakischen Präsidentschaft, wird die Kommission deshalb vorschlagen, die Investmentoffensive auch über 2018 hinaus zu verstärken und zu verlängern. Si les citoyens attendent de l'Union qu'elle leur apporte des solutions pour une perspective économique durable, il en va de même en ce qui concerne la gestion des flux migratoires. Je me félicite qu'en à peine six mois, nous soyons parvenus à un accord sur la création d'un Corps européen de garde-frontières et de garde-côtes, qui pourra devenir opérationnel d'ici quelques semaines. C'est une avancée très importante dans la reprise en main d'une gestion solidaire, et donc vraiment européenne du contrôle de nos frontières extérieures. Mais aussi important cela soit-il, cela ne suffit pas. Une frontière ayant par définition deux côtés, il faut donc aussi travailler avec ceux qui se trouvent au-delà de nos frontières communes pour, ensemble, mieux lutter contre l'immigration irrégulière et sauver des vies humaines. C'est ce que nous avons commencé à faire avec la Turquie et, même si, par certains aspects, l'accord entre l'Union européenne et la Turquie reste fragile et souvent critiqué – il faut bien le dire –, les premiers résultats sont là. Les arrivées sont en baisse et moins de migrants risquent leur vie aux mains de passeurs sans scrupules. Cela devrait encourager toutes les parties prenantes à redoubler d'efforts et à tenir tous leurs engagements, y compris en ce qui concerne la relocalisation et la réinstallation. En Italie, l'amélioration des conditions météorologiques a, comme prévu, entraîné une augmentation du nombre d'arrivées. Je compte donc sur tous les États membres pour respecter les obligations qui leur incombent en vertu des décisions du Conseil sur la relocalisation en ce qui concerne la Grèce et l'Italie, tout comme je compte sur la présidence slovaque pour faire progresser tous les autres aspects de notre programme européen en matière de migration. La réforme de notre système commun d'asile est notre première priorité. Je suis bien placé pour savoir que ce n'est pas simple et qu'il faut souvent déployer beaucoup de temps et d'énergie pour concilier des réalités nationales différentes, voire très souvent diamétralement opposées. Mais il n'y a qu’une réponse possible à la question de la migration, et c'est une réponse européenne faite d'un ensemble de mesures indissociables les unes des autres et qui demandent chacune le même engagement de tous. Cela ne peut pas se faire à la carte, sinon cela ne fonctionnera jamais. I said that our Investment Plan for Europe is at the heart of our strategy for jobs and growth, but there is more to it. New investment will only have its full impact if we create the best conditions for business, starting with the world’s biggest single market. This is an integral part of the logic of our investment plan.  The Slovak Presidency has the opportunity to drive forward some of our most urgent proposals, starting with the digital single market. Over the next six months, you can deliver real benefits to consumers and businesses across Europe, real concrete results, exactly what Prime Minister Fico was asking for: our first copyright proposals, which will allow people to access their digital content whenever they travel; our proposals to stop geo-blocking so that people can buy from websites located elsewhere, in other Member States; our new proposals on media services, which support our creators and promote our cultural diversity, and our proposals on parcel delivery, which will bring down costs. On all of these proposals, but also in our capital markets union and our single market for services, you can make great progress.  The next priority is to complete our Banking Union, starting with the European deposit insurance scheme. I know that politically that is complicated, but it is the crucial last piece of our Banking Union and we need to have it in place. On energy, you will continue the vital work that turns the historic Paris Agreement into action. In the next six months we really need to make progress on energy efficiency, renewables and the security of gas supplies. Slovakia understands these questions better than most and the European Union will benefit from your experience.  Finally on trade, let me say one word about our agreement with Canada. This is a deal that offers huge potential for growth and jobs for European businesses and citizens. It also marks a step change in how investor disputes are settled, making sure that such disputes will in the future be settled by fully qualified judges in full transparency.  Yesterday, the Commission decided to propose CETA for signature as a mixed agreement to allow for its swift application, so those benefits can be reaped more quickly. I would like to stress that this proposal is without prejudice to our view on competences. As you know, the majority of Member States do not share the Commission’s view in this respect. That question is before the Court, and once the Court issues its opinion in that case it will be necessary to draw the appropriate conclusions. Dear friends, let me end on perhaps a more personal note. I had the privilege in the middle of the 1990s to work for my political father Max van der Stoel, who was at the time High Commissioner on National Minorities for the OSCE, and we did a lot of work in Slovakia. The situation in Slovakia was very tense. Even people who are now in government – from the Hungarian minority – we needed to meet them in secret outside of Slovakia, so tense was the situation at the time. There was a huge confrontation within the country, but also with one of its most important neighbours. Tensions were very high and this led to a slowing down of Slovakia’s accession process to the European Union.  Now look at the country! Sometimes it is worth taking a step back and thinking about history, even this recent history. Now look at the country. Now look at the composition of the government, parties in one government that could not even talk to each other, could not stand each other, what am I talking about, 20 years ago. So if anybody challenges the concept that European integration can bring conflicts to a close, can bring people together, let them have a look at Slovakia. Let them have a look at Hungary; let them have a look at the relationship between these two countries now. Let them have a look at the position of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia today. Progress is possible, and Europe can contribute to solving age-old conflicts and tensions on our continent, and Slovakia is a living proof of that.  We lost one of our greatest Europeans in the last week, Elie Wiesel, who spoke this wonderful lingua franca that was spoken – that was his mother tongue – that was spoken in my country, in Slovakia, in Germany, and in many of our countries, which was Yiddish, which is no longer a lingua franca due to the horrors of history. Elie Wiesel said: ‘The opposite of love is not hatred. The opposite of love is indifference’. And what our European Union cannot use today is indifference and we need to make sure that the millions and millions of Europeans who today are rather indifferent towards this project understand once more its historic importance and rekindle their love for this project that has brought so much and still has so many promises to fulfil.

I can follow directly on Frans Timmermann's final appeal. Slovakia, which is now taking over the Presidency of the Council, is a model of Success for Europe. For the first time in history, Slovakia is now taking over the Presidency of the Council of the EU, and it is a normal relay transfer between East and West, between West and East. Europe has grown together, and it is worth remembering that this integration was only possible because we opposed the populists. If, 15, 20 years ago, the populists on the right, the nationalists who are also sitting with you in Parliament today, had been asked: 'Do you want us to grow together, do you want Europe to go on?' then many of these populists would have said no at the time. Nevertheless, the decision was taken against the populists, and today enlargement to the east, the reunification of our continent, is a great success. I agree with the Slovak President, Andrej Kiska: Slovakia must also highlight Europe's successes in the development of its own country in the coming months – as he put it. THE EU has invested EUR 11 billion in Slovakia, new investments are coming to the EU country, and many young Slovaks can now study and train not only at home, but throughout Europe. That is the right spirit, the right spirit for this Slovak Presidency. Prime Minister, you have made a commitment today against populism, and I am grateful for that. However, allow me to ask you that we all take responsibility for this fight against populism, not only here in the European Parliament, that is, not only when the speeches are coming up in Europe, but that we should continue to fight this fight against populism even when we are at home and talking to the people. Unfortunately, I have to say that, unfortunately, populism has been fuelled in Slovakia in recent election campaigns. My group is in favour of strong border controls. We want European borders to be secured. We want illegal migration to be combated. We want to fight the mafia, to dismantle the smuggling industry. We want to crack down on this and implement law and order at the external borders. But, Prime Minister, my group also wants to help people in need. And to set a tone to make people, the citizens, afraid of possible alienation, just because we want to help strangers and people in need, that is unfortunately God's wrong tone that has been struck there. That is why I ask that the fight against populism be practised in all speeches. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes the Presidency's programme. Economic growth is at the heart of competitiveness, the digital single market, the Energy Union and the great issue of the Security Union of our European continent. We stand by your side in tackling and implementing these points now. And we will then regain the confidence of the citizens of Europe if we deliver on the matter now. That is why you are very lucky in your Presidency, and you have the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats at your side on this matter.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Gianni Pittella", "mepid": "4436", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Prime Minister, your country has the difficult task of chairing meetings at a decisive time for the future of Europe. You said some important words today when you spoke about the core of the European project. And he added, \"We are proud to be part of this story.\" We are delighted, Mr Fico, and we tell you that the best way to be a part of this story is to defend, tooth and nail, the values that European history expresses.  You said that we must overcome our fears, not delude ourselves that the Member States alone can do everything and solve all the problems. Holy words. We therefore expect this Presidency to take strong, concrete and unified initiatives, because this is not the time to divide Europe between North and South, between East and West. It takes speed and if the UK wants to leave the EU, it must notify it as soon as possible. These go away as the ship sinks – Johnson, Farage, Cameron let the ship sink. It's better for us not to deal with these characters.  As far as we are concerned, change must begin immediately. On social issues, we want the revision of the Posting of Workers Directive to be re-presented, we want the social pillar, we want to put an end once and for all to the austerity season: we no longer want to hear the word sanctions, punishments, gendarmerie, bureaucratism. People want good things, not bad things. And we call for a strong initiative by your Presidency against tax evasion and avoidance. Vice-President Timmermans has highlighted a number of important points, which we support and which we also entrust to the action of the Slovak Presidency.  On immigration, you referred to security and the root of the ills that cause migratory flows. All right! One word is missing, Prime Minister: welcome. Welcoming and re-location in European countries of those fleeing war and terrorism. Say that word. He will be better off with himself, with the values he said he wanted to defend.  In conclusion, yours, Mr Fitto, was a balancing speech, which we appreciate.

Things have been said in the heat of the moment, strong feelings have been expressed on all sides, and emotions have been running high. All this has been understandable. As you know, I supported Britain’s membership of the European Union and I had hoped for a different result. But we have a clear decision, and it is a decision that must be respected. We now need to move on.  Prime Minister, the Slovak Presidency of the Council comes at a critical time. Your government has a crucial role to play in re-setting the terms of the debate and looking forwards, not back. As we consider the future, we should bear in mind the words of Her Majesty the Queen, speaking just a few days ago. She said this: ‘One hallmark of leadership in such a fast-moving world is allowing sufficient room for quiet thinking and contemplation, which can in turn enable deeper, cooler consideration of how challenges and opportunities can best be addressed’. As we look ahead, we need that deeper, cooler consideration in our reflections on the future of the European Union and its relationship with the United Kingdom.  We need to reflect on the meaning of the referendum and how it expresses not just the concerns of the British people, but concerns felt by millions across the continent. Many want an effective European Union, but they want a limited European Union. That is the kind of reform that my Group will continue to champion. Discussions will shortly begin on the United Kingdom’s departure from the Union. We should be conscious that we are not simply discussing a technocratic withdrawal agreement; we are laying the foundations of a new relationship between the UK and the EU.  In the United Kingdom, we must maintain our best traditions of internationalism. The country I know and love is tolerant and welcoming, and this must not change. I deplore the racist and xenophobic actions of a small minority that we have recently witnessed. While Britain has chosen to leave the European Union, it has not voted to leave behind its traditional values of decency and of respect for all those who live amongst us and who make such a positive contribution to our country. In so many areas, we share mutual interests such as developing a thriving global economy, fighting terrorism and promoting a cleaner environment. So whilst the discussions will be detailed and complex, let us all approach them in a positive and constructive spirit. Let us build a renewed partnership between the United Kingdom and the European Union based on our shared values, our history of cooperation and our long-standing friendships.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Pavel Telička", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the Prime Minister on his first Presidency and wish him the very best. Prime Minister, I am sure you can do very well. I hope you will do better than the Czechs in 2009. Seven years on, you can do better than we have done. So I wholeheartedly support the Slovak Presidency. For quite a few years in this Chamber we have heard from different Prime Ministers and Presidents that we are at a crossroads and that we are in a dramatic and complicated situation. We have heard some strong words. We have heard that we need reforms. You have deviated to some extent from that and I do appreciate it, for one thing because we are no longer at the crossroads. We have left the crossroads and we have come to a political dead end. We need to break that dead end, and that is something we should recognise. Slovakia, for me, is a success story as a member of the European Union. In the past 12 years, you have managed to steer the country from being an average country, averagely developed, to a real success story and much more than that. This is something that we need to recognise and applaud. I was going to ask you to remind us, on the basis of that story, about what the founding values and reasons for the European Communities were. You have done that and I do appreciate it. Let us have the courage to remind ourselves, and to remind our nations and our people, what the story really is: what is history, what is the future and, of course, what the bottlenecks and problems are that we face. You managed to steer your country from an average situation to success. I know that a few days ago you said you feared high expectations – well, I will not reassure you on that point, as we do have high expectations. We have expectations that you will manage to steer the European Union out of crisis. That is something that needs to be done, not because of us, the MEPs, not because of our vague dreams, but because of the citizens who are tired of the European Union as it stands today. We have heard numerous comments from the Council in recent days, blaming and shaming, and I think that is precisely the worst message that we can send. I am glad we will not continue on that path because the European institutions as such – jointly, as you have said – have to tackle the challenges which are in front of us. We have a choice about the European Union of tomorrow. It can either be a European Union with all the success – and I do agree with you that it is a marvellous and unique project – but also, with all the deficiencies that we have, incapable of delivering, or we can deliver on issues like the crises, the real bottlenecks, the issues that concern citizens. Those issues are the migration crisis, the internal market, which you have spoken about, etcetera. I think this is the European Union that we want. This is the choice that we should make. I will make two final remarks. We speak of reforms. We met many years ago for the first time, in my office, and I knew that you were a person who could deliver. Here are two ideas. One is: why not open the deliberations of the European Council to the public? Sometimes even Prime Ministers do not know what was agreed the day before. Make it transparent. Provide for confidence. The second idea is: why not have a programme of revision of the secondary acquis? Do away with all the issues that we should not be focusing on, and let us take on the big issues, the ones where there is added European value. You have our support and we hope that we will jointly succeed.

We are now used to crises and know quite well that it is up to all the actors at European level to make progress. You are in the role of honest broker, and I believe that your Presidency of the Council will really be very important on one issue, namely whether the gap between the Visegrid states and the other states of the European Union is deepening or whether there are bridges over this gap that has opened up in recent years. I remember the 1990s and the enthusiasm with which south-eastern Europe pushed Central Europe into the European Union and with which they were met. If, for example, you look at Ukraine today – we also talked about this in the small round yesterday – you know very well what you have achieved for your countries, what we have achieved together and what other countries in the east of this continent are being denied in a really hard way. I believe that today, as in the 1990s, we know better that we in the European Union can meet the global challenges – be it new aggression, war, the risks and incalculability of the globalised economy, be it climate change or 50 million people fleeing globally – much better together. However, we can only achieve this together if we actually respect the values and also the rule of law, which are the foundations of the European democratic system. I was not always sure whether this was really going in this direction for you, for example, and whether there were no problems in the countries of Eastern Europe, which we are not sufficiently concerned about. Everyone has said here that Slovakia is a wonderfully functioning country on a success story. Until recently, we have always said this about Poland, but it is social upheavals that are taking these countries in a political direction that seems incompatible with European ideas in some areas. I said this yesterday: I would really like to know what the problems of transformation are. Why are the economic indicators good for Slovakia, but the dissatisfaction with the European Union so great? There is something wrong with that. What I really find very bad is that social dissatisfaction is always projected only onto the European Union and if this is also directed against a good and solidarity-based refugee policy in slovakia's policy.

You said that the European Union should take into account people's concerns about migration, the effects of migration on national identity, on the security of citizens. And your government had the courage to vote against quotas for the redistribution of migrants, and even had the courage to challenge the European Union's decision before the European Court of Justice. And I very much hope that, even as President of the European Council, you will oppose what is dangerously close, namely a permanent mechanism for redistributing people across Europe.  You also said that you would moderate the break-up of the European Union with Britain to everyone's satisfaction. This will probably be difficult, because many people here are driven by irrational hatred and will not be satisfied until Britain is somehow smothered in the country. But I believe in your rational approach and I would like to remind you here of the 24-year-old experience of the break-up, the divorce of Czechoslovakia. I think it's a very similar situation. Great Britain decided to leave the European Union, similarly, 24 years ago Slovakia decided to leave Czechoslovakia. And that's when everyone kept their sanity.

Mr President, Prime Minister, a week before you take up your duties as President of the Council of the European Union, the British people have made the choice to get out of this straitjacket. The nation that saw the birth of George Orwell thus gave a great lesson in democracy to the Eurocrats who, imbued with themselves, did not even imagine that they could be told no. You who have lived through the Velvet Revolution, I have no doubt that you will be keen to help make this exit in the best conditions. The point I referred to Orwell is that in many respects the European Union is increasingly akin to the dictatorship described in 1984. Thus, in the new language of brussels technocrats, we speak of \"decarbonisation\" to refer to the killing of our industries, \"good governance\" for the placing under the tutelage of our states or \"migrants\" to refer to illegal immigrants who flock en masse to our old continent. Judging by your statements in recent months, it seems that you have become well aware that the migration policy, imposed by the European Commission and by Mrs Merkel, is leading us right into the wall. You have gone so far as to call this calamitous handling of the migration crisis a ritual suicide. Together with your Hungarian, Polish and Czech counterparts in the Visegrad Group, you seem determined to reject this crazy policy of distributing migrants. If your peoples have suffered behind the Berlin Wall, they have understood the vital need to maintain true borders. However, yesterday, three of your party's four MEPs voted here in favour of a resolution which welcomes the mobility of refugees and requires Member States to compete with our fellow citizens in the labour market. But it was also yesterday that we learned of the date of the Hungarian referendum on the policy of migrant quotas. It will be held on 2 October, two weeks before the commemorations of the 60th anniversary of the Budapest uprising against the communist dictatorship, but also on the eve of the new presidential election in Austria. Let us bet that the Hungarians and Austrians will once again shake the bureaucrats in Brussels, because the peoples of Europe are tired of this superstructure which goes against their vital, economic, security and identity interests.

They ask us to build a Europe that protects its borders, a Europe that defends its values and its shared cultural identity. As such, your priority is to demonstrate the concrete effects of European projects - that is very good - and to put citizens back at the centre, highlighting the social dimension. But there can be no redistribution if there is no growth, and there will be no growth without a competitive industry. So we need an ambitious industrial policy.

Nevertheless, we told our British friends in our resolution: 'We really need your position as soon as possible, but we understand if you still need a little time'. Brexit rejoices populists, extremists across Europe and calls for referendums in their own countries. Therefore, Prime Minister, in addition to addressing the challenges and priorities of the Slovak Presidency, we need the Commission to analyse the problems that led to why the British decided to leave, why there are more and more people in Britain and across Europe disappointed with the results of integration, why a significant proportion of the population of the European Union rejects the project of a united Europe. We need to start explaining better to people the meaning and benefits of a common Europe as a zone where there is peace, which has an internal market, the comfort offered by the common currency and open common borders. Let us show them that the European Union is not only Strasbourg or Brussels with its institutions, but it is 28 governments, 28 parliaments, it is municipalities, cities, regions, institutions, organisations in each country that have something to say and whose arguments have weight.

This does not mean that we are without challenges, but we see many challenges ahead of us. On the other hand, we have been able to create a rich situation.  When Slovakia became a member of the European Union, there was a discussion in Sweden about whether or not we should have transitional rules for Slovak citizens moving towards Sweden. My party and I stood on the barricades to ensure that all EU members are treated in one and the same way and we won that fight. We can also see today in all the statistics, all the economy, that the fear that others had that we would get what was called social tourism did not become a truth. The Slovak citizens who have come to Sweden during this time have made a strong contribution to our country's economy, and we thank you for that. This openness is also important to take with you in the work that you have in the future.  Also, be careful about the things you choose to highlight politically.

Only by working with the countries of the region can Europe successfully respond to the serious challenges that threaten the political, economic and social stability of the whole continent. I welcome the fact that the priorities announced by the Slovak President include a sustainable migration and refugee policy, which is intended to steer the EU's misguided policy in this area in the right direction. The problems caused by the influx of millions of people are almost insurmountable for the countries of the Union, whether it is to catch up and control the growing influx, to distribute and supply immigrants, to achieve huge financial integration, to conflict between Muslim and European cultures, or even to stop the entreated violence or terrorism.  The Slovak EU Presidency has cut its head in a big tree. Slovakia's migration policy so far, and cooperation with the Visegrad Four in this regard, give us the hope that together and in cooperation with neighbouring western Balkan countries, they will be able to balance the policy of unilateral and helpless inclusion between Brussels and the Western states and prepare for a radical turnaround towards resolving the migration crisis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 36, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Patrizia Toia (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "28340", "text": "   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Fico, I appreciate the awareness you have shown in taking over the Presidency of the European Union at such a serious time, and that makes us confident. You talk about relaunching the European project: it seems to us, listening to you and reading the things you write, that this vision of Europe is too limited to the usefulness, the concreteness and the economic aspects of the European project. I say and I think that utility, concreteness and economy are the fruit, the result of the European project, not the substance, not the real strength and root. They are the result for all citizens when Europe is strong, and it is strong because it is united and it is united because it is united. Because if this project were to be reduced only to economic benefits, we would be together when the funds were redistributed, but we would be healthiing ourselves and turn our backs on ourselves when we have to share a sacrifice, a difficulty, a crisis. So I say that this solidarity must be rediscovered and you represent 27 countries here in their unity, certainly not 27 states seeking an identity, which is not denied but put together in the European Union. There are not only national interests here; there is a common interest to be built, where national interests are realised.  And one final point: the citizens. I welcome the fact that you put the citizens of the project at the centre and that you say that the citizens must feel that Europe is close. But the Italian or Greek citizens, who have welcomed hundreds of thousands of migrants and see Europe turning their backs on them, including your country, what can they think of this project?

Our continent must return to respect for God and the principles of Jewish philosophy. God is the creator and the supreme principle of everything and a source of blessing for Europe, man himself is not the highest value we can bow to.

And Adenauer said, \"The power that is being abused is devastating, but power accompanied by responsibility is a gift from God.\" The heads of the Union, including our most senior political leaders, are their very successors today, but respect for God is not realistic to hear from you.

The first is that of respect for the UNITED KINGDOM for some time to organise its position, the second is to, of course, have the best possible agreement but with respect to the rules - if they want to have access to the single market they have to have freedom of movement - and the third is not to get involved in the constitutional issue of the United Kingdom, i.e. , the problem of Scotland and Northern Ireland. It is the United Kingdom that has to resolve, it is not the European Union and I believe that Slovakia has many lessons to be learned about this because of the separation process between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which has gone perfectly because no one has interfered. The second very important point is the point of strengthening the euro zone and here I think it was essential to accelerate the banking union which is an essential point, namely the third pillar which is the pillar of the deposit guarantee system, which I would like to see here further strengthened.  And the last point, which is fundamental to me, is the question of refugees and migration, and then, frankly, I must say that I do not quite satisfy the programme of the Slovak Presidency, because I think that only with a system of real distribution of the effort to receive refugees in Europe will we be able to have a humanitarian response in the light of the values that are European values.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 39, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Pavel Poc (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "96715", "text": "   – Mr President, I will not be so political.

When some of my colleagues who are MEMBERS of the European Parliament today were unwilling to show solidarity with the important measures that the EU needed. We were a governing party and we met all the difficult criteria to become the first state of the Visegrad Group to become a member of the European Monetary Union, and there were difficult measures that the government then had to put in place and which it had to explain to its citizens.

You know, Mr Fico, that 66,400 refugees have been relocating from Greece since September. Refugees who remain there, because relocation is progressing slowly, since so far only 1,503 relocations have taken place.

As rapporteur for this Parliament's recent report on biodiversity, I would like to give you one concrete suggestion: do your ud ute to preserve the nature directives and resolutely support better implementation.

At least 15 Member States subscribe to this story and the more than 500 000 citizens who took part in the Nature Alert campaign expect nothing less from the European Union than that the existing nature rules are properly implemented.

And I therefore ask you to be deseded from those statements which have made many in Europe think that there is a rotating presidency of the European Union with a Prime Minister who thinks that it is not Slovak enough if another religion is professed, it is not European enough if another identity is professed.

In a short period of time, Slovakia built democracy, got back on its feet, joined the European Union, joined Schengen, and was the first central European country to introduce the euro. All of us who have lived through these milestones together know how difficult, turbulent this development has been, but how it has benefited Slovakia and the European Union. On 1 July, Slovakia and the European Union launched a new important stage. Slovakia is taking the presidency of the Council of the EU at a historic moment when Britain has decided to leave the Union and when many leaders and citizens are calling for self-reflection. It will therefore be necessary to manage the proper agenda and this historic challenge at the same time. Prime Minister, in the priorities you have set, the Slovak Presidency will have the full support of the European Commission. Together, we will build an economically strong Europe, modernise the single market and make better use of the potential offered by this largest economic area. I trust that, under the Slovak Presidency, we will move forward with key proposals in the area of the Energy Union and the Digital Single Market and continue to use the Juncker Investment Fund to build modern infrastructure and increase energy efficiency. Boosting investment will lead to faster economic growth, job creation and creating new opportunities for the young and unemployed. The Slovak Presidency stressed that it will engage constructively on sustainable migration and asylum policy issues and create space to find the best solutions. In this context, the European Union's policy towards third countries will also need to be used, and therefore the role of a globally engaged Europe will certainly increase. In addition to these priorities, however, it will perhaps be even more important how the Slovak Presidency will debate two important issues: How the European Union's future relationship with Great Britain will be shaped, where we must find a fair approach, and how we will operate in the format of the 27 Member States. Jean-Claude Juncker responded to citizens' reservations about the European Union, which were already voiced in the election campaign to the European Parliament, by preparing, as the Commission, a concrete concise programme consisting of ten priorities that citizens understand and support. In order to combat bureaucracy, we have abolished hundreds of proposals or unnecessary measures. However, we are ready for further discussion on how to make the EU better, more popular and more supported by our citizens. As you said, the Union is there for the people and it is there for our citizens. The European Commission welcomes, Prime Minister, your readiness for close cooperation between the institutions in the preparation of the historic Bratislava Summit. We also appreciate the timing of the summit, which will take place the day after the speech by The President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, in this plenary and will address the state of the European Union report. I believe that the message of this speech and the ideas of members that will be heard in the next debate will be a positive contribution to the leaders' debate in Bratislava. I believe that one of the conclusions should be to explain our actions more clearly, to bring the concrete benefits of the measures we are taking for our citizens closer, as well as to express the common will of European leaders to celebrate European achievements, but also to take responsibility for complex and not always popular measures, which we sometimes have to take and which we must better explain to citizens. I believe that by common positions, through joint European efforts, we will increase confidence in the European project and the attractiveness of European cooperation. I believe that this will be the best response to extremists, populists, radicals who wish Europe nothing good. Finally, Prime Minister, allow me to wish you and your team, as Commissioner and as a Slovak, every success and a successful Presidency, which the European Union badly needs at this time.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 60, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Robert Fico", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – I will say something at the outset that I do not know if any Prime Minister has ever said. I want to admit that over the years in Slovak politics, but also over the years at the head of the Slovak Government, I have paid very little attention to your work. And I find that I do not know much about the European Parliament. If I had known, I might have a better understanding of the diversity and wealth of ideas that appear in this plenary. I would also like you to have more information about the individual Member States. That is why I want to offer cooperation. Also within the Slovak Presidency, ensure significantly more contacts in order to avoid sometimes misunderstandings, but above all to understand each other better. In any case, I would like to thank you for your interest in presenting the priorities of the Slovak Presidency, I would like to thank you for your inspiring contributions as well as for the interesting questions you have raised. I confirm, Mr President of the European Parliament, the interest of the Slovak Presidency in cooperating with the institutions. It is not possible to bypass the European Parliament, it is not possible to bypass the European Commission. That is what I am saying to the representatives of the European Commission. And let the Bratislava Summit be the first such test of our determination to have this cooperation at the highest possible level. Ladies and gentlemen, it is not possible to answer all your questions and contributions. However, let me draw some summarised conclusions. First of all, I would like to reassure all colleagues in this Chamber who are advocing the need for strong social and economic themes that I am among the politicians who have always warned of the dangers of a policy that is based solely on austerity. I think that Slovakia is a good example of how, on the one hand, public finances can be brought under control – we have a safe deficit below 3%, we have very low public debt of around 52%, and at the same time we have been able to do very interesting investment activities. Of course, with significant support for European funds, and I will not lie if I remind you here that 86% of all public investment in Slovakia comes from European funds. This, as well, is of great importance to the Member States that arrived after 2004. I would also like to reassure all those who talk about the relationship between the European Union and Great Britain that we may have more understanding of this process than anyone else. The division of Czechoslovakia was mentioned several times, in which there was a great understanding for the needs of people in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia. If this understanding had not been, it would have been difficult today to see the success story of two countries that work together and which perhaps have even better relations with each other, as was the case until 1992, when we ended our civil life together. Ladies and gentlemen, I would very much like us to use this experience – unique – to manage complicated processes and, above all, to think of people in their 27s and people in the UK. So that this sovereign decision by Great Britain, which we respect, does not to the detriment of the citizens of both of these groupings. However, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to remind you that we have shown a great deal of patience – I am now talking about the Member States that came to the European Union in 2004. After all, you must be aware that it was Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania and others in particular who had to make some concessions when the agreement between The United Kingdom and the European Union was established. Because we cared about Britain staying in the European Union. Those concessions concerned our people who work in the UK, and these were made by other Member States. Therefore, if we have shown patience and understanding for the processes then, I hope that you trust us to show the same level of patience and understanding in the period ahead in the coming weeks and months. As regards the revision or inventory of the European Union, I would like to use the term inventory. And I would like to thank you for supporting the idea of the Bratislava Summit. Above all, we really need to start explaining to the European public what the values of the European Union are, in which we see enormous privileges and benefits. I often use an example, I'm sorry, I repeat that example because I care about him, without delaying time. Ladies and gentlemen, from my personal life in 1988, I wanted to go on my honeymoon. And I wanted to go outside the bloc of former socialist countries. Whether you believe it or not, I had to wait all night in front of a specialist shop to buy a trip to a country that is very nice to me and my heart, Malta. I've had a whole host of permits, requests, approvals and promises. I've witnessed complicated border controls. Therefore, believe me, it was very emotional for me to saw the bolt on the Austrian-Slovak border with austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer. And I know what the meaning and value of Schengen is. But today a 20-year-old man who sits in his car and travels all over Slovakia, Austria, goes on to Germany without any hesitation, continues to any country? He takes it as natural, self-evident, and he doesn't see it as any value at all. We are not even able to sell these EU valuables that we currently have. This, too, should be one of the tasks of the Bratislava Summit – to set up new communication, including, of course, to face challenges such as security, the fight against terrorism, but above all strong social and economic themes. I would also like to assure my colleague from the Czech Republic – Mr Telička – that I have major problems with some of the working methods of the European Council. You are perhaps going into a very radical position that let us, for example, publish the proceedings of the European Council. I would like to begin by changing at least some working methods that have nothing to do with collegiality and the collective search for a way out of this important European body. And let me touch on the V4 issue, because it has been mentioned several times. Ladies and gentlemen, please respect that the V4 is a unique regional cooperation. It's not a federal state. They are four separate sovereign countries that have undergone unique transformational experiences. After all, we have gone through a process since 2089 that has lasted perhaps hundreds of years in other countries. And that brought us closer. We share the same view on many things. We have the same language. But please believe me, I have been part of the V4 negotiations many times. The V4 has never adopted any anti-European or anti-European attitudes. Maybe she was using a different language. We care about this regional cooperation, but we also care that the V4 is always seen as an institution that understands European issues and which promotes the values on which the European Union stands. At the very end of migration, because this topic has been opened several times. The Government of the Slovak Republic is in favour of a common migration policy within the European Union. But we are also in favour of a degree of flexibility for individual Member States in offering instruments to contribute to tackling the migration crisis. I can say for Slovakia – on our territory we help Austria with asylum seekers in Austria, there are hundreds of migrants who are housed in Slovak facilities. We provide catering, provide accommodation, provide health care. And we are ready to help other countries that are under pressure from asylum applications in a similar way. We simply have a practical problem with one aspect of the migration crisis, but no one can accuse the Government of the Slovak Republic of not being sympathetic, because we are doing everything we can to ensure that the migration crisis is resolved. In this, I ask you to understand, in this, Perhaps even more consistent information, because then there may be various misunderstandings. Mr President of the European Parliament, it has been a great pleasure and honour for me to present the priorities of the Slovak Presidency. I repeat, I am very pleased that they were adopted with such an interest, but this is due to the circumstances in which the Slovak Presidency is taking up its presidency. I wish that the Slovak Presidency would not only be a success for the Government of the Slovak Republic, I wish that the Slovak Presidency would be a joint success for all the institutions of the European Union and for the benefit of both the European Union and the people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 61, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Der Präsident. –", "mepid": "1911", "text": "   The debate is closed.

From the Commission side, your input at an early stage in the preparation for the Commission Work Programme is very important and welcome. Today I am here to listen to you about the priorities for next year, as you see them, and the Commission will pay particular attention to the resolution you intend to adopt tomorrow. I welcome the fact that the Council too is now anchored in this process thanks to the interinstitutional agreement on better lawmaking. It did not get much attention outside of the institutions but I think it is a great innovative approach to make sure that all three institutions are equally locked into our priorities. Our dialogue is all the more important in light of the current challenges, which can only be met together. We need to agree on a focused, prioritised agenda which can deliver on the big things where Europeans expect our Union to produce concrete results. The work of the Juncker Commission is guided by the 10 priorities of the political guidelines. This was the basis on which Parliament approved the College of Commissioners and this will not change. More than ever, we need to get our heads down and work hard to focus on key challenges ahead for our economies and societies – areas where the EU can make a real and positive difference to people’s lives and help them regain a sense of control over their futures and destinies. Jobs, growth and investment must therefore remain at the top of our agenda. The European Fund for Strategic Investments is producing results and should be extended beyond 2018. The Commission has accelerated work under the European Agenda on Migration for a swift, coordinated response to the refugee crisis. We presented a package on legal migration last month; our Dublin reform is already before you; and we will come forward with the remaining proposals to strengthen our common European asylum system next week. I count on you to make swift progress on these difficult but important issues. Having invested considerable efforts towards the Paris climate deal, we now need to begin delivery across the full range of our climate and energy policies. Our proposal for ratifying the Paris agreement has been tabled and we will make the proposal on the Effort Sharing Decision for the non-ETS sector before the summer break. By the end of the year, we will make proposals on renewables and energy efficiency. So there is significant work to do in this area, and rapid delivery should be a priority for all of us. The digital single market package, presented on 25 May 2016, with proposals on geo-blocking, cross—border parcel delivery and customer protection, has the potential to deliver significant benefits for businesses and consumers. If we can ensure that these proposals are adopted in 2017, alongside the proposal on portability and coinciding with the end of roaming charges, we will have made a major step towards delivering results for our citizens. We are also following up on the Five Presidents’ report on European monetary union, completing the banking union, building a capital markets union and reinforcing multilateral surveillance. Reinforcing the social dimension of our policies is a key aim of this Commission and I think you have seen that clearly reflected in this year’s European Semester. In terms of initiatives, we recently presented a New Skills Agenda on which we hope discussions can advance rapidly. The public consultation on a European pillar of social rights will close in December and the follow—up initiatives will come next year. One thing is clear: in meeting the challenges we face, we need to coordinate our action with the European institutions and with the Member States. We need to make the best use of the means at our disposal. The mid—term review of the Multiannual Financial Framework is a key moment. The College will hold a first discussion before the summer break and present its review in the course of the autumn. By the end of this year we will have a lot on the table. The Commission Work Programme for 2017 will take this into account. We will also identify key proposals which are currently before Parliament and the Council to start a discussion with you on setting common priorities in a joint declaration, as is provided for in the interinstitutional agreement on better lawmaking. As in the two previous years, the work programme will focus on a limited number of new initiatives which the Commission makes a political commitment to deliver between October 2016 and December 2017. Making sure that the existing body of law is fit for purpose is as important as tabling new initiatives, and I see what I would almost call a cultural change in the three institutions, to place a focus on that aspect of our work as well. The REFIT (Regulatory Fitness and Performance) platform is already working on opinions on a number of key stakeholders’ suggestions to feed into the discussions on the Commission Work Programme. The platform has worked very hard and has come up with a number of important suggestions and opinions that can be very useful to all of us. We are also updating the REFIT scoreboard to make it easier to use. Our dialogue on the work programme is an important and concrete aspect of the cooperation between our institutions. The Commission is committed to working closely with you and the Council in the preparatory process. I reiterate that today I am here to listen to you. What you say here, honourable Members, and then your resolution, will help us shape the letter of intent which will be sent to you on 14 September in parallel with the President’s State of the Union address. After that, our dialogue will continue in the Conference of Committee Chairs, in the Conference of Presidents and here in plenary when we present the work programme to you on 25 October. Let me finish with one remark. If we do this work together as two institutions and also incorporate the Council in these discussions, then nobody on the Council side will be able to say, when they go home, ‘That’s Brussels: that is not us’. We will get them into the process and then they will have to defend their own responsibility in that process when they go home. Brussels is all of us, including national governments.

One is very good at and very effective in destroying things which have been built through decades of hard work. After the destruction is completed, they leave the scene and do not want – or are not able – to participate in building further. The sign of this escapism is shown at this very moment with Mr Farage’s empty seat.  The majority of colleagues in this Parliament have been choosing a different way, which is to deliver in time the Commission work programme 2017 for the first time in several years, which is one way of participating in rebuilding, step by step, through hard work. After the turbulent past years, something for sure needs rebuilding. There is a need for economic recovery, for renewal, for a better Europe, but what we most need to rebuild is the diminishing public support for the European project. Let me quote my favourite sentence from the resolution we are going to adopt this afternoon: ‘Europe now faces many common global challenges, but also increasing frustration and worry among many citizens about uncertain life prospects and the lack of opportunities that citizens expect decision-makers to respond to’, and ‘whereas it is urgent to win back the hearts of Europeans’. This is the most important which we have to do, but merely by continuing our job, business as usual, we cannot do that. We have to rebuild the trust only with change, sometimes with radical change in order to meet the requirements and the expectations of citizens.  I do not want to fall into the other trap of politicians to exaggerate too much, but I think that this resolution – with the very good collective work of the last few months of negotiations with the leadership of Maria João Rodrigues – is a step in the right direction. A modest step, but I think in rebuilding Europe, rebuilding trust is a very important one.  It is significant that this is the first time in several years that we are bringing this paper, the knowledge of the Commission, much earlier so we can really use this instrument in order to influence by hard negotiations the work of the Commission. Just let me end by saying that what we want is basically to provide the best conditions for future young generations, for SMEs, for business, to create employment and to reshore jobs. The single market is a great opportunity but needs a digital dimension. There is a new deal, as the Commissioner has mentioned. A new deal is needed in order to rebuild the trust, not just between the people and politicians, but also between European and national politicians. This is how we can listen to the hearts of the people.

Citizens are concerned about the way to get control of their lives. There is a big choice about that. Either we go back to national borders or we are able to build, together, better European solutions. For this we need to have a strong and clear road map. This EP resolution is Parliament’s first contribution to defining that road map. We think that the road map should be clear on better European solutions – and, firstly, on how to address citizens’ concerns. We are calling for a strong European pillar of social rights, ensuring that all citizens can count on good working conditions, social protection and social services, while also getting access to better skills for better jobs. This is particularly crucial for young people in Europe. We know, too, that Europe needs to deliver on a new EU global strategy. We welcome the proposal from Federica Mogherini and the Commission in this direction because we think that Europe needs to renew, first of all, the way it works with neighbouring countries to stabilise them and support their development. This is also the best way to manage migration flows, while ensuring that we can host refugees in a manner commensurate with European standards. Moreover, we need to ensure, once and for all, that we reverse the current trend of economic and social divergences undermining the very heart of Europe. This is happening in the EU as a whole and we need to address it with a strong policy for economic and social cohesion. It is happening too inside the eurozone, and for that we need to complete economic and monetary union with banking union and fiscal capacity. So these are our requests.

The European Union is disintegrating at a frightening speed. Anti—EU forces are on the rise, demolishing what has been built up over decades by the post-war generations but, instead of offering an alternative vision for the future, they just jump ship. Thank you, Mr Farage.  Against this this backdrop, the Work Programme of the Commission must be more than a mere list of legislative proposals. It must offer the outlines of a new European Union because the kneejerk reflex to the current anti-EU mood is to weaken Europe even further, assuming that if we scrap a few more directives people will suddenly embrace the European project. But that is a dramatic mistake. People’s existential anxieties will not be addressed by eliminating rules on vacuum cleaners or the curve of cucumbers.  People are anxious and insecure because, in just a few decades, the world has changed beyond recognition. Globalisation, the digital revolution and urbanisation have radically changed the way that we live. Our communities have become much more diverse with immigration and advancing gender equality. Political and economic leadership is no longer the monopoly of middle-aged white alpha males. Agriculture and industry have been overtaken by the knowledge economy and what was considered a very good CV 30 years ago no longer opens doors today. Our old familiar world has gone. There is a 50-50 split in the population that is reflected in the electorate, not just in Europe, but also in the United States and elsewhere. Each side is terrified of the world view of the other and our task is to offer a plan for healing this rift. We must do justice to both. It is not just about a victory of one group over the other, it is about creating a society where both feel safe and at home. The kneejerk reflex of weakening the EU in response to the rise of anti-EU sentiments is the wrong one. It does not do justice to those who do want to grasp the opportunities the 21st century world offers, nor does it help in any way those who feel threatened by a new world. It is a mistake to think we can weaken the anti—EU populists by weakening the EU. We have to make the EU stronger, more democratic and more accountable, and more able to act and address the big challenges of today. The European Parliament and the European Commission have, by and large, understood this, but the national governments are tearing the European Union apart like a bunch of political hooligans, using Europe like a punchbag, and this must stop. I call on all national politicians to stop Europe-bashing. Stop the blame game. Stop the lies. Take your responsibility for Europe. We all have a responsibility to offer a real prospect to all European citizens, a Europe where everyone has a place, a place for all – young and old, city and countryside, men and women, people of all shapes and sizes and all walks of life – and that must be the message of the Commission Work Programme.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 74, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "João Pimenta Lopes", "mepid": "136236", "text": "  gue/NGL Group. – Mr President, we have discussed this work programme in the face of the enormous political magnitude of the sovereign decision of the British people to leave the European Union. A sovereign expression that results and highlights the profound political, economic and social crisis of the European capitalist integration project and the profound contradictions that characterize it result from its class nature. An expression that confirms the increasing distance of the peoples of Europe, the European Union and their policies for the exploitation of workers and peoples for the benefit of the great European capital. They are now launching leaks that will deepen the federalist character of the European Union and the concentration of power within it, in direct confrontation with the interests and aspirations of the peoples.

A support programme is required for Member States wishing to negotiate exit from the euro by ending the submission and corset of the single currency. It is required to renegotiate sovereign debts, which are largely illegitimate.

These words at least are being used by everyone but the big question is, of course: what do we do with that? Are we really serious that we want a change of course, or is it just rhetoric that we are pretending to listen to citizens but then just continuing as we have always done? And I fear sometimes it is the latter.  If you listen to some of the Prime Ministers, they are saying that what Europe should do mainly is focus on the internal market and trade. That has been the message of Europe for decades. That was the message that Cameron was trying to get across to UK citizens. He lost on it. And I would almost like to say to those politicians who think that this would be the way to get out of this crisis: ‘It is not the economy, stupid’. It is not.  It is people not feeling that the EU is giving them social protection, people feeling that their society is losing its grip because there is no control over multinationals and that the countries have no idea how to gain control over this. That is the core of the problem and that is what we expect from Europe: to give protection to the people, to give social protection to the people, and that is where the EU needs to deliver. And that is why we need a change of course: in our economic governance, for example, which is still focused only on reducing debt. That needs to change. That is a reform that we are asking for, and that is very crucial.  But it is the same when you look at future challenges. The challenges of the future lie in our economy. It needs to be a resource-efficient economy. That is the future challenge that needs to be addressed and not to be looking back at the 20th century. And look at the reaction of a lot of leaders. They say now in the UK that they want to lower corporate tax to keep companies. Other countries want to get companies to come to their country. It is that race to the bottom that our citizens have rejected. And if we are not able to overcome this together – instead of a closed Council where there is no transparency, where they are just fighting for their national interests – if we cannot overcome that, then we can carry on saying for a long time that is not business as usual but, in the end, it is business as usual: a race to the bottom where our citizens are losing out.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 76, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "David Borrelli", "mepid": "124796", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in presenting his 2016 action plan, Mr Juncker made his debut with this phrase: 'it is time to go beyond day-to-day administration'. And why did it consider it useful and necessary to go beyond the ordinary administration? Because, Juncker told us, citizens expect the EU to make a difference. After a year, what results do we see? In which areas can our fellow citizens say that the EU has made a difference? To build an effective and coherent plan for 2017 it is necessary to answer these questions and it is necessary to respond concretely, looking at the situations. No one here wants to deny that in recent months the European institutions have faced major challenges, new challenges and even unexpected challenges. But has the Union made a difference? Did the ten key actions proposed in the Commission's 2016 work plan make a difference? It is clear to all of us that some results are not achieved in the short term, that it takes time to see the consolidated effects in the field of the economy and the pacification of crisis areas. But the direction must be clear and the speed appropriate to the needs: some initiatives such as the circular economy are positive indications and we will work together to ensure that they are properly implemented. But the situation in Europe is difficult and, for some of our countries, even serious. We need to act in a more strategic, more coordinated way and also, in my opinion, more comprehensible to the citizens.  A strong signal was the creation of the Strategic Investment Fund, but in its implementation it was lacking a soul and a strong vision, and once again the data tell us how much the strongest countries have rewarded at the expense of the weaker countries. The right direction is one in which the Union is helping Europe and Europeans to release and activate energy; the 2017 work plan must make a difference in creating a habitat favourable to many and not just a few, even if excellent, to those who simply ask to be freed from bureaucratic burdens, taxes and prejudices to build a life. Liquidity is there: the ECB continues to put money into circulation. Let them go to the real economy.  Then there is a Europe which looks outwards and which worries us even more. This is the case with a Europe that has a global strategy but can no longer talk to Russia, other than through the instrument of sanctions. It is a Europe that closes the Balkan corridor, without developing a strategy to contain the other migrant transit corridors, such as the Central Mediterranean corridor. The Commission's 2017 work plan will be the central plan for the entire legislature. What can have the strength and time to be fully developed over the next two years. We therefore expect it to live up to the Commission's wish, that it should allow us to say, in a year's time, that this time the Commission has really made a difference.

Mr President, Mr Commission representative, ladies and gentlemen, how long will you continue to repeat the same empty phrases, to always propose the same deleterious measures? Will you never be able to hear and understand what the people are telling you more and more forcefully - what they will tell you, moreover, again, on 2 October in Hungary during the referendum on the appalling quotas of migrants that you impose on the people? However, it seems to me that the situation is clear. The only work programme of the Commission that deserves to be discussed is the one preparing the concerted dissolution of the European Union, starting with the Schengen agreements and the euro, for the benefit of regained national sovereignty and healthy cooperation between nations. The astonishment shown in these very places following the British vote and the angry statements against democracy and against the peoples that followed show that you did not foresee, let alone prepare, the concrete modalities for a Member State to leave the European Union. Your ideology, of course, prevents you from doing so, when it should be your priority today, because the British vote - be certain - will not be an exception, but the first in a long series. The peoples of Europe have woken up and nothing will stop them. The complete inability of the European institutions to reform and listen in order to become useful condemns them to disappear. People want - whether you like it or not - to regain their sovereignty, their freedom, the power to freely determine their destiny. So, Mr Commission representative, let Mr Juncker know that, rather than talking to the leaders of the other planets, rather than attacking a Europe that is largely rejected by the majority of peoples and which you want to impose today simply by intimidation, terror and force, it should realistically prepare for European deconstruction and the reconstruction of nation states. He could also - it would be classy - in the face of the failure of his Commission, apologise and resign. It is no longer possible to continue to deny reality. There is no point in seeking legal arguments to prevent Brexit. Yes, the United Kingdom will leave the European Union, and that is a good thing.

In my country this is called the appointment of an official, not an election.  Let me explain my contention in simple terms: last year Mr Juncker presented the corresponding 2016 programme, concluding that he had mentioned as the most important objectives, tackling the crisis, unemployment, deepening monetary union, maintaining a security climate after the Charlie attack, restoring stability in the Greek economy and a fair agreement with the United Kingdom. A year later, there is uncontrolled migration, unemployment is galloping, young people are moving towards internal migration to Greece, businesses are closing down and there is control of bank funds.

I think the maxim \"to be big on big things and small on small things\" should be taken very seriously. Fourthly, in legislative and implementing measures, the Commission should limit it to the measures that are necessary and to dispense with those that citizens associate with overregulation with bureaucracy. Fifthly, where harmonisation of standards is not necessary for the proper functioning of the common market, let us leave it to the Member States; where we need to consolidate the common market, European standards must be enforced, for example, the freedom of movement of persons or the provision of services must be defended.

The gap between the official ambition to act as a geopolitical player and the real political capacity to do this still looms large. The EU cannot limit itself to the role of a Good Samaritan, taking care of the results of the Middle East crisis instead of actively heeding its root causes. My second point is that continuing sanctions on Russia is a question of principle until the Minsk agreements are fully complied with. It is a crucial test of the EU’s credibility – the credibility of its value—based impact in the wider world.

I mention this because, all too often in the last couple of months, something seems to have been forgotten, and that is that 751 Europeans have been elected to directly represent citizens from 28 different nations in all their diversity, with all their differences and their different outlooks and lives: you all come together here in this Chamber to look for majorities to take decisions. That is the essence of representative democracy: that you decide by majority, just as the British people have decided by majority to leave the European Union. That decision needs to be respected. But, likewise, those who only shouted during the years they were here in this Parliament should have had more respect for the majority in this Parliament, whose decisions are just as legitimised by the voters who went to vote for them.

I repeat: our people, the people you represent, are worried about the future, are concerned about those who represent them, are anxious. If it were only the European institutions they were challenging, that would be wonderful. We could get rid of the institutions and everything would be okay.

This only proves once again that Member States are unable to combat child poverty. Thus, does the Commission not consider it necessary to establish a specific instrument with a budget set for that purpose, i.e. A children's guarantee that every child can receive free health and childcare, education, decent accommodation and proper nutrition? The majority in the European Parliament has already adopted in its report that such a guarantee is necessary because one Member State is unable to combat child poverty. I therefore very much hope that the Commission will commit itself to combating child poverty through concrete measures in the 2017 programme.

In view of the above, I believe that the institutions of the European Union are missing out on the necessary measures in the area of demographic change.

Article 7, which provides for a period of 5 years as a general rule for the change of scale for all labels, with the exception of dishwashers, refrigerators, washing machines, televisions and lamps, which have 21 months, and heaters (6 years) should be noted.

It is worth noting the adoption of Socialist Amendment No 96, with the vote against the EPP, by which consumers can return at no cost those products that do not meet European labelling requirements and receive their full refund.

However, the European Parliament threatens to limit supervision and to fully exploit the ambition of some devices. Products consume less and less energy, which means that plus signs are added to the labels. This makes the system unclear and ensures that outdated techniques still seem like a good buy. The Christian Democrats and liberals are overlooking outdated techniques at the expense of consumers and climate. For example, they argue that labels for boilers will not be scaled up until 2030. The producers of gas boilers see their lobby rewarded: as long as their product is in the green zone, it sells better. Many of these boilers are hard to call energy efficient.

The main task of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency is to develop an operational and technical strategy for the implementation of integrated border management at EU level, to monitor the effective functioning of border controls at the external borders of the Member States, to carry out vulnerability assessments and to ensure that national authorities address all deficiencies in the management of external borders, etc.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 855, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Andrea Bocskor (PPE)", "mepid": "124712", "text": "  Writing. \\u2012 The European Border and Coast Guard is created by extending frontex's tasks, powers and mandates to protect the EU's external borders, be it migratory pressures or other unforeseen security threats to international crime.

I support the proposed regulation establishing a European Border and Coast Guard. The Schengen area is one of the greatest and most visible achievements of European integration. But the refugee-migrant crisis and the threat have put this achievement at stake, as many countries have resorted to border checks at their borders, the EU's internal borders. In order to preserve the so-called Schengen needs to be strengthened to protect the EU's external border and, in my opinion, the establishment of a European Border and Coast Guard is the right answer to that. This proposal was presented by the Commission in December last year, and in my opinion this should have happened earlier. But better late than never.

The Frontex Agency, whose mandate has already been reviewed twice since its entry into force in 2005, needs to be strengthened in its competences, as Parliament has repeatedly called for. In response, the European Commission has proposed an ambitious plan that includes the preventive assessment of vulnerabilities at the external borders, the use of liaison officers with Member States, the potential deployment of 1,500 border guards for emergencies, with a clearer role for the Agency in terms of returns and rescue operations, increased cooperation with third countries and the launch of genuine and integrated European cooperation on coastguard functions.

Frontex is also mandated to carry out border surveillance activities in the EU's neighbouring countries. The main objective of the proposal is therefore to reduce the influx of refugees into Europe and to return irregular refugees to their countries of origin or transit.

Despite attempts by the Green Group to improve the text, the compromise text still contains elements that we cannot support. We would rather advocate border management in Europe that respects human rights and promotes, rather than hinders, the protection of refugees.

It goes without saying that this cooperation is not intended to combat illegal immigration but rather to facilitate the work of smugglers by organising the rescue and then repatriation of migrants to Europe.

The importance of financial instruments is due to their high leverage effect, which can have a positive impact on innovation, e.g. through energy efficiency, and can contribute to a better absorption rate by providing the necessary co-financing, especially in Member States and regions with low national co-financing capacity. In this context, however, it should be noted that grants and loans do not finance the same type of activities and that these different types of aid target different types of beneficiaries and projects.

The delegated regulation of 23 May 2016 on the matter referred to specifies the criteria which the authorities responsible for the banking resolution must consider when determining THEMR for the purpose of absorbing losses and recapitalisation effects.  The purpose of MREL is to ensure that banks hold sufficient amounts of high-quality own funds and liabilities eligible for high-quality bail-in redemption, which can be readily used to absorb losses and for recapitalisation as soon as it comes from a resolution.  These criteria are very important because they ensure that in times of financial difficulties of the banking institution concerned, it is \"saved\" and supported by its shareholders and creditors - and, fundamentally, not by taxpayers.

First of all let me say that this is the first opportunity we have had to discuss the global strategy that I presented to the European Council last week after the Council saw and welcomed the strategy itself. The fact that this Hemicycle is the first occasion to discuss the follow-up to the strategy and its presentation is, for me, more than something symbolic, because you have accompanied me and all of us in this collective work since the beginning. I would like to thank Parliament and in particular Ms Kalniete for her report and for the several exchanges we have had along the way. I really appreciated the role that Parliament played, as well as, let me say too, the role that national parliaments played all along the way, and I count very much on this to continue as we enter into the most delicate phase, which is the follow-up and implementation of the strategy because no strategy makes sense if it stays on paper, it has to translate into action. I would like to add another thing. As you might imagine, the fact that I decided to present the strategy to the European Council, even after the results of the UK referendum, was not in any way a decision that was taken for granted. I did it after deep reflection precisely because I am convinced that at this time, we need to focus on what the European Union needs to do for its citizens, and acting together at world level, on the global scale, is one of the key action elements for the European Union and it is clearly an element where either we act together as Europeans, or none of our Member States has the size, the power, the tools, to act effectively as a global player. So I thought it was exactly the right moment to point to the need to come together and work together on the global scene, as Europeans, if we want to respond to the security challenges, but also to the economic opportunities that the world offers us. I guess that by now you will have seen the global strategy, the final result of our work, and you might have noticed that the world is described as fragile; if you look at the news every single day it is quite clear that this is the situation we are living in today. It is very different from the world’s state in 2003 when the previous strategy was released. Let me start with a small reference to something big that has happened in the past few days, the terrorist attack in Dhaka in Bangladesh, and if you think of it, Bangladesh has long been considered a stable country, a country safe for EU citizens, an unlikely target for terror and yet today we mourn the victims of last week’s attack, among them nine citizens from Italy, which means nine citizens of our European Union. And on the very same days, Istanbul and Baghdad were also hit. We are getting used to numbers as if these were not people with lives and families, people with dreams and hopes, and a normal life, whether at work or ‘iftar’, just people living their lives, that is being attacked at its very essence. And it is to tackle this aspect of focusing on people’s lives and the everyday life of our citizens and those that are not our citizens that this strategy is being conceived. We believe that our citizens and the citizens of the entire world need a more united Europe and a stronger European Union if we want to make their lives better and safer. As I said, I decided to present a strategy even if it was coming in turbulent and sad days. I decided to go on with the presentation because, yes, the result of the British vote is going to change many things – for the UK, first of all, for the UK’s citizens, and also for the European Union – but the European project does not stop here. I know you discussed this earlier this morning but just two days ago I was with our friends in the Western Balkans – we were together in Paris for a summit with the Prime Ministers of the region – and as we face inside the European Union waves of Euro-scepticism or a negative attitude towards the European Union, in the Western Balkans our friends have to manage the expectations of Euro-enthusiasm. I think it is extremely healthy for us to see what the European Union is about, seen from the outside, and realise what is at stake, what we risk losing, and why we need still today, and even more today, to come together and act together as Europeans. So our Union goes on and cannot afford uncertainty. We need for sure to rethink the way in which the European Union works, but we need first of all to work on the priorities of our citizens. This strategy shows the way forward on security, foreign policy and defence. After months of consultations with all the European Union institutions, including this Parliament, with all the Member States, with so many citizens in the Union, we have agreed on a shared vision for our foreign policy and on the common actions to turn the vision into reality. We have discussed this strategy many times in this Hemicycle, with the Conference of Presidents, with the committees. Thank you again for the excellent report by Sandra Kalniete. I do not need to go through the individual points of the document. Some have told me it is a very long strategy. It is indeed because it contains a lot of very detailed and also some framework things, but also very concrete things that we need to do and yes, it is long because there is a lot of work to do, but I would like to focus on a few central points. First of all, the strategy builds using our Union’s potential which is huge. Each of our countries alone has very little leverage when we negotiate with powers the size of a continent like China or the US, but as a Union of almost half a billion people, we talk to China and the US as peers and this is something that no Member State alone will ever manage to do. And yet this is something that we do not even realise. We still think as national states and this is what needs to be changed. This is what we need to change if we want to be a relevant and effective player in the world. Let me echo here words that some of you said in the Hemicycle in Brussels last week that I found to be extremely wise. There is no contradiction between our local, our national and our European identities. It is not a matter of philosophy here, it is a matter of putting together the instruments we have and realising that there are some instruments that are only effective if we use them at the European common level. So the great challenge is to make full use of all our tools in a common and coherent way and to make sure that they all serve our shared European interests. Because, yes, there is a common European interest that can only be served through common means. The strategy focuses on how to maximise the impact of some tools that we already use, starting with development cooperation. Our Union, as you know very well, is already the biggest aid donor worldwide, investing more than the rest of the world combined in development cooperation. But we can make our aid much more effective if we work more on joint programming, for instance, and if we develop further partnerships between the European Union institutions, Member States, the international financial institutions and the private sector, and if we deepen our partnership and cooperation with our friends in the rest of the world. We are also starting to explore new fields of common action, such as energy, diplomacy, cultural diplomacy and economic diplomacy, but the strategy also states very clearly that what we are so good at, soft power, is not enough in these times. Obviously, nobody calls into question the fact that soft power is and will remain the centre of our external action, also because we are the best in the world at soft power. But our Union has already evolved into something much more than a civilian power alone, and the same concept of human security is something that requires not only a military or security – in a traditional sense – approach, but the whole range of tools we can use. So we have to overcome the debate about whether Europeans come from Venus or Mars. We have to join the instruments we have because the limits between security and the rest is becoming thinner and thinner and we see it in our everyday lives, including inside our European Union. So the strategy also focuses on our security, defence and military instruments. Our missions and operations contribute to global peace and security already today, and this is something that the international community fully recognises. You might have seen that the UN Security Council passed another resolution very recently, the second one, endorsing Operation Sophia in a very clear way with unanimous support. So the world recognises the military assets and the security and defence capabilities and capacity of the European Union. Sometimes from the inside we have some difficulties looking at it in a clear way and we have to overcome that. From our region to the broader world, from Colombia to the Philippines, our partners are working already now with the European Union as a global security provider, and we are putting our partnerships at the core of our foreign and security policy. An anecdote that brings a lot of symbolism: the first person with whom I shared physically the strategy after having presented it to the European Council was my friend Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO Secretary-General, ahead of the NATO summit in Warsaw the day after tomorrow, as we are also strengthening our cooperation with NATO, as will be discussed at the summit itself. We are stronger when we can cooperate with strong partners, including strong regional organisations. This is another key concept of the strategy. This implies concrete follow-up, meaning that we will need to work more and more, and in a coordinated way, to reinforce our partners, starting with existing organisations such as the African Union, CELAC, the Arab League and ASEAN, and also to explore new formats and also different geometries of that. We saw with the Iranian deal last year that every single situation requires different formats for cooperation worldwide, but all of them require some partnerships and some multilateralism formats in one way or another. We are stronger when the UN system is strong and we know very well that the way of making the UN system strong is not only to preserve its values and its centralities, but also to reform it, so the strategy refers to the need and the will to work on the reform of the United Nations, including the Security Council , so that they can truly meet the challenges of this 21st century. And we are working more and more to coordinate the European voices within the United Nations in the best possible way. I think this is going to be an interesting field of action in the years ahead. At the same time, strong partnerships will be coupled with a higher degree of strategic autonomy for our Union. A more credible European defence is essential also for the sake of healthy relationships with our friends, starting with the United States, and yet a more credible European defence would serve first and foremost not our partners, but our citizens and their security. Our citizens’ interest calls for stronger cooperation on all security issues from intelligence and anti-terrorism, making the link between internal and external work, to research and development in the fields of defence and security. The strategy does not aim to change the Treaties, but to finally apply them in full. The battle groups were already foreseen by the Lisbon Treaty but too many obstacles have prevented their development. Defence cooperation must become the norm, and not the exception, to make our investments more effective, our industry more competitive, and our citizens more secure. The strategy clearly indicates how to perceive these objectives in the years ahead, hopefully in the months ahead, but this will depend very much on the political will to follow up coherently what we have agreed in the strategy. All these commitments will have to be put into practice. The next phase, the implementation of the strategy, will be essential and crucial. The strategy explicitly foresees a revision of the existing strategies – sectoral strategies we already have – and it also plans to devise and implement new, thematic or geographic strategies in line with the priorities that it indicates. So such work must begin now with clear procedures and timeframes agreed by all relevant players and I will discuss this with the Foreign Ministers already in 10 days’ time at the Foreign Affairs Council. The European Union global strategy itself will require a periodic review, to be carried out in consultation with the Council, the Commission and this Parliament on a yearly basis. It will reflect on the state of play of the strategy, pointing out whether and where further implementation must be sought. This will be a political decision and I will be interested obviously to hear Parliament’s views on what part of the strategy needs to be prioritised in time. This strategy is about how to make our foreign and security policy more effective and, at the end of the day, deliver to our citizens and their needs. It will need the full support of this Parliament to translate this shared vision into common action. I count very much, as always, not only on your support – I know the strategy and its implementation have that – but also on your ideas and on your contribution to this strategy because there is one thing that has been clear to me all along the way – and once again, I would like to thank Sandra and Parliament for the work done in this direction – this is not just a strategy for the Member States; this is just not a strategy for the Council; this is not just a strategy for the Commission; this is not just a strategy for Parliament. This is a strategy for the European Union and this is the first step.

I regret that, due to very unfortunate circumstances, the strategy was not discussed properly at the European Council and was just welcomed but not endorsed. Vice-President of the Commission/ High Representative Mogherini has done a good job in taking on board recommendations of various stakeholders, including those made by this House. I fully agree that the highest priority for security and defence in this strategy is security. Short of an ambition to create a true European Defence Union, the strategy points in the right direction of cooperation to increase defence capabilities, with the expectation that the White Paper on defence will bring us closer to adequately funded – and I underline ‘funded’ – integrated European defence. I support the shift to principled pragmatism in foreign affairs that this strategy implies. It does not mean abandoning our values, but rather setting realistic objectives, so the Union is able to protect and ultimately advance those values. Resilience is another key concept of the strategy. It is as important for our neighbourhood as it is for our own states and societies, especially in the light of ever-closer intertwinement of external and internal security. We are entering an era requiring an unprecedented level of policy coherence to counter external and internal threats. I strongly welcome the determination to continue a credible enlargement policy and a clear, strict and fair accession process as an investment in our own security and prosperity.

The people of the European Union have a right to safety, and we therefore thank you for presenting this global strategy, which shows a good way of proceeding. The strategy stands and falls with the political will of the Member States and the political will in this House. The 27 Member States must define what kind of Union they want. For all the differences that can be made in detail, additional commitment to the safety of our citizens is a necessity that everyone will understand, even if there may be different standards and different needs to be seen. The fight against terrorism is an example of this. The necessary steps have often been discussed with us. The external borders are being discussed again at the moment, and this is also part of security in the European Union. In order to successfully implement this strategy, we first need strong political will and, above all, a concrete roadmap. Only then will people reward our efforts. Cooperation, for example in arms planning and in the development of complementary capacities, is a prerequisite for a common defence policy. Common defence will also be able to lead to a restructuring of the arms industry. It should not end in armament, but in more efficient Community planning and armament. Irrespective of the question of what police, intelligence or military means to use, it remains the case that soft power is one of our greatest weapons that we have and must continue to be used.

The UK-led anti-piracy operation, EU NAVFOR Atalanta, has proved not only that there is a need for a CSDP-led missions, but that they can be hugely successful. The breakthrough anti-nuclear deal with Iran and Russian sanctions have been greatly helped by Europe’s ability to work closely together. These are successes that we must point to when advocating the benefits of closer cooperation in Europe.  Whatever the future relationship post the Brexit referendum result between the United Kingdom, my country, and the European Union, the one thing of which I am certain is that strong cooperation in the fields of foreign policy, security and defence will continue.  The shifting world order, conflict in the Middle East and North Africa, an aggressive Russian expansionist state, global migration patterns, the effects of climate change, international jihadist terrorism as we recently saw in Dhaka – all of these are shared threats and will continue to be so. As for the strategy, targets aimed at Member State level to commit 20% of defence spending to procurement and to research and development, for instance, are very welcome. Focusing on initiatives such as the energy union and investment in cyber security are also very positive steps.  We are still seeing the infancy of the CFSP and CSDP, but I continue to believe that they are the instruments for securing a strong voice for Europe in the world ahead, which is ever more dangerous.

A Brexit must not prevent us from working closely together with the United Kingdom in security matters. Personally I hope that the impossible is possible and that the United Kingdom stays with us, but that we will see. It means that NATO is the best platform for working with the United Kingdom, the United States and, of course, the countries of Europe. NATO is effective. Of course in Europe we should not stand idly by. If NATO cannot operate, we have to do it ourselves. We have to put our money where our mouth is and invest in our defence capabilities and capacities. This is of vital interest. Let me look to Theodore Roosevelt, who said, ‘Speak softly and carry a big stick’. We do not need to have all the decorations but we should act when necessary. If we look at the relationship with Russia, the High Representative states – quite rightly – that the illegal annexation of the Crimea cannot be accepted and neither can the intervention in eastern Ukraine. So the sanctions are on. However, it is possible to work with Russia in fields where we have common interests. That is possible and is called selective engagement.

Fundamental freedoms are the freedoms of capital. Security is the security of being able to enforce the neoliberal economic order worldwide. Nevertheless, I would like to ask: what are the values of cooperation with Saudi Arabia or Turkey, arms deals or the use of development aid for military equipment in Africa or the linking of development aid to refugee defence? Central to the strategy are the demands for more armament, massive support for the military-industrial complex and a classic: the further strengthening of EU-NATO cooperation. It is correctly analysed that there are more fragile states, that terrorism and violent conflicts are spreading, that poverty, lawlessness and corruption are driving more than 50 million people to flee. But there is no recognition that the neoliberal EU is a contributor to these crises.

Obviously, we are living in a different world today. That is why we very much welcome the fact that you, Mrs Mogherini, are providing for a new foreign and security strategy. And you were quite right when you said earlier that this is a field in which the citizens of Europe expect more from our Union. We also welcome the fact that you are very explicitly and clearly committed to the principle of effective multilateralism, that you do not restrict the security strategy to the classic fields of foreign and security policy, but that, as you yourself have pointed out, you describe the various fields in their interaction. We also very much welcome the fact that you are putting the principle of prevention at the centre. But the high literary touch does not always meet an equally good note for the practical substance. With regard to battlegroups, for example, the strategy remains rather vague. The key word of the operational headquarters, which we have been calling for for a long time, does not occur. It is proposed that the EU's budget should be spent on additional military research, while the Member States themselves spend less on it. \"The truth is concrete,\" Hegel said, and so is your strategy. If you want so much prevention, why change the structure of your service in such a way that the Directorate for Security Policy, Conflict Prevention and Mediation is abandoned? Why are you trying to use money earmarked for prevention for the export of armaments technologies? I believe that we should be very careful in our strategy that we do not take over. The EU as a global security provider is implausible. The idea of strategic autonomy is a fantasy.

The plan is ambitious and assumes a revival, a return to reality, in a much darker context than in 2003, on all theatres, starting from our neighbourhood: instability, terrorism and the economic and social crisis are, alas, the most sore points.  The answer is entrusted to five priorities, which are inspired by the so-called 'pragmatism of principles', i.e. an unstable balance between the realities of the facts, and above all the concrete interests of the EU, and the EU's guiding principles and values. However, it is right to recognise the need for three prerequisites. The Union must therefore be credible, responsive and united. A mission that is perhaps impossible with the instruments at your disposal at the moment. But are we really consistent and united? Have we been consistent and united in Libya? About Egypt? We see, on the one hand, the Regeni spouses received in this Parliament, on the other hand, France handing over the Mistral helicopter carrier, the first of the 2 am, which concludes multibillion-dollar agreements on the supply of arms. And what about the agreement with Turkey, which is illegal and immoral from our point of view, in order to conceal our limitations and our inability? And again on the accession of Turkey, which has so far been formally supported, even though it is now out of history, given Erdogan's choices.  But there are still the contradictions of certain countries in the Council. Ukraine and Russia should be everyone's problem for some Eastern European countries. But the asymmetric sanctions bill brings only a few countries to their knees while others are only scratched. Other Member States, on the other hand, as far as migration is concerned, are seen as the only ones to have to deal with it, and it would therefore be a problem exclusively for the Mediterranean and the Member States themselves are also called out of the redistribution of migrants' quotas, something I would like to stress, given that one of these Member States currently holds the rotating Presidency of the Council.

In the meantime, the question arises as to whether this approach to the new vision, the desire and the strategy of a strong Europe and so many other impressions that I have read in this report are shared by the strong Powers of Europe, because there is an interview by Wolfgang Schäuble in Corriere della Sera, which seems to me to be heading in exactly the opposite direction, if what is true is true, which he declares : \"Now is certainly not the right time to work on greater eurozone integration. The first task – always Schäuble literally – is to avoid re-awakening expectations that cannot be met. Now is not the time for vision. The situation is so serious that we must stop playing the usual European games in Brussels.\" On the other side of German politics, a former Chancellor, Mr Schimdt, declares that a breathing space is needed in the European process and calls for greater consideration to be given to national and regional self-government and the defence of the identity of the Member States.  Well, I believe that these are reflections that perhaps the High Representative should and should have taken more into account, because the meaning of Brexit is precisely this: it is a questionable response, motivated according to an infinite number of different interpretations, but certainly strongly influenced by a widespread feeling. I am pleased that the High Representative welcomes this Euro-enthusiasm, perhaps in Albania or some other Balkan country. Unfortunately, however, among the founding countries, the peoples who represent the Europe of all time, the Europe of its origins, the Europe that really had the original vision of what the European Union was supposed to be, feelings are completely different.  It is hard to understand, for example, even though we are talking about peace, that this choice is well known as equally inspired and perhaps even pressed to continue, through NATO, to support actions that can only be described as provocative, to inspire a feeling of hostility towards Russia which is hostile to Europe and perhaps never has been, and, indeed, , perhaps it has the same interests as us in the field of terrorism and security.

I, too, would like to thank you for this global strategy. It is moving in the right direction. The problem is: we are filling in something, and how do we get the Member States to fill it out? Political will is the key point behind it. Multilateralism as a crucial instrument is important, the idea of prevention is important, Europe's soft power must continue to play a role. We must make it clear that we are giving a great deal for non-military aid: 60% of global development aid comes from funds from the European Union and its Member States – and much else can be accepted.  We spend more money from the EU budget on prevention abroad than the United States. I think we should stick to that. But it is not enough if the same sense of security is not associated with it. We must ensure that all Member States feel the same quality and safety. However, we must do this in cooperation with NATO in terms of territorial defence. But we must be able to operate outside Europe's borders for prevention as a military one. That is why a mixture of civil and military crisis management is important, and it is important that the capacities and instruments are created for this. It is therefore necessary to create synergy effects and to address procurement issues that are most urgently needed. It is necessary to enforce permanent structured cooperation so that the willing can act. It is necessary to have a headquarters for coordination, so that we do not have to look for one every year for a year before we can take action. I believe that, overall, we should look at the issue of coordination. The issues of resources in our budget must be addressed here. This is a bad chapter. And we must have a new definition of security, which refers to the issues of internal and external security, the fight against terrorism, etc. Our enemies in the field of terrorism , the Islamic State – make no distinction. That is why we need to make a new definition of global terrorism security, covering normal threats and threats from land warfare, as well as open issues ranging from hybrid to cyber warfare.

Mr President, the foreign policy of each Member State serves its national interest, both bilaterally and in the integrated global environment. It is achieved through classical diplomacy, participation in international organisations, and even by demonstrating strength or financial support. However, within the Union, in many parts of the Treaty relating to the common foreign policy, there are ambiguous concepts and errors.  Firstly, let us make it clear that the Union's defence policy is wrongly guaranteed by NATO and a common security and defence policy is wrongly designed in line with NATO's interests. For the Union's global strategy, what is set out in Articles 21 and 22 of the Treaty is sufficient and currently achievable. Projects other than those provided for in the above Articles will be unmanageable, both in terms of the provision of forces and in terms of logistical and financial support.  Finally, I would like to remind some colleagues who, after Brexit, have shown a willingness to punish and isolate the United Kingdom with pseudo-lionism, excessive snobbism and even a ban on talks with British officials, that it would be good to tone down, especially on foreign policy and security issues.

The strategy rightly defines security as a top priority of our external action. This need for increased security both internally and externally is strongly felt by our citizens.

The context of Brexit is terribly complex, and this forces us to implement these strategies as quickly as possible through concrete actions that will enable us to realis our regional ambitions as well as our security and defence projects. We have a collective responsibility to our partners, and in particular - I would like to stress this point - to enlargement.

There is much in this strategy which Socialists and Democrats strongly welcome. There is no acceptance of a relative decline in Europe, but rather an understanding that, in a changing world, Europe itself must change to uphold our interests and our influence. That is the importance of the concept of strategic autonomy. It means that soft power may not on its own be enough, but the power of soft power should not be underestimated in the quest to prevent and overcome conflict: by being more than just a security strategy, this strategy may be more effective in making us all more secure. It means that it is a global strategy – because Europe does have global interests – and it is right that we address the tensions on the Korean peninsula or support for the Columbia peace process, as well as the problems of our immediate neighbourhood. It means that in defence, as in other things, European cooperation really does not have to mean loss of sovereignty. The Socialists and Democrats welcome the commitment to making the sustainable development goals a cornerstone of EU external policy and to upholding the concept of decent work in Europe and outside it.

I am pleased that Russia and its relations with it have been described in this document as a 'key strategic challenge', although a number of countries would like to continue to use the phrase 'strategic partner' that was used against Russia even before the annexation of Crimea. This document also rightly states that the Union is no longer enough just to exploit the potential of soft power, that military force is also needed. Europeans really need to take more responsibility for their security and have the appropriate military capabilities to respond to an external threat that we know is great. And of course it must be taken into account that NATO is the fundamental pillar of defence for many of us – perhaps for all – as the document explicitly confirms. The Union should further deepen its cooperation with NATO, seeking synergies and focusing primarily on what it does best: strategic civilian projects that are important for enhancing the Union's and NATO's defences.

You just said, \"Give me the priorities.\" They are very clear to us. You often talk about cross-border crime and terrorism in your note, and you say that the challenges for this are too great for one European country. But nowhere do you advocate a single service to combat terrorism and crime. Nowhere are you advocating for a single European intelligence service.

I think that every intervention here today in the hemisphere has played into that defence union.

Mr Tony Blair, the abbot of a NATO member country with whom you are working, invaded Iraq in search of a chemical bottle, resulting in perhaps 500,000 deaths since then.

Mr President, the european Union's new global strategy, in the midst of fierce opposition, aims to upgrade its military involvement in imperialist wars for the interests of European monopolistic groups. On this basis, your once strategic business partners, such as Russia, are now turning from strategic partners into a strategic challenge. So leave the pretences for refugees and traffickers.  The third phase of your operation \"Sophia\" and with the NATO partnership, is nothing more than your new intervention in Libya. It is a threat to the people to strengthen cooperation between the European Union and NATO, despite the competition sparked by Brexit.

So all the keywords are there, but the challenge will be to turn them into actions. The two obstacles that present themselves to us today are well known. On the one hand, of course, there are the Member States and their political will to move forward - this is an inescapable fact in a policy that remains largely intergovernmental. But we must also admit that there is a second obstacle, linked to the very heaviness of the European institutions. We will still have to move forward and be much more efficient and pragmatic. I take a few examples such as this famous \"Train and equip\" programme that has been talked about since 2013, since the European summit in 2013. We are now reaching a solution. It took three years to overcome legal burdens in the European Commission. This is not acceptable for a program that is a real added value in today's world. With regard to research and defence budgets, we will come up with something that will certainly fall short of the original ambitions. We will do everything we can to maintain a decent and efficient envelope, but we are also falling far behind on things that seem obvious if we are to acquire this strategic autonomy. Finally, there is the implementation of regional, sectoral and thematic strategies, and you come back to this point in this comprehensive strategy.

In other words, the stronger the services at national level, the higher the level of security in Europe will be.

We know that this strategy is the result of intense consultation. In recent times, terrorist attacks and conflicts have really shown us that we need a new comprehensive EU foreign and security policy strategy more than ever. I would like to highlight two things and two challenges. The two elements: first, cooperation with regional organizations. Whether in our neighbourhood or in relations with African countries, regional organizations and cooperation are tools to better achieve our peace and security goals. In many cases, if we invest in strengthening these organizations and promote regional integration, we can reduce the asymmetry of our relationships and enshrine them in real win-win partnerships. I note, by the way, the desire to cooperate more with the Union for the Mediterranean on security issues. Very well! Member States must follow suit. The second positive element is the risk of joining several areas of insecurity and instability. As I have stressed on several occasions, we must anticipate this type of dynamic also linked to hybrid security threats, notably between West Africa, the Sahel and the Horn of Africa, or between the Sahel and Central Africa.  Today, I see two challenges: on the one hand, it is about credibility in action. What is our credibility? It is to trigger all our prevention and sanctions instruments on time, to have defence capabilities consistent with our objectives, to respect ourselves the rules on which relations between our Member States and third countries are based and, finally, to speak with one voice. This brings me to my last point, the full adherence of The Member States to this strategy.

The problem is that governments, in the intergovernmental drift that has been affecting the Union, are deceitable in recognizing it. Soft power is not enough, Mrs Mogherini stressed here today. Oh, no, no, no That is why the Union must also strengthen strategic autonomy in defence and security capabilities by articulating resources and policies to ensure civilian and military resilience with means of rapid and coordinated response to the ongoing crises here in Libya to a possible crisis in the China Sea with a global stabilising impact.

I am convinced that together we are much stronger than separately. In these days when many of us are wondering about policies where a better Europe is needed, I would like to remind you that, according to recent surveys, foreign policy is an area in which most European citizens agree that the Union must play a more active role. This is striking, but it is. And, for this, what is needed first is political will — as has already been said – also to make proper use of the resources and instruments at our own and that strategic vision, and fortunately with its document it will be easier for us to profile that strategy. After brexit, I don't think it's time to be standing, in any way. More importantly, I believe that it may be easier to move forward on some blocked elements to date and put in place mechanisms already envisaged in the Treaties. I am thinking of the specific area of defence, to which they referred so much this afternoon, and even — why not?— in the so-called permanent structured cooperation. If we want to be a global actor, effective, then..., soft power is important, but it doesn't come, as has been said here this afternoon repeatedly.

We have to abandon the idea of a europe that was folded in itself, frightened, and we want a leading Europe, as Pope Francis himself reminded us here almost two years ago.

If the central element of the future strategy is cooperation, whether defensive or proactive, then we already need some clear words. There is, after all, a philosophy which worries me and convinces me little, based on excessive realism which, with a view to a shared process of global security and stabilisation, seems to give up the urgent need to relaunch the process of democratisation and the extension of rights.

The second key thing: we have almost everything in this document, that is very good, but there is a lack of a certain hierarchy of values of problems in this message. It seems to me that to say that all issues are identically important is a kind of mistake, perhaps not very serious, but nevertheless a mistake. Secondly, of course, we are all convinced that Europe's security is energy security, cybersecurity, financial, economic and social security. It seems to me that Europe's social condition is worse than it should be. This is due to several elements, but I will say one thing, because for me it is crucial. We should remember that solidarity in Europe must be based on respect for diversity and sovereignty, but at the same time those who fight for sovereignty must constantly suggest that sovereignty must not reduce internal solidarity in Europe. The social condition must also be conditioned by a third element – good information, the fight against propaganda and a good presentation of these achievements, which undoubtedly belong to parliament, parliamentary institutions, European institutions.

Mr President, good and evil has created the need to have a common European policy on foreign security and defence policy.  Firstly, after Brexit, the UK will only contribute to defence and security issues through NATO and we may find ourselves uncovered on issues of great European importance.  Secondly, with the US covering almost three quarters of NATO's total defence spending, it is clear that European countries need to undertake, to undertake, greater obligations. There's no free defense.  Thirdly, previous interventions, such as the invasion of British troops in Iraq, which is currently in the news because of the investigation into this matter, have taken place without a global or European view of things and have resulted in political failure and the creation of an endless flow of refugees and migrants, which also creates the problems we are discussing between us.  Fourthly, the enlargement of the European Union to Central and Eastern Europe, the Baltic states and the Nordic countries provokes a negative reaction from Russia. With the latter we do not want a rivalry, but we do not want to give it an appetite, because we lack a common European policy on external issues, security and defence.  Fifthly, we are faced with new threats, from Islamic terrorism to so-called 'frozen conflicts' and these must be tackled at European level so that there are no unpleasant developments.

It is becoming increasingly difficult for individual states to resist them on their own. There is no doubt that the European Union's common security and defence policy is becoming a priority. If only because a community of half a billion people has exceptional economic, military, and cultural-historical potential. It is a force that can rely on the millennial tradition of Euro-Atlantic civilization. Mrs Mogherini's report defines the fundamental risks to Europe today in a balanced and diplomatic way. In general, it stresses that the EU will promote peace and guarantee the security of its citizens and its territory. This means that Europeans working with their partners must have the necessary tools to defend themselves. Mindful of the risks facing the European Union, the High Representative's report stresses that 'the European project, which has brought unprecedented peace, prosperity and democracy, is being put to the test'. I agree, High Representative, and I assume that the current dangers will escalate. Therefore, it is imperative to stratify them and call them by their real names.

This is also, as you said, a concrete result of the work that sometimes we do silently but with good outcomes so I am glad to see you here. Let me touch upon a few points you raised. I have noticed an overwhelming feeling of ownership in this House. That is something good on which I count because, as some of you mentioned, this has been collective work that now acquires a collective follow-up to make sure that we move from the vision into action. First of all, some asked whether we stress more the values or the interests, and whether we define more as an important element of our action in the future our values or our interests. The ground of the strategy, the clear indication of the strategy, is that our values and our interests coincide very much. There is one element in our values that the strategy underlines, which is that, to make our action consistent, we have to be true to our values first of all in our internal policies, and in our own behaviour, and this is something that echoes also some of the elements that some of you underlined. Any global strategy starts at home and any external credibility is rooted in our internal strength. This is why, in these difficult moments for the European Union, it is so important that we think of our common responsibilities towards our citizens and towards the rest of the world. Second, as I was saying, values and interests coincide here. Think of the resilience that is so much at the centre of our strategy, as was mentioned in the first intervention. Resilience of societies around us is indeed an investment in our own security, and when we mention resilience of societies in the strategy we do not mention the strength of institutions only, but we mention the resilience of societies as such, which includes the space for civil society, human rights defenders and the place for every citizen in their own society. Is this responding to our values only, or is this also responding to our interests? I believe, and the strategy reflects this common indication, that in this case, as well as many other cases, following our values also responds to our interests and we would be making a mistake if we were to put this in contradiction. Third, I would like to refer to one point that a couple of you raised, one in a negative sense, and another one, Mr Danjean, in a positive one, on the so-called ‘train and equip’ or capacity-building in Security and Development. It is true it took us three years to come to that. Yesterday the College as you might know adopted the package on capacity building on Security and Development, and let me tell you very clearly: this is not at all a diversion of our development tools into a security or military approach. On the contrary, this is a response to what, especially our African friends, not only governments and institutions, but also civil society, are telling us, that if in a territory, be it in the Sahel, be it in Nigeria, be it in the Horn of Africa, if you have a lack of basic security conditions for the populations, you can do all the development you want but, first of all, it does not get there, and second, it is not effective at all because the first basic right to security has also to be guaranteed. This does not mean that again we are diverting resources from one chapter to the other. This simply says that we need to use our resources in a coherent way and respond to the needs of the populations we are working with, and all the messages we are getting are in the sense that we need to also work on security as we continue to work on development. We always say there is no security without development, but there is no development without security. It is now also a matter of turning this into practice, so that is why I think that the package we adopted yesterday is something that is going to be extremely important in our capacity to implement also part of the strategy, using our different instruments, keeping in mind that they are different and covering different areas but in a coherent and integrated way. I received a specific question on part of the strategy that refers to the fact that Member States can be asked or tasked to actively contribute to specific common foreign policies that are determined all together. It is a part of the strategy that was carefully thought of, as you can imagine, and it responds to the fact that, on one side, we need to keep the unity not only of the 28 Member States, but also the different institutions, including this Parliament, and this is what is done in the framework of the common institutions, but there might be occasions where we might want or we might need or we might want to encourage one or a group of Member States or – why not? – some parliamentary delegations, to complement the work that we do all together. There can be specific added value that one or the other can bring. The important thing is that this is done in a coordinated manner with a clear, transparent link to common decisions and with common approaches and reporting back to the common instances. So I would never be afraid of initiatives, whether they are from parliamentary delegations or from a group of Member States, or a group of Commissioners that I lead quite often in our partner countries or in other countries. The important thing is that all of this is in a common framework and towards a common goal. We do not have to be afraid of our added value, even when it is a partial one. The important thing is that this is part of a coherent and concerted policy. Here I come to the basic needs we have now and many of you mentioned that. The basic need we have now is to guarantee that the European citizens are guaranteed their right to security, and this requires the European Union to act as a European Union, united. There is one thing that I would not follow, one suggestion I would not follow, that one of you mentioned in your intervention – it was not mentioned in the English language, but you said there is the need to take more into account opinions that are contrary, that are opposed to working more together. You have to listen to those who say ‘the European way is not the way’. I am sorry but I am not going to hear those voices in this field because if there is one field where it is self-evident that the security of the European citizens require European action, it is our work in the world. There is no single field in our external action where one Member State alone, whether it is the biggest, the strongest, the richest, the smallest, is more effective alone than all together. There is not one single thing, be it counter-terrorism, be it trade, be it development, be it migration management, there is not one single issue where we are stronger alone than stronger together. And I believe our citizens in this field see it very clearly. Threats are global, opportunities are global, all of our countries, compared to the rest of the countries in the world, are small-sized countries, at the maximum medium-sized countries. We are not living in the era of empires anymore, not for a couple of centuries. And we have to wake up to reality. Our strength is our European Union in the world, and our partners around the world see it very clearly and recognise our strengths in the world. What we sometimes do not do is recognise this strength inside our Union, but we have to come out of this sort of depression we have entered and make use of our strength, because you can be strong, but if you know you are strong you do not use your strength and it is useless. So I hope that we can indeed, as some of you said, use a strategy to turn our common vision and action into those of a self-confident, global player. I think this is the basic thing we have to do now. I have noted that some of you said that this strategy is too ambitious and unrealistic. Others have said it is too realistic and not ambitious enough. We need both. We need both realism and ambition, also because we see these days that things change, internally and externally. Things change in a way that was unforeseeable just a few months or years ago. The point here is whether we want to react to a change that is produced somewhere else, or if we are confident enough to try and shape the change that is happening around us, and I believe that we have all the tools, all the strength if we have the political will to do it exactly as our citizens have an interest in us doing this.

I know very well that there is a widespread feeling that things will never change in Israel and Palestine and some say there are more urgent crises to deal with. Others think the current leaderships are not up to the task. Personally, I have always believed that we have a duty to keep working for positive change with patience and courage, and a precise interest in doing so. I know that Parliament shares this view. You have shown it by hosting, just a couple of weeks ago, President Rivlin and President Abbas in the Chamber in Brussels. One reason why we have a duty to keep working for positive change, and an interest in doing so, is that the status quo cannot hold, and actually there is no status quo. If things do not change for the better, they can only get worse. Another reason is the regional context. The other crisis in the region – the spread of terrorism – makes it even more urgent to restart some kind of political process. A new war in the Holy Land could have horrific consequences in the entire region and we do not want to see Daesh take root in Israel or in Palestine. Peace now – or at least a process for peace now – is more urgent than it has ever been. I know this Parliament shares the same sense of urgency. The French initiative was spurred in part by your willingness to restart a credible peace process. For exactly the same reason we decided to revive the Middle East Quartet about a year ago and to work on the report that we presented on 1 July. It is a report on the main threats to the two—state solution, with clear recommendations on the steps needed to rebuild the conditions for meaningful direct negotiations. We all know that the situation on the ground in Israel and Palestine is deteriorating. The viability of a two-state solution is challenged on a daily basis. People are dying on both sides – almost on a daily basis – and with them hope is also dying. Children are dying and children are being killed. Unless we do something to reverse the negative trends, this conflict could get out of control and the very chance of peace would slip away. We simply cannot afford further escalation. We cannot afford further escalation, the Israelis cannot afford further escalation, and the Palestinians, and the entire region, cannot afford further escalation. This is why we issued the report. It was a lengthy process but, as you might have seen, the report is a long, dense text that brings the international community together on substance and in some detail. The report is about our common goal in the international community, which is to start a process and to stop and reverse the negative trends we have seen, to rebuild trust and to advance the two-state solution on the ground in order to create the conditions for peace. We are seeing those conditions slipping away at the moment. The report is a result of complex, collective work and is an integral part of a broader international effort. The report stresses the importance of the Arab Peace Initiative and the opportunity for building a regional security framework. Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, as well as the League of Arab States, are essential for peace and, for the first time ever, the Arab countries can actually represent an opportunity for, rather than a threat to, Israel’s security. We must not waste this historic opportunity. Above of all, Israel must not waste this opportunity. We are also working closely with France in the same direction and towards the same goal. Let me thank President François Hollande and Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault for their great commitment and for our close coordination in these weeks. Our Union and the Quartet have welcomed the communiqué issued in Paris and its support for a negotiated two-state solution. I was myself at a conference in Paris at the beginning of June. All our initiatives can – and must – proceed hand in hand, coherently and in full coordination. Together we can pave the way for a return to meaningful direct talks because this is the ultimate goal of the report. Let me be very clear on what the report is. I will start with what the report is not. It is not a document on what the final status should look like or on parameters for final status negotiations and it is not a legal assessment of the situation under international law. Let me state clearly that the European position on this is very clear and has not changed. What is the report? The report seeks to indicate a way forward, with concrete actions to be taken. It is an attempt, first of all, to save the two—state solution. We had a debate here, in this Chamber – a couple of months ago, I believe – on the fact that the two—state solution is fading away. So, first and foremost, we have to make the option of a two—state solution still possible – something about which all of us have serious doubts if the trends continue this way. How? By setting out affirmative measures on the ground to reverse negative trends, to rebuild trust between the sides and to recreate a political horizon. I remember very well that this was exactly the goal we defined for ourselves, as the European Union, the first time we debated the issue in this Chamber at the start of the new term of this Parliament. The report identifies three main trends that are putting at risk the two—state solution and that need to be reversed. The first is the trend towards violence and incitement. The report clearly identifies Hamas as responsible for the most explicit and widespread forms of incitement, but it is also a fact that some Fatah members have failed to condemn specific attacks. The report also refers to the actions of the Israeli authorities: an expansive use of administrative detention, punitive home demolitions, closures of whole districts and the use of excessive force when there was no imminent threat. Second, the settlements: for the first time ever, all Quartet members have agreed to look at the settlement issue in a much broader and deeper context. We focus not just on the construction and expansion of settlements but also on the designation of land for exclusive Israeli use, the high rate of demolitions and the denial of Palestinian development in Area C. This is the first time this has been done by the Quartet as such. This set of negative trends on the ground in Area C is steadily eroding the viability of the two—state solution and we clearly say this. The legitimate questions in the international community and in the region about Israel’s long—term intentions are also raised. Thirdly, there is the situation in Gaza. The report not only addresses the dire humanitarian situation – and let me remind all of us that the European Union has delivered on all the pledges we made at the conference in Cairo two years ago on reconstruction in Gaza – but we also focus on something that goes beyond the humanitarian situation. Both the continuing military build—up by Hamas and the lack of Palestinian unity damage prospects for economic development and efforts towards a negotiated solution. So, analysing the situation on the ground was the first step, and you will find in the report things you have not seen said by the Quartet as such ever before. But the analysis of the situation on the ground is only a first step because we have also issued clear common recommendations on actions to be taken on the ground. These are steps on which the whole international community agrees – the European Union, the United States, Russia and the United Nations. First, decisive action is urgently needed to reverse the negative trends we have described. The parties must work to de—escalate tensions and maintain security cooperation. Palestinians must strengthen efforts to combat terrorism and incitement to violence. The Israeli policy of settlement construction and expansion has to come to an end. Second, the two—state solution needs to be created on the ground. The Palestinians must be able to take control of their lives and to build a future, including in Area C. In Gaza all militant activity must end. Israel should accelerate the lifting of the restrictions of movement to and from Gaza with due consideration for its security. The Palestinians should unify, based on the PLO platform and on democracy, for the benefit of their own people. The third element of the recommendations – you will find 10 recommendations in the report but I will not go through them all – is key. It is that the primary responsibility for peace obviously lies in the hands of the Israeli and the Palestinian leaders. Peace cannot be imposed upon them and only direct negotiations can lead to a solid solution, but the region also has a central role to play. So we strongly encourage further dialogue in the context of the Arab Peace Initiative and its vision for a comprehensive peace because it is very clear that are two overlapping conflicts there that need to be resolved, possibly together: the one between Israel and Palestine and the one that is still creating tensions between Israel and the Arab world. The report was presented a few days ago. We have seen the first reactions. We fully expected some criticism from the parties and, in fact, that is only natural because the report challenges the prevailing narratives on both sides. We are telling the Israelis and we are telling the Palestinians – and we are doing this together for the first time ever – that there are many things each side can do, and should do, independently to demonstrate genuine commitment to the two-state solution. And this is essential to lay the ground for successful direct negotiations. Perhaps the most important thing right now is, as we discussed in relation to the global strategy, the follow-up: that both sides engage with the Quartet and use this opportunity to advance and to stop trends that might destroy both peoples. All international initiatives can play a role, and it is vital to keep a united international front and a united region connected with the international front we have built. That is why the Quartet envoys have worked throughout recent months in close cooperation and close connection especially with the initiators and the key players of the Arab Peace Initiative, because we need to revive that and operationalise it, together with them, and with the united European Union at its core.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2811, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Mariya Gabriel", "mepid": "96848", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Mr President, Madam High Representative, I would once again like to acknowledge the personal commitment you have shown since the beginning of your mandate on the Middle East peace process. Despite the difficulties, this is a new lease of life in the Union's commitment to this issue, particularly in view of the difficulties and regional and global issues. The Quartet has issued its report. I too would like to make four remarks on this occasion. First, I would like to welcome the approach taken and the correctness of the recommendations made. They provide a necessary and concrete basis for establishing a minimum climate of trust and appeasement with clear objectives for a real resumption of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities. It is not enough for both sides to affirm their commitment to peace; concrete action is now needed to support the process. My second point is about the role of other countries in the region. As we know, this role can be double-edged, but on specific issues, which are conducive to creating conditions for a resumption of negotiations, the Quartet may be able to reflect and make recommendations. Third, I think there is also a clear signal for young people. On both sides, there is a youth growing in insecurity amid incitement to violence and hatred. Here, the European Union can give young people concrete opportunities to understand that there are other options, other means and another future for their country. All the projects that promote the mobility of these young people contribute, I hope, to the goal of peace. Finally, as the European Union, we understand the pain caused to every new victim of this conflict. We are trying to understand the Israeli and Palestinian views and demands. I believe that the parties to the conflict, through follow-up, could also show us that they understand our concerns - the concerns of the European Union and neighbouring countries - because even though we know that the resolution of the conflict will not lead to a solution to all the problems in the Mediterranean region, we are also aware that a number of deadlocks and the lack of integration of the region are linked to this conflict.

I will invite all my colleagues – even those who speak without reading it – to read it carefully because the report wisely points out most of the difficulties we are facing today when it comes to re-launching negotiations on the Middle East peace process. The proof is that since Friday we have heard criticism from both sides and it is impossible for it to be both right and wrong at the same time. I also share your concern that continuing in the current impasse will make the prospect of the two—state solution remote, although that is the only outcome for achieving an enduring peace that meets both Israeli and Palestinian needs and aspirations. Therefore, our Group is committed to supporting all realistic peace initiatives, including the Arab Peace Initiative, which seems to be welcomed the most by all sides. We fully support your assessment of the situation and, while condemning all incitement and violence on the ground, it is important to keep in mind that there are not many Palestinians and Israelis today who still nourish the hope of a solution in the near future. There are not many young Palestinians today who still hope for a better life and opportunities in their countries. This is particularly worrying in Gaza, where the dire humanitarian situation is making everyday life so difficult for many human beings. This is an alarming fact that can only fuel further violence and exacerbate the conflict.

The problem with any debate and conversation about the Middle East peace process is that one very often lapses into positions pro Palestine, against Israel, or vice versa. But a war of propositions has never led to a solution. My party also believes in a two-state solution. And yes, to make such a solution viable, both camps will have to leave their trenches. For example, it is true that Israel's settlement policy undermines the prospect of a two-state solution. Israel's new construction plans in the West Bank, announced yesterday, are already not helping the peace process to progress by a millimetre. Nly more than the continuing rivalry, violence, extremism and corruption on the Palestinian side. Many wonder whether peace can ever be achieved if both societies are so war-oriented. The European Union remains committed to lasting peace. I appreciate your efforts, Mrs Mogherini, to revive the peace talks and the peace process.

Less than 24 hours before the report was published, the Palestinians carried out two terror attacks, and violence against civilians continues on the Israeli side. In response to the violence, the Israeli government is promoting the construction of more than 800 homes in settlements. And yet, Mrs Mogherini, my group and I continue to believe in a two-state solution. That is why we continue to push for a negotiated solution. Yes, we believe that there must be Palestinian unity and that reconciliation is needed. And yes, we believe that Israel should stop building illegal settlements. And yes, we believe that the Palestinian anti-terrorist units can perform even better and that security cooperation with Israel is important. Both sides say they want a two-state solution. We, as a Europe, under your expert leadership, must continue to work for this solution. We have to keep our commitment. I would therefore like to stress that the quartet's report is an important step forward. It identifies the threats to peace, the ongoing violence, the settlements and the governance in Gaza. And the quartet is also drawing up runs to reach effective status negotiations. Mrs Mogherini, I am very concerned about one thing. The Knesset will normally adopt an NGO law next week, cataloguing ngos receiving money from abroad and having to make a statement. This will greatly hinder many aid workers and lead to a limited freedom of expression. That's why I'm appealing to you. Should I ask you to insist and express your concern to Israel about the adoption of that NGO law. Can you also urge Israel to transfer its powers to the Palestinian Authority in Zone C, and finally, you can also call for Palestinian reconciliation, based on the principles of the quartet.

Indeed, this latest quartet report acknowledges this: Israel must already cease its policy of building and expanding settler settlements. Israel and Palestine cannot, of course, negotiate on an equal footing, it cannot be equated to occupying and busy, and that is why I call on you in particular, as High Representative, to be really involved in the search for a solution to end almost half a century of occupation and colonization.

They asked the kidnapper to treat her with more respect in the future and they pay for the broken window and provide the girl with food and medicine as she stays hostage. This sounds absurd does it not? Well, this is exactly what the EU is doing towards the occupation of Palestine. Staying silent about violations of international law, balancing, beyond absurdity, responsibilities of the acts of the occupier and of the occupied, subsidising Israeli occupation through its assistance to the Palestinian people and allowing the Israeli army to destroy EU-funded projects. Ms Mogherini, why did you co-sign a quarterly report which does not include a single reference to international humanitarian and human rights law? Why is the fight against impunity missing? What about cooperation with the UN and the ICC? Why not one word about the separation wall? Why is your report ignoring the growing attack against civil society, and in particular, as I mentioned before, the Israeli NGO bill? There will be no peace without societies on both sides ready to accept that peace is better than conflict. The NGO bill which is about to be adopted by the Knesset will profoundly damage Israeli democracy and undermine the few remaining partners for peace in Israel. This report, sorry to say, is shameful.

Tension and hatred are still at critical levels: on the one hand, while acknowledging the efforts of the Palestinian authorities, which have led to a decline in the frequency of attacks, it must also be remembered that even today their perpetrators are glorified as martyrs; on the other hand, Israel, with massive punitive demolitions, aggressive settlement expansion, insufficient reaction to Israeli ideological extremism and restrictions on freedom of movement and beyond, is still an obstacle to peace.  The Quartet puts all this in black and white, which is a useful piece on the way to peace. But we must make real progress on the part of both sides, and conscience and justice require me to stress, as Saeb Erekat also said, that the responsibilities of an occupying power cannot be equated with those of an occupied country. Without prejudice to Palestinian responsibilities, the current Israeli Government is not making every effort to relaunch the peace process.

Mr President, I would like to point out a number of facts which the European Parliament seems to be ignoring. This is not an Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but an Arab-Israeli conflict. Indeed, Israel, the only democratic country and the only national state in this region, faces states that are not democratic, states that are often racist, religious, which is not Israel. In Israel, there are 20% of Israeli Muslim citizens. Most Arab-Muslim countries use the Palestinian cause and push it to radicalism, only to destabilize Israel. The situation of abandonment of Palestinian refugees is, above all, a testimony to the indifference of arab countries to the condition of the Palestinians, who are their brothers, because what interests them is not the aid to the Palestinians, which is essentially provided by Europe, but the search for the destabilization of Israel by their propaganda and also - it must be said - by the hatred of the elected Jewish people. Hatred of Israel is confused with hatred of our Judeo-Christian values in countries subject to political Islam and also, now, in our cities. Your pro-Palestinian options are equivalent, in diplomacy, to the so-called reasonable accommodations under which we force our nations to practice, with political Islam, an impossible alliance with our states of religious freedom. This is how we have communitarianism, an expression of political Islam, in our streets, at home. You allow yourself to criticize a legitimate Israeli government that is fighting for its survival. Many of us are even willing to negotiate his safety, but you will not succeed. And it is a grave mistake to consider that two States will allow this peace, for it will then be Israel's suicide. Survival is politics, that is the very reason for politics, and I absolutely understand Israel's survival position, which should also be the policy we must adopt.

And when some say it is not beating Israel enough – Israel is a democracy, even in terms of NGO law. They could not even discuss the Law of the NGO with Hamas in Gaza. In Israel, they can discuss it. I am also against the law, but there should be a slight difference in terms of quality. We must ensure , as the report rightly says , that the Palestinians should help the Palestinian Authority to establish the political unity of the Palestinian territory, including the Gaza Strip. This includes criticism of the settlement areas and, in particular, of the Israelis' refusal of opportunities in zone C. That is important! And it is important that, in this context, we also discuss how we strengthen the Quartet, how the European Union can play a stronger role here and how the French proposal is included here. But this must be broadened accordingly and must not be regarded as a French proposal alone when such a conference is made. I also think it is important that the proposals of the 2002 Arab Initiative are taken forward, that cooperation should be promoted here, particularly with Egypt, which, incidentally, is doing an excellent job in preventing arms supplies to Hamas, and Saudi Arabia.

Israel must understand that the suffocating and attempt to humiliate the people of Palestine, but also the cruel and excessive violence, for which I have personal experience because I have experienced all three wars since the second Intifada in Gaza, provide fertile ground for Hamas and any other terrorist organisation. It is the European Union and the United Nations that have an obligation to apply law and democracy without divergence. The two-state solution with an independent, democratic, secular and viable Palestinian state comprising the entire West Bank and Gaza, with a road link between the two regions, and with its own economic exclusive zone is the aim, while at the same time recognising the State of Israel from the Arab States and eliminating any attempt to wipe it out.

Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, it is not enough to make declarations and wishes for peace to prevail. In order for the peace process to proceed, Israel must lift the occupation, stop the settlement and displacement of the populations, release the Palestinians it arbitrarily imprisoned and respect all the rights of the Palestinians.  Unfortunately, the Quartet's recent report does not help in this direction because it boldly seeks to maintain equal distances. However, the conqueror cannot be equated with the people under military occupation. Today, Israeli occupying forces and the more than 570,000 settlers living in the occupied Palestinian territories are abusing the land of the Palestinian people and violating their human rights and fundamental freedoms every day.  The report rightly states that settlements, demolitions of houses and seizures of land by Israel undermine the viability of the two-state solution. But it is shameful and unacceptable that the Palestinian resistance should be put on the same scale and that the Palestinians should be criticised. Enough complicity, enough impunity!  The European Union and the international community must stop denying their responsibilities and put the necessary pressure on Israel to commit itself immediately to a roadmap for peace leading to the establishment of a Palestinian people on the 1967 border with East Jerusalem as its capital.

In other words, he should not side with one of the two warring parties, but try to play a mediating role. It has great potential to make a significant contribution to solving the problem.

I understand very well that in this Parliament, as in any other parliament in our Member States, as sometimes in the Council, we go back to stating and restating positions. My job is a different one. My job is not to tell you my personal opinion on who is right and who is wrong, who is most responsible or less responsible. My job is to try and create a space for the peace process to restart. So all the comments I have heard are something that is obviously part of our common European position, but let me tell you that my priority is that difficult exercise of creating a little bit of space for confidence to restart, or for the sides to talk, simply, which is, let me tell you, more difficult than saying: you are guilty! Or you are guilty!  Having said that, what do we do to create conditions that are a little bit better on the ground? On the ground: because we are seeing people dying on both sides and what worries me – one of you mentioned this – is that we are seeing generations that are being killed, that are killing, and that are being raised in the absence of peace and in the absence of any reason for peace. Those generations, on both sides, do not even have the language of peace anymore and that is what we have to try and invest in.  So let me express my appreciation of the role of Parliament in this respect. I will make good use of the offers you are making me to use this Parliament and the energy of this Parliament to push and mobilise and get in touch with parliamentarians and civil society and actors in the region and among the parties. We will continue to work in these ways: with the parties because they have the primary responsibility for making peace; with the societies in the parties, not only with the leaderships, because we have to create the ground for peace among the people; with the region, starting with the countries that have a direct stake in the solution of the conflict – Egypt, Jordan but also Saudi Arabia and the Arab League, the Arab Peace Initiative; and with the international community at large through the Quartet, playing our role in full.  Some of you mentioned the fact that we did not wait for the US elections to take place before issuing the report – before working on the report, before having the report. This is very much because we have clearly said as a European Union that we cannot take a sabbatical year at this time and the regional situation is making it more urgent, not less urgent, to tackle this crisis.

First of all, Madam President, let me say that I am glad that after discussing earlier on the global strategy we now move to our EU strategy on China. Some of you might wonder why we are working on so many different strategies or new strategies, and this is for a very simple reason. The world has changed and is changing very rapidly. For us as Europeans, isolation is not an option and our action cannot be fragmented, cannot be unstrategic so we need to either update or to develop common visions and common paths for action that are in connection with the reality of today. Our last communication on China dated back 10 years, so it was clearly time to come back to this because China has changed and also the European Union and the world has changed. Clearly our relationship with China, one of the world’s great powers, is a crucial issue for our future but actually it is a crucial issue for our present. Next week we will be in Beijing for the EU-China summit and a number of important China-related matters will need to be addressed in the coming weeks and months. This Parliament knows very well, as the two most recent resolutions on China have shown, we are now in a different place compared with 10 years ago. First and foremost, China is much more of a global player than it was a decade ago. It is more confident, more outward-looking and more assertive. This new attitude has created some frictions and we all know that. Asia’s security environment today looks more unstable than a few years ago but China has also sought stronger cooperation with other world powers, including with the European Union on many different global issues. We have an interest in an open, stable and cooperative China, but China too has an interest – a huge interest – in good relations with Europe. We are their biggest trading partner, and we are an important security provider in Asia, from Afghanistan to the Philippines, so we have a lot to discuss, and we have a lot on which we can and should work together. There is no doubt we need to step up our engagement with China and this is the core principle of our strategy. European Union engagement with China will be principled, practical and pragmatic. Only if we engage will we be able to safeguard our interests and also our values in all sectors from trade to human rights. The communication identifies three main areas of cooperation and engagement. First, the prosperity and reform agenda; second, common interests on foreign policy and security; and third, global governance and the multilateral context. Let me start with the economy. When we talk about a prosperity and reform agenda, when we talk about promoting a greater opening-up of the Chinese market to European business, this is very much about creating jobs and growth in Europe. Trading and investing with China is first and foremost an opportunity for Europe and for European firms. This part of our work, internally and externally, linking up the work we do inside and outside of the European Union within the institutions is part of our work to strengthen and promote the European economy worldwide, and China is obviously a key actor in that respect. The strategy identifies opportunities such as concluding an ambitious and comprehensive agreement on investment, a Chinese contribution to the investment plan for Europe, joint research and innovation activities as well as creating new connections inside the Eurasian continent, both physical and digital, to make trade, investment and people-to-people contacts faster and easier. As we focus on the opportunities it does not mean that we do not see the risks of this new phase and we all know very well that we are heading towards a delicate moment in our trade relations. China is becoming a more integrated member of the global community and this means it has to accept the obligations and not simply the benefits of it. In the meantime, we must also make sure that we act to shield our industry from unfair trade practices. China must make significant and verifiable cuts in industrial overcapacity, notably in the steel sector, but also on aluminium, ceramics and wood-based products. This is something I have made clear in all my meetings with our Chinese counterparts including recently just last month in Brussels, and we will pass this message very strongly next week in Beijing too. It is first and foremost China’s economy which would benefit from economic reform, including the elimination of state-induced distortions. On our side we have to strengthen our trade defence instruments, in particular through the swift adoption of the Commission’s trade defence instruments modernisation proposal. In this moment of history we cannot afford to be a conservative force. We must adapt to change and most of all, we must drive the change or at least try to do that. We need better rules to serve our citizens’ interests and we can promote reforms through constant engagement with the wider world. Such reforms include the promotion of human rights, the rule of law and the role of civil society. This is the aim of our human rights dialogue with China and of the recently launched EU-China Legal Affairs dialogue, to support and accompany China’s legal reforms. I believe this kind of engagement can make both China and Europe stronger, richer and safer. This is very clear when we look at the second and third pillars of the communication. In our fragile world, insecurity and instability in East Asia can only spread to the rest of the world. The safety of maritime routes and the respect of international norms concerns the whole international community. So while our Union is not taking sides on specific territorial claims in the South China Sea, we have stated very clearly what our position is and that is based on our expectation of the full compliance with international norms, especially the role of UNCLOS and a peaceful solution of any disputes is what we expect, especially in the days ahead. China is also an essential player in other issues. I have witnessed first-hand the positive impact of China’s responsible engagement in the negotiations on Iran’s nuclear programme, and more – I think of Beijing’s role during the Paris conference on climate change compared with their attitude just a few years ago. China has an essential role to play in Afghanistan. We will work together on this also in view of the conference on Afghanistan we will have in Brussels in October. It is a relevant actor in Africa and in the Middle East. We work together in the international support group for Syria and in the UN framework, obviously, cooperation is strong. On climate action, on migration, on development aid, on all this the question is not whether we need to engage with China but rather, what is the best way to do so. A big part of the answer depends on our Union, on our unity and cohesion. None of our Member States has the size, nor the power to engage, be it in a trade negotiation or in a commercial dispute, with China, leaving alone stronger diplomatic efforts on China’s role in Asia or in the Pacific, but as a true union as a European Union as part of the global G3, as we are united we can surely do it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2854, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Frank Engel", "mepid": "96876", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Madam President, Madam High Representative, I would like to start by expressing our appreciation for the presentation of this strategy, because indeed, since the last ten years ago, much has changed here in China and between here and China. This presentation and strategy is therefore timely. Indeed, China is becoming a global player, and now the interaction we have with China is firmly encompassing all areas. In this house in this house, and this year more Members of the European Parliament will have participated in missions to China than they are currently in this room , which speaks volumes about both the presence in the room and the interaction with China at the parliamentary level. I would like to briefly address a few specific elements. I think our relations with China would benefit from being rigorously European. Ideally, the 16-1 format should be finished; we should also put an end to the so-called so-called strategic partnerships that each European city enters into with China and which ultimately have only the interest of China. We need more economic connections, big agreements, but also, of course, more access to the Chinese market. This is progress that we have been calling for for a very long time. I will not recall Parliament's position on China's market economy status.

The last document of this kind dates back to 2006. As you have just mentioned, Madam High Representative, many things have changed in these 10 years on both sides. China is today a key player in the international arena and a fundamental partner for the EU – with different views on many issues, of course, but there is no doubt that cooperation and coordination between the EU and China are fundamental for both. I welcome your call for EU action on China to be united and coherent, and I hope the Member States will finally be ready to practise it. Madam High Representative, you have shown the awareness of what the EU and China can do together, bilaterally but also in international fora – I am thinking of the G20 which will soon be hosted by China – but also on counterterrorism, cyber security, climate change and other reciprocal investment under the Juncker Plan and ‘one belt, one road’, where it will be necessary to address also the issue of protecting key critical infrastructure projects , including energy ones. And then we have to think of Africa, where the respective investment and development policies can be coordinated, the Iranian deal and peacekeeping in South Sudan or in the Gulf area fighting against piracy. Do not forget that one example where Europe and China can cooperate together is the fact that China is building up an emissions trading system (ETS) which is inspired by technical assistance from Europe or the fact that China has established three main courts in its intellectual property rights (IPR) project.

Madam High Representative, as rapporteur for Parliament's latest report on relations between the European Union and China, I very much welcome the Commission document. There was also an emphatic demand from academia, as I heard when I asked that world for advice on my report. In my opinion, academic expertise is also essential to get a clear picture of our current strategic partner. That means, the strategic partner China. After all, how else could you achieve a responsible European policy? On this basis, I am keeping you, but also myself and all of us, with an academic analysis that is current, which was published in the Dutch press last Saturday by a great china expert from leiden University. He said that we must be careful not to find chamberlain in the position of 1938. We must recognise that there are good developments towards a more prosperous country participating in globalisation, a country with empowered and smart citizens. But, he says, we also need to set very clear limits on a regime – and above all we need to think about that – that embraces a national socialist strategy.

The relationship must become more meaningful and I certainly hope this strategy will help. This year, no doubt, we will devote a lot of energy and attention to trade and investment with China, and we need to ensure that these are fair and rules-based. The Council and Commission must play their role to ensure the EU takes effective measures, in compliance with World Trade Organisation rules, in time to fight dumping and other unfair trade practices. For strategic and security reasons, too, it makes sense to engage with China. However, intensifying our engagement must never lead to turning a blind eye to human rights violations. Recent ideas and suggestions for further instrumentalising EU foreign policy to serve only the EU’s immediate interests are risky. This approach will backfire and it does not do justice to our history or our promise to strengthen people’s human rights universally and globally. Who will defend these rights if not Europe? This week, the UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution stressing that human rights must also apply on line. We need now to ensure that China lives up to this too, as people in China are increasingly feeling the lack of free expression and access to information on line. Mass censorship, and also the monitoring of internet users and hacking into their systems, are ongoing and are unacceptable. We must join the dots: where people are hindered from surfing on line on an open internet, EU businesses are effectively banned. Human rights violations and protectionism can be one and the same, and a trade-off between the two is, therefore, a race to the bottom. I have a few specific questions. How are we going to ensure that China will be more constructive when it comes to keeping the internet open, for example in internet governance forums? Is this an integral part of the strategy?

For the commitment to the universality of human rights should then include a similar commitment to the indivisibility of political and social human rights. The Commission would have stumbled across the contradiction so quickly that a positive agenda with a partner can only be developed together and cannot be tied to increased coordination with that partner's strongest antagonist. The Commission's general position on China's One Belt, One Road initiative is finally clear, clear and to be welcomed.

Since the EU established relations with the People's Republic of China more than 40 years ago, both partners have changed fundamentally. Much has also changed since a China strategy was last presented ten years ago. The European Strategy for China must reflect these changes. There is only one basic law that does not change: we are condemned to cooperation because we live together in an increasingly intertwined world and must tackle international problems together if we want to solve them at all. But this cooperation must certainly be shaped according to our values and interests. In the field of foreign policy, we note that China has not only the ambition to be an Asian hegemonic power, but also an increasingly clear ambition to become a globally dominant power that does not necessarily want to adhere to the principle of multilateralism, which is so valuable to us. There is a new tone in economic relations. There are more conflicts than we used to have – as has already been mentioned – and not every win-win proposal presented by the Chinese side is designed in such a way that the Chinese side does not end up winning twice if you are not careful. Here, too, we need to look again. As far as intellectual relations are concerned, I would say that this is the most difficult thing, because an anti-Western mood is spreading in China, and it is even actively promoting it.

I am referring to the systematic industrialised murder of prisoners of conscience and the harvesting of their organs for transplants. What is going on in China now is comparable to the Holocaust in Nazi Germany in its enormity and horror. The victims of this persecution are prisoners of conscience. They are not dangerous political opponents of the regime; they are democracy activists and followers of peaceful religions and philosophies.  A large proportion of these people are followers of Falun Gong, a traditional form of meditation that teaches truthfulness, compassion and tolerance. These virtues are, of course, completely intolerable to the Chinese Communist Party and threaten its very existence. Therefore, it has decided to exterminate these people while making a profit at the same time. What is going on in China would be unbelievable if it were not backed up by voluminous evidence gathered over a long period of time by impeccable sources. Falun Gong followers, Christians, democracy activists and others are arrested, sentenced for concocted crimes against the State and imprisoned. They are then murdered so that their organs can be used to supply the transplant industry. Unbelievably, some operations are done without anaesthetic, because this is apparently more effective for a successful transplant.  Since the year 2000, an estimated 1 million to 1.5 million have been killed for their organs in enforced organ harvesting. These enforced transplants are now proceeding at an estimated 60 000 to 100 000 operations per year, and are worth in the region of USD 8 to 9 billion per year.

And then a few thoughts on the consequences of Brexit: it seems to me that here there is an underestimation and a lack of consideration of effects that are visible at a glance on economic relations. We all know what influence Britain's presence in the European Union, which is more open to liberalisation and balanced by different interests of Germany, had in these relations. Do we want to think about that? Do we want to talk a little bit about our interests from this point of view as well? As far as our interests are concerned, I reiterate our total opposition to China's recognition of its role as a market economy! You have no right to receive this status. It would, among other things, be the condemnation of entire sectors of our production. We cannot talk about China without reiterating a strong emphasis on counterfeiting, which is an economic war on our production. These things need to be clearly talked about.

We must not destroy European industry to make China a superpower, creating millions of unemployed.  All our relations with China must be balanced and consistent with the condition of reciprocity.

There are no zero-sum approaches in today's society. China throughout this period has benefited from the existing international order and, given its growing international projection, China must also contribute to maintaining that stable and peaceful international order and respect the rules of international law, also on human rights.

Many of the challenges we face—climate change, sustainable development, international peace and security, failed states, and so on—will hardly overcome them without the Chinese competition.

We are without doubt global players and we should share responsibility for global governance and for global goods. I think China and the EU have to maintain peace, stability and development.

Parliament also called for the prosecution of people engaged in such criminal practices. Last month the US Congress strongly condemned the ongoing organ harvesting in China; and independent researchers have concluded that in one year up to 100 000 organ transplants are carried out. As there are practically no voluntary donors, the organs are taken from prisoners – predominantly prisoners of conscience. Thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of innocent people are being systematically killed to sell their organs for transplant to patients coming from the west. This amounts to crime against humanity.

This must, of course, be done for the benefit of the citizens of the Union. The Chinese industrial relations attempted by European multinationals should therefore be blocked in order to reduce costs by competing with Chinese companies.  Measures must also be taken to protect not only European small and medium-sized enterprises, but also the European steel industry, due to dumping and unfair Chinese trade practices. In addition, a barrier should be put in place for the sale instead of a lentil plate of strategic infrastructure of European countries to Chinese interests, as is the case with the sale of the port of Piraeus to Cosco.

Not only during the summit but also obviously in the meetings and talks we will have around the summit, which will also constitute an important part of our work. I also particularly appreciated the clarity of your comments on the challenges we are facing in our relations with China, and in particular when it comes to overcapacity, when it comes to human rights – and by the way, yes, I am pleased to be joined by Stavros for the incoming debate we are going to have now on human rights – but also as I said on overcapacity, on human rights, on market access and I would add an issue that few of you if none of you really pointed out, the issue of security in Asia, which is not a minor issue because it affects also, somehow, global stability and also our own security, and the issue of the South China Sea will be an important element of our discussions there. Obviously I also heard again the considerations of many of you on the market economy status, as you have seen this is not the main issue, it is not the issue of the strategy we discuss tonight, I know that you had occasion to exchange with Cecila Malmström very recently in this Hemicycle specifically on this, and I am sure that you will have soon occasions to do so again. It is obviously part of our work on China more than with China at this stage, but indeed it is central in our considerations. The joint communication aims the strategy at two things. First, being very honest and crystal clear on the challenges and difficulties we have in front of us in all these sectors – security, trade, especially market access and overcapacity and human rights – but also to create a common ground of the European Union on a positive and forward-looking basis for a collective engagement on the opportunities that we can and must seize in our relations with China. You all remembered and recalled the numbers, and if you look at the word, if you take the European Union united, it is us, it is us, the Chinese and the Americans working on the same level in terms of size, but on very different standards and this is the issue we have to work on, and this is what we are doing. So I get from the debate an overall support, quite an overwhelming support, for the strategy, for the fact that we do have a strategy and also for, and a final point here, the need to have a coordinated and well-orchestrated common action and common voice in our relations with China. I am sure that your activities as a Parliament vis-à-vis China, the many visits, again most of your colleagues might be there in this moment, but all the initiatives you have as European Parliament, as groups, as committees, will accompany us in, now, the implementation of this strategy and tackling the challenges in the most useful way for our European citizens and businesses and also helping us get the benefits of a relationship that is strategic for Europe – and also for China by the way.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2880, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "La Présidente. –", "mepid": "96952", "text": "   The debate is closed.

Today we are indeed touching upon the old spectrum of our foreign policies, priorities and instruments, so I am glad that we are also having our annual debate on human rights, which is an opportunity for me to present our annual report on human rights and democracy in the world. In a world that is clearly in turmoil, some believe that human rights can be a secondary concern, that we need first to focus on fire-fighting and crisis management and only then, afterwards, can we look at the human rights dimension – as if it was a luxury element that we can afford tackling only when the situation calms down.  We have seen how short—sighted this approach can be and our global strategy – and the European Union cannot be more explicit on this – is that for our European Union, investing in human rights is a matter of values, but it is also a matter of interests. There is no way in which we can make our societies strong and societies in our neighbourhood and in the world strong and resilient also to crises if we do not focus relentlessly on human rights. This is not a luxury. This is an investment in security and stability as well.  This is even more true as human rights and basic humanitarian principles are coming under increasing pressure. The space for civil society is shrinking in many parts of the world and very close to home as well. Constant violations are at the very root of each and every crisis we try to address in the international arena. They are behind a great deal of the migratory flows we are facing and behind the new peak in global displacement that was recorded this year by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. There is no viable crisis management, there is no crisis prevention if we do not address human rights violations properly.  The report provides a clear picture of all our human rights activities and we have strived to be focused on the areas in which our action was particularly prominent following last year’s suggestion from this Parliament. At times our work goes almost unnoticed by the wider public for years. Think of our teachers and aid workers fighting for everyone’s right to good schools and good education. Think of the men and women who challenge the culture of female genital mutilation in remote communities. They might not make the headlines in the international media, but such patient work is making so many people better off. Let me tell you that I appreciate this House recognising this kind of work constantly, in particular with the prizes you give. Every now and then results do come into the spotlight. Just months ago almost one hundred and fifty people from political parties and from civil society were pardoned in Azerbaijan – something that we have been working on for a long time and that is done. Such results owe much to the continuous dedication of our special representative for human rights, Stavros Lambrinidis, who I imagine you know well and who is with us today, and we can now count also on the work of Mara Marinaki, the first ever principal adviser fully dedicated to gender in the External Action Service.  In a very difficult year for human rights much work has been done and has brought some results. I think of our work on the reconciliation process in Myanmar. I think of our work on the peace deal between the Colombian government and the FARC. When we work with them we promote accountability, democracy, justice for the victims and real peace, which means real rights.  We have also focused on individual cases. Over 160 human rights defenders and their families have received support in 2015 through dedicated funding for human rights defenders at risk. You know how many statements we issue on this kind of cases and let me tell you that sometimes I personally feel a little bit of frustration about the statements because a statement does not change reality on the ground. But on the other hand, it is so important for the activists and the human rights defenders or the victims on the spot to see that the European Union speaks out for them and does not forget any single violation of human rights in the world. We know that this is also an essential part of our work and of our responsibility.  Beyond that, there is so much work happening off the radar. As you know very well, I raise human rights issues with all relevant interlocutors with no exception, always and everywhere, even where this is more difficult to do. We have just finished a discussion with China and that is a perfect example of this coherent work that, let me stress, is something that the European Union constantly and coherently and consistently does. It would be good if all Member States would do exactly the same in their bilateral relations as well.  Let me be very clear on the fact that the overall picture is clearly not rosy. This year we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the UN Human Rights Council and the 50th anniversary of the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural rights. Still the global situation of human rights does not leave room for much celebration. New restrictions on civil liberties are being imposed in many parts of our immediate region. Attacks against human rights defenders, activists and journalists are on the rise and in several cases European citizens were among the victims of torture and other abuses. Allow me to mention here the tragedy of Giulio Regeni which is particularly close to our hearts and to our daily work.  It is time for us to take even more decisive action building on four fundamental pillars. First, our action will still focus on conflict areas – Syria, Libya, Yemen, the whole Middle East, and we will keep working on post-conflict reconciliation as we are doing, as I said, in Colombia and in Myanmar. There can be no sustainable peace if we do not mend the wounds of communities and societies.  Second, we need to keep in mind there is not only one way and one recipe for human rights. We need to engage on a broad spectrum of actions from efforts at Community level in the field of transitional justice to the International Criminal Court.  Third, we have to continue our work to preserve and to broaden the space for civil society, to fight for the freedom of expression and of the press, support human rights defenders, sustain progress in electoral processes – and let me thank this Parliament for our precious partnership on electoral observation missions. It does make a difference in so many places. Fourth and almost last, we need to renew our efforts to end the death penalty and the use of torture worldwide. 2015 was a difficult year also in this regard and we can only increase the pressure in all fora to wipe the death penalty off our world. Many of these initiatives are a concrete follow-up to the EU action plan on human rights and democracy that was adopted just one year ago.  So, last but not least, we have to put human rights at the core of all our policy areas. This begins with migration and displacement. Let me tell you very clearly we need to step up our commitment and our work for human rights all along the routes of migration – inside the refugee camps in Africa and in the Middle East, across the desert, at sea and here at home in Europe. I know that some of you, maybe not those present here but others, might not like to hear this because we always reflect on human rights thinking this is something outside of our borders. We have to be consistent and coherent. We say also in our global strategy that our foreign policy starts at home. The point is that our credibility starts at home, and this is true even more than in all other fields when it comes to human rights. We will not be a credible advocate of human rights worldwide if we do not preserve the highest, and I underline twice, the highest standards here in the European Union. As Europeans we cannot tolerate xenophobia. As Europeans we cannot tolerate anti-semitism and as Europeans we cannot tolerate Islamophobia. We cannot tolerate violence and intimidation against any minority on any grounds. Our credibility as a global human rights champion depends on our actions and also on our words. We have a big responsibility and we have to exercise it to the full.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2884, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Andrzej Grzyb", "mepid": "23785", "text": "  On behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab Madam High Representative, i would like to thank you for your excellent work I would like to thank you very much for the fact that the Foreign Affairs Council has just submitted its report on human rights and democracy in the world in 2015, and we can discuss this report today. This is what we sometimes refer to as European 'soft power', which you also referred to today during an earlier debate on security policy. Firstly, I would like to say that, in the area of human rights and democracy, 2015 has been a very difficult year not to say – dramatic, because armed conflicts, and ongoing fighting, as well as the intensity of terrorist attacks, and with it the victims of these, are also something that threatens democracy, which threatens, above all, the security of individual citizens. Many citizens of the world have had to change their place of residence. More than 60 million people are said to have changed their homes. Often the decision to go into the world was combined with false promises, often also with a threat to life. This was another year of the deteriorating situation of believers in the world, in particular Christians and other religious, national and ethnic minorities, particularly in the Middle East. Thirdly, I would like to say that the issue of religious freedom has found its place in the report. It should be appreciated that in 2015 one of the priorities was the implementation of the 2013 Union Guidelines on freedom of religion or belief.

But Europe is facing great and very serious crises and the big question is whether we are up to it, precisely in what challenges us, as Europeans. In other words, how can we go and tell others in the world how they should behave about the human rights of the weakest—because human rights exist to defend the weakest—when today the Hungarian government announces that it will hold a referendum to find out whether or not it accepts displaced persons on its territory? With what face are we Europeans going to give lessons in the world if many of the European governments are behaving in our own ranks? In some of the human rights reports of international organizations, the European Union now appears not as the great reference, but as the great responsible for the suffering of hundreds of thousands of human beings.

In the Basque Country, I and some colleagues investigated the situation of political prisoners. Our report shows that there is still work to be done in the European Union. In addition, we must stop weighing two sizes and two weights. We rightly press African capitals on issues such as human rights, respect for international rules and good governance.

Global human rights threats and democratic challenges became even more pronounced. We experienced an unprecedented migration crisis in the Mediterranean, a surge in the Daesh threat, continuing aggression against Ukraine, and a crackdown on civil and political rights in many places around us. This is all happening on Europe’s doorstep or in Europe itself. Can this be effectively managed? I believe, yes, but only if we ensure consistency between our words and actions. Only if we make full use of our policy and the financial instruments at hand. I want to see human rights underpin the implementation of the new EU global strategy just presented by the Commission. They are a prerequisite for stability and democracy and therefore have to be systematically mainstreamed into the work in crisis regions such as the Middle East, Africa or Ukraine.  In addition, we need to scale up our efforts in empowering civil society. Human rights defenders and space for civil society are the main – and often only – catalysts for positive change. Only a strong civil society can accommodate the voices of minorities and other vulnerable groups. We must ensure that they are better protected from authoritarian governments and their restrictive laws and actions. Lastly, if we want to tackle the global governance crisis, the EU cannot act alone.

Madam President, we are once again looking at the annual report on human rights and democracy. There are a number of things that can be welcomed, but what worries me is the contradiction with the reality of a growing number of European policies. One example: I read, on page 14 of the report, that we welcome the European Union's reaction to President al-Bashir's visit to South Africa, which was done. But, at the same time, the EU is in the process of reaching an agreement with Sudan to finance its army against a background of development, what Mr Mimica calls 'development and security go hand-in-hand', which is contained in the Commission document of 5 July. What can be expected in this area? Will the Sudanese dictator be given funds to continue bombing his people in Darfur and Blue Nile? Will Sudan be helped to control emigration, as more and more Eritreans are sent back to Eritrea, where they risk their lives? This is just one example of how migrants' rights are systematically discussed with third countries, which is read on page 19. So, yes, there is a vast difference between speech and deeds.

I believe that our region is a world leader in pushing for the strengthening and continuation of human rights protection in international for a.

However, I do not want to go into this today. We in Parliament are, of course, preparing a comprehensive report which, above all, also comments on this annual report. Looking back on the past year and the EU's human rights policy, however, I am particularly concerned that the profound changes in refugee policy have moved away from a humanitarian refugee policy that is justifiable under human rights law. The primacy of foreclosure, the desire to deport as many people seeking protection as possible and as soon as possible from the EU, has become a driving motive. For example, the pact with Turkish President Erdogan is not a template for a refugee policy that complies with human rights. And yet, in the future, this model will also be used to cooperate with states such as Ethiopia or Libya. The EU has been criticised for this – by human rights experts at the United Nations, by the Council of Europe. European and international human rights and refugee organisations have made an impressive appeal to the EU to abandon the primacy of refugee defence – so far to no avail. It saddens me and is very thoughtful that the EU and its Member States have lost credibility in the area of human rights protection. And I warn against a further loss of confidence.

This post has just been created and awarded to Jon Figeé – a classic post for a Christian Democrat. There is also a special representative for human rights, Mr Lambrinidis from Greece, also such a supply case, but this is another issue. Mr Lambrinidis is primarily concerned with human rights violations. He is very concerned with the many sexual identities, the sexual orientations and the many genders that people can have in this way. He is distinguished by the fact that he sees human rights violations there very quickly and then takes action very quickly and reprimands them. In the case of human rights violations against Christians, it clearly does less. Question number one: The Special Representative for Human Rights has his own staff, and he is in your foreign affairs service. Why does the Special Representative for Religious Freedom not have his own staff? It is not on an equal footing, it is not with you in the External Action Service, but only with the Development Commissioner. Is the protection and promotion of religious freedom less important and worth less for the Juncker Commission? Question number two: can the tasks of the many special representatives not actually be carried out much better by the foreign ministers of the nation states? Is it not the case that every special envoy somehow pretends to be a small foreign minister? And aren't there a bit of a lot of them? Question number three: has the Court of Auditors actually checked the efficiency of the many special representatives and drawn up a cost-benefit calculation?

Let me point out some suggestions as well. Firstly, the Institution for Development Cooperation must recognise the enormous work done by the churches and their organisations in humanitarian relief worldwide. Also regarding development cooperation, the EU cannot make compromises in countries where human rights such as religious freedom are in danger. Europe must show zero tolerance towards oppressive regimes in development agreements.  Secondly, in early February Parliament passed an historic decision on the recognition of genocide against religious minorities by Daesh. Naming the crime by its true legal name is the first step to really addressing these atrocities by radicals. Thirdly and finally, protection of religious minorities is the major security factor in the Middle East.

I consider it a priority for the European Union to adopt a strategy for the Middle East and North Africa region, taking into account all the factors underlying terrorism and radicalisation, taking a representative approach through the involvement of civil society and complying with international human rights standards.

I'd like to make a few small observations. I think it is very good that a programme of support for human rights defenders has started, that last year the European Union provided a total of 160 defenders with cash in the form of grants. I think that this is precisely the area for the future where, in countries where there is simply no democracy, there is no possibility of freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, to support those who seek to defend the ideas of human rights and fight against totalitarian regimes there. I consider it very important that the European Union is heavily involved in monitoring electoral processes in the world and that this can contribute in some States to making elections more fair, democratic than they would have been if external observers, such as those from the European Union, were not there.

There must be more evaluation, less description, and there should be greater use of benchmarks to measure and to foster progress. And this year, in particular, there remain serious questions as to how far the EU’s refugee policy fully upholds human rights. But I do not want to bash the European Commission on that, the needs of the refugees themselves are too important. Nor do I wish to do so on the Commission’s widely publicised failure to carry out the human rights impact assessment required in the EU-Vietnam trade negotiations.

We welcome, for example, the progress made in conditioning the European Union's trade agreements with third countries to respect for human rights.

I would like to welcome, in this regard, the inclusion in the annual European report on human rights and democracy of a reference to the right to 'not have' a religion, in harmony with the resolution on freedom of religion or belief adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in December 2015.

We have witnessed this trend in the 1930s and 1940s, and it is dangerous for the continent. It is the EU, and the rules and norms upon which it is founded, which has effectively kept the dangers of extremism and totalitarianism at bay for over half a century.

The objective of these recommendations is to feed into the preparation of the EU priorities for the next UN General Assembly session each autumn, which the Council normally adopts in July. We agreed on 22 compromises on the basis of 220 amendments and our opinion of the David committee. I would like to thank all the colleagues involved, the shadow rapporteurs, the political advisers and the members of the EU-UN working group. The renewed UN General Assembly recommendations report gives us a chance annually to voice the opinion of the European Parliament in times of great challenges. This is even more important in the light of the conflict on the EU’s doorstep, Europe’s growing exposure to hybrid warfare, cyber-terrorism, foreign fighters, unprecedented waves of migrants, and the blurring of the distinction between external and internal threats. It also empowers our institution to present its opinion via the Council to the UN General Assembly, not only on matters of migration, peace and security, and the fight against terrorism as mentioned above, but also on issues such as non-proliferation and disarmament, human rights, democracy and the rule of law, development, climate change, and the EU and reform of the UN system. Parliament’s recommendations to the Council in the report are, among others, to continue to support multilateral attempts to find lasting political and peaceful solutions to ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Africa; to support the ongoing comprehensive efforts to strengthen US-UN peace operations and the organisation’s ability to address conflicts; to reiterate its unequivocal condemnation of terrorism and its full support for actions aimed at the defeat and eradication of terrorist organisations such as the so-called ISIS/Daesh; to support UN efforts to prevent non-state actors and terrorist groups from developing, manufacturing, acquiring or transferring weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons; to promote greater support for the work of the United Nations Refugee Agency in implementing its international mandate to protect refugees; to reiterate clearly and firmly that all human rights agreed under the EU Charter are universal, indivisible and independent and that respect for these rights must be enforced; to continue to advocate for freedom of religion or belief; to call for the repeal of laws criminalising blasphemy or apostasy; to serve as protection against the persecution of religious minorities or non-believers; to work towards the implementation of sustainable development goals on the 2030 agenda for sustainable development; to ensure that the EU remains at the forefront of the fight against climate change and to cooperate further with the UN in this area; to ensure swift implementation of the position taken at the 2015 UN climate change conference in Paris; to support a comprehensive reform of the UN Security Council on the basis of a broad consensus; to promote the revitalisation of the work of the General Assembly and improve the coordination and coherence of action by the UN institutions. The Council will adopt the conclusions on 18 July for the General Assembly opening in September. Therefore, if approved in plenary, Parliament’s recommendations will be forwarded to the Council for official consideration in the Council’s priorities for the next UN General Assembly meeting. I hope that next year we will be a bit earlier, because there are only 10 days now for the Council to consider Parliament’s opinion.

Let me tell you openly that the mood one year ago was not exactly the same, and I believe that the change is due to the hard work we have done during this year, during this current session of the UN General Assembly. In a minute I will come to your recommendations for the year ahead, but before that I would like to look back quickly to last year’s General Assembly and what has happened since then. In September 2015 in New York, we decided to build on the format that made the Iranian deal possible and to create the International Syria Support Group. In New York again, the Quartet reconvened after a long time, in September last year, engaging key Arab states in the conversation, and the result of that process was also discussed here this afternoon, the Quartet report on the Middle East that we just presented. Another issue: right after the General Assembly, the Security Council endorsed our naval Operation Sophia to fight people smugglers and their networks. And let me announce to you tonight, with a little bit of joy at the end of this long afternoon of painful discussions, that a baby was born today on one of our ships. So I would like to thank and congratulate our military staff for the work they are doing at sea. Sometimes we also bring life and save lives. Last month again, the Council voted unanimously to authorise Operation Sophia to enforce an arms embargo off the coast of Libya. As you have seen this year, these are just some examples. We have put the UN at the centre of the decision-making process on all major foreign policy issues, exactly as it should be, and the European Union had a key role in this, exactly in line with our global strategy discussed this afternoon. There is a lot of work to do on all these issues and on many others. Let me mention the conference on Afghanistan that we will host in Brussels in October, which we are preparing in the light of the UN General Assembly last September; and, of course, our work with the UN goes well beyond mediation. So, I come now to your recommendations on the 71st session of the UN General Assembly and the excellent report we are discussing tonight. As you mentioned, Member States will also discuss this report and the priorities it indicates, and will adopt conclusions in the Foreign Affairs Council on 18 July. The year 2015 has been an impressive one for international agreements and global governance, with COP 21, the sustainable development goals (SDGs), the revision of the UN strategies for peace cooperation, the peace-building architecture and the Women, Peace and Security Resolution. As the report notes, the strategic visions on peace and security of the UN and the EU are evolving in precisely the same direction. If you look at the global strategy and look at Resolution 1325, we agree on the link between security and development: very much so. We agree on the need for a culture of prevention. We agree on a long-term, multi-level approach to security, one that looks at human security and put people at the centre of our work for security. Just like our own strategy, the UN strategies will now have to be implemented on the ground and, as the report states, the two implementation processes can and should go hand-in-hand, for instance on strengthening cooperation between UN operations and common security and defence policy (CSDP) missions and on Battle Groups. The same goes for the SDGs. I fully agree with you when you say that we have to translate our commitment into concrete action. The EU was key in achieving the result of agreeing on the SDGs. Now the world looks to us to show the way on implementation, and there we will need to work, using a mix of tools, on development and security and on improving good governance as well as partnering on private investment and economic development. As you know, the Commission is preparing two initiatives related to this: mapping communication on the EU internal and external actions contributing to the implementation of the SDGs; and a revision of EU development policy in the light of the 2030 agenda. Our world has clearly changed and is changing, and our tools must also adapt to the new reality we are facing. But is not just about us and the actions we put in place. Yes, the EU is the main contributor to the UN system and to its peacekeeping operations. Yes, we are the leading humanitarian player worldwide, and that is not about to change. But we must also realise that our efforts will not be enough if our actions are not rooted in strong cooperation with our partners. Here is why the UN must necessarily be at the centre of our policies: a world of global challenges must be a world of global responses and global partnerships. On climate change, we are finally on the right track with the Paris agreement, which is the cornerstone of emerging global governance for climate. We are now pressing for early ratification and entry into force, and it is crucial to build on the momentum through continued cooperation on the implementation of the intended nationally determined contributions. We remain committed not only to implementing our ambitious domestic commitments but also to providing the necessary financial and technical assistance to developing countries in transition towards a low-carbon economy. Apart from climate, there are the two further issues I would mention. Counter-terrorism, of course, is a field in which each country has its specificities. The paths to radicalisation are different, but some of the patterns are common, as was clarified by the UN Secretary-General’s action plan on preventing violent extremism, and in all cases prevention and partnership are the most powerful tools in our hands. In this field, cooperation is vital, as it is also vital to work across borders in the fight against terrorist financing, which is key in our work with the UN. Last, but by no means least, there is migration. Let me conclude on the global migration crisis. We too often forget that this is a global crisis and not a European one. Never have so many people been on the move in the world, but it is also true that the world has the resources to face the crisis. We can manage – if we manage it all together. This means that not only countries of origin, countries of transit and host countries but also state and non-state actors, from local government to the private sector, are called upon to play their role and assume their responsibilities. Alone, no one will manage, but together we can and we will, and we have finally understood this. I was glad to see that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for a UN summit in September in New York to define a global approach – a global compact – on migration, with concrete commitments in relation to the movement of migrants and refugees, and that President Obama, the following day, organised a global summit on refugees and the need for concrete commitments. Both events have the potential finally to constitute a turning point towards globally shared responsibility, a global framework for cooperation on migration and stronger international protection of refugees. If this finally becomes a global commitment, it will be largely as a result of our European work within the UN system. A stronger European Union, a safer European Union, needs a stronger international system with the UN at its core, and the strong European Union can be the best champion of more effective global governance. This will be an incredible year for the UN. After the election of the new Secretary-General it will be time to discuss reform of the UN, in line with the new strategic agenda for the next 15 years, and our aspiration cannot be simply to preserve the existing system. We need to transform it, to make it stronger and truly to meet our citizens’ and the world’s needs. This report helps us in that direction.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2923, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Cristian Dan Preda", "mepid": "96838", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Mr President, I would first like to congratulate my colleague Andrey for his commitment and for his work on this recommendation to the Council. Our group has been very insistent that, after last year's break, we should return to the practice of expressing Parliament's position before this very important annual meeting at the multilateral level. The clearest expression of multilateralism, of course, is the United Nations General Assembly. For us, the European Union, this is a very important principle. That is why we support not only the reform of the UN institutions, but also efforts to strengthen peace operations and the organization's overall capacity to respond to conflicts. I have supported several amendments in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, stressing the need to respond to the current challenges of the Peace and Security chapter. It is important to cooperate with the United Nations, as I said in these amendments, to strengthen the role and capacity of regional and sub-regional organisations in peacekeeping, conflict prevention and crisis management. But in that sense, of course, we need to increase cooperation with these organizations and with the United Nations. Finally, as I am the permanent rapporteur of this Parliament on the coherence of development policies (CPD), I would like to welcome the inclusion of the points relating to the implementation of the programme by 2030. In particular, I believe it is very important to stress the need to strengthen the CPD within UN structures in order to integrate all dimensions of sustainable development more effectively.

I think you are doing a brilliant job, and I would like to send with great encouragement for continued good work. It's very important. And I agree, I think it is shameful that we are so few in here when we talk about such essential things as respect for human rights. I would also like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Andrej, a colleague for whom I feel that we have shown great sensitivity in our cooperation on these issues, and also, of course, to thank the other colleagues for this joint draft report on which we are going to vote tomorrow and which contains the Recommendations of the European Parliament to the Council for the General Assembly meeting in September. After all, the UN is the largest body we have today to act for peace, security and human rights globally. It is therefore very important for the EU to be involved in building a UN that can act effectively within the three pillars of the UN: peace and security, development and human rights. A key element in the work for peace and security is to ensure the implementation of Resolution 1325 and Resolution 2242 on the inclusion of women in peace and conflict resolution.  I have two and a half minutes.  If women are left outside the negotiating tables, we will never achieve a sustainable solution. I was told two and half minutes. So I have to fight for this because I have prepared for two and half minutes and it's not fair. Yes, I will shorten – OK. Yes, I will shorten, because I also took some time to ask if there was a translation. OK, anyhow. It is now 20 years since the Beijing Declaration was adopted and it is high time to put it into practice. With regard to the UN's work for development, it is important to ensure access to sexual and reproductive health here, as this contributes to a reduction in child and maternal mortality. Safe abortions for rape victims during war and conflict are central to women, and society as a whole, being able to heal and build up after a conflict. This should also be a central part of the UN's development policy. I would like Parliament to send clear recommendations to the Council on working against violence and discrimination against LGBTQ people and to ensure that all laws that discriminate or discriminate against LGBTQ people are abolished among UN members.

Christians are undoubtedly the most persecuted religious group, and this must be said very clearly, but not because it is a kind of resentment towards the Muslim world, just because it is true. It is Christians who are the group that suffers the greatest religious persecution. If our report calls for apostasy not to be punished, for freedom of religion to be respected, for no one to face criminal sanctions on the ground of their freedom, because of religious freedom, then it must be said that these sanctions apply only to Christians.

As many Member States are divided on numerous global issues, this recommendation would be a great opportunity to show to the world community that the European Union can speak in one single voice. In light of this, I am very pleased that the Committee on Foreign Affairs succeeded to include in the recommendations some proposals that are significant to our values. It has clearly highlighted the role of the European Union in human rights, climate change, development and the active promotion of the rule of law and international humanitarian law.  Of course, the unmistakable condemnation of terrorism and the full support for actions aimed at the defeat and eradication of terrorist organisations, which possess a clear threat to regional and international security, should be also our priority. However, I would like to draw your attention to the course of the identification and appointment of the best candidate for the post of Secretary General of the UN and the possibility of the EU to support fair distribution based on geographical and gender balance.

The United Kingdom has, of course, voted to leave, and – as has already been said – now is the time for a rational and calm discussion on the future relationship between my country and the EU. However, I would like to extend my caution to French colleagues here in this Chamber, as you will soon be the only EU Member State to hold a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.

We talk about multipolarity, and we support the International Criminal Court. There, as I have already told you, the West makes others judge, forgetting to judge itself. Secondly, the Union is systematically demonstrating a desire to destroy the strategic autonomy of the Member States. But without the States, what is the Union? Nothing! This is a success of the Member States, including France. Operations in Central Africa, Mali and the current Operation Barkhane are the work of French soldiers, their professionalism and sacrifice to help local people, with the agreement of the United Nations. We take advantage of a migration crisis, largely due to Germany, its hegemonism, its interests, to neutralize the action of the other states that make up Europe. If Merkel's Germany imposes its interests, but also its suicide, the other states must be able to oppose this supposedly European German policy.

Two points, because the far right is always speculating and we need to give an answer to the false allegation that somebody in the European Union is pressing the United Kingdom or France to give up their seat at the Security Council for an EU seat. That is not the case – we never said this, and in our recommendations, the goal to have an EU seat on an enlarged and reformed UN Security Council is only mentioned in the future and in the long term. This is not replacing France or United Kingdom, and again we see how people on the far right, which are now not here, have presented a falsification of information. My next point – and I cannot not mention this – is on the election of the next Secretary General. We hope that the informal rotation will be kept and Europe will have the next European Secretary General; from the gender point of view, this is the time to have a woman as the next Secretary General. Thank you very much again, and I am expecting that adopted recommendations will be taken into consideration at the Council for the next general assembly.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2937, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Πρόεδρος. –", "mepid": "28586", "text": "   The debate is closed.

It is important for me to say that we are confident, that we, on behalf of the Council, are ready to cooperate very closely with this Chamber, with the European Parliament. We have clearly defined priorities and I rely on you that we can bring tangible results because I think this is more important than ever before.  Thank you for this opportunity to discuss the issue of protection of whistle-blowers. Indeed, a number of events and cases in recent years have highlighted the role of whistle-blowers and generated an EU-wide and, I daresay, global conversation on this issue. When acting for the purpose of protecting the general public interest, whistle-blowers play an important role in disclosing wrong-doing and dangers to society and therefore they deserve legal protection. It is crucial that they can signal and sound an alert without having to pay for it with their job, their reputation and even their life. The protection of whistle-blowers is currently the subject of several international instruments, for instance, the OECD guidance of 2012. At the same time, the Council of Europe recommendation of 2014 encourages Member States to have in place a framework for whistle-blower protection and sets out a series of principles in this respect.  In our work at the level of the European Union, several pieces of legislation include provisions on whistle-blowing; for instance, the protection of whistle-blowers and journalistic sources was one of the issues discussed during the negotiations on the Trade Secrets Directive last year. The compromise provision offers protection to whistle-blowers when revealing misconduct or illegal activity, provided notably that they have acted in the public interest. Likewise, provisions on whistle-blowing are included in several directives or regulations in the area of financial services. Provisions also exist, let me underline, at the level of Member States and notably in the context of the Council of Europe recommendation that I have mentioned earlier.  As far as overarching or horizontal legislation at EU level on the issue is concerned, it would be up to the Commission to consider the possibilities, and I have taken note of Parliament’s call for a clear legal framework on the protection of whistle-blowers before the end of June this year. I look forward to hearing the views of the Vice-President of the Commission on this issue. The Council has not yet discussed the matter as such, but it has in a broader sense discussed integrity policies in the public and in the private sector across the EU.  Within its institutional powers, the Council is prepared to consider relevant Commission initiatives for EU measures deemed necessary in this respect. Furthermore, I know that the Commission yesterday adopted a very important communication on further measures to enhance transparency and the fight against tax evasion and avoidance, which also addresses the issue of protection of whistle-blowers.  Finally, the Commission will notably assess the scope for a horizontal and further sectoral action at EU level, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2941, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Jyrki Katainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to discuss the protection of whistle-blowers after the debate which took place in this House four months ago. The activity of whistle-blowers can be indispensable to identifying wrongdoings where institutional processes of accountability do not function appropriately. The protection of whistle-blowers in the public and private sectors thereby contributes to addressing mismanagement and irregularities, including criminal activities. The Commission therefore strongly supports the objective of protecting whistle-blowers.  The Commission has taken steps to protect whistle-blowers in EU sectoral legislation, as well as measures within the EU institutions in the guidelines on whistle-blowing adopted on 6 December 2012. For example, Member States are required to establish effective and reliable mechanisms to encourage the reporting to competent authorities of potential and actual breaches of anti-money laundering rules. Financial institutions and other entities have to put in place procedures for employees or persons in a comparable position who report breaches of those rules. Similar requirements are in place for law firms and audit firms and in other areas of EU law such as market abuse, collective investment in transferable securities and trade secrets. Recent mass leaks such as the Panama papers have once again highlighted the important role of whistle-blowers in journalistic investigations and, in this particular case, in exposing tax avoidance and tax evasion. For this reason, the Commission yesterday issued a communication in which it outlines the progress made so far and the priority it gives to strengthening the fight against tax evasion, tax avoidance and illicit financial activity and to promoting tax good governance globally. In particular, the Commission is facilitating research and exchange of best practices to encourage improved protection at national level and will assess the scope for further action at EU level. In this respect, I would like to draw your attention to the public consultation launched by the Commission on media pluralism and democracy in the run—up to the second annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights, which will take place on 17 and 18 November 2016. This consultation, open until mid—July, seeks inter alia to gather the views of a broad range of stakeholders on how to address the pressure put on journalistic sources, including whistle-blowers. The current discussions that you are holding in this House contribute to the reflections on the possible EU response. To sum up, a lot has already been done at EU level in fields where the EU has competence. With a view to strengthening the protection of whistle-blowers, we need to carefully assess the scope for horizontal and further sectoral action at EU level, while fully respecting the principle of subsidiarity. I am glad to listen to your views on this issue, and the Commission is open for your ideas.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2942, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Julia Pitera", "mepid": "124898", "text": "  On behalf of the PPE Group. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by The UN Convention against Corruption, ratified by all European Union countries, in Article 33 on the protection of reporting persons encourages states to set up legal systems to protect against the negative consequences of persons reporting corruption offences. The Council of Europe's Civil Law Convention on Corruption, Article 9 on the Protection of Workers, also obliges the parties to ensure that such persons are protected from consequences. Both conventions indicate that bona fide and legitimate persons should be protected. Whistleblowers should be protected because, knowing the internal organisation of the institution and the mechanisms of its functioning, they can react as soon as possible when they perceive phenomena that threaten or cause harm to other staff, institutions. Their activity is essential for the disclosure of irregularities, so such protection should be guaranteed by law and strengthened throughout the European Union, but only if the whistleblower's aim is to protect the general public interest by acting in good faith. In a judgment delivered in July 2011, the European Court of Human Rights ruled on the matter, stating that courts and Member States should only protect whistleblowers if their disclosure is clearly and decisively in the public interest. By contrast, in its Judgment of November 2012, the same Court held that the authorities should in no way restrict or diminish the ability of whistleblowers and journalists to document and disclose illegal, unlawful or harmful practices if it is a priority to make that information known in good faith in the public interest. Thus, a good, but taking into account all aspects, a system of protection of whistleblowers is necessary if we are to strive for the effective elimination of the pathology of public life.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2943, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Evelyn Regner", "mepid": "96998", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group.

I do not want to talk about the hot porridge, but I would like to give you the right thing to do, which is particularly important to us here: we need a horizontal directive, a general directive that really protects whistleblowers in general, not just sectoral rules. This is a question of political will, not of the legal basis. We have looked at this, there is a legal basis. In other words, if the Commission is prepared to go further than what it is doing now, it is absolutely possible. In this respect, I also take the introductory remarks of the Presidency as a positive sign that we can and must do a great deal here. We have put this debate into a good place in terms of timing. It is absolutely important for us Social Democrats that this should take place today, because we are now looking back on a verdict that was handed down last week against Antoine Deltour and also against Raphael Halet, which is quite simply scandalous – a judgment that is a disgrace to Europe.

Now Mr Deltour is being condemned by a court for exactly what he has won a prize for. In other words, something has simply gone wrong here. It is a bug in the system, and that is why we need to repair this system. In other words, we need – and I repeat – a horizontal directive, and not just one, which is sectoral, because otherwise we would not be able to count on this cooperation in the work that we are now doing in the European Parliament when it comes to LuxLeaks, that is to say, our TAXE report today, when it comes to showing what is still contained in the Panama Papers. , on this help that these valuable whistleblowers provide us with.

The 2014 Directive required the review of the European Union's tax transparency agreements with Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino and Switzerland, but Panama did not wish to sign.  We have only been able to discover the gigantic plot woven in the office Mossack Fonseca thanks to an anonymous delator, but in other large plots, the people who have dared to denounce have suffered serious consequences for it.  On behalf of my group, I must ask the European Commission to submit a legislative proposal to protect the delators and to do so with a single horizontal European table because otherwise we will be in breach of our responsibility, and now we know what we should do.  My group believes that whistleblowers play an essential role in protecting our democracy and the general interest. \"Luxleaks\" or the \"Panama papers\" prove that despite our efforts, our democratic systems do not have the necessary legal instruments to protect us effectively and that we must therefore protect whistleblowers, as well as learn from each of these uncovered realities.  Despite the general interest of the revelations, which has already been said today, Antoine Deltour has been sentenced to twelve months in prison and a fine.

Mr President, I would like to thank the The Left Group has requested such a debate. In Luxembourg, Antoine Deltour and Raphael Halet were recently convicted for informing the public about the LuxLeaks. These were lazy tax deals under the responsibility of the current President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. The auditors PwC even had the official stationery of the Luxembourg State. Apple and Google often pay less than one percent tax on their profits. We lose up to EUR 1 trillion a year through tax evasion and avoidance, money that is lacking for hospitals and schools. Antoine therefore has more moral stature than many European politicians who run letterbox companies. Deltour and Halet have uncovered legal but also illegal tax theft. In my view, people who report a crime should not be punished, but the criminals should be arrested. Together with my colleague Sven Giegold, I witnessed Deltour in court and I am proud of that. Antoine has won the European Citizens' Prize and his work has also been recognised by the TAXE Special Committee. But what heroes need are not warm words. What heroes need is protection. Mr Juncker told me that protection of whistleblowers at EU level was necessary. Nothing has happened since then. We have asked Conservatives, Social Democrats and Liberals not to adopt the directive on the protection of trade secrets until the protection of whistleblowers serving the public interest is sufficiently guaranteed. Unfortunately, we have not been listened to. So the verdict against Deltour and Halet did not surprise us. My colleague Dennis de Jong, as co-rapporteur, will present a report on the protection of whistleblowers on the basis of Article 325 TFEU or the protection of the Union's financial interests.

Mr President, Commissioner Katainen, I thank you for saying how important it is to protect whistleblowers. Beyond words, I think it is time now to change and take action. This is a very strange world: we live in a world where people who report fraudulent acts are prosecuted and convicted by the courts and where those who defraud and who have been denounced are doing well. No problem. This is a world in which journalists who inform citizens are rightly relaxed, but where, on the other hand, the citizens who have informed journalists are condemned. Who can understand that freedom of the press, which is based primarily on a right to free information, is not backed up to the protection of those who defend the public interest? Why should whistleblowers be protected? Simply because they are the guardians of the public interest, the actors and guardians of an open and transparent democracy. Whether it is health issues, environmental issues, tax issues or corruption, we need this information, we need to protect these people, not to see them prosecuted and sent to prison.

A few days ago, in fact, a Luxembourg judge was led to convict two whistleblowers in the LuxLeaks case under strict Luxembourg law.

Parliament is holding this debate today on whistleblowers at the request of the Socialist and Democratic Group and has repeatedly called for European protection for whistleblowers. What for? Because national protections, when they exist, are heterogeneous, imperfect, sectoral. Scandals, on the other hand, are European. So it is a cross-cutting text that we need. So far, the Commission has been opposing legal arguments that we believe do not hold. We have the means to find a basis, a foundation to act and to protect, with a horizontal, global, multi-sectoral framework, whistleblowers in Europe. We must go beyond the Commission's procrastination. So I ask you, Commissioner: are we going to get out of this status quo, which is not acceptable? We need political will.

Unfortunately, I cannot give you an exact date for the arrival of the proposals, because we have to assess the legal framework. It may sound boring, but as much as protecting whistleblowers must be on a legal basis, we have to base our proposals on a legal framework. Sometimes it is quite difficult in the sense that we have to take into account what are areas of EU competence and areas of national competence. I understand fully the need in this House for a European—wide harmonised legal basis on this issue because, as I said, it is part of the normal rule of law; a modern interpretation of the rule of law of democracy.  But the reality is not as bad as some may think, as there is still room for manoeuvre and improvement. The Commission is assessing whether we have a legal basis in the Treaties to act horizontally. We have to do this because we are not sure yet. Whistleblower protection provisions figure in the acquis on audit, money laundering, market abuse, collective investment in transferable securities and soon also in trade secrets.

We are developing a balanced package of measures that will strengthen our regulatory framework further, while improving its proportionality and consistent application. In particular, we will follow up on our announcement in the communication completing the banking union and propose requirements on leverage, stable funding and total loss absorption capacity for internationally active banks, while also updating our rules on market risks. All this is based on international agreements that have been reached at the level of the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board. At the same time, we are paying close attention to a number of issues that matter for the financing of the real economy. Our call for evidence has brought up a number of issues that we are now focusing on. In the context of banking regulation, the input from stakeholders suggests that we need to address the issue of the proportionality of our rules to the size, complexity and risk profile of our banks. We will, for instance, look at the reporting requirements for smaller or less complex institutions. Another area I would like to mention is the so—called SME supporting factor that reduces the capital requirements for lending to SMEs. Our analyses suggest that this factor should be maintained in the future and that we should also consider expanding the range of SME loans that can benefit from it. Lastly, we are also looking into the treatment of lending for infrastructure projects. As we have been working on this package, the Basel Committee is currently discussing certain further modifications to the Basel III framework. I expect these further modifications to be finalised only after the Commission proposes the package that I have outlined, namely before the end of this year. Therefore these further modifications from Basel will not form part of the end-of-2016 package. The aim of the modification which Basel is currently considering is not to increase capital requirements in the banking system but to review the calculation methodologies in order to find a better balance between risk sensitivity, simplicity and comparability. The work has two main aspects. On the one hand, the risk sensitivity of the so-called standardised calculation is to be increased. On the other hand, Basel is looking for better comparability on capital requirements, possibly in the form of restrictions on the use of internal models or by imposing flows under the capital requirements calculated with internal models.  As I said, the aim of this work is not to increase capital requirements significantly. This has been clearly stated by the Basel Committee’s oversight body, the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision, and also by the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors. Having said that, maintaining the overall level of capital does not mean that each individual bank will have the same required capital in the future, and banks that currently underestimate risk may well see the requirements increase. In any case, it is important that any agreement must be based on solid quantitative evidence. The impact of the modification under consideration is currently being examined both by Basel and by the European Banking Authority. We are very much aware that there are concerns that the ongoing work in Basel may have adverse effects on the financing of the European economy. Nevertheless, I can assure you that we will expect the Basel Committee to deliver on its commitment of not increasing capital significantly. I would emphasise that, for us, this must hold true for European banks in particular. In any case, the Commission will ensure that any proposal will be in the best interests of the European economy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2970, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Markus Ferber", "mepid": "1917", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. I am, of course, very pleased to hear that the Commission, for example, does not want to change the SME factor. I believe that this is a very important contribution to ensuring that small and medium-sized enterprises continue to have full access to SME loans and that they do not become more expensive for small and medium-sized enterprises without a greater risk here. On the other hand, we are, of course, following very closely and with great concern the discussions that are currently taking place in Basel. And here, Commissioner, it is not just a question of what to expect, but also the question of how we influence it. When I look at how the Americans are not implementing basel requirements and look at how we are implementing requirements from Basel to the smallest bank somewhere in the rural area, somewhere in the European Union, then something is no longer right. And when I see that the European Union is the big loser in the credit risk standard approach, while the Americans are hardly affected by it, then of course it cannot be that we are just watching it, but I expect a strong commitment on the part of the Commission to ensure that where there are risks, they are also mentioned, but that we are there. , where there are no risks, especially in the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises, especially where we have decentralised structures, especially in the context of proportionality – if I may use this term again – no risks should be invented where there are none at all, so that our banks are put under massive pressure here and, in the end, it is not possible to stabilise our banking sector by misadopting these proposals. , but is changing the banking sector. If something has proved its worth, then we do not need to change it, but then we must influence those who brood about it in Basel, that it does not exactly happen. That is why, Commissioner, I really would ask you to exert influence within the scope of the possibilities – Commission officials are also at the table in Basel – that things do not come to an influence, that those who sit at the table in Basel, like the Americans, actually make an impact, that we also get some breathing and that we do not go through everything to the last comma in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2971, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Roberto Gualtieri", "mepid": "96892", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the conclusion of the work on the revision of the Basle 3 agreements, scheduled for the end of this year, is an important step forward in ensuring the certainty, coherence and effectiveness of this regulatory framework in ensuring the stability of the global banking and financial system. However, a number of essential elements will have to be taken into account in the finalisation of the work, in order to ensure that these objectives are actually achieved and that there are no negative effects on the real economy.  Firstly, the Commission will have to make every effort to ensure that the Basel Committee sticks to what the governors of the central banks responsible for supervision said last January, namely that the reform must be completed without significantly increasing the overall capital requirements for the banking system. The Commission will also have to ensure that the Basel Committee draws up this reform package on the basis of a comprehensive and transparent analysis and takes into account, in its calibration, not only the overall effects but also the distribution of the impact on the different business models, avoiding negative repercussions, especially on commercial banks.  These banks, despite the difficulties of recent years, have shown greater solidity than investment banks and have been key to supporting the economic and employment recovery and it would be wrong to penalise with a sharp tightening of capital requirements, especially if not justified by a real increase in risk. That is why I hope that the Commission will fight to ensure that the calibration of operational risk is not too punitive for commercial banks.  Finally, the Commission will have to work to ensure that the reduction in the variability of the value of weighted risk assets, which was a primary objective of the Basel reform package, retains its centrality and ensures a level playing field between banks using internal valuation models and banks using standard models, for example by limiting the results of internal models downwards and anchoring them to those of standard models.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2972, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Paloma López Bermejo", "mepid": "125047", "text": "  GUE/NGL Group. – Mr President, when we still suffer the effects of the 2008 financial collapse, some still worry more about finance than workers.

These are negotiations which, at a technical level, as we know, should be concluded as early as September, with the possibility of an increase in capital requirements for banks. And let us be clear: we are not opposed to the consolidation of the banking sector, which has more own funds to deal independently with future crises, although I think it would be appropriate for capital requirements to be calibrated proportionally according to the risk and size of institutions. Having said that, however, we absolutely must ensure that the consolidation of the banking sector does not come at the expense of the real economy and that the role of the European Commission in Basel is fundamental to supporting a strong political direction, in favour of growth.  Mr Vice-President, I can only endorse what Mr Ferber and Mr Gualtieri have said: we call on the Commission to ensure that this review does not harm small and medium-sized enterprises and the real economy but only serves to enable banks to continue to raise funds and then lend. That is why, a few months ago, we in this House defended the EMS supporting factor which the Commission intends to support. We asked Commissioner Hill, who, I would remind you, has done an excellent job in reviving our economy and the well-being of our fellow citizens.  Motivated by the same motives, we are here today to defend the political priority of reconciling growth and consolidation, in short, flexibility and rigour. We do not want the review of the standardised approach to credit risk to be carried out in a bureaucratic way, simply applying formulas and parameters. Unfortunately, Ferber is right, we apply certain decisions automatically, without assessing the consequences often, I repeat, with a bureaucratic approach.

I must remind you that one of the objectives of the Commission and this Parliament is to boost non-bank financing, the Capital Markets Union, which should also help to improve the financing of SMEs.  On the other hand, we must somehow contribute to the translation of the Basel decisions without reintroducing rating agencies into European regulation. The United States has done so, and I believe that Europe must make progress in eliminating rating agencies in the calculations of capital requirements, as announced by the Basel Committee's own conclusions.  And I also dare to introduce a debate that is pending in Basel — and which I hope in Europe ...; let's wait for Basel to make some determination—and that's nothing more than the discussion about sovereign debt capital requirements.

The debt-to-GDP ratio rose from three to five percent, risk weights fell on average, and there was a general capital increase. We are now entering the decisive final phase of the largest banking regulation in the history of the European Union. What is the goal? Restoring confidence in risk-weighted equity, reducing the range of risk-weighted assets. It is precisely in this revision of the standard approach to credit risk that we need to focus on the right points. The stability requirements for banks must also be implemented in the light of their economic consequences. It must therefore be made clear that increasing the risk weight of company investments can lead to more instability, especially in small markets, and would therefore be counterproductive. The granularity criterion, which includes a maximum of 0.2 percent of the total retail portfolio for individual SMEs or private customers, may also unintentionally have several negative consequences. We need to consider what we need to do so that the supervisors have the opportunity to make justified, individual exceptions within the overall framework. We must be mind-masered.

Nineteen EU countries are not Basel members at all. Therefore I share the concern of my colleagues regarding the expected recommendation of the Basel Committee on capital flows. Mr Ferber said this evening it is good for the US, bad for Europe. I sincerely hope that the Commission will not take into account that ‘one size fits all’. This has never worked for anyone.  New capital flows will lead to a higher cost of capital for banks and mortgage banks heavily involved in low-risk lending. The new capital flows that the Basel Committee recommends will not fit all European banking systems. For example, it fits very poorly in the country I come from, Denmark, where we rely strongly on a system of low-risk mortgage loans. As it is today, banks put capital aside as a buffer against losses. More capital is reserved for riskier activities. Less capital is put aside for less risky lending such as mortgage loans. With the new capital flows, banks would thus have to put more capital aside for the least risky lending activities such as mortgage lending. Two horrible consequences arise from this. Firstly, consumers will have to pay this bill when the low-risk loans become more expensive, the consumers – ordinary European homeowners and the SMEs relying mainly on mortgage loans. Secondly, it only gives incentives to banks to take more risks, not less, as the bank will be punished proportionately higher on the cost of low-risk loans than on high-risk loans. That is contrary to the objective of the recommendation on capital flows.  Therefore, let me stress that it is important that the EU stay strong and focused and that we do not adopt the Basel rules just for the sake of adopting rules. These capital flows will seriously harm growth and job creation in Europe and pass on the bill to ordinary people.

We have an entrepreneurial fabric which, as my fellow Members have pointed out, generates about 80% of employment in Europe, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises. My country, Italy, is dragged to one side, which is northern Italy, where almost all entrepreneurship is small and medium-sized and needs banks, rightly performing, absolutely balanced from a capital point of view, but willing to look at the ability to produce value of companies, not only capable of looking at their internal condition.

I must say that I have enjoyed it a lot, because a few years ago most of us – including me – were furious about what the banks had done. In 2007-2008 we entered the economic crisis, and many of us blamed the banks for what they did. Indeed, many banks did wrong: for instance, securitisation was not transparent. Nobody knew what they were selling and nobody knew what they were buying. There was a very hostile atmosphere towards the banks and this led us to regulate the banking sector more, which was the right reaction. However, everybody understands that if we launch 40 or 50 new regulations on banks there may be some consequences which nobody intended. That is the reason why we have to look at the set of new rules which the Commission has proposed and the co-legislators have accepted. We have to look very calmly at the regulatory environment and whether it really serves its purpose. If there is a need for changes, let us make the changes. I do not know at this point whether we will have to change anything or not, but nevertheless we have asked stakeholders to respond to us about how they see the current regulatory framework. A few issues in this debate were raised by many Members. The first is Basel itself. Danish Member Bendt Bendtsen mentioned that Basel does not necessarily function in a similar way in all countries: in Denmark, for instance, the banking sector is very mortgage driven. That is true. We have had this feedback from many countries, especially when comparing the European market to the American market, and still we have the same rule base. So Basel, strong and good as it is, functions differently in Europe than it does in the United States because the nature of the financial market is different in the two continents. We do not have a similar type of capital market in Europe to the one they have in the United States, and that is one of the reasons why the Basel requirements have a different impact in Europe than in the United States. There are also differences between our Member States. Mr Ferber, Mr Tajani and Mr Gualtieri raised the issue of SME financing. This is also a big issue. I think we all agree that it is better to have safe banks, meaning that the capital requirement for banks is adequate and banks are well capitalised. But at the moment we are suffering from a situation where in some of the Member States banks cannot lend more to SMEs because SMEs’ risk weight in the balance sheet is very high. That is why, first of all, the Commission wants to concentrate on the capital markets union in order to diversify the source of financing, especially on the SME side. But also, when looking at the banking regulation – and this is an issue which Mr Karas mentioned – it should be proportionate to the needs and the risks. Basically, we have identified three major areas which are the most crucial things to react to, according to the feedback from stakeholders. The first is banking regulation: the rules about the size, complexity and risk profile of our banks. This is number one. We have to look at the rules, the size, complexity and the risk profile of the banks, and then at how well the rule base fits with this. The second area is the so-called SME supporting factor, which means that we have to look at the possibility of reducing the capital requirements for lending to SMEs. This might be an exacerbating problem in Europe. Thirdly, we are looking into the treatment of lending for infrastructure projects. Again, we are a bank-driven market, and if banks cannot finance infrastructure then we are in trouble. We have already – and this is an amendment which is force at the moment – changed the Solvency II framework, meaning that we have reduced the capital requirement for insurance companies when they invest in infrastructure, and we are now considering doing the same thing with the banks. We have to be very careful, of course, not to jeopardise stability but, nevertheless, depending on the nature of the capital markets and financial markets in Europe, there is obviously a need for action in this field.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2981, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Marco Valli (EFDD)", "mepid": "124778", "text": "  in writing. I believe that the proposal for a Basel review represents an unfinished but positive step forward in relation to the absurd problem of disparities and asymmetries in internal risk assessment models that banks can use to calculate capital requirements. Partial and late revision, which must be supported anyway. Giving banks the opportunity to rely on internal rating models not only creates complexity and difficulties in assessing and comparing banks' actual risk exposure, thus hampering transparency and supervisory activity, but above all opens the way to model manipulation, thanks to which large investment banks have often managed to lower capital requirements. At the same time, however, I cannot but criticise the Basel approach, which, by focusing all its attention on credit risk and the capitalisation of individual banks, neglects the most important aspect from the point of view of the stability of the financial system, namely exposure to derivative instruments and speculative assets with enormous systemic risk. Unfortunately, as long as we did not limit the leverage effect, reduce interconnections, put a stop to speculation and tackle the problem of too-big-to-fail banks, that is, the main causes of the 2008 financial crisis, nothing can reassure us from the threat of a systemic crisis of even more catastrophic magnitude than the previous one.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2982, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Christel Schaldemose", "mepid": "37312", "text": "   rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Mr President! Ladies and gentlemen! Commissioner! On 15 June, a very large majority of Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Food and Public Health voted to reject the European Commission's request for the approval of health claims on caffeine. We hope that parliament as a whole will support that resolution when we vote tomorrow.  Most of us know well that a cup of coffee or two can brighten us up for a while, and many of us can hardly do without the effect of coffee in the morning. However, our objection is not about whether or not the proposed health claims are scientifically correct. Nor is it about whether caffeine is edifying or not. Our objection to the Commission's desire to authorize the four caffeine health claims is fundamentally about our desire to protect our children and young people. In order to obtain the proposed health claims on a product, a relatively large amount of caffeine is required, and in addition to coffee, it is virtually only energy drinks that contain sufficient amounts of caffeine to be able to use the health claim. That is why this is really a question of authorising health claims on energy drinks.  There are two reasons why we do not want to be part of it: one is that energy drinks contain large amounts of sugar. The second is that these energy drinks are primarily consumed by teenagers. Energy drinks contain as much as 27 grams of sugar per can, which is much more than who's recommended daily intake of sugar. We do not want it to be possible to make health claims on products that contain so much sugar. Moreover, it is the case that on a large scale it is young people, even children under the age of 12, who drink these energy drinks, despite the fact that we are fully aware that energy drinks are not recommended for children or for adolescents or for pregnant women. But it has very little text on the back. Furthermore, studies on who drinks these energy drinks also show that they are children and adolescents on a large scale.  Products with such high levels of sugar and products consumed at the same time by children and adolescents must not be capable of making any health claim. I would like to stress that the Committee on the Environment does not propose a ban on energy drinks. But we do not want to be part of making an unhealthy product more healthy because of a health claim! A health claim will mislead our children and young people into thinking that energy drinks are a more healthy choice than they are. The Committee on the Environment's rejection is based on basic Regulation (EU) No 1924/2006 on health claims, which clearly states that health claims should not contribute to excessive consumption of a food and must not be placed on products targeted at children and young people. Although energy drinks are not, in principle, targeted at children and adolescents, they are actually consumed by children and young people. Moreover, health claims are, of course, intended to increase the sale of the drink, and thus it will lead to an increased intake of sugar. So a health claim on energy drinks would go directly against Article 3 of the Health Claims Act. That is what we say no thanks to! In addition, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy suggests that we call on the Member States to look more closely at how the sale and marketing of energy drinks takes place. I think there is a need for tightening up! I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for so unequivocally backing the rejection of the four specific health claims. However, we have not only discussed them. We have also discussed nutritional profiles. We do not agree on this point in committee. However, I would like to say that had the European Commission complied with the legislation and put forward nutritional profiles, we would not have had to reject these health claims. It would have given itself! Then energy drinks would have been in a category that, because of its high sugar content, had not been allowed to use health claims. And rightly so! I know there are a lot of people who are concerned about the nutritional profiles. Many believe that they are synonymous with traffic lights on food. That is not the case! Nutritional profiles are guidelines that should be used to find out which products you allow health claims. Commissioner, please bring these nutritional profiles. We need them! However, it is great to see that a large majority of the Committee on the Environment supports it. We stand together when it comes to protecting our children and young people. We do not want our children and young people to be misled when it comes to food and drink.", "language": "en", "original_language": "da", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2983, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Jyrki Katainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, we are discussing a draft Commission regulation that aims to authorise the frame for health claims relating to caffeine and prohibits one for health claims relating to caffeine.  Some of you have voiced concerns on whether the Commission has made proper use of its powers when deciding to authorise these four claims. I am here to respond to those concerns and to explain why authorising these claims will be beneficial for consumers, besides providing a level playing field for food producers.  The Commission proposed the authorisation of these claims in the context of progressive establishment of the permitted list of health claims made on foods as required in the regulation on nutrition and health claims. The four health claims have been scientifically substantiated by the European Food Safety Authority and also take into account the latest scientific advice as regards the safety of caffeine intake from all sources.  This regulation is urgently needed. The health claims that are covered by this regulation have been used until now on the EU market under the responsibility of food business operators and subject to the general principles and conditions of their claims, and the regulations and national provisions applicable to them.  I would invite you to consider the possible consequences of not deciding now. Until a new decision is taken, these caffeine claims would continue to be used by any food business operators on the EU market without any specific conditions or restrictions for their use. In fact, far from promoting the caffeine intake in the population, the authorisation of the four scientifically substantiated claims will properly frame the use of these claims.  In addition, the Commission also recommends the prohibition of a fifth health claim. Should the fifth claim stay on the market in spite of scientifically confirmed safety concerns? Beyond this prohibition the draft Commission measure for the other four scientifically substantiated claims takes account of possible safety concerns as regards intakes of caffeine, especially for particular groups of the population. This is why in order to mitigate possible risks the draft regulation sets concrete conditions for the use of these caffeine-related claims.  It requires information to be given to consumers about the recommended daily intake that should not be exceeded and about appropriate intakes for scientific subgroups of the population, such as pregnant and breastfeeding women. Moreover, this draft regulation establishes a restriction for the use of the caffeine claims on foods that target children and adolescents. When Member States voted in favour of the authorisation, they confirmed that this restriction will help to better control and limit advertising of caffeine-containing food to this population group.  A number of Members have also linked a reservation to a general call for restrictions on the marketing of energy drinks to children and adolescents. As regards this objective, we are on the same page. The Commission fully recognises the importance of not marketing energy drinks to children and adolescents. This is demonstrated by the stipulation in the draft regulation of a restriction regarding this population group.  This is not the only safeguard in place. The regulation on food information to consumers requires a warning statement for beverages with high caffeine content. In addition, some Member States have adopted measures restricting marketing of such products for public health reasons. Member States may also carry out public health activities to inform citizens about the appropriate use of energy drinks and to discourage certain vulnerable population groups such as children and adolescents from all consumption and misuse or abuse.  Here, the role of the EU needs to support, coordinate or supplement the actions of the Member States. The EU Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health, for example, encourages industry partners to initiate self-regulatory activities in the field of marketing of food and non-alcoholic beverages to children. Finally, allow me to emphasise that the Commission has clearly remained within its mandate given in the basic regulation and that these draft regulations are fully in line with the requirements of the claim regulation in view of ensuring a high level of consumer protection and accurate information about the product.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2984, "date": "2016-07-06.json", "name": "Renate Sommer", "mepid": "4282", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioner for his work and for the work she has Is this regulation urgently needed, as the Commissioner has just said? I do not think that it is urgently needed, because so far the Member States have also been using these advertising statements in particular to deal with energy drinks. Some Member States – they are already printed on cans – but there are also Member States that prohibit exactly that. Why should we suddenly deprive these Member States of the opportunity to ban this and thus protect their populations from the harmful effects of excessive caffeine consumption? That is absurd! I think it is absurd to allow positive health advertising and harmonise them throughout Europe on products which, in general, must already carry warnings for certain groups of the population, such as pregnant women, breastfeeding women and children – and this is the case with energy drinks via the Food Information Regulation . This is contrary to common sense. And yes, the Commission has complied with EFSA's instructions, and that is right. But here it is a political decision. We claim – and the whole of Parliament is claiming this – that this commission's plan to allow these advertising statements contradicts the meaning, content and purpose of the regulation on nutrition and health claims. We must not force the Member States to allow something they do not want to have, especially today. This would further bring the citizens away from the European Union. Why not leave the status quo? It would also give other Member States where the statements are currently authorised the opportunity to take an example from the States in which it is forbidden.

Energy drink manufacturers argue that advertising campaigns are not directed towards children, but teenagers are among the biggest consumers of these drinks, and children under 12 are increasingly drinking them. Health claims to improve concentration or facilitate learning can lure children and young people to drink these drinks before school or before learning. The link between children and energy drinks is problematic on several levels: first, it is the intake of a large amount of sugar, which negatively affects the already significant problem of obesity in children in Europe. The second is the consumption of caffeine, the effect of which on children still needs to be extensively investigated. The third is the formation of taste in children, i.e. getting used to an extremely sweet drink. The fourth is the mixing of spirits with energy drinks, which is extremely popular among young people.  This isn't about banning energy drinks, it's about common sense. After all, the cans already say in lowercase letters that they are not recommended for children or pregnant women.

I am referring in particular to energy drinks which are usually consumed by around 68 % of adolescents and 18 % of children. As the European Parliament prepares to vote on a motion for a resolution which opposes the authorisation of new claims of caffeine health benefits, I cannot but support this objection because it considers it relevant and timely.  This objection is intended to counter the general principle that claims about caffeine are beneficial because they increase endurance and performance, as well as the ability to concentrate, stimulating the central nervous system, without at the same time taking into account the fact that the largest number of consumers of this type of drink are precisely children and adolescents. Commissioner, I myself, being a Portuguese, am an avid coffee drinker. However, I also know the harm it can have to health if it is taken too much. For these reasons I consider it correct the position taken by some political groups in this House to decline the possibility of admitting claims of health benefit for the purposes of marketing consumer products when, in practice, it is not possible a priori to select the target consumer, separate them from the younger layers.

Warning labels are being ignored whilst the industry’s code of practice, which is voluntary anyway, entails a commitment only not to market energy drinks to children under 12. We already know that the 10 to18—year-old age group is actually the one most likely to drink these products, and significantly 20% of under 10s have also confirmed that they drink them, so clearly the industry needs to work a bit harder to turn nice words into real action to stop their products being marketed at children. The sugar content in individual cans is unbelievable. A 250 ml can, which you can buy for EUR 0.49, can contain up to 27 grams of sugar, meaning that a child would already be over the daily recommended limit for sugar by consuming just one of them. But what does the Commission propose to do about these energy drinks? Unbelievably, it wants to approve health claims on these high-caffeine, high-sugar energy drinks – drinks that have no nutritional benefit for children. The use of these so-called health claims gives kids and teenagers the wrong impression: they could legitimately believe that they will improve their attention in class or their performance in school.

This is exactly how it is with caffeine, but also with sugar as ingredients of beverages and energy drinks that have certain positive and negative properties, and they should be taken care of especially since they are consumed by children or adolescents. Claims that \"Caffeine contributes to increasing endurance, increasing endurance capacity, increasing alertness and improving concentration\" do not tell the full truth and do not give full information about the product and its potentially negative characteristics. While the proposed restrictions suggest that these claims should not be used in advertising beverages intended for children and adolescents, in practice this is difficult or impossible to control. These health claims favor the use of energy drinks, which can result in increased intake of caffeine and sugar above the recommended daily doses.  This is a serious problem if we have in mind that 68% of adolescents consume energy drinks and 25% and up to three of them at once. EFSA itself also found that increased sugar intake in the form of a sweetener can contribute to an increase in body mass, and one can of energy drink contains as much as 27 g of sugar.

To date, the Commission has not identified such dietary profiles. The 250 ml energy drink can contain as much as 27 g of sugar and 80 mg of caffeine. The study found that 68% of adolescents and 8% of children consume energy drinks regularly.  I support the proposal for a Resolution of the European Parliament opposing the adoption of the Commission's draft regulation, as I find the claim that energy drinks increase concentration and help with learning is worrying. Problems related to obesity, the effect of caffeine on the body, the formation of taste in children and mixing energy drinks with alcohol should be borne in mind. We don't want to ban energy drinks or withdraw them from the market, but we don't want to encourage consumers to consume something healthy, if that's not true. Children and young people are victims of advertising campaigns, and our task is to protect them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure"}]
