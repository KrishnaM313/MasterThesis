Madam President, this request for an emergency procedure inspires me to make three points of misunderstanding.  First, during the three weeks of conciliation on the draft 2015 budget and the 2014 amending budgets, the Council was fully mobilised by this issue. He was so mobilized that he was only able to take a position on conciliation a few hours before its closing, and it was under these conditions that conciliation failed. In a way, this issue has cannibalized the Energy and Intelligence of the Council. The second reason for misunderstanding: in the event of this operation, the Commission proposed to allocate an additional 420 million resources related to customs duties and certain other taxes, not to help settle unpaid bills but to return this sum to the Member States of the European Union. Finally, I would like to say that in this area, between retroactivity and urgency, we must choose. Since retroactivity has been chosen, there is no emergency reason.

The urgency today is to approve an EU budget for 2015 that will enable the Union to function properly and to honour the commitments and priorities it has set out. The urgency today is to approve the 2014 amending budgets, an essential step in stabilizing, I mean, stabilizing, not reducing, the amount of unpaid bills which, without it, will reach EUR 30 billion by the end of this year. The urgency today is to agree on a multi-year plan to phase out unpaid debts to avoid the impending suffocation of the Union's budget in the future, either through a drastic reduction in commitment appropriations, which is the wish of some, or by unbearable delays in the liquidation of bills.

As for the own resources decision, this was the unanimous decision of the Member States, with revisions which mean overpayment for some and underpayment for other Member States. So far, all the Member States are ready to deliver what they should, in due time and in the full amount. This is a paradox. We are asked for an urgent procedure for the benefit of one or two countries and also for flexibility – there was never flexibility – and for a slow track in delivering what was needed to the European budget in order to solve the problems of the European budget. We are ready to do this – not on a fast-track basis, but in reasonable time and in the framework of the overall solution to the difficulties of the European budget.

The crisis would be halted, the financial market would be regulated, jobs would come and welfare would grow. Since then, however, things have gone in the opposite direction. Today, some 25 million people in the EU are out of work. About six million of them are young people, who thus start their adult lives in unemployment. In the wake of the crisis, social security and other social security systems have been eroded, inequalities have increased. The 2020 strategy wanted us to go in the opposite direction, but since 2008 the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion has increased by 10 million, so that today there are over 122 million people in Europe at risk of poverty or are already poor and vulnerable. In our discussions today, but also in the run-up to the Commission's proposal for an investment package, it is therefore important to underline that we must not forget to invest in what can take people out of unemployment and poverty. Of course, we say yes to investment in infrastructure, in research and in a sustainable climate, but we must also invest in education and in increasing the participation of women in the labour market. This requires us to build a functioning childcare system that is universal and accessible to all. We must invest in the integration and inclusion of the people who are furthest from the labour market and, of course, we must do everything to ensure that no young person has to start his life by becoming long-term unemployed. Youth unemployment has reached alarming levels today. It is now over 20%, more than one in five young people in Europe, and we did not believe that when we in this House decided on the 2020 strategy. In some cases we see more jobs being created and more being added, but, unfortunately, the increase in the employment rate has unfortunately proved to be partly the result of an increase in the very precarious and frivolous forms of employment, i.e. zero-hours contracts, bogus self-employment and involuntary part-time. What would become flexibility has become a shackle of insecurity and exploitation. Loosening and abuse of labour law rules mean that people have never really managed to get to solid ground in the labour market in recent years. Among the many who still actually have jobs, over 40% go on temporary contracts, and as many as 25% work part-time. I meet some of these young people who are basically chained to their cell phones, because what if someone calls and offers them a few hours of work. Then they can't miss that call. Thus, increasing economic growth is not in itself a guarantee of more quality jobs, of poverty reduction or of reducing social inequalities. The right political choices must be made in order to achieve these objectives. We must make the internal market work for people so that it serves the life and societies in which we want to live. The benefits of growth must be spread throughout society in order to be sustainable. Otherwise, we are sitting on a ticking bomb of inequality and people's frustration with all the consequences that this entails for both individual life destins and our democratic society as a whole. We can never compete with the world around us by having low wages, poor education, poor precarious working conditions, slave contracts, exploitation, weak trade union rights. We can only compete with being the absolute best at what we do. It requires a great deal of thought and activity in this House.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 12, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Sandro Gozi", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Mr President- in-Office of the Council. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is certainly an important moment, it is a timely time to discuss the review of the Europe 2020 strategy and to discuss it in those priorities that are fundamental for the rotating Presidency, but are also fundamental to the work, in general, that we are doing in the Council. You know that the review of the 2020 strategy has always been a priority of the Italian Presidency since the beginning of our six-month period, because we believe that this strategy must be relaunched and made more effective and because we believe that there is a dramatic level of economic and social crisis in Europe to which the European institutions must give faster and more effective answers, first and foremost around horizontal strategies , as is the Europe 2020 strategy.  In your question, you have raised a very large number of issues in your work, and that is at the heart of the strategy. The 2020 strategy cannot be linked only to one issue, but touches on many important issues to promote growth, to combat poverty, to create jobs. They range from energy policy to a new knowledge policy, to a sustainable development strategy. These are all issues that are linked horizontally at a time when we are talking about the new Europe 2020 strategy. We wanted to include the debate on mid-term evaluation and the identification of new priorities and the new method and within all the formations of the Council of Ministers. And already this was a choice that was not only of work organizations but is a clear choice of political approach.  We believe that all formations of the Council of Ministers must be active, proactive and should make their contribution to achieving the results of Europe 2020. We cannot continue – and this is a priority that we have generally placed on the functioning of the Council of Ministers, but which is particularly true with regard to the Europe 2020 strategy – we cannot continue to work with a compartmentalised Council. On the one hand, we cannot develop major horizontal, mainstream strategies, which touch on various policies and then have a Council of Ministers that continues to work in compartmentalised areas or that deals with Europe 2020 only in one or two Councils. No, this is the work we have to do, horizontal work. That is why we have discussed the main features of this strategy in all council formations. This work will then be continued and finalised, as you know, by the Latvian Presidency, which will follow the Italian Presidency. There are a number of sticking points from the discussions we have had in the Council. Some firm points that are first and foremost the objectives. We must maintain them and be more effective in achieving the objectives that we have set out in this strategy and that we have not achieved: growth, employment, the fight against poverty. We must be ambitious, we must be more ambitious. There are positive results in some areas, such as education. There have been totally unsatisfactory, I would say very worrying, results, not least as regards the credibility of what we are and the credibility of our work, as regards the fight against poverty, as regards the fight against unemployment. It is clear that we must move forward more decisively and more effectively. The third important message I want to give you is the issue of governance. It is clear that we also need to rethink the way in which the Europe 2020 strategy has been managed, starting with greater alignment of the Europe 2020 strategy and the European Semester. This is another point on which, in the new parliamentary term, I believe that we must make a difference together. We cannot continue in the economic, social and development field to have parallel processes that we meet and sometimes talk to each other from time to time. On the contrary, it is clear that we need to develop in a much more integrated way all those strategies which, in the economic field, tend to achieve the results that you and we want and, above all, the results of job creation and the fight against poverty.  Therefore, we certainly need to work better to integrate the processes that we have developed so far under the Europe 2020 strategy and those that we have carried out within the framework of the European Semester, and this is clearly a work for which we need more dialogue and greater interaction. We are working - some progress has been made and I believe that we need to do much more - to coordinate the work that is being done in Ecofin and the work that is being done in the Employment and Social Affairs Council. We know very well, I do not have to remind this House, that this is also due to a lack of competence, a difference in powers of competence. On the one hand, we have a process managed by the Ecofin Council within the framework of the European Semester, which is made up of binding processes and possibly also sanctions, and on the other hand we are still at the so-called open method of coordination with regard to social aspects of work.  It is clear that there is an imbalance on which we must work and we can begin to work through greater integration of the policies and priorities pursued in the social field and together with the priorities and processes that are already well regulated within Ecofin. This is certainly a very important point.  Just as it is very important – it was also raised by Mr Syley on be it – it is not a question of the european Union. Ulvskog – the theme of the involvement of the social partners. Greater involvement of the social partners is essential for the success and strengthening of the social dimension of the Europe 2020 strategy at national and European level. That is why we wanted to focus precisely on the very subject that we are discussing this morning at the trilateral social summit that we held during our presidency on 23 October. However, the process of consulting the social partners must be more lean in order to be effective. It can't have the long time you've had so far. From this point of view, therefore, we must make the dialogue between the social partners more leaner, more effective and, I would say, more interactive. We cannot limit ourselves to large summits of many hours in a day which then do not have the effect they must have in the impact on the process as a whole. The other very important issue on which we need to do more and which we have identified as a priority is the evaluation of employment and social indicators. It is certainly a step forward, it is a good starting point. Let us now give greater visibility to employment and social aspects. In addition to this visibility, more effective concrete actions will also be needed.  In the same way, we must make a much more determined commitment to gender equality. It is clear that the role of women in the labour market is part of one of those great objectives that we must continue to pursue within the Europe 2020 strategy after its review next spring. I would also like to refer to a letter signed by 22 ministers insisting on this issue, stressing the need for gender equality to be reflected more strongly in the revised strategy. We as presidency have fully supported the initiative of these 22 ministers. In conclusion, Mr President, because I want to make room and listen to the speeches, I would like to remind you of the subject of investment, the issue of growth, rehabilitation, structural reforms and investment. I am absolutely convinced that the real response to the fight against poverty, together with all the things I have just mentioned, is a new investment policy. A new investment policy which, in our view, we will see tomorrow, and the idea of the investment plan, an idea which was the view of the Italian Presidency and which Mr Juncker wanted to take on his own and which he will present tomorrow, so I cannot comment today on a plan that will be presented tomorrow. But, it seems to me, we wanted a fresh start, we wanted a whole new start. Juncker has committed to a new start, a new beginning. We believe that the investment plan is a good start, it is a positive start to develop an investment policy that must concern European policies around that plan, in particular the Europe 2020 strategy, but it must also concern national policies that must be consistent with the new choice, which we are making at European level, to aim to do what Europe has not wanted or been able to do in recent years.  What has been lacking in recent years has been an active European demand policy, active for growth, through investment. We now have this new priority and this is the real response to the fight against poverty, to job creation: public investment and private investment. Tomorrow we will have a debate in this House in which the Presidency will also take part, but this, Mr President, is certainly the most concrete, most tangible and comprehensible response for our citizens that we as the European Union can give.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 13, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Marianne Thyssen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Madam President, since the Europe 2020 strategy was adopted, we have indeed been moving away from the EU’s headline employment and social targets. For instance, the number of people living in or at risk of poverty has increased by more than 6 million. The economic and financial crisis has taken its toll: social hardship and the rise in equality call into question the fairness and effectiveness of our social market economy. However, the crisis should not make us overlook long-term social structural issues. It is accepted now that more and smarter investment in jobs, growth and competitiveness is needed. For this reason, the Commission will present a EUR 300 billion investment plan, which should mobilise money for much-needed projects to support job creation and improve living standards. I am happy that the Council has already welcomed this wholeheartedly. As regards progress towards the Europe 2020 targets, the modernisation of national labour markets and social protection systems is crucial. The European Semester with the country-specific recommendations is a key venue for calling on the Member States to make good on their commitments and deliver on their targets. The Multiannual Financial Framework supports this ambition. A greater share – at least 23% – of cohesion policy funding has been ring-fenced for the European Social Fund, of which at least 20% will be specifically allocated to promoting social inclusion and combating poverty. The globalisation fund and the fund for the most deprived can also contribute to the employment and social targets. They support workers made redundant to find jobs, and they help the most deprived maintain a level of decency. Both the existence and the distribution of these financial instruments were only secured with the very outspoken support of the European Parliament. The Youth Unemployment Initiative has been frontloaded in the first two years of the programming period, and we are working with the Member States to get the funding on the ground. As to the new Commission, there is an explicit agreement that employment and social policies and the related indicators need to be better taken into account in the European Semester. Indeed, they need to be better coordinated with economic and fiscal policies. As President Juncker said, social fairness is as important as the stability of the single currency and the solidity of public finances. We must – and we will – also work more closely with social partners.

Firstly, we want the EU 2020 strategy to take into account and promote the potential of young people. We need the entrepreneurial courage of the young generation, who shoulder the economic and social benefits of the future. Work does not create politics, work creates small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs. Secondly, we want the EU 2020 strategy to emphasise red-tape policy even more than before, less bureaucracy. This must apply to businesses, but it must also apply to all citizens, to families: less bureaucracy, more identity. Thirdly, Europe's competitiveness needs healthy sustainable demographic development. We need young people, and young people need family. So far, this demographic factor has been far too short.

We are informed that levels of private debt among households and companies – already high in some Member States – have increased significantly during the crisis. It points to rising levels of unemployment and poverty, with the long-term unemployed – those out of work for more than one year – increasing by over 80% between 2008 and 2012. Now there are some positives in the report, in that the share of young people in tertiary education has increased and the percentage of early school leavers has dropped. But equally, the share of NEETs – at 13% in 2012 – is a major source of concern. Alarmingly, it also points out that, although significant inequalities already existed in some Member States prior to the crisis, those divergences have amplified both within and between Member States. From a social perspective it warns that, while GDP and wealth have marginally increased overall, the crisis has constrained redistributive effects. So, on my part at least, all of this gives rise to a growing alarm – even panic – at what is happening across the EU, a continent that I believe is fracturing economically and politically. Those of us who support the EU as an entity need to find ways to help and support Member States to deal with this immense challenge. Some of the challenges are fiscal – are debt-related – and while they are crucial, we are not discussing them here this morning. This morning we are trying to see how we can strengthen the employment and social aspects of the EU2020 Strategy. Even though citizens will not see an immediate impact, if we can find agreement on proposals to help Member States achieve those targets, then I believe we will have done valuable work. So that is why we welcome, for the first time, the use on the scoreboard of key employment and social indicators such as child poverty levels, access to health care and homelessness. But crucially, we ask that the scoreboard be used as an early warning mechanism in order to develop suitable policies, otherwise we are just number-crunching, we are box-ticking, and that is less than useless. We also ask that employment and social considerations be put on a par with macroeconomic ones. I personally support this proposal. I know there are issues about a legal base, but I want to ask the Commissioner: What is your view on this, how do you see the possibilities of rebalancing the economic and the social, how can we make it real rather than just talking about it? This is not just about spending money. Yes, we will have the details of Juncker’s package tomorrow, but we need to be sure first of all that it is growth-friendly investment, and secondly that there is a redistributive effect from this growth. So I am asking the Commissioner: How specifically do you propose to deliver on those objectives? I was interested to hear the Council speaking earlier about integrating the 2020 objectives into the European Semester. You said yourself there is an imbalance there. We need to see how to get rid of that imbalance. Finally, job creation is crucial, and in that, ALDE strongly supports the elimination of bureaucracy and unnecessary burdens for SMEs.

Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Representative of the Council, there is no point here in multiplying the rhetoric of lamentation which in fact reveals the failure of European policies: they must be changed.  Social objectives must stop being wishful thinking and the remnants of economic policies; on the contrary, economic efficiency stems from choices of social and ecological efficiency of human well-being. We cannot hope to make progress towards more jobs without a development project, without getting out of austerity, without a credit policy of the European Central Bank that must first serve the real economy and work. Experience shows that flexible work does not create jobs, it develops social insecurity and creates poor workers. The future of a new human European project depends on debate and decisions here to invent a system of security in employment and lifelong learning, with a top priority for young people. Similarly, we will not reduce poverty without defending public services, without improving social protections instead of destroying them, without a minimum income within the European Union and without the incentive to create a guaranteed minimum wage in each country.  The reorientation of the 2020 strategy must be clear in order to consider education, social protection, public employment services as priority investments, the preservation of the climate and the ecological transition of productive systems as priority guidelines, which should no longer be taken into account in budgetary calculations on deficits.  More fundamentally, we propose to include in the work programme of Parliament, the Commission and the Council the draft of a new initiative which would be a European pact for human development, social and ecological progress by otherwise mobilising the European Investment Bank and the European Central Bank.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 20, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Jean Lambert", "mepid": "4531", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, today we are looking at the employment and social aspects of the EU 2020 strategy, but our resolution also reminds us that the strategy is designed to cover three elements: the smart, the sustainable and the inclusive. If we are not bearing all three parts in mind, as our resolution recalls, we are not actually going to be moving forward, because it is that integration and cooperation which gives us that direction. We are also very clear that the search for growth is not an end in itself. It is more about political choices to reduce inequalities and to tackle poverty. The benefits need to be spread throughout society and not just concentrated in the hands of those that are already rich. It is clear that we are moving away from what, in our view, were already pretty unambitious poverty reduction targets. But it is also clear that work in itself is not the answer. If you look, for example, at the report of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation which was published yesterday in the UK, 50% of those in the UK who are in poverty or at risk of poverty are in work. Social security benefits are important; they are a key stabiliser, and they actually give people a base from which to be able to move forward. As others have also been saying, the quality of work – decent work, a job you can build a life on – is also a key element of a job-rich recovery and this strategy. So we do need to look at the abusive practices that we have. We need to look at the way in which people are working many, many hours and still actually cannot afford to live a decent life. It is not enough for us to end the biting austerity measures – which have had such a destructive effect on so many lives – if we are not engaged in a socially-just transition which is going to tackle inequality and move us towards a low-carbon economy, which is also part of the EU 2020 strategy. The issue of bureaucracy and administration costs for businesses is important, but removing that does not necessarily give you a better society with decent work either. You have to look at the outcome of what you are doing. We very much welcome the Council’s words about the balancing of the social and economic dimension, because we think that the reaction to the financial crisis has been one of stand-alone economics and that it has not taken into account the need to actually develop people’s lives. So, yes, we would agree that new investment is needed, but we should not forget – as the Commissioner has said – that we need to make the money that we are already spending through the structural funds – including the social fund – work properly. Parliament has an oversight role there too. And finally I also very much welcome the words of the Council on the reference to governance. It is not just about social partners and the engagement of local and regional authorities; civil society also has a key role to play in this area, and it needs to be there as part of the discussion as well as part of the delivery.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 21, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Laura Agea", "mepid": "124811", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against poverty and marginalisation is a key aspect of the Europe 2020 strategy, as is job creation, but if there is no job, citizens must still be guaranteed a decent life. That is why it is necessary to break up work and income, and that is precisely what citizenship income is for.

Many European countries have already implemented such a measure, but in Italy our proposal has been mocked. But instead of stopping, we decided to think big and suggest it here in the European Parliament, where you received the support of the European Commissioner for Labour, Marianne Thyssen, during her hearing.

The truth is that, so far, the strategy for exiting the crisis has met fiscal consolidation criteria, leaving behind measures aimed at stimulating economic growth.  In this battle, social cohesion and the fight against unemployment are the main victims. Iniquity between Member States is clearly visible and continues to increase. Europe cannot continue to operate at two speeds.

It is imperative to implement the programme for jobs, growth and investment that Mr Juncker will present in this House tomorrow.

Europe is getting old, its young people are fleeing and they will rejuvenate other continents. Ms Thyssen rightly said that the funds for globalisation and for the most unprotected have to be more carefully managed. That's true, but that's just not enough. We must provide the business fabric of the Member States with effective support mechanisms and instruments. We need to improve access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises, as they create jobs and sustain the economy, as well as focus more heavily on competitiveness factors in order to promote real sustainable reindustrialisation.

There are currently over 24 million unemployed in the EU. More than one in five young people are unemployed and in some countries youth unemployment is over 50%.

Yes, some people even have two jobs, but they still can't afford the day and the road.  Today, more than 122 million people in the EU are at risk of poverty or social exclusion. For particularly vulnerable groups such as people with disabilities, the poverty rate is 70% higher than the average. Inequality between rich and poor is on the rise. In 2012, the top fifth earned five times as much as the bottom fifth. In other words, this is not a success story.  If jobs are to be created for people to live on and if poverty is to be combated, it requires, first and foremost, a showdown with the eu's current policy. This requires a showdown with the EU's policy of cuts, with the EU's one-sided focus on competitiveness. This requires a showdown focusing on economic growth, without the recognition that the whole of society should benefit from growth.  There's other buns on the soup.

Quantifiable targets for employment, for equality, for education, for the fight against poverty: the importance of these issues cannot be overstated, and I think that brings us a considerable step closer to economic and social cohesion in Europe and is an important contribution to a more social Europe. Because I believe that the citizens need this social Europe. We need a social union, especially as a counterweight to economic and monetary union. It is precisely the citizens who must no longer see Europe as a vehicle for austerity or the assertion of neoliberal interests, but must also see Europe as a guarantor of social rights and their personal social rights.

There is record unemployment, life-saving jobs are already becoming a luxury, women are often deported to involuntary part-time work, and in many Member States young people are already talking about a so-called lost generation. This is an alarming state of affairs. I am not really surprised that we are sitting here today talking about the failure to achieve the Europe 2020 targets. We have a fundamental design flaw in the whole matter. Anyone who believes that austerity can combat poverty or create jobs must go astray, and that must fail. We need a holistic approach to reform, a change of course away from austerity policy, a reform of the Stability and Growth Pact and a rethinking of our crisis-fighting policy to date, which has not actually fought the crisis at all, but has exacerbated it even further, especially for the most vulnerable. I think that this resolution, which we are adopting together today, is a very important step, because it brings a holistic, broad approach to combating poverty, how to create sustainable growth and green jobs. There is also talk of a reform of economic and monetary union, of the importance of public services, of the need to involve civil society in social Europe.

Employment and social affairs are one of the key elements of the Europe 2020 Strategy, which aims to ensure inclusive growth.

But at the same time, we realize that Europe's biggest scourge remains unemployed young people. In March 2014, there were nearly 5,340,000 young people under the age of 25 unemployed in the European Union. We cannot expect young people to participate in Europe's political life when they are unemployed. Among other European Union mechanisms, small and medium-sized enterprises are one of the main tools for successfully tackling youth unemployment. They have significant job creation potential and play a crucial role in the transition to a new sustainable economy. That is why I would like to emphasise the need to create an environment conducive to small and medium-sized enterprises by providing easier access to credit, removing unnecessary administrative barriers and, of course, the need for their connectivity and internationalisation.

The recipes put into practice by the EU in recent years and by the Member States have in some cases even made the situation worse.

Today, Pope Francis, you are speaking to a European Parliament whose members represent more than 500 million people from 28 Member States. Members of this House represent the diversity of Europe. Over the past six years, Europe has experienced a dramatic and unprecedented crisis. This crisis has serious consequences. The loss of trust in people in their institutions, at national and also at European level, is particularly dramatic. This loss of confidence is enormous. Without trust, however, no idea, let alone an institution, can survive permanently. That is why the cooperation of all forces is necessary in order to regain the lost trust. In this respect, the concerns of the European Union and its institutions and those of the Catholic Church go hand in hand to a large extent. The values of tolerance, respect, equality, solidarity and peace are part of our common mission. The European Union stands for each other rather than against each other, for inclusion rather than exclusion. Young people are struggling to find work and their place in our society, migrants are looking for a better future for themselves and their children, people are fleeing wars and disasters and are seeking asylum and protection here. Whether it is the issue of social justice or the unequal distribution of wealth and life chances, whether it is about the situation of old people in our society, or whether it is about wars and conflicts in our neighbourhood and beyond, we face common challenges. Your holiness, your words have enormous significance. Not only because you are the religious leader of more than a billion Catholics. Your words are extremely important because they concern us all, because they are also addressed to all of us and are valid for all of us, because the issues you raise affect us all and concern us all. These themes are universal. Her words provide orientation in times of disorientation. Their messages of peace and dialogue, sincerity and responsibility for each other, solidarity and coexistence clearly show us that we must solve common tasks together, that we are stronger together than alone. Their message is a very European message. It is precisely on this message that the idea of European unification is based. And your history, your holiness, is a European story. The story of a family that has left Europe and found a new home in South America. It is the story of a pope who returns from the other side of the Atlantic, from the other side of the world, to reform his Church and lead the faithful. It is a story that can serve as a model for us and help Europe to renew and reform itself.

I would like to express my particular gratitude to you, Mr President of Parliament, for the warm words of welcome you have addressed to me on behalf of all members of this House. My visit comes more than a quarter of a century after that made by Pope John Paul II. Much has changed since those days in Europe and around the world. There are no longer the opposing blocs which then divided the continent in two, and the desire is slowly being made that 'Europe, by sovereignly giving itself free institutions, can one day extend to the dimensions given to it by geography and even more by history'. Alongside a wider European Union, there is also a more complex and highly moving world. An increasingly interconnected and global world and therefore less and less \"Eurocentric\". A larger, more influential Union, however, seems to be accompanied by the image of a Europe that is somewhat aged and compressed, which tends to feel less protagonist in a context that often looks at it with detachment, mistrust and sometimes with suspicion.  In addressing you today, starting from my vocation as pastor, I would like to send a message of hope and encouragement to all European citizens. A message of hope based on the confidence that difficulties can become powerful engines of unity, in order to overcome all the fears that Europe - together with the whole world - is going through. Hope in the Lord who transforms evil into good and death into life.  Encouragement to return to the firm conviction of the founding fathers of the European Union, who wanted a future based on the ability to work together to overcome divisions and to foster peace and communion among all the peoples of the continent. At the heart of this ambitious political project was trust in man, not so much as a citizen, nor as an economic entity, but in man as a person with transcendent dignity. First of all, I would like to stress the close link that exists between these two words: 'dignity' and 'transcendent'.  \"Dignity\" is the key word that characterized the recovery of the second post-war period. Our recent history is characterized by the undoubted centrality of the promotion of human dignity against the multiple violence and discriminations that have not been lacking in Europe over the centuries either. The perception of the importance of human rights arises precisely as the result of a long journey, also made up of multiple sufferings and sacrifices, which has helped to form the awareness of the preciousness, uniqueness and unrepeability of every single human person. This cultural awareness is based not only in the events of history, but above all in European thought, characterized by a rich encounter, whose many distant sources come \"from Greece and Rome, from Celtic, Germanic and Slavic substrates, and from Christianity that has shaped them deeply\", giving rise precisely to the concept of \"person\". Today, the promotion of human rights plays a central role in the European Union's commitment to promoting the dignity of the individual, both internally and in relations with other countries. This is an important and admirable commitment, because there are still far too many situations in which human beings are treated as objects, whose conception, configuration and usefulness can be programmed, and which can then be thrown away when they are no longer needed, because they have become weak, sick or old. Indeed, what dignity exists when there is no possibility of freely expressing one's thoughts or of professing one's religious faith without constraint? What dignity is possible without a clear legal framework that limits the domination of force and makes the law prevail over the tyranny of power? What dignity can a man or a woman ever have, the subject of all kinds of discrimination? What dignity can a person who does not have the food or the bare minimum for living find and, worse still, who has nothing but the work of dignity?  Promoting the dignity of the person means recognising that he has inalienable rights of which he cannot be deprived of any arbitrariness, let alone for the benefit of economic interests.  However, care must be taken not to fall into some misunderstandings that may arise from a misunderstanding of the concept of human rights and their paradoxical abuse. In fact, there is now a tendency towards an ever-increasing demand for individualism – I am tempted to say individualistic – which conceals a conception of a human person detached from every social and anthropological context, almost as a \"monad\" (μονάς), increasingly insensitive to the other \"monads\" around him. The concept of law no longer seems to be associated with the equally essential and complementary concept of duty, so that we end up affirming the rights of the individual without taking into account that every human being is linked to a social context, in which his rights and duties are linked to those of others and to the common good of society itself. I therefore believe that it is very vital today to deepen a culture of human rights that can skilfully link the individual, or rather, personal dimension, to that of the common good, to that \"we-all\" formed by individuals, families and intermediate groups that unite in a social community. In fact, if everyone's right is not harmoniously ordained to the greatest good, it ends up conceiving itself without limitations and therefore becoming a source of conflict and violence.  To speak of the transcendent dignity of man, therefore, means to appeal to his nature, to his innate ability to distinguish good from evil, to that \"compass\" inscribed in our hearts and which God has imprinted in the created universe; above all it means looking at man not as an absolute, but as a relational being. One of the diseases that I see most prevalent in Europe today is loneliness, which is the very loneliness of those without links. It is particularly evident in the elderly, often left to their fate, as well as in young people without reference points and opportunities for the future; you can see it in the many poor people who populate our cities; you can see it in the lost eyes of the migrants who came here in search of a better future.  This loneliness was then exacerbated by the economic crisis, the effects of which still persist with dramatic social consequences. It can also be seen that, in recent years, alongside the process of enlarging the European Union, public mistrust of institutions considered distant, committed to establishing rules perceived as far removed from the sensitivity of individual peoples, or even harmful, has increased. In many quarters we get a general impression of tiredness and ageing, of a europe that is a grandmother and no longer fertile and lively. So the great ideals that inspired Europe seem to have lost its attractiveness, in favour of the bureaucratic technicality of its institutions.  This is associated with somewhat selfish lifestyles, characterized by an opulence now unsustainable and often indifferent to the surrounding world, especially the poorest. It is regrettable that technical and economic issues prevail at the heart of the political debate, to the detriment of a genuine anthropological orientation. The human being is in danger of being reduced to a mere cog in a mechanism that treats it as a consumer good to be used, so that – as we often note – when life is not functional to this mechanism it is discarded without much hesitation, as in the case of the sick, the terminally ill, the abandoned and careless elderly, or children killed before they are born.  It is the great misunderstanding that occurs 'when the absolutization of technology prevails', which ends up creating 'a confusion between ends and means'. Inevitable result of the \"culture of waste\" and \"exasperated consumerism\". On the contrary, affirming the dignity of the person means recognizing the preciousness of human life, which is given to us free of charge and cannot therefore be exchanged or disposed of. You, in your vocation as Parliamentarians, are also called to a great mission, although it may seem pointless: to take care of the fragility of peoples and people. Caring for fragility says strength and tenderness, says struggle and fecundity in the midst of a functionalist and privatist model that leads inexorably to the \"culture of waste\". Caring for the fragility of people and peoples means preserving memory and hope; it means taking charge of the present in its most marginal and distressing situation and being able to aage it of dignity. How, then, can we restore hope to the future, so that, starting with the younger generations, confidence can be restored in order to pursue the great ideal of a united and peaceful, creative and enterprising Europe, respectful of rights and aware of its duties? To answer this question, let me use an image. One of Raphael's most famous frescoes in the Vatican depicts the so-called School of Athens. At its center are Plato and Aristotle. The first with the finger pointing upwards, towards the world of ideas, we could say to the sky; the second extends his hand forward, towards the one who looks, towards the earth, concrete reality. It seems to me to be an image that well describes Europe and its history, made up of the continuous encounter between heaven and earth, where heaven indicates openness to the transcendent, to God, who has always distinguished European man, and the earth represents his practical and concrete ability to face situations and problems. The future of Europe depends on the rediscovery of the vital and inseparable link between these two elements. A Europe that is no longer able to open itself to the transcendent dimension of life is a Europe that slowly risks losing its soul and also that \"humanistic spirit\" that it also loves and defends.  Precisely starting from the need for an openness to the transcendent, I intend to affirm the centrality of the human person, otherwise at the mercy of the fashions and powers of the moment. In this sense, I consider fundamental not only the heritage that Christianity has left in the past to the socio-cultural formation of the continent, but above all the contribution it intends to make today and in the future to its growth. This contribution does not constitute a danger to the secularity of the States and to the independence of the Union's institutions, but to enrichment. This is shown by the ideals that formed it from the beginning, such as peace, subsidiarity and mutual solidarity, a humanism focused on respect for the dignity of the person. I would therefore like to renew the readiness of the Holy See and the Catholic Church, through the Commission of European Bishops' Conferences, to have a fruitful, open and transparent dialogue with the institutions of the European Union. Likewise, I am convinced that a Europe that is able to treasure its religious roots, knowing how to grasp its richness and potential, can also be more easily immune from the many extremisms that are rampant in today's world, not least because of the great ideal vacuum we are witnessing in the so-called West, because \"it is precisely God's oblivion, and not its glorification, that generates violence\".  We cannot fail to mention here the many injustices and persecutions that affect religious, and particularly Christian, minorities in different parts of the world on a daily basis. Communities and persons who find themselves subjected to barbaric violence: driven from their homes and homelands; sold as slaves; killed, beheaded, crucified and burned alive, under the shameful and complicit silence of so many. The Motto of the European Union is 'Unity in Diversity', but unity does not mean political, economic, cultural or thought uniformity. In reality, every authentic unit lives on the richness of the diversity that makes it up: as a family, which is all the more united the more each of its members can be fully self-fearless. In this respect, I believe that Europe is a family of peoples, who will be able to feel close to the institutions of the Union if they are able to skilfully combine the ideal of unity that they yearn for, with the diversity of each one, enhancing individual traditions; becoming aware of its history and roots; freeing himself from the many manipulations and phobias. Putting the human person at the centre means first of all letting it freely express its face and creativity, both at the level of the individual and at the level of the people.  On the other hand, the peculiarities of each one constitute an authentic wealth inso far as they are put at the service of all. We must always remember the european Union's own architecture, based on the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity, so that mutual aid prevails and we can walk, animated by mutual trust. In this dynamic of unity and particularity, you, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, also have the need to take responsibility for keeping alive the democracy of the peoples of Europe. There is no hiding the fact that a homologous conception of the whole world affects the vitality of the democratic system by de-strengthening the rich, fruitful and constructive conflict between political organisations and parties. So you run the risk of living in the realm of idea, of speech alone, of image, of sophisma... and end up confusing the reality of democracy with a new political nominalism. Keeping democracy alive in Europe requires avoiding so many \"globalizing ways\" of diluting reality: angelic purisms, the totalitarianisms of its kind, atoric fundamentalism, ethicalism without goodness, intellectualism without wisdom. Keeping the reality of democracies alive is a challenge of this historic moment, preventing their real strength – the expressive political force of the peoples – from being removed in the face of pressure from non-universal multinational interests, weakening them and transforming them into uniform systems of financial power in the service of unknown empires. This is a challenge that history presents to you today. Giving hope Europe does not only mean recognising the centrality of the human person, but also promoting its skills. It is therefore a question of investing in it and in the areas in which its talents are formed and bear fruit. The first area is certainly that of education, starting with the family, a fundamental cell and a precious element of every society. The united, fertile and indissoluble family brings with it the fundamental elements to give hope to the future. Without this solidity we end up building on sand, with serious social consequences. On the other hand, emphasizing the importance of the family not only helps to give prospects and hope to the new generations, but also to the many elderly people, often forced to live in conditions of loneliness and abandonment because there is no longer the warmth of a domestic hearth able to accompany and support them. Alongside the family are educational institutions: schools and universities. Education cannot be limited to providing a set of technical knowledge, but must promote the more complex process of growth of the human person as a whole. Today's young people are asking to be able to have adequate and complete training to look to the future with hope, rather than disillusionment. Europe's creative potential in various fields of scientific research is also numerous, some of which have not yet been fully explored. We need only think, for example, of alternative sources of energy, the development of which would greatly benefit the protection of the environment.  Europe has always been at the forefront of a commendable commitment to ecology. In fact, this land of ours needs continuous care and attention and everyone has a personal responsibility to preserve creation, a precious gift that God has put in the hands of men. This means, on the one hand, that nature is at our disposal, we can enjoy it and make good use of it; on the other hand, however, it means that we are not the masters. Keepers, but not masters. We must therefore love and respect it, while \"instead we are often guided by the pride of domination, possessing, manipulating, exploiting; we do not \"custody\" it, we do not respect it, we do not consider it as a free gift to take care of\". Respect for the environment, however, means not only avoiding disfiguring it, but also using it for good. I am thinking in particular of the agricultural sector, which is called upon to give support and nourishment to man. It cannot be tolerated that millions of people in the world starve to death, while tonnes of food are discarded from our tables every day. Moreover, respecting nature reminds us that man himself is a fundamental part of it. In addition to an environmental ecology, we therefore need that human ecology, made up of respect for the person, which I wanted to recall today by addressing you. The second area in which the talents of the human person flourish is work. It is time to promote employment policies, but above all it is necessary to restore dignity to work, while also ensuring adequate conditions for its implementation. This implies, on the one hand, finding new ways of combining market flexibility with the need for stability and certainty of job prospects, which are essential for the human development of workers; on the other hand, it means promoting an adequate social context, which is not about the exploitation of people, but about ensuring, through work, the possibility of building a family and educating children.  Similarly, the issue of migration must be tackled together. We cannot allow the Mediterranean Sea to become a great graveyard! On the boats that arrive on European shores on a daily basis, there are men and women who need reception and help. The lack of mutual support within the European Union risks encouraging special solutions to the problem, which do not take into account the human dignity of immigrants, encouraging slave labour and continuing social tensions. Europe will be able to cope with immigration issues if it is able to clearly propose its cultural identity and implement appropriate legislation that can at the same time protect the rights of European citizens and guarantee the reception of migrants; if it is able to adopt correct, courageous and concrete policies that help their countries of origin in socio-political development and in overcoming internal conflicts – the main cause of this phenomenon – instead of the policies of interest that increase and fuel these conflicts. It is necessary to act on the causes and not only on the effects. Mr President, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, awareness of one's own identity is also necessary in order to engage in a proactive dialogue with the States that have applied to join the Union in the future. I am thinking in particular of those in the Balkan area for whom the in the European Union will be able to respond to the ideal of peace in a region that has suffered greatly from the conflicts of the past. Finally, awareness of one's identity is indispensable in relations with other neighbouring countries, particularly those bordering the Mediterranean, many of which suffer as a result of internal conflicts and the pressure of religious fundamentalism and international terrorism. It is up to you legislators to preserve and grow the European identity, so that citizens can regain confidence in the Union's institutions and in the peace and friendship project that undersoes it. Knowing that \"the more the power of men grows, the more their personal and collective responsibility is extended and expanded\". I therefore urge you to work to make Europe rediscover its good soul.  An anonymous author of the second century wrote that \" Christians represent in the world what the soul is in the body\". The task of the soul is to support the body, to be its conscience and historical memory. And a two-thousand-year history links Europe and Christianity. A story not without conflicts and errors, even sins, but always animated by the desire to build for good. We see it in the beauty of our cities, and even more so in that of the many works of charity and common human edification that support the continent. This story, for the most part, is yet to be written. It is our present and also our future. It is our identity. And Europe is in great need of rediscovering its face in order to grow, in the spirit of its founding fathers, in peace and harmony, since it itself is not yet free from conflict. Dear MEPs, the time has come to build together the Europe that revolves not around the economy, but around the sacredness of the human person, of inalienable values; Europe, which boldly embraces its past and looks with confidence to its future in order to live its present fully and with hope. The time has come to abandon the idea of a Europe that is afraid and bent over itself in order to arouse and promote Europe as a protagonist, bearer of science, art, music, human values and even faith. Europe that contemplates heaven and pursues ideals; the Europe that looks at, defends and protects man; europe that walks on the earth safe and firm, a precious point of reference for all humanity!

I hope that the resolution adopted today will move in this direction, stimulating the development of a more constructive strategy, based on the exchange of best practices between Member States, innovation and targeted economic interventions that guarantee, for example, better access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises, greater stability in the financial sector and the promotion of new public and private partnerships.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 775, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Siôn Simon (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "124948", "text": "  in writing. - Today I voted in favour of Parliamentʼs resolution on employment and social aspects of the Europe 2020 Strategy.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you said, Madam President, the conciliation committee has not been able to succeed. So it's a big disappointment but it's also a real hope.  It is a great disappointment because the conclusion was a finding of failure and because it was not until Monday 17 November, the last day of conciliation, that the Council's proposal was obtained at 1 p.m. For almost 21 days, our conciliation was hemiplegic, only one of the two branches of the budgetary authority worked. It is also a disappointment because the ministers were very absent during all these discussions. Mr Zanetti has done everything he could, and I want to praise his efforts, but the other people present did not really have a mandate, who were, no doubt, busy to deal with the problems of amending the regulation with regard to Member States' participation in the European Union budget. Finally, it is also a disappointment because the proposal that came to us at 1 p.m. on Monday, November 17 was unacceptable.  So I also said that this committee finally gave us real hope. It gives the Council hope that Europe cannot remain in such a situation that unpaid debts are piling up on the Commission's desk: 5 billion in 2010, probably 30 billion at the end of 2014. However, when there are unforeseen revenues - and this is what happened in 2014, almost 5 billion unanticipated revenues - they must be used to pay the oldest bills. We are hopeful that, in the coming days, we will be able to share this principle with the Council because allowing unpaid invoices to accumulate on the Commission's desk is to damage the credit of the European Union, which thus creates counterfeit money.  There are resources, the question is simple: should these unforeseen resources of five billion go into the accounts of the Member States or should they be used as a priority to pay unpaid bills?

Firstly, I am disappointed because my conviction is established - and it is not only mine but that of many parliamentarians - that the Council has spent much more time trying to resolve problems among its members, as a result of the 'rant' - forgive me the expression - which mr Cameron has given, with regard to the rebalancing of the contributions of the various Member States. , to try to agree on a common position on the 2014 and 2015 amending budgets.

Mr President, we want a 2015 budget that is realistic. You have reduced the commitment appropriations, you have further reduced the payment appropriations by $2 billion, whereas this budget has the lowest payment appropriations we have seen in recent years. We have also told you, and we confirm this, that we want Parliament and the Council to agree on a procedure, mechanism or plan to phase out unpaid debts in order to avoid the asphyxiation of the Commission's budget in the future, either by strangling commitments or by the fact that delays in payments will become unbearable.

The European Union cannot be delinquent to its citizens, its organisations, its municipalities, or its students. And, in order to defend this proposal, which is so easy, we have given them legal arguments, because Article 310 TFEU says that the European Union budget has to be balanced.

And even reasons for opportunity, because we have an extra 5 billion euros of income, which can help alleviate the situation. But it's clear that all these motives haven't worked. Thomas Paine once said that 'time produces more converts than reason', and I think it is a perfect description of what has happened at the European Council. Because over time they are advancing in positions, over time they understand that we have a problem of defaults, and over time they understand that the multiannual financial framework, even partially, has parts of flexibility. We had twenty-one days to reach an agreement and it was not possible; so we give them extra time to see if we have any more converts within the Council. He said earlier that, in preparing this intervention, he collected all the arguments, but he also tried to think if I could come up with any new ideas, some magic phrase, some key word that manages to get the Council out of that hypnosis that doesn't seem to let them see what the reality is. And the magic word was said to me today by Mr Renzi at a meeting we had: politics. That is what we need, because it is politics that will allow us to get out of this rigidity that we have in the Council today. Because it is politics that will allow us to move forward with agreements and get out of this blocking situation. The European Parliament is prepared to put all policies and proposals on the table, but we need receptiveness from the Council. And, if the Council wants to make proposals to solve the problem of defaults, we will accept them, because all we want is to be able to pay people, be able to pay for the projects and move the European project forward.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 804, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Monika Hohlmeier", "mepid": "96780", "text": "  Rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the excellent work he has I am far from happy that the Member States have not been able to reach a compromise. The image we are giving to the outside world is actually relatively confused, even in a difficult time of crisis. At a time of crisis, we are expected to boldly focus on what has been on everyone's agenda for months – I would almost have said in Sunday speeches – and that is called growth, that is called jobs, it is called social stabilisation, it is called innovation, that is called research and so on and so forth. In this context, it is, of course, particularly incomprehensible to expect five billion in fines or other payments to be returned in the European Union, to have old invoices of 6.3 billion and for the Commission to make a proposal of 4.7 billion that one would have liked to have paid. Now we enter the typical technocratic debate, which is not understood by any public. What is in contingency, what is outside the ceilings, what is inside the ceilings? It takes me an hour to explain to anyone what we are debating here technocratically. There is simply no one outside who understands that we have open invoices, that we have money in our accounts, but that we are unable to pay the bills because the Member States would like to have it returned to their budgets, but do not want to pay the old invoices. I say this so aggressively here: the old bills should be as little discussed as possible. They must be paid. We once had the consensus here that old bills should be paid and not a debt to take into the next year. That was actually a fundamental principle of this European Union, which we are currently breaking with. The second is that if we transfer too much of old bills to the budget, we will put Commissioner Georgieva in an almost impossible state. The new programmes will be launched, including important programmes. I am now deliberately mentioning one that the whole of the European Parliament has been hanging on to and which has got off to a brilliant start and is fulfilling exactly the purpose that we have set ourselves: namely, the new Horizon 2020 programme, which has been designed to support innovation and research for small and medium-sized enterprises. Which companies are the most involved? They are Italian and Spanish small and medium-sized enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises from countries that are not doing so well economically at the moment. Now that 95% of these companies are rejected or even unable to apply for the programme, we are frustrated by those who really use all their skills to be there for science and research. In this context, I therefore ask that old invoices be paid and that the new programmes should not be deleted too much, because otherwise we will no longer be able to fulfil what is necessary in the essential areas.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 805, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Enrico Zanetti", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Mr President- in-Office of the Council. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Vice-President Georgieva, I too, of course, open my speech by expressing regret that it has not been possible to reach agreement on the budget between our institutions within 21 days of the conciliation period.  There is no doubt that a number of elements, some of a more technical nature and others of a political nature, have undoubtedly contributed to the failure of the negotiations. Conciliation was not a vain exercise, however: important progress has been made on the most controversial issues in relation to the starting positions, and I am thinking in particular of the use of the contingency margin on amending budget No 3. In this regard, the Council accepted the use for 2014 of this budgetary flexibility instrument precisely to address the exceptional situation of unpaid invoices and other previous commitments pending liquidation. I believe that this is objectively a good thing, the result of a debate that is not taken for granted and which should not be underestimated, all the more so given the Council's initial position of clear closure on this point. It is clear that the agreement on the level of use of the contingency margin has not been reached, but work can be done on this during the negotiations that will open immediately after the presentation by the European Commission of the new 2015 budget proposal.  Further progress has been made by the Council on the position on the 2015 budget compared with the position adopted last September with the availability of a reduction in cuts in payment appropriations compared to the budget proposal presented by the European Commission. This progress, too, was not considered adequate with a view to an agreement, and even the Commission's subsequent compromise proposal, formulated at the final stage of conciliation, failed to bring positions closer together while containing elements in this direction. It is clear, however, that at this point we must start from the positive elements of the negotiations carried out so far and find the basis for reaching an overall agreement in the coming days. We must therefore first await the Commission's new budget proposal, which will have to take account of the discussions held with the Council and the European Parliament. We hope that this proposal will provide an optimal starting point for the timely establishment of a common position enabling the 2015 budget to be adopted by next December. The Italian Presidency will clearly work in this direction, as it has worked in recent months, hoping for and urging the active contribution of all the institutions involved.

We were with President Schulz and it took us a while to reach the Chamber. I am here reflecting on what we heard earlier today from Pope Francis. He spoke to us about the risk that we get so caught up in technicalities – in our case it would be margins and ceilings and payment credits and commitments – that we lose sight of why we are here and what we have to do. What we have to do is bring resources to help our people, our small businesses, our municipalities, our farmers, our teachers, the elderly that rely on social programmes that we fund, and this is what it is so important for us to keep focused on. Like Parliament, like the Council, we regret very much that agreement was not reached in conciliation on Monday night and that we started negotiations in earnest late and could not complete them, but we are working very hard to make it possible for us to facilitate, in our position of honest broker, the next stage of trialogue so that the Council and Parliament can agree on amending budgets for 2014 that would write off income from fines already collected to shrink the Union’s unpaid bills, so that we are able to agree on a sound budget for 2015 that can underpin investments in competitiveness, growth and jobs and would underpin a strong Europe in the world, and so that we can agree on the next steps in the coming months – that the Commission would come up with a payment plan that shows how we can further shrink the bills that we are not supposed to have. We are not supposed to have unpaid bills in the Union, and of course we count very much on the Member States as well because, to come with a credible payment plan, we have to work with our Member States as well as with Parliament. I will finish with three points. My commitment here is that first we will put forward on Friday for approval in the Commission a revised draft budget for 2015 as required by the Treaty. Second, we will participate actively in the trialogue in the following days with a view to reaching an agreement, and third, we are also working on a budget in case we do not have an agreement.

It is important that, in this space that we now have, we take it as an opportunity, an opportunity for a new draft budget, an opportunity also to reach an agreement within the Council.

We don't want more money, we want to help pay off debts, our ambition is no longer even to pay what we owe, is to stabilize the debt. We want credibility, we also want to, and I would like to welcome the payment plan for the future, Commissioner, but it is important that this payment plan is not made at the expense of delays in programmes that should already be in place, because when we are saying that at the end of this year we run the risk of having 30 billion euros of unpaid invoices , this means that we are harming growth and jobs, penalising small and medium-sized enterprises, also contributing to difficulties for national and local authorities, harming farmers.

The net contributors regard their payments to the EU budget as lost grants and not as means of achieving jointly agreed policy objectives. The net recipient countries, of course, see it quite differently, but they do not prevail in the Council. As a result, the EU budget is stocked according to national discretion and not according to political needs. Within the framework of the commitments, the EU Commission pledges to finance projects that are not paid for by the Council. The victims are students, cities and municipalities that cannot pay for their urban development projects are small and medium-sized enterprises. If there is still evidence that the EU needs real own resources, here it is! In the short term, however, even that would not be a solution and, at the moment, the Council is failing to adopt a dogmatic attitude. In doing so, a concession from the Council might not solve a serious problem, but at least would contribute to a short-term stabilisation. The Commission needs EUR 4.7 billion to ensure that the situation on unpaid bills does not get any worse. On the other hand, we have EUR 5 billion in fines collected.

Payment arrears have been rapidly increasing in recent years, amounting to close to EUR 30 billion at the end of 2014, which means that they are already at a level that threatens the liquidity of the EU budget.  In this situation, Parliament should firmly maintain its position towards the Council and the Commission with the simultaneous resolution of six amending budgets for 2014 and the 2015 budget. It is of particular importance that nearly EUR 5 billion of the penalties and fines that have entered the Union budget this year should not be returned to member states' budgets and be used to pay the most urgent payments. It is also necessary to increase the level of payments in the 2015 budget by at least several billion euros compared to the Council's proposal.

It is our duty as the Commission to provide a credible underpinning to the decisions of the two sides of the budget authority, and we will do our duty.

I want to assure you that we will look at these two issues – the immediate budget, forming the budget for Europe, as well as the longer-term sustainability of our budget – equally seriously.

This is not the time, I believe, to fossilise ourselves on recriminations, on why conciliation did not give the desired result. We have a second half which must be properly exploited.  Of course, as a contribution to the debate, I would like to underline what Mr Mc8/80 has said. Bresso on the importance of own resources. I say this precisely from the point of view of experience gained during participation in this work on the budget. There is no doubt that the Council must be the Council and not a multilateral table of 28. There is also no doubt, however, that on the specific issue of the allocation of resources from the European budget, each individual country also has a role as a contributor which, as such, inevitably and understandably leads it to make assessments linked also to its budgetary problems, which sometimes also often result from the need to comply with obligations of European derivation. This interweaving which, year after year, is in danger of becoming inextricable and which, in order to have a real solution, implies not only that there are own resources but, I would add, that there are own resources that are recognisable and directly identifiable as such by the citizens.  Citizens need to know how much they pay for each level of government: at local level ( I am thinking of town halls), at regional level, at national level and also at European level. This is the best way for everyone to have real full responsibility, and where I really mean all the players in the process for everyone, because at a time when there is a European tax that is directly perceived as such, it is clear that the European institutions other than the Council of Contributors themselves will also need to respond more directly to the fiscal burdens that the increased budgetary allocations may determine. So that step is definitely important. This is a contribution I make to the positive debate we have had today; For the rest, the Presidency is doing its utmost to ensure that this second half ends with the result that objectively it would have been better to have already had a few days ago, but which, once it arrives, will leave us all certainly satisfied.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 840, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Jean Arthuis", "mepid": "124773", "text": "  Chairman of the Budgets Committee.

The study by the European Union's Agency for Fundamental Rights kept public this year yields shocking data. More than nine million women in Europe have been victims of some form of violence. Let's remember we're not talking about a fringe group. Let's remember we're talking about half the population. Older and young women, who live in cities and in the rural environment, who study, who work, with or without a good economic situation. We're talking about women. Of all the women. The European Union must be a space free of violence. We will not accept the excuse of lack of competence so as not to implement all necessary initiatives. Citizens will not understand that in Europe we have agreed to save the banks and do not agree to save women's lives. That is why today, 25 November, we are expressing our demand to launch a directive against gender-based violence. The last legislature, most of this House, supported this proposal. We believe that it is important that legislation is put in place, as has already been done in some Member States. The European Union cannot look the other way when the fundamental rights of such a large percentage of the population are being violated so heartbreakingly: millions of women who are being violent just because they are women. A comprehensive policy is needed to act in all areas: in prevention, in treatment; that includes police, legal, economic, social measures, not to mention educational ones. Because women have to know that the state is ampara. It's not your problems, it's our problems. Putting a face, face, on the violence faced by women will help many of those who hide behind shame and guilt today know that it is time to end silence. And part of our work and commitment lies in making visible a reality that was long ago in the realm of the private, without being considered a social problem. We want 2016 to be declared the European Year against Gender-Based Violence. Because decision-making, citizenship awareness is essential, but so is the awareness of community institutions, which must achieve greater commitment to the society they represent. Today a large number of social organizations and women are working on the support and treatment of victims. From here I express my sense of appreciation for your work and the requirement that the Community budget in this area not be cut. We have already had to see how in some countries the policy of cuts and austerity has been a setback in the measures being pushed forward in the fight against gender-based violence. Please let's not forget that cutting in policies against gender-based violence is cutting back on lives. In addition, we must keep in mind that many of the women who do not have financial resources at the moment do not report because they have no possibility of undertaking autonomous and free lives. Commissioner, it is difficult to see how, year after year, on 25 November we are having the same debate. We lament injustice. We're asking for more commitment. It's time to get down to business. We can't wait another minute. Don't let it be one more, because then, for many women, next year will be too late.

It is an important symbol that the debate is taking place today on 25 November: the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. I hope that in one year’s time I will be allowed here to speak about better results and a better situation in the field we are going to speak about. Violence against women remains one of the most serious human rights violations of our time. It is deeply rooted in gender inequalities and reinforces them. It is an extreme form of discrimination. One in three women in the European Union has experienced physical or sexual violence since the age of fifteen. I was myself shocked by reading the latest figures given by the Fundamental Rights Agency in Vienna. I did not know myself that the situation is that bad in the European Union. I would like to stress in this place that for me, this problem is not a matter of statistics, because this concerns any individual. We had the Pope here today. He spoke about human dignity. This is what is at stake in this problem, in this field: not only human dignity but lives themselves, as you have said. Violence against women affects society as a whole and is also costly. Parliament’s European added-value assessment estimated the direct cost of violence against women in the European Union at EUR 69 billion per year. It suggests that if we reduce violence by just 10%, the direct economic costs would be reduced by approximately EUR 7 billion a year. Tackling violence against women therefore makes economic sense too, but again I want to stress that I understand this problem as more than an economic problem, for sure. This is just an illustration of economic figures. I can assure you that I share your commitment to eliminating violence against women. This will be reflected in the new Commission strategy for equality between women and men, in which there will be a chapter on gender-based violence. This strategy has been proposed by my services and by myself to be elaborated for the year 2015, and I am inviting a wide discussion on this topic under the preparatory work for this strategy. Violence against women is a complex phenomenon and there is no magic wand which makes it disappear at once. If we really want to make a lasting difference then I believe that we have to address it as part of our greater common struggle for equality. Our action must therefore be steady, coherent and based on several pillars. These are: legislation, awareness-raising and funding, as well as improving knowledge and data collection. Allow me now to go through these instruments we have in hand. As regards legislation: the EU has put in place a coherent legal framework to prevent all forms of violence against women and to support victims. This framework now includes the Equal Treatment Directive and its provisions on sexual harassment, the Directive on Trafficking in Human Beings, the Directive against Sexual Abuse and Sexual Exploitation of Children and Child Pornography, the Directive on the European Protection Order applicable in criminal matters, the regulation setting the European Protection Order (covering civil matters), and last but not least, the Directive on the rights of crime victims, which emphasises the need for tailored protection and support for victims of gender-based violence. The Commission is now guiding and monitoring Member States in the effective implementation of this legal framework. So this is the list of existing legislation, and the expression of the necessity to adopt new legislation may be one of the results of working on the new strategy on equality between men and women which we are going to prepare next year. Prevention measures and the cross-border dimension of gender-based violence that you have raised in your question are addressed by the Istanbul Convention of the Council of Europe. Insofar as the EU has competence to sign and ratify the Convention, I believe we should consider EU accession to it. It is equally important that Member States respect their commitments and ratify this Convention as soon as possible. To date, and over four years after the adoption of the Convention, 22 EU Member States have signed it, but only eight EU Member States have ratified it so far. So I ask all of those here who are from Member States which have not ratified the Convention to go to their governments, their national parliaments and their media and call for national ratifications of the first international legally binding instrument combating violence against women. The second pillar of what we can – and what we must – do is awareness-raising and funding. The second pillar of the Commission’s approach to combating violence against women involves supporting awareness-raising and grassroots actions by Member States, civil society organisations and European networks. For example, this year EUR 9.5 million were allocated to supporting European networks and grassroots projects to combat violence against women under the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme. Our objective is to make a real difference in women’s and girls’ lives, also by the good use of this supporting money. The Commission will monitor and evaluate the ongoing awareness-raising and prevention efforts before deciding on possible future awareness-raising activities such as a European Year to End Violence against Women. Improving our knowledge of the prevalence and causes of gender-based violence is essential, because it allows the situation to be monitored across the EU and holds governments and stakeholders accountable. It also helps us to formulate and implement better policies, beyond a mere benchmarking exercise. Comparable EU data shows us how to improve the prevention of violence and the protection of victims. We can learn from each other, from our successes and failures. My services are working with Eurostat and the European Institute for Gender Equality, two key actors in the area which I believe can help fill these gaps. As a follow-up to the Directive on the Rights of Crime Victims, Eurostat, in cooperation with national statistical offices, started in 2014 to collect more detailed crime data recorded by the police and justice systems. The results, disaggregated by sex, will be published in 2015 and will constitute a step forward in our efforts to better understand gender-based violence. However, to complement police records, comprehensive and in-depth surveys are necessary. The already-mentioned Fundamental Rights Agency survey paved the way in this field. It is now considered the gold standard, and we should be proud of this achievement. However, we cannot stop here and now. We need to repeat the Fundamental Rights Agency survey again, and we will make sure that such surveys are conducted at regular intervals to detect new trends and gaps. In my view we need to use existing tools more effectively rather than establishing new bodies like the European Observatory on Violence against Women. Instead, we need an orchestrated effort from all relevant bodies, making full use of the existing expertise. As you know, the Commission will adopt a new strategy on equality between women and men from 2015. Gender-based violence will be a priority of this strategy. I am committed to addressing new forms of violence emerging in an increasingly connected world, such as cyber violence and harassment. While new means of communication and technology offer great opportunities in combating violence against women, they can pose a new threat to the security of women as well. The most effective course of action will be determined and integrated in the new Commission strategy on equality between women and men. This strategy must also include actions to engage men in combating violence against women, raising their awareness of the issue but also engaging them as actors for change. Only by working together will our efforts be fully effective. Finally, I would like to engage with you and listen to you and other stakeholders when developing this new strategy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 851, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "President. -", "mepid": "28115", "text": "   We now continue with the debate on the question for oral answer O-000080/2014 – B8-0039/2014 – 2014/2916(RSP).", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 852, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio", "mepid": "96806", "text": "  PPE Group. – Madam President, since I came to this Parliament, the defence of victims has been my priority and will remain so wherever I am. Today it is European women who are victims of violence who are asking us to speak with a unique and clear voice. They require us to join forces to raise awareness of the magnitude of a problem affecting not only Europe, but the whole world. Violence against women does not distinguish between rich and poor. It crosses all the barriers: home, school, work. There is no refuge for those fleeing from that aggressor, sometimes so close. More than a third of European women admit to having suffered some form of violence just because they are women, with consequent physical, moral and sexual harm. The countries of the Union need to laugh in the same direction towards the total elimination of violence against women, and that is why we need a common strategy. In this connection I worked as rapporteur on the European Order for the Protection of Victims, and today we have a legislative instrument capable of recognising a restraining order in any country of the Union. But I am not satisfied as long as the number of women and girls suffering abuse, rape, trafficking in whites, women who see their freedom and dignity trampled on continues to grow.

I will have a hard time saying it today because, if I look to my right and to my left, I do not see many men. But, yes, if women are victims of violence, it is because there are perpetrators.  I thank the men who are among us. Today, we must send a message to the perpetrators of these violences, of course, but also to sanctions and support. One in three women is appalling. For years, as parliamentarians, we have been fighting this fight and yet, unfortunately, the numbers are rising, certainly because this violence is not decreasing but fortunately because some countries have put in place mechanisms that finally allow women to get out of the private sphere and to go and file a complaint, to be heard by a doctor, to be defended by a lawyer. , to succeed in the courts.

What does the fact that, while there have been 47 rapes per 100 000 inhabitants in Sweden, only two, three rapes per 100 000 inhabitants, in Greece, Hungary or Slovakia, for example, in Slovakia, mean by the fact that there are only two or three rapes per same number?

However, the reality is much worse than the chilling data we know, because only a third of victims report it. The question is, again: what can we do? I am going to propose here and now, I too, that we do something immediate, radically concrete, revolutionaryly effective: ratify the Istanbul Convention. It is the first integrated and legally binding document that establishes that violence against women and domestic violence are a serious attack on human rights. The Istanbul Convention is a unique instrument, which commits each ratifying State to detect, prevent and eliminate violence against girls and women in all its manifestations, from domestic abuse to forced marriage, female genital mutilation or trafficking for exploitation purposes. There is already a comprehensive legal tool that requires the protection of victims, legislative and punitive action against perpetrators and the development of effective equality policies. It has been in force since August 1, it is ready and at our disposal. What are we waiting for to adopt him? To date, only eight Member States have ratified the Istanbul Convention: Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, Sweden, Denmark, Austria and Malta. Fourteen have already signed it and are in the process of ratification. But today is a good day to ask Bulgaria, Estonia, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Cyprus and Latvia why they haven't even signed it yet. Today is a good day for this Parliament to unequivocally implace the Commission to accept this mandate and the new Latvian Presidency to lead this indispensable process with determination from January on a determination. As a reference in the defence of democracy and human rights in the world, it is imperative that Europe has a unanimous voice; unanimously in the rejection, persecution and punishment of violence against women; unanimously in the quality public debate that expressly and decisively incorporates men, such as Dr. Mukwege, for example; and unanimously in the momentum and implementation of political and legislative measures that end the inequality that persists and shames us, the inequality that is at the basis of violence against women.

It is a frightening read, but above all it is figures that show a reality, an unacceptable reality. A reality in which women are abused simply because they are women and where women and girls are de facto without rights because the judiciary does not judge the perpetrators. How can this continue?, we must ask ourselves. Well, the answer is that we have a culture and a power order that subordinates women compared to men. I agree that it is not something that the Pope has taken on, quite the contrary. A culture in which women's bodies do not belong to ourselves, where we constantly have to endure sexist comments. Groping and intimidation are everyday life for women and girls. Everyone knows a girl who's been raped, but no one knows a rapist. When women take their place in public, we are sexually harassed. It's a reality, but now there are no excuses anymore.

Violence against women in all its forms – FGM, domestic violence and the exploitation and trafficking of vulnerable women – must be tackled with commitment by all of us.

An employer has asked an advanced pregnancy worker to terminate the pregnancy if she wants to have a job.

One area where we can move forward is to ratify – for everybody to ratify – the Istanbul Convention. Commissioner, you said that only eight countries have ratified this Convention. My own country has not ratified the Convention. I have spoken to our Minister for Justice, and we intend to do it by this time next year, when everything is in place. We have had difficulties with constitutional rights and property rights under our Constitution when it comes to barring orders.

And alarming and unfortunately growing figures are recorded in many other Member States of the Union.  It is therefore clear that we now need cohesive action by the Member States in the field of prevention and support for women who are victims of violence and, in some cases, their children who, let us not forget, are themselves victims of assisted violence, with serious consequences for their serenity and for their mental development.

We currently have worrying statistics worldwide. UN estimates show that abuse against women is on the rise. The most common form of violence against them worldwide is physical violence. On average, at least one in three women is beaten, forced to have sexual relations or subjected to other types of abuse.

We have, approaching the Chair, our new Commissioner, Commissioner Avramopoulos, for his first debate. He is just about to take the Chair. We have in the Council Mr Gozi, the Italian Presidency of Mare Nostrum, which will shortly move to Operation Triton. Unfortunately, the inadequate sticking plaster which sees good people trying to save migrants in the Mediterranean could not prevent three thousand migrants from drowning in 2014 alone. Earlier this day, we heard His Holiness saying to us, in an excellent speech, that we cannot allow the Mediterranean to become a vast cemetery. But he also said, in a very mature passage, that we need a united response to the question of migration based on a recognition of the human dignity of immigrants. It was a very mature response, which also talked about the causes and effects of migration. Colleagues, it is in that spirit that we talk about our oral question today in front of the Commissioner and in front of the Council. This is not the first time that we talk about this issue. It is after many, many oral questions. Colleagues, we have the tools to do the job – of course we do. In the final paragraph of our oral resolution we talk about the common European Asylum System. How many times have we talked about it? How many trilogues have we had? How many pieces of directives and laws have we put together? Of course we have the tools to do the job. The issue is one of solidarity, and the issue is one of political action. We have something to say to the Commission and to the Council today, and particularly, Mr Gozi, to the Council, not to the Presidency – because within the Presidency we have had Mare Nostrum, which has saved 150 000. It is the Council which is not implementing the common European Asylum System. So I direct this primarily to the Council: we do not have solidarity. And that is why we had that powerful moral message earlier today. In our search and rescue obligations – the first part of our oral question which I put to both of you – we have moved from Mare Nostrum to Triton the inadequacy of that programme. Secondly, when we talk about broadening the activities of Frontex and Triton, we have an inadequacy. First we have to ask that question. The European Commission does its best, but if we do not have the Member States working together, we do not have adequate burden sharing. Then we have development of safe and legal routes. What does that mean? It means what His Holiness was talking about: causes and effects, the push and pull factors, and a common resettlement policy. I attended the Justice and Home Affairs Council in Milan, and there was clearly no real resettlement policy with real burden sharing across the Member States, since it was not equal across the Member States. When we talk about the context – and we will hear many Members talk about the context – please remember that, despite the austerity that we have, the top ten countries receiving refugees today from Syria and elsewhere are all among the world’s developing countries. Not one country in the top ten countries receiving refugees today is a European Union country – they are all developing countries. So let us put that into context. Yes, we are generous, but we are not there amongst the developing countries of the world taking the biggest burden. So let us remember that President Juncker, in his opening statement, talked about adequate legal migration channels. So we have to be brave and courageous in actually saying what that will mean. Not perhaps today, but let us refresh our vision about what that will mean. So colleagues, yes, emergency funds, migration and asylum border control, fighting smuggling and trafficking, EU foreign and development policy, what we do about common standards for reception procedures and qualifications – all of that is vital. But the key point, and I put this both to the Commission and Council – and particularly to the Council – is that we do not have implementation of our Common Asylum System. The purpose of the oral question today is not that the Parliament has not done its job – we have done our job. Rather, the point is that we can do more. I address this to my colleagues in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) and across Parliament. What I would propose is that we say to the Council: implement what we have and stop people dying in the Mediterranean. But we should also have our inquiry to ensure that pressure is put on the Council, that we have resources put into an inquiry or an investigation into what is happening, so that we can look citizens in the eye and ensure that they know that we as a Parliament are doing everything possible to ensure that Mediterranean deaths are not happening week in and week out, and that we have a managed migration system that is worthy of our Parliament. We have to show our moral compass and what we are doing about our refugee and asylum policy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 917, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Sandro Gozi", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Mr President- in-Office of the Council. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Moraes most sincerely for having put in place issues that are fundamental, that are priorities, that are part of the major priorities of our presidency. High priorities, I stress this as President-in-Office, also with satisfaction with the Commission's programme chaired by Juncker, which identified immigration as one of its immediate priorities, which it also included in the 2015 legislative programme. This is certainly a very important point for us. It is very important because if there is one issue where the European Union can and must demonstrate its added value, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that is exactly immigration.  By definition and by nature, immigration is a cross-border phenomenon. By definition and by nature, a cross-border phenomenon needs a more integrated, more common and bolder response from the European Union. We have worked very hard during our six months to give concrete meaning to that principle, to that article of the Treaty which speaks of solidarity in the field of immigration. For me, that article is a principle, it is a political principle, it is a legally binding commitment, it is a political programme for the European Union. A political agenda on which we must work much more. It is much more in cooperation between the Council of Ministers, the Commission and Parliament. In his question the author referred to the work of the Mediterranean task force. As you know, Mr Moraes, there have already been 37 concrete and operational interventions by the Task Force in the Mediterranean around five priority areas for action. I would remind you of them: cooperation with third countries, regional protection programmes together with resettlement and strengthening of legal access opportunities in Europe, the fight against trafficking, trafficking and organised crime, the strengthening of border surveillance to help protect and rescue migrants in the Mediterranean, and measures to assist Member States facing strong migratory pressures. These are the areas on which the task force has worked and the task force has regularly reported to the Council. I trust that this information has been given, as well as to the Council, to the European Parliament.  Having said that, are we satisfied with today's situation? No, we are not satisfied and we share the words to which you referred, which you recalled of the Pontiff. We too always say that the Mediterranean cannot be a graveyard. And I would add that it cannot and cannot continue to be a graveyard of indifference and selfishness on the part of Europeans. That is the concrete meaning of the word solidarity. That is why we must work much harder to implement quickly the operational programme adopted by the Council of Ministers at its meeting in Luxembourg on 10 October. One of the conclusions, entitled 'Working towards better management of migratory flows', concerns a strategic approach to give a concrete response to migratory pressure around three broad guidelines, three major sectors, which are, among other things, those that we identified as priorities during our six-month period, certainly enhanced management and external borders. After years of work and years of very serious responsibility on the part of Europe in rejecting this principle, the principle has finally passed that the European Union's external borders are not Italian or Polish or Greek or Spanish borders. The external borders of the European Union are common borders and, being common borders, they require a common approach, common initiatives, hence also the initiative of Operation Triton, which you mentioned.  Of course, this is not enough, and this must go hand in hand with much more operational and much more effective cooperation with third countries. The dialogue with the countries of origin and transit must first be extended geographically, according to the Presidency. It must certainly continue to include North Africa, but mobility partnerships must become much more effective, they must be linked much more to economic cooperation, they must be linked much more to trade cooperation. It must also be extended to sub-Saharan Africa, and it is necessary – and this has been one of the works on which we have put a great deal of effort during our six months – that it should also be extended to the Horn of Africa. These are the areas to extend that approach to, which only the European Union can do. Only the European Union can really make a difference in these areas. There is also much to be done because the first experiences and partnerships for mobility are not satisfactory. Let us face it in this plenary. There's so much more to do, we have to work much harder to to make operational sense and to convince the countries of origin and transit to make a real effort to cooperate in a concrete, effective and tangible way with us in the management of migratory flows. And then there is the third area that you mentioned, namely supporting and fully implementing our common European asylum system. As President-in-Office, I do not want to and cannot, Mr President- Mr Moraes, I would like to go into some of the comments that you have made, which would relate to possible infringement procedures that may exist against the Member States, the task of the European Commission, or to the presentation of new legislative proposals, which we hope will be presented, but which fall within the institutional prerogatives of the Commission. All I am telling you is that progress has been made in this common European asylum system in recent years and also during our six months. There are more common rules, there is a reduced possibility of derogations, there is progress. I am also thinking of the new regulations within the Dublin system, which we as presidency consider to be some of the inadequate. There is no agreement in the Council, but we consider it to be partly inadequate to meet all the challenges.  Internally, however, there is room for flexibility which must be used for much more effective management of an issue which is extremely serious, in the general gravity of the issue of immigration, which is the issue of unaccompanied minors, on which the rules allow us to do much more, just as we have a new early warning mechanism. It is clear that in the years to come the emphasis must be on consolidating the system, completing the system and also fully implementing the various legislative and administrative instruments that this system requires in order to achieve a genuine common European asylum system, which is the third absolutely necessary element. To do what? In order to rebuild mutual trust between the Member States. Because what has happened in recent years, namely the fact that we have left some States alone to deal with a massive phenomenon such as immigration, which affects us all as Europeans, has been the lack of mutual trust between the Member States. It is essential, and that is why we need to work on the issue of borders, on the issue of dialogue with third countries, but also on the issue of a better asylum system, which means that the individual Member States must also improve their national asylum systems, because that is the only way to restore that mutual trust that is the essential prerequisite for a genuine new immigration policy.  It is with this in mind that, as the Presidency, during our six months we have proposed the principle of mutual recognition, on which there is still no agreement but which is certainly one of the answers to create the system to which you referred, but which needs a premise: we must return to trust each other. As long as there is no full mutual trust, there can be no common immigration policy that Europe can and must absolutely develop.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 918, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Madam President, migration was always part of the home affairs portfolio but was never before in the title. Now it is – for symbolic, but also for pragmatic, reasons. I would like to express my thanks to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and its Chair, Mr Moraes, for having given me the opportunity to be present today at this very important event. I would also like to quote what Pope Francis said this morning. I fully agree with what he said and I can tell him, on behalf of everybody, that this strong signal that was sent to us was received with full respect for his remarks. I make no secret of the fact that I am honoured to be responsible for this portfolio. At the same time I know that there is no easy solution to address the important tasks ahead of us. But I can assure you that there is a strong political will. Your extensive questions show the complexity of the challenges the European Union faces on migration and asylum. We are confronted with the highest migratory pressure at our external borders since the Balkan crisis. This requires an integrated approach covering all areas, including foreign and security policy. It requires restoring and building more mutual trust to successfully face these challenges – trust between the Member States, and between the Member States and the European Union. The sharing of solidarity and responsibility remains the foundation on which the Commission and the Member States are building a common European migration and asylum system with common standards and rights for migrants. Many tools for solidarity have been developed to put this into practice, such as the financial solidarity and supported guidance provided by the relevant agencies – the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and Frontex. Relocation has been developed by the Commission, and we will continue to work on this. We have the early warning mechanism and the possibilities offered by Article 33 of the Dublin III Regulation. Some of these tools have already proved their worth. We need to further develop and use all of them as appropriate. Solidarity goes hand in hand with responsibility. All Member States must take full ownership of the proper functioning of the system. The full and effective implementation of the Common European Asylum System is an absolute priority. The Commission will closely monitor implementation by the Member States and support their efforts. The Commission will support the Member States in practical cooperation, notably through EASO. We also count on the continued engagement of non-governmental organisations and international partners such as the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. The Qualification Directive and the Dublin III Regulation are already in force, but the other instruments will only be applied from next July. So I do not see an urgent need for major changes to the asylum system in the very near future, but this is not ruled out for the medium term after careful consideration. Smuggling and trafficking have elements in common, but they are two separate criminal offences which required tailored responses. The EU’s response to trafficking in human beings will remain victim-centred and human rights-based. We must ensure protection for all victims and a strong criminal response to the traffickers, working closely with all the justice and home affairs agencies which implement actions on anti-trafficking. Prevention is key, and the Member States are obliged to take legal action to reduce the demand that fosters all forms of exploitation, whether this is by criminalising employers who use victims, or by holding companies liable or individuals who knowingly use victims. Smuggling is steadily increasing. We need to increase our response capacity. We need to build a stronger criminal justice response to stop this crime, investigating and prosecuting those in charge more severely. The EU plan that we intend to develop to counter migrant smuggling will focus both on dismantling the criminal networks through reinforced intelligence sharing, investigation capacities and prosecution, and on prevention, through information campaigns about the dangers of being smuggled into the European Union and enhanced cooperation with third countries. The response to the migratory pressures at the borders and smuggling should include a strengthened role for Frontex. To broaden the activities of Frontex, Member States must uphold their commitments to work with the Agency. Only they have the border guards and equipment to carry out such activities. Regarding joint operation Triton: as you know, this began on 1 November of this year, and its duration will depend on how the situation evolves. The Commission is following it closely, but the decision will be made by the Agency and the Member States involved. The estimated cost is EUR 2.9 million per month. To launch and finance it in the short term, the Agency performed internal reallocations and the Commission provided EUR 3.9 million via a direct transfer from resources available under the Internal Security Fund. The Commission is aware that Parliament has proposed an amendment to add a reserve of EUR 20 million to the 2015 Frontex budget. We look forward to the final joint decision on this by Parliament and the Council. Resettlement is for the time being effectively the only route of legal entry for a person in need of protection. It is the most tangible expression of international solidarity with refugees in third countries but also a tool to relieve some of the burden on host countries. While the decision whether to resettle and, if so, how many people lies with Member States, the Commission will continue its efforts to encourage them to increase quotas or, of course, to start resettlement for those not doing it yet. But something is out of balance here. Member States that receive the highest numbers of spontaneous asylum requests are also the ones that resettle the most refugees. The Commission intends to address the situation. Yesterday my services had a first orientation discussion with the Member States on a possible allocation or division mechanism. The Commission is already committed to exploring new avenues, in particular the possibility of developing a common approach to issuing humanitarian visas to allow those in need to come to Europe and apply for protection. This was also discussed during the meeting yesterday. I do realise that it remains a very sensitive issue. On legal migration: for obvious demographic and economic reasons, Europe needs to address labour and skill shortages and address the challenges of an ageing continent. We will work closely on this with business and social partners. Our first step will be to look at policies currently in place, such as the EU blue card, and see what can be done to increase their attractiveness and effectiveness. The answer to many of the challenges in the area of home affairs lies in our relations with third countries. We need to improve the link between the European Union’s internal and external policies, putting an emphasis on the need to adopt a long-term approach which addresses the root causes of migration. In this vein we should try not only to respond to immediate emergency situations but also to work on a comprehensive and structured approach to address the increasing migratory pressures. More specifically, the European Union approach should aim at integrating political and economic stability, development and security aspects, as well as both operational and political instruments. Issues such as migration, asylum, crisis management, humanitarian aid, development, trade, democratisation and human rights should be addressed in a comprehensive and coherent way. We must make sure that migration is embedded in all fields of EU external relations, including development cooperation and security policy, but we also need to be supportive and credible. We must support partner countries, therefore, to ensure better migration and border management as well as improved protection and reception capacity with a view to helping these countries fulfil their international obligations. Mobility partnerships have been put in place to enable deeper and tailor-made policy dialogues and operational cooperation with partner countries, so far with Morocco, Tunisia and Jordan. For the long term, tackling irregular immigration at its source is the best investment we can make. I intend to coordinate with High Representative Federica Mogherini and work closely with my colleagues, the Commissioners responsible for neighbourhood policy, development and humanitarian aid, as was set out in our mandate by the Commission President. Finally, I turn to funding. Under the Development and Cooperation Instrument the Commission is currently implementing initiatives for around EUR 53 million focused on migration and international protection. Around EUR 14 million of this fund supports the fight against trafficking and smuggling and tackles irregular migration, while EUR 17 million is dedicated to actions focusing on regional development and the protection programme for refugees and host communities in the Middle East, the Horn of Africa and North African countries. The European Neighbourhood Instrument mobilises around EUR 60 million for migration and international protection-related interventions in the Mediterranean countries. In addition, around EUR 200 million was allocated in 2014 to respond to the Syrian refugee crisis. Under the 2014 to 2020 financial framework, Member States and Schengen-associated countries will receive more than EUR 4.4 billion under the two funds combined: the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund, and the Internal Security Fund – Borders and Visa. The frontline Mediterranean Member States – Italy, Greece, Malta and Spain – will receive a large share of these funds: in total, together, around EUR 1.4 billion over the whole financial cycle. For emergency situations we have set aside for 2014, for all Member States together, EUR 25 million under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund, and EUR 6.8 million under the Internal Security Fund – Borders and Visa.

First of all, Mr Commissioner, a warm congratulations on what you have said. I believe that your speech shows how much work we have ahead of us to find a solution at all. That is why I have a specific question about cooperation in the fight against trafficking in human beings. Some 42,000 people crossed the Mediterranean in 2013, and 108,000 in 2014. The number of deaths is estimated by the Migration Agency at 3 000. We do not even know how many people die, are killed or tortured, abducted or are subjected to forced prostitution, forced labour, enslavement, organ trafficking, the sexual abuse of children, torture and multiple murders, because we cannot see them and can only guess the extent. In the meantime, it seems that fewer women are victims of human trafficking, but more and more children are falling into the clutches of criminals. In this context, it is particularly important to me that law enforcement authorities also cooperate in a coordinated manner, that we develop cooperation with third countries that is capable of displacing traffickers, and, at the same time, that cooperation in humanitarian aid is stepped up – although this is not one of the tasks of our committee – and that the legal possibilities are developed towards humanitarian visas so that we can put a stop to traffickers.

It is important to point out once again that it is not the European states that are taking in the largest number of refugees. It is precisely for this reason that it is intolerable that people on their way to Europe risk their lives and all too often lose their lives. We now need new approaches to protect people fleeing war and persecution. Fighting criminals - yes! However, if I no longer want any escape workers at all, then we should open up more safe routes to Europe. So far, there is a resettlement. But this is voluntary, and many Member States do not participate, some take in just a handful of refugees. All in all, therefore, we need more solidarity, a better distribution of refugees in all our Member States. That is why we also need a binding distribution key in order to involve the Member States, which have so far shied away from their responsibilities. To make a point, I believe that a distribution key would not only help to relieve countries such as Greece or Italy, it would also help countries such as Germany and Sweden if all the Member States finally joined in a distribution according to their own responsibilities.

Europe must approach immigration with respect for fundamental rights, international obligations, human dignity and life. We need to have a sensible and balanced approach. There is a significant increase, year on year, in the number of people dying while attempting to make the journey to Europe. This is unacceptable and unsustainable. Europe needs an approach which is achievable but not idealistic. There is no simple answer, but what this Parliament needs most is what the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) has asked for: a holistic approach which looks at all the tools available to the EU in order to respond to the crisis. This includes looking at the responsibilities of Frontex and how we can save those vulnerable and exploited from dying at sea, as well as confronting the appalling actions of the human traffickers and smugglers who are so often responsible for their plight. We need to deal with third countries strongly and effectively to tackle immigration at source, and how we can work on resettlement and returns policies with them. There also needs to be a period of reflection where Member States take responsibility for processing efficiently, quickly and immediately in the first place of arrival.

Even though we said it must never happen again, it happens again and again. Today the Pope was here and he said that we must never make the Mediterranean a cemetery, a graveyard.

Do you think it is possible to continue with this irresponsible management of a complex and unstoppable phenomenon such as immigration? Do you think it wise to continue erecting walls around this fortress called Europe, allowing the Mediterranean to turn into a great cemetery? Migration from the south of the world is a direct consequence of the processes of globalisation implemented by the north of the world, of which we are part and for which we as legislators are jointly responsible. We are increasing and making more efficient the legal access channels for asylum seekers, for family reunifications, for job seekers.  The emergency approach has created another monster that is the reception machine, where unscrupulous speculators are teeming alongside people working in a genuine spirit of solidarity. We denounce the criminal economy of drug dealing, prostitution, theft and unead work that thrives in that limbo without clear rules that are the reception centres, especially in Italy.

Today, more than 90% of Syrian refugees are granted political asylum, which is very close to refugees of other nationalities, such as Afghans or those from horn-of-Africa countries. Why is it making it so difficult for them to enter the European Union?

Finally, Operation Triton is strictly limited to border control as the budget is limited and its technical equipment remains suspended from the promises of equipment from the Member States. There are still many open questions about the steps that will be taken to complete Operation Triton in the Mediterranean Sea. Secondly, it is crucial today to put a stop to the trafficking of migrants. The only instrument we have is the UN Protocol against the smuggling of migrants. The Union must have a mechanism to monitor the protocol and, above all, to do an enormous amount of work in terms of information and data on traffic, on the road to be taken, on recruitment techniques, on the most vulnerable people.  Finally, there is the issue of cooperation with third countries. The causes of refugee flows and irregular immigration, both economic and political, must be addressed.

The second pillar is the corollary of the first: we must have a regulated right of entry into the European Union with, why not, country quotas on immigration. The third pillar is urgent, as you all said; we need a harmonization of our right to asylum. We can no longer continue with countries where, basically, it takes six months to get something and for others it takes five years. This is not reasonable.

I conclude, first of all, that, in general, everyone, with few exceptions, agrees that this is a very important issue, with social and humanitarian implications, which puts to the test every day the principles on which Europe was born and founded. I didn't come here to beautify any situation. I don't intend to. I have only been in this position for three weeks, but I have known and studied the problem for many decades. If I may make a personal reference, some eighteen years ago, when the first waves of illegal immigrants gathered at the doors of Europe, I was Mayor of the city of Athens and I do not hide from you that I was surprised. The Greek state was taken by surprise with me, as were all the states of the European South, when all these fellow human beings who were asking for a place in the sun and a better life began to knock on Europe, pushed by the difficult situations they faced, by poverty, by war and by the tragedies that brought together the personal drama of each.  You referred to Lampedusa, which has become a symbol for the whole of Europe. It wasn't just in Lampedusa that we mourned people. There are those for whom we will never know where they are because they are lost in the depths of the Mediterranean and because there are many more than the Member States of the wider region have recorded so far. Ladies and gentlemen, many people believed at the outset that this was an issue that concerned only the European South. Within a few years, however, it became one of the biggest problems in the whole of Europe. It is a pan-European issue. But there is one thing we must not forget. There is an answer that we must give to all those who cultivate xenophobia and who unfortunately are unraveling, or at least trying to unravel the principles and values on which the European construction is based. Mr Engel said this earlier and I agree with him: we are a union made up of peoples and nations that have sent millions of our ancestors around the world. Large countries, today's superpowers, consist of mosaics of ethnicities dominated by the European element. Our people at the time, our relatives and grandparents were treated with xenophobia, with racism. All this is not a foreign experience for Europeans, but the time has come to judge ourselves, in the light of our own values, on the other hand.  But how is that going to happen? Certainly not with a fragmented policy. Nor by blaming each other - because such voices were heard here. It will be done with a holistic, coherent immigration strategy. I assure you there is the political will. The Commission is determined to adopt a new Charter on migration because the problem we are concerned about today will not be resolved until many years have passed. You are aware of the geopolitical developments along this whole arc of instability that starts in Tunisia and reaches Ukraine. At the moment, on the shores of Turkey, Libya, Egypt or elsewhere, hundreds of thousands of souls are waiting to find a way to cross over, victims of smugglers and intermediaries who, as I said before, we are determined, in cooperation with the Member States, to strike lightly. There are countries, including Greece from which I come, that have already taken very strict measures. Life imprisonment is a sentence imposed by the courts of the country. I don't want to hear about the human rights of smugglers again. They have no right to sell out human souls. Behind the issue we are discussing here today lies a well-functioning industry, equipped with the best systems, with new technologies, an industry which in many cases is better equipped and organised by the States themselves. Europe reacted. The policy, which we are now criticising, in the past year has begun to give results. Some programs have been tested. Any programs that fail stop. We support the Member States in their policies; Member States are not alone. Europe stands by them; Europe will show its solidarity in practice, Mrs Vozenberg. It is its obligation because solidarity is one of the principles on which the European construction is based, with daily social, humanitarian and political implications. Here, in this sacred site of the European Parliament, in the Temple of the European Republic, all these principles are tested every day through your own debates. The Commission needs your help, your support, your ideas and your sensitivities, sensitivities which we all share, regardless of the institution of Europe we serve.  I repeat that it is our intention and will to adopt a new Charter on migration that protects human rights, fundamental rights and all the humanitarian values that were born in this place called Europe and which today are the brightest example of democracy in practice for the whole world. Europe is attractive not only because it prospers, but also because people here know that it will be respected. We know where the system is suffering. We know what his weaknesses are. The experience gained by the previous Commission and all of you here is not unknown to us. We feel an absolute responsibility to adopt a coherent, integrated policy that responds to the issue with sensitivity, humanity and values that are confirmed in practice. The time will come when we will all decide to clarify the concept of European borders. It will not be borders that will lead us to what was a slogan of the interwar period. You know who that slogan came from. It's not even worth naming them in this room. We don't want a fortress Europe. Europe will not become a fortress. Europe will not lead to isolationism. Europe is made up of citizens of the world and has its doors open to the other citizens of the world, those who have been brought to us in search of a human welcome and a better environment. They want to live with us and we want to give them this opportunity but within an organised framework, according to a web of principles, values and directives that will come from our own cooperation in this very area.  I want to give you this assurance today that the Europe of values will be judged in practice and that Europe will be able to stand up against all the ills we have described before, first and foremost the exploitation of man. I hope it won't be long before we all experience this result together. I really hope from my heart, when at the end of next year we have the same debate, that we have made the great leap forward and upwards and found genuine answers to these questions, so as not to continue this situation which, after all, offends us and the values on which we have founded our common European edifice.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 970, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Sandro Gozi", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Mr President- in-Office of the Council. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you to all those who have spoken. Frankly, it has been an interesting debate, not a new one in many respects, but it is very important that it takes place at the beginning of this parliamentary term. It is clear, as has been said and I also said in my introduction, that in this political cycle Europe either makes a difference on issues such as immigration or will find it very difficult to regain credibility in the eyes of its citizens.  Immigration is precisely one of the test cases on which we will have to check how much Europe will be able to do together. And the more integrated approach is certainly an approach that starts from the external dimension that is linked – several of you have said this and as the Council we fully agree with it – to development policies and security policies. It is clear that there is a direct link with the contribution that the European Union as such - however we are the world's largest donor - will be able to make to the fight against poverty.  It is also true that there is an aspect linked to security, starting with border security. And I would remind you that, on the initiative of the Presidency, the Council has set a medium-term objective - and this has also been mentioned in the debate - of achieving a European external border police force. This is something that is now in the Council documents and that we will certainly have to work on in the new parliamentary term.  It is clear, and we have also mentioned this in the Council's work, that we need much more cooperation between the European Union and countries of origin and transit. In particular, one thing I would like to add to the debate is the commitment that the Council has made to work much more effectively and with much more intensity for voluntary resettlement programmes, for initiatives in crisis-related regions outside the European Union, together with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. This is an operational commitment that was made in the Luxembourg Council of Interior Ministers, on which the Council and Parliament will certainly have to work much more and much more together. The question of rescues at sea has also been raised. I would remind you that the duty to assist people in difficulty at sea is part of international rights. It binds all the Member States, binds all those who intervene, including in the Mediterranean, and binds them to save regardless of their nationality and, I would stress, regardless of the status of the people to be rescued. It is not that if a person is an irregular immigrant we can drown them, whereas if they are an economic immigrant or a potential asylum refugee we can save them. This is a very important point to emphasise.  Of course, therefore, this duty to assist people in difficulty, which binds the Member States, also applies to operations with the help of Frontex, such as Operation Triton. Of course, Operation Triton is the beginning of a shared response, it is the beginning of a shared assumption of responsibility, it is a good starting point, around which we must build much more.  Of course we need more money, starting with Frontex. But funds without new common policies certainly cannot be enough. It is very important that in the strategic agenda for the new parliamentary term the European Council has identified the commitment to fully develop common legal and illegal immigration policies, but that is why – I repeat again – we need confidence and we need solidarity. And if we do not rebuild a relationship of trust and solidarity between us within the European Union, much of this and much of what you have also hoped for will remain on paper. In today's debate, too, two approaches have emerged which are only apparently opposed. There are countries that complain that there are a disproportionate number of asylum seekers on their territory. There are other countries that complain of uncontrolled, sometimes difficult-to-control, massive arrivals of illegal immigrants on their shores. And it seems that sometimes there is a competition for those who have more rights or those who need joint intervention most. But it is clear that it is precisely the absence of a common policy, whether legal immigration or illegal immigration, that is costing disproportionately both countries with a very large number of asylum seekers and countries that are exposed to massive irregular influxes on their coasts. It is clear that, in both cases, the answer may be a new common European policy on legal and illegal immigration. It is not that we can continue to play the game of those who need it most, which also means the game of an absence of trust between us. It is a policy to be built step by step, proposed after proposal.  In the negotiations between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, a new directive on access to the European Union for research, study and voluntary reasons. Another piece of that common legal immigration policy that we absolutely must build, because it is clear that all this will be built over an entire parliamentary term, step by step, piece by piece. In his opening speech, the Commissioner referred to the Commission's possible proposal for better distribution and burden-sharing. Of course, this is another very important point.  With regard to unaccompanied foreign minors, I indicated in my introduction that, first of all, we must certainly make use of all the margins that the existing Dublin rules on unaccompanied minors allow, that have not been exploited and on which we must work, and I would remind you that some Member States are working on legislative proposals to this effect. I fully agree, and that is one of the issues that we have also discussed in the Council's work. It is impossible, Mr President, to respond to all the speeches. But of course we will either really have the courage and the will to have a common approach or we will all lose and also lose the credibility of the European Union to our citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 971, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "El Presidente. -", "mepid": "125032", "text": "   The debate is closed.

We all know the pictures of rubber bullets being fired from the coast off Ceuta on refugees armed only with rescue tyres, people panicking and drowning. And we remember the pictures when in Melilla – we all saw the film, I think we all saw it – a man was knocked down and carried back to the Moroccan side without respect for his rights. This approach has been strongly criticised by both Mrs Malmström and the European Commissioner for Human Rights. It is not acceptable for people to be treated in this way at our borders, in the middle of Europe, because the entire fence is Spanish territory. We have heard a lot about dignity this morning. But human dignity is indivisible, and it does not only apply to European people. The amendment could therefore now be incorporated into The Spanish Security Act. The European Commission is now called upon to do everything possible to prevent this change in the law.

This action is contrary to international law and to EU law, the asylum legislation that we have put in place with great effort.

Not everyone has the right to asylum, but everyone has the right to a normal return to their country of origin. Sending someone back without individual testing is incompatible with our legislation. It is very worrying that Spain is now discussing adopting legislation that allows these hot returns, because that would lead to collective expulsions – incompatible with European and international law.

People have been dying in the Mediterranean for years because thousands of people are prepared to risk their lives in order to cross the border that separates them from Europe. There are not only the recent events in Ceuta and Melilla and the Spanish Government's intentions to confirm this disturbing reality, but also the European Court of Human Rights. It has recently pointed the finger at Member States such as Italy and Greece for their inability to guarantee Article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights, which prohibits inhuman or degrading treatment.

I believe that the situation in Ceuta and Melilla is really very important and deserves all our attention. In my capacity as Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship I intend to closely monitor and address the situation in Ceuta and Melilla while, at the same time, continuing to support Spain in managing the situation at its external borders. I myself have had the occasion to discuss this matter with the Spanish Minister of the Interior, Jorge Fernández Díaz, just two weeks ago. I have also accepted an invitation from the Minister to visit the two areas concerned in the coming months. I am satisfied that the Minister of the Interior himself and the Spanish authorities are willing to engage in dialogue with the Commission on this issue. However, the situation remains disconcerting and requires our attention. The Commission is concerned by all the allegations as well as the recent proposals to amend the relevant legislation. The Commission is concerned by reports coming from NGOs and the media alleging the summary removal of migrants from both Ceuta and Melilla to Morocco, as well as ill treatment. We take these allegations very seriously. For this reason the Commission is in contact with the Spanish authorities over this matter. It is also important for the Commission to know more about the procedures put in place to ensure the correct application of the principle of non-refoulement and effective access to the asylum procedures. I want to be clear on that. Any border surveillance measure must be proportionate to the objectives pursued. It must be in compliance with respect for the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights and the principle, as I mentioned before, of non-refoulement, and it must respect human dignity. In accordance with these obligations, border control must be carried out while respecting the rights of refugees and persons requesting international protection, in particular as regards the principle of non-refoulement and effective access to the asylum procedures. Any cooperation with third countries must be carried out in full respect of these principles. It is necessary to guarantee effective access to the asylum procedure for those third-country nationals who are on Member State territory, including at the borders, in transit zones or on the territorial seas, and who express a wish to apply for asylum. The Commission is also concerned that the interpretation by Spain of what constitutes an external border, and recent proposals amending relevant legislation – what some have called ‘hot returns’ – might not be in conformity with obligations arising under EU and international law. My predecessor, Commissioner Malmström, had requested that the Spanish Minister of the Interior provide the Commission with information concerning these draft amendments. In addition, my services have already addressed the Spanish authorities at the technical level to better understand the implications of these draft amendments and their conformity with Spain’s obligations under European Union law. As guardian of the Treaties, the Commission follows closely the actions of Member States, and it is the responsibility of the Commission to draw attention to actions which may constitute a violation of European Union laws, in particular when it concerns the protection of the fundamental rights of individuals. The Commission will not hesitate to take appropriate steps where there is evidence that a Member State has violated European Union laws. But I am confident that the dialogue we have opened with the Spanish authorities will have positive results and will lead to the necessary changes, and I am planning to accept the invitation of the Minister and confirm, together with him, the improvements in such a difficult part of our common European borders.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 987, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Lara Comi", "mepid": "96775", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking the – Señor Presidente, yo soy italiana, however, I am speaking en la primera parte del debate en español para afirmar con fuerza que el problema de la inmigración es europeo y no sole nacional, y no only italiano, y no only español. All forms of violence must be condemned: it must be condemned when it is carried out by the police and must be condemned when it is also carried out by immigrants and illegal immigrants. The absence of an effective European strategy leads the Member States to individual solutions, as we will see with regard to Spain, which are necessary for the protection of land, security and internal public order, but which are sometimes in danger of being a violation of rights.  There are different interests at stake. First of all, we cannot abandon the boats to their fate. The Member States must therefore also accept illegal immigrants and refugees, and they must also have very rapid timetables for understanding whether they are refugees or illegal, precisely because the difference is important. We must take in the refugees, but we must repatriate illegal immigrants while respecting their rights. I strongly call for the rapid negotiation of agreements with countries of origin and faster procedures, as I said, with regard to the status of refugees. The watchword is zero tolerance of illegal immigration, which gives rise to even more crime. I will end very briefly by saying that I am very pleased that almost the whole Parliament, apart from my colleague, has shared the Pope's words, because we have understood that there are no more Eurosceptics because the Pope said that more Pro-Europeans than this we continue to move forward with solidarity.

Witnesses and images prove the unacceptable practice of 'hot returns'. For everyone to understand: a hot return consists in the delivery to the Moroccan authorities of a foreign citizen, intercepted as irregular on this side of the fence, by the forces and security forces dependent on the Government of Spain. And this practice is contrary to Spanish law, it is contrary to the Spanish Constitution, it is contrary to European law, it is contrary to international treaties for the protection of human rights and, in particular, the protection of refugees. And the Spanish Government knows that this practice cannot be validated by legal reform, in so far as it remains contrary to international law and international human rights law. The Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, Mr Nils Mui-nieks, has expressed his opposition to this practice and his concern. Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom has done the same in a blunt letter to the Government of Spain. Now it is your turn to speak to the current Commission, it is your turn to speak, Mr Avramopoulos, to set a clear position on unacceptable practices which worsen when, moreover, they are accompanied by abuses which harm fundamental rights — as we have seen in those images of people who are forcible and dragged across the fence, as if they had never been on Spanish territory. Therefore, here we have a real fire test of the quality of European law, which is our raison d'etion. If there is one thing that distinguishes, which is a real test of quality, a legal order as a civilization based on law is precisely the treatment of the other, the treatment of the different, the treatment abroad. That is why it is so important that the European Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, should say as soon as possible what it thinks of these practices — in our view manifestly illegal and contrary to European law — and what it intends to do to prevent the consumption of such legal reform, which in no case can be validated, because it remains contrary to international human rights law.

I would say that it is a guarantee law, which provides for legal assistance, interpreter, hearing, reasoned decision of the competent authority and appeal. Moreover, the so-called Community law: the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in Article 77 there, proclaims that 'the European Union shall develop a policy which shall aim at ... ensure people's checks and effective border surveillance.\" Ceuta and Melilla are considered the Union's land border on the African continent and also have extraordinary migratory pressure.

This is also very much true in the labour market. It is definitely about the working environments that have become harder and more dangerous. Having strong common rules for the working environment is a profit-making business for all of us. Not only for those who work, not only for all citizens, but also for businesses. According to an international study, companies investing EUR 10 in preventive work environment can expect a return of more than double. Having strong common rules for a good working environment also means ensuring competition on equal terms. In order not to distort competition in the internal market, a common minimum standard is required. However, this must not, of course, prevent Member States and companies from keeping and demanding a higher standard. Regulatory simplification and reduction of bureaucracy must never be allowed at the expense of people's lives and health. Proposals to exempt SMEs from health and safety requirements do not help anyone, either companies or workers. Quite the opposite. Large companies have the resources to cope with if an accident occurs or when staff are on long-term sick leave. In a small company, the margins are smaller, there it is exactly the opposite: every single employee means an enormous amount and you often have neither insurance nor staff who can handle if something happens. That is why health and safety issues are so important for very small companies as well.  Everyone should have the right to the same good working environment no matter what company you work in. That will be my given conclusion. The proposals that have so far been on the table here in the European Parliament have taken a different starting point. They would exempt over 90% of all employees in the EU from living by health and safety rules. Such a proposal is, of course, totally unacceptable to many – I would say with certainty a majority of Members of this House. If these proposals are repeated in the coming parliamentary term, they will face very strong opposition. That is why it is so important that we address this issue at the beginning of this parliamentary term. The solution is not to erode the rules, but to make it easier for companies and individuals to comply with the rules. This requires an offensive EU programme. Support systems, new risk management tools for small businesses are needed to facilitate osh work and strengthened trade union training that can make conscious workers even better at dealing with complex work environments and also contribute to real simplification – real simplification, without deterioration in the working environment. The EU therefore urgently needs a new aggressive strategy on health and safety at work covering everything from workplace accidents to cancer risks and psychosocial damage and stresses. That's thinking long-term. It's thinking radically. It's thinking humanly.

The new EU strategic framework that was adopted in June reflects this commitment. The European Union has a comprehensive body of legislation on health and safety at work in place already. Our new strategic framework complements the legal acquis by promoting a holistic culture of prevention. It also provides a framework for coordinating national policies and improving implementation. The framework identifies three main challenges: to improve implementation of occupational health and safety legislation, in particular by enhancing the capacity of small and micro enterprises to put in place effective risk preventive measures; to improve prevention of work-related diseases by tackling existing, new and emerging risks; and thirdly, to address demographic change and the ageing of the workforce. On these points we can make progress only with the active collaboration of all the relevant stakeholders. The Commission is working closely with the Member States, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, the Tripartite Advisory Committee on Health and Safety at Work and the Senior Labour Inspectors Committee to ensure appropriate implementation of these existing rules. The Agency and the two Committees are reviewing their work programmes in light of the new strategic framework. I will continue to involve the social partners, including through sectoral dialogue when appropriate. With the assistance of the Tripartite Advisory Committee on Health and Safety at Work, the Commission intends to develop a tool to monitor better the implementation of the framework. I take note of your request in the oral question to introduce specific indicators in this regard. Several measures are being implemented already, such as the online interactive risk assessment tool developed by the Agency and a Europe-wide training programme for labour inspectors. A study on improving labour inspections in small and micro enterprises in the area of health and safety at work is currently under preparation. A number of user-friendly good-practice guides are already available with a view to supporting SMEs and micro-enterprises. In line with the Regulatory Fitness and Performance programme, the new strategic framework sets as an objective simplifying and rationalising the legal framework, in particular for SMEs, while at the same time ensuring the same level of protection. In this regard, the Commission has launched an ex post evaluation of 24 existing directives. The results are expected for the end of 2015. Furthermore, the framework highlights the need to address the impact on physical and mental health of changes in work organisation – a point which Parliament also underlined. It further acknowledges the need to improve statistics related to occupational safety and to set up a database. Statistics are critical to identify the various hazards, and your suggestions will be taken into account. Finally, let me mention that the results of the ongoing evaluation of the occupational safety and health directives will be determined to decide about possible new legislative initiatives.

We need regulations to keep people safe, and I will never support measures which make workers less safe. There is a misconception, though, that better regulation means a race to the bottom in terms of workers’ protection and health and safety. That is not the case. We should reduce the complexity of health and safety legislation, because if we do, we can increase compliance. We can achieve our policy goals of enhanced health and safety, while reducing the burdens on business.

However, I think it is important that we underscore what we are talking about here, because every year, more than 4 000 workers die in the EU due to accidents at work. More than three million workers are victims of accidents that mean they have to take more than three days off work. I mean, those are hugely significant figures. We are talking about 11 people every day who die from workplace accidents and over 8 000 who are injured. That is why this question was put to the Commission, and while there are a number of specific questions here, and I do not expect the Commissioner to answer all of them – I just want to ask, maybe to tease out one or two of the issues that we have raised here. When we talked about measurable goals with fixed timetables and periodic evaluation, I just want to ask: has any progress been made on, let us say, improving coverage of statistics, on reliability, on comparability, on the timeliness? Is there any specific progress that we can point to? What actions have been taken in order to promote exchange of good practices? For example, where SMEs might be mentored or supported by larger enterprises in the contractor-supplier-purchaser chain, have we any examples of that? We have heard a lot of talk about straightforward legislation and user-friendly guides. I think some of those may have been provided by OSHA, but again, if the Commissioner can give me any detail on that? The issue of gender and age-specific disaggregated statistics is very important, because I believe that if we can get our hands on that information, it will deliver better policy outcomes. So again, is there is any progress on that? Two final points. In a recent Eurobarometer study, workers considered stress to be the main occupational risk – 53% of them. Now I know that the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work is running an awareness-raising campaign – the Healthy Workplaces Campaign – but, given that it is such a high risk, I think that we need greater intervention on this issue and I think more needs to be done. I just want to ask the Commissioner if there are any proposals at all to promote a healthy environment and mental wellbeing at work. Finally, you will be aware that during the last mandate the Commission were proposing, at least, that we might have a directive on musculoskeletal diseases. That was dropped by the Council, but again, if we go to that same survey carried out by Eurobarometer, we see that one in every four says that ergonomic risks are very significant.

Part-time and precarious work is becoming the norm, and Ireland – my country – has had a 46% increase since 2008 in the number of workers who are underemployed. The psychosocial health impacts this phenomenon has on workers cannot be underestimated. Job insecurity and the pressure of irregular hours causes significant stress for workers and leads to sick days. Many of these workers are trapped in jobs that do not pay a living wage. These low wages then negatively impact on their ability to access healthcare and nutritious food.

I am referring not only to occupational accidents often caused by the lack or inadequacy of protection measures, but also to occupational diseases, which are a relatively neglected area. Many workers are affected by various cancers, skin conditions, musculoskeletal problems and other diseases due to working conditions and the materials with which they come into contact.  But how can there be prevention when, because of the crisis and the policy of austerity, countries such as Greece are experiencing a complete collapse of their health systems? I only mention that a patient in Greece, for a simple examination, faces an average waiting time of six months.

Europe is a community with very advanced legislation on the subject of safety at work. Unfortunately, this good legislation in individual countries often turns into formalism and bureaucracy. So how to achieve the goal? First of all, I remember the great lesson of a lawyer who lost his life in Italy because of his ideas, Marco Biagi, who taught us that topics like this must be addressed by putting the objectives first and not the rules.  So, what's our goal? First of all, training and information. But not only of the workers: also of the young people who are preparing to reach the world of work. They come to you with the awareness of what a good job means, how you choose it and, if you cannot choose it, how you defend it: with what rules, with what objectives, with what dignity in the relationship with the employer.

This new strategy must be aimed at a person who works hard, works hard and is increasing life expectancy. Demographic change in Europe must therefore be taken into account, as employers will have to recognise changes in the workforce and increasingly use older workers. The fact that the health risks of older workers are also significantly different from that of younger workers should therefore be assessed. Therefore, in order for people to be able to work longer, occupational health and safety measures must also be adapted to workers of this age. Another problem is that there is still little focus on the psychosocial risk aspect, i.e. the intimidation of workers. For example, they can lose their jobs at any time, because there is now a crisis because there are hundreds of jobs, thousands of those who can replace them. We are therefore also paying too little attention to the stress caused by the workload. And these issues are becoming increasingly important, as the working environment is changing dramatically when new technologies, materials, work processes, design, work is organized and administered in a different way.

I would like to thank you for today's debate. It gives me the opportunity to reiterate my commitment to improve people's working conditions and, above all, to pay attention to the protection of health and safety at work. I have taken note of many of your concerns and concerns. I cannot comment on everything, that would go too far, but I understand that you feel that this strategy has come rather late. We have to do it and we will now try to implement it as best we can. In any case, the framework is now in place and that is a good thing. It is aimed at an effective implementation of the agreements that are made. It is aimed at prevention and it is also aimed at responding to demographic developments, including the fact that we are dealing with an ageing working population. As I have said, we are currently undertaking a post-evaluation of the acquis communautaire, of everything we have on legislation - more than 24 directives are being scrutinised. We will continue to investigate what we need to do in a transparent and organised way. Let us now wait and see what emerges from this evaluation of the legislative texts, and when we know that we can see how we can tackle everything in its entirety in a structured, organised way, both legislative action and the political actions needed to improve the situation in the workplace. I understand from the debate that you are calling for a great deal of attention to safety and health in the workplace in SMEs. Rightly so, SMEs create a lot of jobs. So, and certainly there, the safety and health of people must be guaranteed. I agree with you that fewer rules should not come at the expense of protection. That is not to say that we should not investigate whether we can provide good protection with fewer rules, and that is one of the exercises that will also take place. As far as the number of accidents is concerned, that number remains high. Some of you have mentioned figures, every accident is one too many, so we can never be satisfied. However, what I have learned from the evaluation of the previous strategic framework is that the number of accidents has decreased. At the same time, we must be aware of the emergence of new and other risks, and we must take into mind this in the future approach to this important policy area. You have also mentioned one of them, namely mental health and stress at or after work. In the previous strategic framework, attention was already paid to this and I am satisfied that in the current strategic framework mental health is a priority as one of the challenges. We all know the situation of people who are constantly attainable. Everyone is connected 24 hours a day. We all carry these instruments with us, these are things that can, of course, create additional stress and need to be looked at in more detail. Whatever is happening in this area, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work is currently campaigning for healthy workplaces in Europe, and this is being done under the name Healthy work places manage stress. These are matters which are still in the early stages, but they are issues that clearly show that this is not just about words, but that political action is being taken in this matter. There is also a joint action on mental health and well-being at work coordinated by our Directorate-General, together with DG SANCO. That DG has been renamed, consumer protection is off, and is now called DG health. Here, a number of people are brought together from Member States looking at mental health in the workplace, including in the care professions. I believe that we will probably be able to learn a great deal from that too. Special attention has also been drawn here to, among other things, the dangers of asbestos. We know that asbestos has been banned in Europe for years, but that it is still present in a number of buildings and that, among other things, people in the construction sector, certainly those responsible for maintenance or who are active in the field of building demolition, can still be at risk; we are well aware of this. However, we also know that there is legislation in this area that protects people, and I would like to add that this piece of legislation is also involved in the evaluation process of the 24 directives that we are currently reviewing; only after the completion of the evaluation can we come up with an outcome. Only then can I tell you what political direction we think we should go in. Asbestos is certainly also a concern. Mrs Jongerius asked the question: what about soldiers and police men? I have to admit, I didn't know that this sector wasn't covered. I can there is something to suggest that it is not covered, but we must at least look at what prevents us from doing anything for that sector and I will certainly have that checked. Ladies and gentlemen, I have found that you are very motivated to cooperate in the field of health and safety in the workplace. I look forward to this cooperation and I can assure you once again that we will ensure good cooperation in this area too with all those involved and without a doubt also with the social partners. They really are our partners in this.

As key measures, I see better protection for non-standard labour professionals, adapting existing regulations to an ageing working population and developing European statistical mechanisms for monitoring work-related diseases.

This protection of equal treatment has subsequently been extended and deepened. The Court of Justice has also acted as a defender of citizens' rights, while several directives have been adopted to promote equal treatment. Unfortunately, however, work on this is not over. It continues. It must continue to combat any direct or indirect discrimination on grounds of nationality, sex, origin, religion, belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. That is a central task.  All Member States have now also transposed the directives. However, according to the Commission, there are a number of problem areas. These are obstacles to access to justice, inadequate sanctions, a lack of awareness of the rights of citizens through EU legislation, under-reporting on things, a lack of data and so on.  Many are therefore unaware of their rights. Here, of course, a responsibility rests with all of us, but especially on the Commission to disseminate information, quite simply, about what citizens can do and should do if he has been discriminated against.  A key area of discrimination is precisely about the labour market. All workers in Europe must be given the right to protection against discrimination. That is also why I have put this oral question up for discussion here today. We want this to be included and resolved and strengthened in the term of office before us. That is also why today we have raised the problems of underreporting, which must be resolved, and lack of access to justice. We must strengthen our preventive work as well. We must combat prejudices and underlying structures that lead to discrimination and which, in turn, can ultimately manifest in lost life chances or even physical violence.

This engagement is not new. The Union adopted in the past a comprehensive framework for tackling discrimination and ensuring respect for fundamental rights to equal treatment throughout the Union. This framework includes the Employment Equality Directive, the Directive on Racial Equality and the directives on gender equality. But to provide full effect, directives must be properly implemented in all Member States. The implementation report issued in January this year highlights, indeed, that more needs to be done to ensure effective implementation of the directives on employment equality. Member States have put in place implementing legislation, but effective protection to victims of this discrimination on the ground still has to be improved. Easy access to justice, availability of remedies and effective sanctions are not yet sufficiently secured everywhere in the Union and, on top of this, the report makes clear that today many victims of discrimination simply ignore their rights. The Commission will on a continuous basis carefully monitor the national developments, including any new legislation and the development of national case law. We will also pay more attention to what happens at regional and local level, and I am ready to use all available means, including the use of infringement proceedings, to ensure correct application in all Member States. But the Commission will also act itself to address the problems identified. We have a booklet which is currently under preparation, with practical guidance for victims of discrimination. The Commission is also providing funding for both awareness-raising and for training on equality law. In order to address the lack of information on discrimination, the Commission is assessing the means to promote collection of such data in cooperation with other players, such as the Fundamental Rights Agency. The disadvantages faced by women in employment, including the gender pay gap, are not specifically covered by the Employment and Equality Directive itself, which deals with discrimination on grounds of religion or belief, disability, age and sexual orientation. But there is a legal framework on equal pay, which includes the Employment Gender Equality Directive, clearly prohibiting any pay discrimination. It is reinforced by a recommendation on equal pay adopted earlier this year, and from now on I will strongly focus on the correct application and enforcement of the EU legal framework at national level and on the measures taken on the transparency of pay.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1050, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Verónica Lope Fontagné", "mepid": "96765", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, I will try not to pass the time. Commissioner, the existing legislation provides a good legal basis, but the main problem is that it is not always applied correctly and, in order for equal treatment to be a reality, Member States and civil society must be more involved. I would like to focus my speech on two groups. First, in people with disabilities. In order for them to work on an equal footing, in many cases, it is only necessary to make small adjustments in the workplace, adopting mechanisms that do not involve a disproportionate or undue cost to companies, but that guarantee their full participation. Secondly, I would like to refer to ethnic minorities and, in particular, to the Roma community. The employment exclusion rate is more than 78%. The problem is structural and requires rapid and long-term action, through awareness-raising campaigns aimed not only at society as a whole, but in particular for trolling and trade unions to eliminate once and for all the social stigma suffered by this minority. But, fundamentally, measures are needed to prevent absenteeism and drop-out, because, as my country's awareness campaign says, 'Gypsies with studies, Roma with a future'.

Thank you for actively addressing the issue. Discrimination in the workplace is precisely serious. The number of unreported cases is still very high. Recent data from the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights show that 82% of respondents who were affected by discrimination did not bring the case to the attention of the public. Either because they were not informed about their rights, or because they were afraid of a dispute with their employer, or because they were also afraid of the cost of a legal dispute. Discrimination must not take place. It is our duty to do everything we can to prevent this from happening in Europe. That is why we need clear common definitions of when discrimination occurs. And indirect discrimination in particular is often difficult to prove. We need information, information and appropriate penalties. The Member States need to become more ambitious.

As I have been helping people with disabilities or people from socially disadvantaged backgrounds as well as education for a long time, I see unequal access to education as one of the main areas of discrimination in Slovakia. Although our legislation talks about integration, it is hardly happening at all in practice. The employment situation is similar, with many employers paying punitive levies rather than hiring a person with disabilities. According to a recent survey by the Institute for Financial Policy of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic, if the job applicant has a name that suggests that he belongs to the Roma national minority, he/she has a significantly lower chance of being invited to an interview at all. However, our society is paying for and will pay for such segregation, not only in the huge economic losses from the untapped potential of these people, but also in the consequences of denying the self-realisation and human dignity of this broad group of people.

What I would say to you, Commissioner, is that there is a paradox with regard to anti-discrimination legislation at EU level, and it is this: I believe many Europeans are generally aware that we have anti-discrimination legislation, and indeed that we have equality in the area of employment. Yet, reading your own reports, all available information suggests that there are very low levels of reporting, and indeed, in your report which was published last January, you gave the commonest reasons for this. These include: the belief that nothing will happen as a result of reporting; a lack of knowledge on how to go about reporting an incident; and also negative experiences in relation to inconvenience, bureaucracy and, crucially, the length of the process. So again, your report goes on to say that there is a need to make further efforts at awareness-raising and reporting, and a need to make the complaint system more consumer-friendly, as it were, or customer-friendly. I think we need proposals on how to deal with these barriers on access to justice. We could look, for example, at the length of time during which a complaint could be made, getting rid of the short time limits that are there. We could also look at the cost of proceedings, and I think in all of that we need to link in with national actors on the ground. I think the issue of remedies – and one of our colleagues said a few moments ago that some employers would prefer to pay the costs rather than comply with the legislation – is a very important one, and the practice seems in most Member States to be that national authorities apply the lower scale of the sanctions available. I know the Commission perhaps cannot intervene directly, but it is an important issue and it is one that makes a difference, because if sanctions are not dissuasive then they are meaningless. On the whole issue of the shift in the burden-of-proof argument, where it is up to the respondent to prove there has been no discrimination, is that working satisfactorily and do you feel that any further action is needed? Finally, in the context of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we have ratified that and, of course, that has certain implications for our legislation, particularly in the area of reasonable accommodation for disabled persons. Do you believe that the ratification of the UN Convention will be meaningful – that was the second question we asked you – without any further action to make the non-provision of reasonable accommodation a discriminatory action?

When we look at the breakdown of unemployment figures, it is still very clear that there are still groups that are really suffering discrimination, whether they are people with disabilities, older workers, people from ethnic minorities, or whatever.  So we are not, as our colleague said, using the skills and the talents that are there, and a lot of the time we are not developing them in training either. People have talked about the awareness of rights; the Fundamental Rights Agency said that maybe about one in four people in the EU were aware of their rights under the legislation. So this begs a question about whether we can put in practice a strategy to improve that figure, measure the outcome and, hopefully, improve the results. Others have spoken a bit as well about the way in which we apply rights. We are aware that many national equality bodies have actually had their funding cut over the last few years.

Secondly, women in employment and social protection are also affected by many inequalities.

Some of you will remember that, during my hearing, I made it clear that promoting equality and fighting against discrimination, especially in the labour market, is one of my priorities, and I can only repeat that. It is therefore also my commitment now to ensure that there is better implementation of equal opportunities directives and that there is better protection for citizens against discrimination. There are several things we can do about it: having good laws is one, making sure they are applied is two. But, of course, we must also - and this has been addressed in the debate - ensure that we have more data. Because if we have data, problems become transparent, we make them visible, then we bring it up, then we qualify them, and then awareness of the fact that there is a problem will increase. The directive itself does not provide for mandatory data collection by the Member States. That is why we are exploring whether we can do something y-ness by, as I said in my introduction, by including the European Fundamental Rights Agency. Awareness-raising campaigns are another tool we can use, and I may like to remind you again. You have just asked for examples of the row - in the context of equal pay - of the pay gap, which is still there between men and women. For those who were to doubt it: we organise an equal pay-day every year, which clearly draws attention to this issue. It also calls for greater transparency in the context of a recommendation recently adopted, so that awareness is increased and something is done at the bottom to reduce and ultimately eliminate that pay gap. As far as the UN Convention and disabled people are concerned, this legislation prohibits discrimination against disabled people and there is an obligation for employers to ensure that disabled people are provided with an adapted workplace. However, there is also a limitation to that obligation: it should not cost the employer too much. That is a lot of giving and taking, because one also takes into account the cost effect for the employer. However, I believe that the ratification of the UN Convention will give us extra motivation to ensure that this aspect of our directive is finally properly implemented.

Together they have delivered the most stringent scrutiny that European banks have ever faced. The adverse stress test scenario was the most severe anywhere in the world. This has required a huge investment. Over 6 000 officials and experts worked on this project at its height, but the result was worth it because it has given us a health check of the European banking system, which enjoys broad international credibility. Overall, the results confirm the significant improvements there have been in the strength of European banks in the past six years. The capital ratios of EU banks are now at around 12%. Capitalisation levels are on a par with US banks. Between 2008 and 2013, more than EUR 200 billion of capital was raised by the 130 banking groups participating in the full comprehensive assessment, and a further EUR 57 billion has been added since January 2014 alone. As a result, our banks are much better placed to withstand financial shocks than they were before the crisis; and the rigour and transparency of the exercise mean that these results are credible across the world. This will, in turn, reassure investors about the quality of EU banks’ balance sheets, help restore confidence, and allow banks to carry out their core function: lending to the economy. Some banks still have work to do to strengthen their positions. The tests were carried out on the basis of the situation at the end of 2013 and identified a capital shortfall of EUR 25 billion for 25 banks. Taking into account capital raised in 2014, this shortfall falls to EUR 10 billion affecting only 14 banks. When adjustments are made to take account of additional capital available, two of these 14 banks do not need to proceed with capital-raising. One is in the process of being resolved. To protect taxpayers, the first port of call to address capital shortfalls should be private sources, and the remaining 11 banks therefore have a short window to raise money on the market. Should a public capital injection be necessary, it will be subject to state aid rules, as set out in the 2013 Banking Communication; and these rules require burden-sharing from shareholders and junior debt-holders before any public support is provided. Stress tests are now part of the European supervisory toolbox. They must be used regularly and in a robust manner to provide a clear and accurate picture of the robustness of our banking system, to detect vulnerabilities and to pave the way for timely intervention. The comprehensive assessment also marks a turning point for the supervision of eurozone banks. On 4 November, the baton passed from national supervisors to the Single Supervisory Mechanism, and I shall work closely with Ms Nouy and other key players in the SSM to ensure the success of this change. We have entered a new chapter in our efforts to make the EU banking sector healthy, resilient and transparent. We have much better capitalised banks, we have exacting rules and processes for their oversight, we have new tools to resolve banks in a crisis, and we have a powerful and independent new banking supervisor in the eurozone. Now I hope we can build on these foundations and start to turn the page on the financial crisis, focusing on the pressing challenges of regenerating growth and investment. The G20 in Brisbane emphasised the need for a comprehensive programme to restore sustainable economic growth. This is the priority of the new Commission, reflected in our investment initiative and the capital markets union, which will promote non-bank sources of finance. Bank lending, though, remains the principal funding mechanism for European businesses, and I believe that the stress test and the comprehensive assessment should make us feel more confident that our banking system is now better placed to play its full role in supporting economic growth.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1071, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Burkhard Balz", "mepid": "96997", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has The balance sheet test took place when the Single Supervisory Mechanism was still at a provisional stage. Existing structures of the European Central Bank have therefore played a special role. That, of course, must now change. The SSM has a duty to institutionalise itself in order to maintain a necessary separation between monetary policy and supervision. There are certainly also critical comments during the test, for example with regard to the communication of the catalogue of requirements, the involvement of external consultants and the agreements with the national level. Nevertheless, the balance sheet test has remained within expectations and is a good basis for the start of the new supervisory structures. Many financial institutions have already significantly strengthened their capital base. Risk awareness has increased significantly and, finally, we need to return to the point where the risks are taken where they are taken. The balance sheet test was a first step. What is much more important, however, is how the SSM can now establish itself in the coming months. The right conclusions must be drawn from the test. The capital plans of institutions in difficulty need a political, rigorous examination. Strong and credible oversight must have a range of options for action. However, there is no carte blanche to do so. The legislative requirements must continue to be the stipulation. Democratic legitimacy is essential. The European Parliament will certainly use its hard-fought powers of control, I would say. For us, cooperation with national supervision is an essential point. Clear structures must apply, particularly to the indirectly supervised banks. It would be a terrible development if there were competition between the supervisors at the expense of the banks. Therefore, supervisory structures must remain consistent and predictable. Specific supervision is appropriate depending on the business model. The balance sheet has now been examined.

In Greece in particular, the old shareholders still remain in the management of the Greek systemic banks, although they hold a minority of the shares. Mr President, since the beginning of the crisis EUR 1.6 trillion has been allocated to the rescue of banks. The banks were rescued but at the same time public debt increased. In some countries, such as Cyprus, depositors paid for it with the well-known bail in. The main problem is dealing with \"red loans\" and this needs to be addressed immediately.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Lord Hill! The German chancellor promised after the G20 summit in Brisbane that taxpayers would never again be liable for zombie banks. The EU promises something similar. If I may say so, this is stupidity. The resolution fund will be worth EUR 55 billion over eight years. Since the crisis in the EU alone, we have pumped more than EUR 1.6 trillion into ailing banks. Taxpayers in the EU continue to be too big and too connected to fail for gamblebanks that do not lend to invest but are too big and too connected to fail. Yesterday, the Financial Times reported that the financial lobby is running a storm against a separation from serious banking and investment banking. You have written to Lord Hill, not to us as Parliamentarians. These bankers are soft eggs. They are afraid of the market economy. Deutsche Bank and Co. want to gamble, and when things go wrong, they play state bank. Nor is the argument that financial market regulation is repeatedly argued that it would hinder lending. It is austerity: if public investment, when wages, when pensions fall, then companies will not ask for loans for investment. The stress test does not give a warning. Shadow banks were not covered. The crisis scenario was softer than in the last crisis. Deflation was ignored. So is the networking of the banking sector. For example, if institutions sell off bad papers in fire sales, it also has an impact on other solvent institutions. Banks continued to work on the internal risk models that failed so reprehensibly during the crisis. I fear conflicts of interest at the ECB. As supervisor and lender of last resort, it will be subject to permanent conflicts of interest. The ECB could now use the purchase of junk loans, known as asset-backed securities, to rehabilitate the very 25 banks that have fallen through the test. So far, at least, the ECB has not denied this. I would also be interested to know what the European Commission's position is on such an incentive for banks to then offload their scrap from the ECB.

The two most important causes of the financial crisis have still to be addressed. First we need a clear-cut separation of retail from casino banking activities, and secondly we need to reduce the size of individual banks so that no single financial institution can threaten the whole financial system. This problem of ‘too big and too interconnected to fail’ is more important and more urgent than the capital position of any individual bank. Recent news about the Royal Bank of Scotland misleading regulators and deliberately undermining their own customers suggests that banks are still no way near the responsible corporations serving the real economy that we need them to be. If it is not too cheeky on the day the Pope has visited Parliament, I recommend you to check the Green Group’s Seven Deadly Sins website to assess the performance of your national banks. Finally we need to confront head-on the vast and growing levels of debt which are the fundamental cause of instability in the monetary system globally. We should establish a citizens’ audit of how that debt was acquired and to what extent it can be considered legitimate, and we should reconsider the nature of the money creation system, which relies on allowing private banks to create money with a simultaneous creation of debt.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1076, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Marco Valli", "mepid": "124778", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the regulatory process that should have led to the neutralisation of systemic risk from the 2009 crisis to today is once again in danger of being ineffective and rewarding for speculation. These stress tests are proof of this. You, Lord Hill, say that the European banking system is now solid and credible. But do you really think it's solid? The risk weighted asset parameters used actually penalise the most exposed banks on credit-related banking products and reward banks exposed to poor or dubious financial products such as derivatives. For example, the amount of derivatives in the 2013 financial statements of one of Europe's largest banks, Deutsche Bank, is EUR 54.7 trillion, which means about 20 times Germany's GDP or 5.7 times the GDP of the whole of Europe.  Now tell me if it makes sense to talk about the success of these stress tests and whether the banking system is solid and credible when there are banks in our house with this systemic risk scale, when the shadow banking system has reached immense and equally systemic volumes, when some of these market realities by agreeing can move volumes of money so that they can blackmail entire nations , threatening the democratic process of decision-making and self-determination of peoples.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1077, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Bernard Monot (NI). -", "mepid": "124761", "text": "   Mr President, the satisfaction shown by the ECB and all the policies when reading the balance sheet of the stress tests at the end of last October must be nuanced.

About a fortnight ago, on the sidelines of the G20, the Financial Stability Board - the FSB - published its annual list of thirty private megabanks, including European and French banks, that would not withstand the next crisis, a crisis of which it is no longer a question of when it will take place but whether it will take place. The FSB calls for stricter solvency standards than the current Basel III regulations and recommends that these banks increase their capital by up to 20% of their assets. Who's right? The ECB, who tells us to sleep easy? Or the FSB, which raises fears of another catastrophe?  The stakes are high because, when these systemic risks are realized, you will now have to enforce, as in Cyprus in April 2013, the Frankfurt MUR - the single resolution mechanism - and its famous lease-in which will drain the deposits and savings of customers to enable the countries concerned to bail out their own bankrupt banks.

I think in terms of the credibility of the test, which is one of the themes of the debate, I would argue that the exercise was credible because a robust methodology was followed; there was a great deal of detail in the quality assurance; there was strong governance and multiple layers of accountability. I think, since, that investors and analysts have praised the degree of disclosure and the degree of transparency about how the tests were run, and I think that there has also been a broadly positive market reaction, since the results were announced a month ago, and I believe that is testament to the credibility of the exercise. One of the points that was raised repeatedly – in slightly different ways – was the question of whether this is enough and whether it will lead to the pickup in bank lending that we all want to see. The purpose of the exercise was to identify and address vulnerabilities in the banking system and to try and dispel some of those doubts about its health – but it was not an exercise for its own sake; rather, the purpose was to try to restore investor trust and confidence. I believe that the European Banking Authority and the ECB did an excellent job and that they have successfully met the objectives of the exercise. We have devoted a lot of attention to the supply side, but in order to get lending going again, we need the demand side to pick up as well, and that is also something we need to look at. Our foremost priority at the Commission is to create an environment conducive to growth so that businesses can create jobs and our economies can prosper once more. That, of course, is the background to the investment initiative, which President Juncker will be announcing to Parliament tomorrow; and it is also the prism through which I intend to look at the question of regulation and regulation of the banking sector. I believe that a healthy European banking sector is one that supports growth and benefits EU citizens, businesses and society as a whole. It is a system, as a number of colleagues said, where taxpayers are no longer exposed to the risk of bank failures; it is a system that is solid; it is a system that is stable, without banks which are too big to fail, too costly to save or too complex to resolve. That means it needs to be a system that is responsibly regulated, managed and supervised, based on strong ethical standards and sound governance. Ms Ferreira reminded us of the need for the next steps on banking union, and I agree with what she said about that. An important task has been started, but there is more work to do, and she reminded us of some of the immediate steps that I know she and her colleagues are working on at the moment. I also take the point that we need to be alert to new risks and to look, as I said, in particular at the question of ‘too big to fail’. But I believe – although there is more work to do – that the results of the EU-wide stress tests have brought us one step nearer to a healthy banking system, and that the stress tests and the comprehensive assessment will help restore confidence in our banks.

First, these tests are based on a simulation exercise. In addition, the evaluation method, which is chosen by the European Central Bank, is to ask the different banks to send it a balance sheet report, leaving room for them to misrepresent the accounts. An example of the low neutrality in such tests occurred in 2010 when the resistance tests were passed by many Irish and Spanish entities, including Bankia, which had to receive public aid shortly after passing such tests.

A regulation which, together with the regulation on the ECB's powers to impose sanctions, is one of the pillars of the European Central Bank's statistical activity. The reason for this proposal lies in the entry into force of the single banking supervision mechanism, which gives new powers to the ECB and therefore makes it necessary to update the mechanisms for collecting and processing statistical data.  Once adopted, the legislative act will allow the ECB to use confidential statistical information in a similar way to what national central banks, which perform prudential supervision functions, do. In addition, the ECB will have the opportunity to disseminate confidential statistical information to the national authorities responsible for financial supervision or stability of the financial system, as well as to the European Stability Mechanism to the extent and level of detail necessary for carrying out their respective tasks. The position adopted by the ECON Committee on 11 November welcomes the ECB's proposals and supplements them with a series of suggestions aimed at extending the scope of the report. The amendments I have tabled as rapporteur aim to ensure better transmission of data and greater protection of its confidentiality. In particular, an amendment introduces an obligation on authorities and bodies, including the ESM, which receive confidential statistical information to take all necessary measures to ensure its protection. The ECON Committee also adopted other amendments which reinforce certain points not covered by the ECB recommendation. In particular, transparency in the ECB's statistical acts is strengthened, calling for the ECB to make public decisions to exempt particular categories of subjects from reporting obligations. In addition, it is asked to extend the type of data collected, so as to include raw data as well. An important reference to the principle of proportionality is added, in the definition and imposition of statistical reporting obligations. Finally, with regard to the sanctioning part, a clear distinction is made between negligent or intentional conduct in infringement cases and in the transmission of data by statistical agents, which is particularly relevant precisely from the point of view of compliance with the principle of proportionality. The adoption of this review is therefore of particular importance, as it falls within the more general framework of strengthening the ECB's supervisory tasks within the framework of the Banking Union design. I therefore hope that Parliament will welcome the recommendations of the ECON Committee in order to allow rapid adoption by the Council and also, of course, that the broad consensus that has been expressed around the report, for which I thank the shadow rapporteurs and the political groups for their cooperation, will provide an additional incentive for the Council to take into account the recommendations of the ECON Committee.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1089, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Kay Swinburne", "mepid": "96920", "text": "  rapporteur. - Mr President, may I extend a welcome to Commissioner Hill.

In the last Parliament we made an unprecedented change to the role of the European Central Bank. Instead of just acting as a central bank with power over monetary policy, we gave it powers to supervise the largest banks in the eurozone, with the option for those Member States outside the eurozone to also join the single supervisory mechanism. The Banking Union has fundamentally changed the role and responsibility of the ECB. While the ECB should continue to be independent from political influence in terms of monetary policy, it is imperative that in its new function as banking supervisor it is accountable. During earlier trialogues the Parliament tried to include scrutiny processes and transparency in the ECB’s operations and was often rebuffed, yet we did make some huge steps forward in terms of information-sharing with Parliament, so some democratic accountability is present within the process. I have tried in this report to continue in this vein, adding accountability and transparency wherever possible. In the initial draft of this regulation, when the ECB imposed a sanction upon a financial institution it could decide whether or not this sanction was made public. There were no conditions or time limits attached. It was entirely within their mandate to decide on whether or not to disclose. While I can see reasons why, in some circumstances, not immediately publishing the fact that they have been sanctioned might be necessary, for example in the case of a wider financial crisis situation or, indeed, worries about bank runs, this should not be the norm. The normal operating procedure should be immediate public disclosure. The prospect of a fine may not faze large financial companies, but being on the front page of every newspaper poses a much larger reputational risk. For this reason we have a compromise between political groups to ensure a three-year time limit so that the ECB cannot wait any longer to disclose the fact that they have sanctioned a financial firm. I am disappointed that there is one area that we have not been able to find a compromise on so far. I am a firm believer in the concept of innocent until proven guilty. Therefore, if we consider that part of the punishment for breaking the rules is that of reputational damage, using a ‘naming and shaming’ approach, then it seems to me logical that if a decision is subject to an appeal and may still be overturned, we should allow a longer time period before disclosure to the wider market. Failing to provide this safeguard may otherwise cause a bank to lose significant value in its share price based solely on accusations that are later overturned on appeal. I believe adding in this safeguard ensures the fairness of the disclosure process and will increase the effectiveness of the sanctioning regime, which will then increase the effectiveness of the ECB itself when exercising its supervisory powers. I therefore hope that the majority of the European Parliament political groups can continue to support this centrist position calling for increased transparency. Specifically on the Gualtieri report I have little to add, because quality of regulation depends on quality of the statistics that the supervisors are working on. I honestly believe that the only way we get good quality supervision is good-quality data. Therefore I hope the proposals in these two reports are supported tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1090, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Jonathan Hill", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss ECB sanctions and ECB statistical information, and I would like to congratulate Ms Swinburne and Mr Gualtieri on their work. The ECB sanctions recommendation is important because it is part of implementing the banking union, and we need it because it will give the ECB the means to enforce EU banking law and its decisions. So the Commission fully supports the objectives of the ECB recommendation. Since sanctions can have a major financial and reputational impact on banks and can be subject to legal challenge, the rules should be clear and consistent and provide legal certainty. So the Commission has no serious concerns with the approach taken by the ECB in its recommendation and by Parliament in its opinion. The Commissionʼs legal services have, however, detected two legal inconsistencies between the ECB recommendation and Parliament’s draft opinion, on the one hand, and the Regulation on the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) on the other. One of those points relates to a legal-base issue and concerns the power to sanction not only the ECBʼs own decisions and regulations, but also directly-applicable Union law, and the other point refers to the publication of sanctions. The ECB and Parliament’s opinion, as we just heard, proposed to grant the ECB the flexibility to delay publishing sanctions until after any appeal has been concluded. Personally, I understand the logic of that approach and I can see why the ECB might want this discretion. There is, however, a legal inconsistency with the SSM Regulation, which states that the ECB shall publish a sanction whether there has been an appeal or not. I think, therefore, it is worth having a look at this point in order to try to resolve it in a common-sense way. In terms of next steps, the Commission will adopt its own opinion in the weeks to come, and we will continue to work with the Council, the ECB and Parliament to ensure that the ECB possesses all the tools necessary for the effective enforcement of the applicable EU banking rules. As far as statistical data is concerned, the Commission issued its opinion on 13 October. We welcome the ECB’s proposal to align the Regulation on the collection of statistical information to the central bank’s new competences in the area of prudential supervision of credit institutions. The proposed changes will enable the transmission of confidential statistical information between all authorities responsible for supervision and macro-prudential oversight. It will also minimise the reporting burden on undertakings by ensuring that data needs to be collected only once, so we welcome the report of the European Parliament and we agree with Parliament’s view expressed in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) report on the confidentiality of statistical information and are happy with what they propose in this respect.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1091, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Burkhard Balz", "mepid": "96997", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the As a Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we naturally welcome today's debate, which is about clarifying the competences of the ECB and the SSM in terms of statistical requirements and the possibility of sanctions. The ECB and the SSM cannot switch and act as they wish. The ECON Committee has already made its position known, and I can say that we parliamentarians will also exercise our supervisory role on these two points. In the case of statistical requirements, the ECB must ensure that confidential data remains confidential. As the EPP, we would like to express our concerns about how comprehensive the ECB's data claim could become. Proportionality is an important issue here. It is important to ensure that reporting obligations do not become excessive, especially with regard to small and medium-sized institutions. We do not need additional separate data collection points if the national authorities collect the relevant data anyway. In this way, the duplication of reporting channels must be counteracted. Clear structures are important and the basis for ensuring that data collection and analysis work well. What we, as legislators, have decided in the sectoral directives must be taken into account and, in the end, the ECB must not undermine it. This must also apply to the scope of the report and to the reporting rhythms. With the possibility of sanctions, we would like to stress the importance of cooperation with the national authorities. The ECB and the SSM are bound by confidentiality. Publications are then possible as soon as the legal redress has been exhausted. I would also like to highlight the international component. Thus, the issue of a level playing field with regard to the proportionality of penalties also plays a role.

The scope of the ECB’s powers to impose sanctions was extended in order to establish a coherent regime for the imposition by the ECB of all administrative penalties relating to the performance of its supervisory tasks. In this aspect, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs our proposal to the Council aims to improve the text concerning several points, including the following three: firstly, it emphasises that the ECB shall act based on equal treatment of credit institutions and without any discrimination against any Member State; secondly, it specifies that the period to impose penalties starts to run from the date on which the decision was taken to initiate infringement procedures, rather than the date on which the infringement occurred; and thirdly, it ensures transparency by publishing the decision without undue delay, with a possibility to delay publication until three years after the date on which the decision was taken in the event that immediate publication would jeopardise the stability of financial markets. At this point I would like to raise our great concern regarding the PPE’s amendment introducing a broader derogation which allows delaying, in an open-ended manner, the publication of the decisions imposing penalties with the phrase ‘until all legal means of appeal have been exhausted’.

First of all, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs and the other colleagues who have contributed to these reports very much for the work they have done. Recent years have shown that inadequate supervision of banks can have disastrous consequences for the stability of financial markets and for the economy as a whole. Now that the Banking Union has been launched on 4 November and the main European banks have been placed under the direct supervision of the ECB, it is therefore of the utmost importance that the ECB can act quickly, correctly and effectively when banks break rules that can lead us back to pre-and financial crisis practices and problems. That is why the subjects of these two reports are so important. In working on and assessing these reports, the following three things have been leading us: firstly, strengthening the financial sector. Adequate supervision and addressing abuses in the banking sector are necessary to restore confidence, both within Europe and internationally, in the European banking sector. At the same time, the financial credibility and resilience of the sector must also be strengthened. Fines imposed on banks that do not comply with the rules should therefore go towards strengthening the banking resolution fund, under the motto 'the polluter pays'.  The second point is to prevent financial instability. This means that investigations into breaches by banks must be initiated and completed within a reasonable period of time. Ensuring financial stability also means that any decisions on sanctions or fines are published when the outcome of those investigations is final. The last point I would like to mention is to improve the provision of information by banks to regulators. As far as we are concerned, this must be done as effectively as possible, and we therefore support the amendments that make this possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1095, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Sven Giegold", "mepid": "96730", "text": "  Mr President, For better, I would like to make a name for my free Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Kay Swinburne, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and for the way in which she has been a member of the European Union. We are largely in agreement on these reports. There were nupts in many conflicts. Thank you for the good cooperation. I have two things to do in particular. The first point concerns statistics for joint supervision by the European Central Bank. Here, the problem seems to me to be less in legislation than in practice. I wonder whether it is appropriate for the ECB to create a kind of credit register up to EUR 50 000 and then have data on every single loan movement down to the smallest bank. I wonder who is actually paying attention to the principle of proportionality there. As Mr Balz pointed out, we have more problems there with multiple reporting and a tendency towards overzealousness. Perhaps the Commission can also look at whether this is consistent with the principles of proportionality. With the aim of sanctions, and this is the main point of contention that we still have here: on the question of whether sanctions should now be published directly, even if an objection is lodged, our basic legal principle is actually very clear. From the point of view of the rule of law, it is actually a kind of prejudgment if one can no longer defend oneself against a sanction under the rule of law, since this sanction has in fact already occurred through publication. That is why we support the EPP's concern in principle to say that this should not happen.

The problem here is that you can make as many ad hoc adjustments to the powers and remits of the ECB and its quangos as you like, but you will still have a seriously suboptimal currency zone. Only by abolishing national governments, national elections and, indeed, any feeling of national identity among national populations could you create the conditions for a smooth-running single currency zone. You would need popular consent for massive and permanent transfer payments from the stronger parts of the zone to the weaker. You would need to deploy ruthless political power to impose structural and, indeed, cultural changes on the non-powerhouse nations. You do not have any of this, and I, for one, pray you never get it, because the right outcome is to dismantle the euro and let national currencies presided over by national governments accountable to national populations come into being once again. That way, interest rate decisions could be taken to suit national economies and the exchange rate could serve as an adjustment mechanism to protect economic activity in the weaker parts.

Since we sit here almost until midnight, it means that we are not indifferent to these matters. We are focusing on the details of the functioning of the European Central Bank, but the crisis we fear is rooted elsewhere – it is rooted in the very systemic essence of this institution, which is the European Central Bank. After all, this bank functions as an institution controlling the outflow of euro money. This has the effect that inflation, or depreciation of the euro, gives profits to this central bank in the amount of money issued, while at the same time giving the same losses to all users of the euro, depreciating that money, and that is the root of the crisis. All national economies have so far kept their money in their budgets and in their national banks as long as they used national currencies. And at the moment we are fattening the giant parasite of Europe, which is causing the crisis of this Europe, and we cannot, by analysing the trifles, lose such an important factor that has stopped our development.

It is not, in fact, possible for the ECB to be limited to a technical function anymore. The ECB today has a political mission, and taking refuge in this debate on the strictly technical issue is a mistake, and we, as long as we give us a voice, will not allow that to happen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1112, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Jonathan Hill", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the hour may be late but the debate has been an interesting one, and Mr Giegold brought us back to the technical nature of what we are here to discuss. It shows the significance of the implementation phase that we have entered into – into this area of financial services – and it underlines the old saying about the devil always being in the detail. As I said at the beginning, the Commission has already adopted its opinion on the statistics recommendation, and it will adopt its opinion on the sanctions recommendation in the coming weeks. I have heard the comments made this evening by Members – some of whom are still here – about the importance of data remaining confidential, about proportionality in reporting, about equal treatment for all and the need for good supervision, and I will obviously reflect on those. I am grateful to the ECB for having prepared the two recommendations, which I think provide a sound base for the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council. I think it is essential that we have strong and legally sound sanctioning regimes in place. As I indicated earlier, there are some technical legal issues about the legal base of one of the recommendations, so I will continue to work closely with the Parliament, the ECB and the Council to see that we can get a balanced outcome, which I believe is what Members want. I would just like to end by thanking Ms Swinburne and Mr Gualtieri for their reports; they have given us all a lot to think about and they have pointed to some extremely helpful ways forward.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1113, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Roberto Gualtieri", "mepid": "96892", "text": "  Rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think I will even need to use both minutes, because I seem to note that there is broad agreement and also a positive agreement with the European Commission on the report on the collection of statistics. I therefore believe that we will be largely consensual tomorrow and I naturally reiterate the hope that the Council will take account of our recommendations and those of the Commission. On the other hand, I have some political and legal problems with the other report and, of course, I consider the Commissioner's statements about doubts about the legal basis and the consistency with the SSM Regulation to be very important, and I therefore hope that these critical issues and these elements, which are certainly very important, will naturally be taken into account, including in tomorrow's vote on the Swinburne report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1114, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Kay Swinburne", "mepid": "96920", "text": "  rapporteur. - Mr President, I call on my colleagues tomorrow to send a strong message to the Council on the need for increased transparency and public disclosure with respect to the sanctions. I appreciate that, as has become fairly obvious tonight, there is a matter outstanding that has proven to be very controversial: that of whether or not an appeal should be allowed before public disclosure. I am sure the Commission will advise the Council on how they might balance the need for information to be made public versus the right of a company to appeal, also bearing in mind that they need to balance the requirements of the SSM legislation with this report, and indeed the procedures for disclosure by listed companies throughout the EU and the possible market abuse regulation and directive requirements too. I am sure the Commission will find a solution to this, and I call upon my Members tomorrow to send a strong message on the need for public disclosure.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1115, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Puhemies. -", "mepid": "2119", "text": "   The debate is closed.

However, I would like to point out that the situation of these banks also affects the credibility of the banking system of countries that have not adopted the euro, because the European banking system is a system of connected vessels. I strongly support the increase in the ECB's supervisory powers over euro area banks. It seems particularly important to me to extend particular supervision to all banks whose assets exceed at least EUR 30 billion or represent at least 20% of gdp in their countries. In practice, this will mean the supervision of 130 euro area banks. Europeans need to be sure that these banks operate lawfully, are managed professionally, have liquidity. The serious problems of one of these banks would not only affect its head office, but could also affect the situation of its subsidiaries in other countries. Therefore, the ECB's additional supervisory powers over euro area banks are economically and socially justified.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}]
