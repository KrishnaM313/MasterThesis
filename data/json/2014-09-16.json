These achievements, which we tend to take for granted, are the long-standing aspirations of the people of Ukraine. For many, they correspond with a future based on European values which, as Europeans themselves, they share. They have paid a high price in the process since last November, and I am proud to be here today so that we can together take a historic step in Ukraine’s political association and economic integration with the European Union.  Much has happened since we were preparing for the Vilnius Summit one year ago. Crimea, part of the sovereign territory of an independent Ukraine, has been illegally annexed by Russia in an act we will never recognise. Furthermore, the territorial integrity of Ukraine is being further challenged by rebels in the East, who are supported through the direct military involvement of Russia. Many hundreds have been killed in military action among people who had been living as peaceful neighbours only a year ago, but aggression does not pay. On the contrary, it has further united the Ukrainian people behind the aspiration for a better future for their country.  There is no time to rest. Much remains to be done. The fragile ceasefire will need to be turned into a genuine peace. The courageous move by President Poroshenko offers a real opportunity for lasting peace, but there are many challenges. Direct fighting on the ground has become sporadic and prisoners are being freed, but unfortunately incidences of shelling and shooting continue. Russian troops are still in Ukraine; armed forces are using the ceasefire to redeploy and resupply; and large parts of the border remain outside of the control of the authorities, allowing a continuous flow of militants, arms and equipment into Ukraine from Russia. What can we do? Our approach is threefold. Firstly, we continue to give our full and active support for a sustainable political solution. Secondly, we are maintaining pressure on Russia through a gradual increase of individual and economic sanctions to try to make it alter its course of action and move towards a solution. And thirdly, we continue our support for Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and to help it overcome the difficulties it faces. My colleague Commissioner Oettinger is sparing no efforts to facilitate an agreement between Russia and Ukraine ensuring a fair price for gas deliveries and security of supply to the European Union. We have also engaged with Russia to discuss the effects on the Russian economy of the implementation of the association agreement – including the DCFTA – with a view to clarifying concerns and, where appropriate, identifying solutions. The deal reached on Friday by my colleague Commissioner Karel De Gucht is good news for de-escalation, and it has the potential to be a game-changer in the ongoing crisis. I will discuss this further in the next debate this morning. You are aware that the European Union adopted a new package of restrictive measures with regard to Russia last week on the basis of the mandate of the European Council of 30 August. This was done in response to the increased inflow of fighters and weapons from the territory of the Russian Federation into Eastern Ukraine and the aggression by the Russian armed forces on Ukrainian soil over the past weeks, and in order to reinforce the effectiveness of existing measures. The new package includes, firstly, more individuals who are responsible for undermining the territorial integrity of Ukraine, and secondly, economic and financial sanctions with regard to access to capital markets, defence, dual-use goods and sensitive technologies. We have always stressed that our restrictive measures are reversible and scalable; therefore, by the end of September, the Member States will carry out a comprehensive review of the implementation of the peace plan and, in the light of the review, and if the situation on the ground so warrants, the sanctions may be amended, suspended or repealed – in whole or in part – depending, of course, also on developments in Crimea. We have already expressed our strong support for the peace deal agreed in Minsk; its implementation is a key to success. We need to learn from recent experience, from the failed attempts in Geneva and Berlin earlier this year, to pass from words to deeds in reaching a political solution, and to respect the ceasefire agreed in June. We call on the Russian Government to pass from verbal pledges to the implementation of commitments this time around and to ensure a genuine and a comprehensive implementation of the peace plan. As I have said, the implementation of the ceasefire agreement and the road map will be important for all further decisions on sanctions. Today it is difficult to see if and how successfully European Union relations with Russia can continue under the label of the so-called strategic partnership. In the short term, much more effort is needed to reach a comprehensive conflict resolution in Ukraine, and Russia must show that it takes its commitments seriously. Russia should prove in deeds its respect for international law and for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of its neighbours. As for the medium and long term, the European Union and Russia will need to further build their relations on shared interests with a view to engaging in dialogue, particularly in the fields of trade and investment, energy, science, cooperation in solving international crises and in responding to global challenges. In any case, the solution to the conflict in Ukraine will be the litmus test for launching a dialogue on the development of the huge untapped potential of the European Union’s future relations with Russia. We must avoid creating a lasting rift on our continent. We must also reflect on how we can jointly work on a vision of cooperation on the European continent, where all countries can take advantage of economic opportunities from Lisbon to Vladivostok.  Our European House is being destroyed; the time has come to rebuild it with all European partners involved, not leaving anyone outside of this process. The relationship between the EU and Russia played a central role; the relationship between the European Union, the customs union and, in the future, the Eurasian Union will have an important role to play.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Elmar Brok", "mepid": "1263", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has I believe that today is an historic moment, that the treaty with Ukraine will be ratified at the same time in the Rada and in the European Parliament, and that we are saying that, even after Tuesday's agreement, this treaty will not be changed at all. It doesn't change a word, there's an asymmetric implementation. The fact that this has been recognised in this way no longer gives Russia the justification for taking action against this Treaty and of using it as an alibi to take action against Ukraine. I believe that we should make this very clear that this Treaty, in its wording, applies in all parts, unamended. It must also be clear that this agreement can no longer be torpedoed. I believe that it is equally important that the Ukrainian President and the Ukrainian Government propose today in the Rada a series of reform possibilities of anti-corruption, decentralisation and other things that will make it possible to initiate a sensible process within Ukraine too, thereby implementing the Poroshenko peace plan accordingly. This, too, is an important measure. It must also be said that the energy package, which is once again under negotiation, comes to a reasonable solution, that Russia must no longer be allowed to use energy and energy prices as a political weapon. I hope that an agreement will be reached there. Now we come to a third area – that is the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The annexation of Crimea under international law, the lack of sufficient respect for the ceasefire, the talk about Novorossiya, which gives the impression that we want to annex other areas, that Russian soldiers have been involved in and engaged in hybrid warfare in Ukraine with tanks, official battalions, and that, as Commissioner rightly said, we want to see action rather than words, and that this has never been respected in Russia since the Geneva agreements. As long as that is not the case, we will persevere with the sanctions and, if nothing happens, we will possibly issue further sanctions, because it must be clear to Russia that international law is valid and that Ukraine's territorial integrity is safeguarded.  Commissioner, you have rightly said that we are prepared to partner with Russia. It is in our interest to have a good relationship with Russia and Russia with us. But this can only be done under the conditions of respect for international law. I believe that this must be clear. I believe that the acceptance of current Russian policy in some parts is simply unacceptable to us, because we should see that this Europe is formed on the basis of the law and the rules that no country is entitled to govern in the internal affairs of another country by pressure and by attacking such countries.  This must also be clear, that this applies not only to Ukraine, but also to Moldova, including to matters of Georgia and other countries, but also, in particular, to safeguard our own countries. Now I am glad that a NATO renaissance has taken place in Newport. Europe's collective security also depends on NATO. That is why Poland and the Baltic States must be adequately protected. It should also be clear that we are entering a new era, that we are finally implementing a European foreign, security and defence policy in order to ensure in this way that the territory of each european state must have the same quality and that no one can be disadvantaged. Everyone must know that they have the solidarity of the other in order to ensure a peaceful Europe on this basis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Gianni Pittella", "mepid": "4436", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, unfortunately, as we know in Ukraine, more than three thousand people have died in recent months. Many more people were injured. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are fleeing.  The principle of international law of the inviolability of borders has been broken and dialogue between partner countries has been replaced by escalation of violence and the imposition of diplomatic sanctions. These are the elements of a crisis of great importance to Europe. We must be able to respond fully and firmly, not only because this crisis will have an impact on our security, but also because what is at stake is the future of relations with our neighbours, with whom we share the main interests. With this responsibility and with this firmness, we must ask ourselves, this Parliament, the Member States and the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy this question: does Europe need a new Cold War? We Socialists and Democrats say no, but we also wonder whether Europe should allow anything to prevent a new Cold War. We Socialists and Democrats say no. We believe that not everything can be allowed and insist on respecting the right of Ukrainians to decide their fate as well as on defending the principle of territorial integrity.  Peace and prosperity in our neighbourhood should be the objective, and we still want to believe that this objective is shared with Russia. At the same time, the defence of international law is a duty for us, and legality is the single framework for developing future peaceful relations. The recently declared ceasefire is a positive step forward, but it is fragile. We need to maintain dialogue with Russia in order to make the ceasefire effective and to assist those affected by the conflict. Sanctions cannot always replace the search for a diplomatic and political solution. We call on the High Representative, in the future too, to facilitate dialogue between Ukraine and Russia and to maintain open channels of communication with Russia in order to take concrete steps towards a peaceful solution to the crisis. Among these passages I would like to mention: one, the withdrawal of all military forces from Ukraine; two, to ban the entry of fighters and weapons into eastern Ukraine; three, the commitment of the rebels in the negotiations for a comprehensive political solution. We are sure that Russia can convince the rebels, because another conflict on russia's borders would be unacceptable. Let us therefore give peace a chance, a chance. Taking into account the situation on the ground, the European Union must be ready to phase out sanctions and, if the assessment is positive, to re-establish good relations with Russia. I would also stress that the crisis in Ukraine should not hinder cooperation with Russia in other areas where our interests coincide. I am thinking of the fight against international terrorism in Syria and Iraq, the need to stabilise Afghanistan and the fight against the spread of weapons of mass destruction in important regions such as Iran. The European Parliament had no news, and was surprised at the decision to postpone the implementation of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, which we are voting on here today, until December 2015. Many problems could have been avoided if the current consultation process on the implementation of the agreement had been agreed earlier. The delay in implementing the agreement should not be seen in a Cold War logic as a victory for Russia, but as a concession to build peace. I will conclude by saying that we are giving peace a chance, and I want to reiterate that. We work for peace and prosperity and we work together, all together, for these goals.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Charles Tannock", "mepid": "4521", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, having just returned yesterday from Kiev, I feel that the need for supporting Ukraine against the aggression it is facing from Russia is clearer than ever. It is clear also to my group, the ECR, that in response to Ukraine’s ambitions to move in a westward, democratic, Euro-Atlantic direction, Russia is revisiting its imperial past – refusing to accept that its large neighbour in the 21st century is an independent sovereign nation that has the right to take charge of its own destiny. The refusal of Russia to accept this and to work within this internationally accepted legal paradigm should concern us all as democrats. This is not a case of an isolated conflict in a faraway land, but rather it is part of a wider struggle in which democratic nations on our own doorstep are fighting off the revanchist and irredentist ideals of a Putin-led authoritarian and revisionist regime that boasts of a nuclear arsenal. The West has already stood by as countries such as Georgia, Armenia and Moldova have suffered as a result of these ideals. We must not allow Ukraine to become another precedent. It is for this reason that Member States within the EU and NATO should begin to take proactive, rather than reactive, steps in this conflict, sending a message to President Putin that there is hard-power substance behind our rhetoric. Commentators from across the world have noted now the necessity for Russia of militarily acquiring a land corridor to the Crimea. In this regard we should also note the presence of 50 000 Russian troops at the ready on the borders. It has been suggested that one Member State of NATO is already arming the Ukrainian army in anticipation of this further act of aggression. So today I call on other Member States to do the same and allow Ukraine to acquire the means to defend itself. We are making the right move today in this House by simultaneously voting to ratify the Association Agreement and the deep and comprehensive free trade agreement (DCFTA) with Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada. Europe, including, I have to say, my own country, has for too long relied on the dominance of Russian energy and finance. We must now look to diversify away from these dependencies and to have a coordinated EU plan for external energy security, just as we have successfully united the entire European Union in the support of tough economic sanctions against Russia for its blatant acts of aggression.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Petras Auštrevičius", "mepid": "124766", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, Commissioners, the present situation in Ukraine remains very, and increasingly, complicated. We are witnessing a war going on and war crimes being committed in Europe. This has deconstructed the European security system and exposed Ukraine to undeclared aggression from Russia. The pretext for Russia’s military action against Ukraine was the choice – by the free will of the Ukrainian people and the country’s new leadership – of a European perspective to create new and more transparent governance, to fight corruption and to develop a free-trade exchange with the European Union. Is that a crime or a danger for the existing system? Who can presume to sit in judgment and decide to impose a harsh situation on neighbouring countries? Many of us were taken by surprise by the announcement on 12 September that the implementation of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement was being postponed for 15 months. It is as if a young couple’s parents had decided after the wedding to postpone the honeymoon for 15 months. Notwithstanding the format of trilateral talks, we have to respect the autonomy of EU decision-making, the competence of EU institutions and EU procedures. We should be asking the question: is this not ultimately a recognition of the EU’s inability to impose a necessary level of sanctions against Russia, and the continuation of a self-imposed policy of restraint? Finally, colleagues, by accepting the ‘three seas’ policy of the High Representative and, I am sorry to say, the Italian Presidency, we simply support a ‘no voice, no action’ policy line.

Ukraine is a deeply divided country with a very weak civil society and political parties which are little more than a façade for the business projects of oligarchs. We have been engaged in a bras de fer and a trade war with Russia, which is poisoning Ukraine’s internal political life and, at the same time, harming European farmers and the European economy.

I have worked with many Ukrainians for at least ten years on this moment of ratification of an agreement between the European Union and Ukraine, and I simply have to admit now that I do not know at this moment whether I should be happy, whether to laugh or to cry. I am very cold because I do not agree at all with the line taken by the European Commission and the Council on the trade agreement. In order to understand this, we need to re-establish what the Association Agreement in Ukraine stands for. That is not what the Ukrainians wanted. The Ukrainians wanted membership of the European Union, and from the outset there were many who saw the Association Agreement as an instrument of the European Union to keep Ukraine a little far away. The fact that this association agreement exists today is not thanks to Mr Barroso, Mrs Ashton, Mr Füle, Mr De Gucht, Merkel, Hollande or others. The fact that we can and want to ratify this today has to do with the fact that the citizens of Ukraine have fought for freedom and democracy. We did not take this as seriously as we should have taken seriously. It is President Putin who has taken this democracy movement the most. It was Putin who decided when his puppet regime was no longer tenable, when he took Yanukovych out of the game, that he would have to go so far against freedom and democracy in Ukraine that he was even ready to invade Crimea. In the meantime, he is prepared to wage a war, a war that will never be declared, which is taking place on the territory of Ukraine, but which is directed against freedom, democracy and European values as a whole. Ladies and gentlemen, the worst thing in this situation of compromise is self-deception, ongoing self-deception. The emperor's new clothes, I thought, Mr Füle, in your speech. My impression is that we must now do everything we can to ensure that the one who has bet on the military solution – Putin – does not get what he wanted with the military solution, while we have not been able to find a way to protect our Ukrainian friends from this readiness for war from Russia. I think that is very difficult. We have relied on this fast-track procedure for ratifying the Association Agreement. Mr Brok, I do not understand you. Are you naive? Or do you really believe that it is already certain that the trade agreement will enter into force unchanged in January 2016? I have read who has taken action against it. I have to tell you that the only one I trust at the moment and who has tried to explain his real-political approach to me is Pavlo Klimkin, the Foreign Minister in Kiev. We have an incredibly difficult road ahead of us. Everything is in question in this trade agreement. And we will only get what Ukraine needs if we really dedicate ourselves now to Ukraine, if we do everything we can to ensure that political, social and economic reforms take place. We are paying at the moment, we are taking money in our hands so that Putin gets his big foot in the door. I don't know if we'll get him out of there. Because we, as Europeans, have let ourselves be lied to by Russian diplomats and Russian politicians. One last wish: the orientation alone towards oligarchs and the old established politicians in Ukraine must not continue in this way. I recommend that all colleagues seek the conversation with many more Ukrainians, so that we know how our actions work and so that we finally understand what this country really needs.

This EU empire, ever seeking to expand, stated its territorial claim on the Ukraine some years ago. Just to make that worse, some NATO members said they would like the Ukraine to join NATO. We directly encouraged the uprising in the Ukraine that led to the toppling of President Yanukovych; that led in turn to Vladimir Putin reacting; and the moral of the story is: if you poke the Russian bear with a stick, do not be surprised when he reacts.  Now just to continue with that, today we are rushing through, at undue speed, an Association Agreement with the Ukraine, and as we speak there are NATO soldiers engaged in military exercises in the Ukraine. Have we taken leave of our senses? Do we actually want to have a war with Putin? Because if we do, we are certainly going about it the right way.  Perhaps we ought to recognise that the West now faces the biggest threat and crisis to our way of life that we have seen for over 70 years. The recent beheadings of the British and American hostages graphically illustrates the problem, and we have our citizens from our own countries engaged in that struggle too.

Ukraine must feel real support: otherwise, if we leave it alone with Russia, it will bow to its pressure. The ratification and full implementation of the Association Agreement today is therefore crucial. Only consistent political pressure, Russia's political isolation, increasing economic sanctions can prompt Russia to withdraw and cease military action in Ukraine. The first step is a ceasefire, but let us recall that this was also intended to mean the withdrawal of foreign troops – Russian troops – from Ukrainian territory.  The States of the Union should support Ukraine in its military activities and efforts, m.in. by supplying weapons, in its efforts to protect its sovereignty and independence.

That is why we are voting today in favour of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, because it opens up new opportunities for cooperation between both partners. That is why we also support the consultations between the EU, Ukraine and Russia on the compatibility of free trade agreements with the EU and trade with Russia. Better to learn late than never. But the late timing of these talks is extremely annoying. Like travelling preachers, we have called for this over and over again. The fact that there is only now serious talk leaves a devastating aftertaste and is a sign of poverty for us.

Today I could say that the Ukrainians are in a similar situation, but no they are not: they are in a worse situation. In 1990-91 we were basically surfing an unstoppable wave.

If I look at the international press what does it say? Russia has 2 400 amendments to the draft agreement. Do we really think that one year from now Russia will not still have 2 400 amendments: that Russia will finally be satisfied with the fact that we are concluding this agreement? No. I think we have given up on certain standards and certain values. I think that we have failed.

For me, the signing of this agreement is an expression of a sovereign people who can choose their own future. That does not allow itself to be forced to make choices under the threat of military or economic violence by the large neighbour.

The way Russia operates very dangerously resembles what happened between 1938 and 1939. I fully agree with Mr Telička on this.

There is no stable ceasefire so far, there is no osce monitoring of the ceasefire on the Russian-Ukrainian border, and there has been no full withdrawal of Russian soldiers from the region. Therefore, the twelve-point plan is certainly a way of finding a solution, but it is not yet the solution.

What is it really about? It is a process; and I have to say that I am very surprised that you are surprised about this process, because it started on 11 July when there was a first trilateral meeting, asked for not by us but by the two other parties concerned, and the Russians put on the table a number of remarks and questions and observations with respect to the DCFTA. That resulted in technical consultations over the month of August, with the agreement to meet again on 12 September at ministerial level. Then there was the summit meeting in Minsk on 26 August, where Catherine Ashton, Günther Oettinger and myself represented the European Commission. Explicit reference was made to the meeting on 12 September and President Poroshenko even said that he was going to postpone the ratification until that very date. That is why we met, Mr Auštrevičius, to make possible the ratification of this agreement by Ukraine. That is why we have been doing this and when you look closely at the agreement that we reached on Friday, what does it really say? On the one hand, it says that we are going to prolong the autonomous trade measures, which means that the advantages that we grant to Ukraine can continue. I think this is very important, because what you really need in Ukraine is economic growth and development. That is what you really need. If you want to find a lasting peace there, that is what you need. If you want to strengthen the position of the Ukrainian people that is what you need, economic growth, and we continue that. On the other hand, the Russians have been asking to cut out 2 400 lines from the agreement, that is about one fourth of the agreement on the tariffs. They are claiming that the technical barriers to trade are disadvantageous to them and they say that SPS cannot go ahead as it stands at this moment in time. Solutions exist for the SPS, because we could very well have an equivalence on the Ukrainian market between SPS in Russia – GOST rules – and our own rules. You could have that. For technical barriers to date, it is a programme that still has to be put into practice. And the 2 400 tariff lines: yes, of course, if you make a DCFTA that gives an advantage with respect to tariffs. But we are ready to do exactly the same with Russia! We have been insisting with Russia for years, about having a DCFTA with them! It is not that we are doing anything against them, but that is what they want to do. To find the solution for that, we have postponed the provisional application for one year, leaving open the possibility for either party – either party meaning Ukraine or the European Union – to put possible changes on the table. Just putting them on the table, you know: we have not agreed to any change. And, by the way, we could not do that. The only ones who could do that, honourable Members, once you have ratified the agreement, is you; because it would mean that you would have to change the treaty with Ukraine before you can change anything in it. I do not have the feeling that Parliament is really ready to do that. So what we have been doing is creating the conditions for ratifying today. That is what we need today. Once this ratification happens, this is a new fact. It is not only a political fact, it is a legal fact, it is a judicial fact. It means that you have an agreement, that you have a treaty, and that you can only change it by a new treaty. I have always understood that that is what you wanted, which is why I do not understand the remarks you have been making today. If you really want to put yourself in a difficult position with Russia, if you really want to give them the upper hand, then you have to follow the line you have been voicing here, that this is a bad agreement, that in fact we should delay ratification of the agreement. Allow me to say that to do so would be a historical mistake. What we have been doing is creating the conditions for ratification of this very, very important treaty. That does not concern only Ukraine: it concerns the whole Eastern Neighbourhood. It is about whether or not we are in a position to continue this policy and make it a success.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 61, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Štefan Füle", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  , Member of the Commission, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/ High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, honourable Members, there was a lot of wisdom, as always, during this debate – though rather more populist slogans than I have been used to hearing over the past five years, and some outrageous remarks too, from your side, such as the implication that the nationalities of our Heads of Delegation in our partner countries determine the policy of the European Union. What a nonsense! I would like to make four points. The first, in response to your request that we should learn more about Russia, is that we understand Russia. The 1975 Helsinki Act clearly stipulates that borders may not be changed through military force. Under the 1990 Paris Charter, it is reiterated that ‘within the framework of international law, all the participating States have equal rights and duties. They will respect each other’s right to define and conduct ... its relations with other States in accordance with international law and in the spirit of the present Declaration’. The Budapest Memorandum of 1994 guarantees the Ukrainians total integrity and sovereignty. All of that was violated and destroyed by one European country. In 2008, in the context of the NATO-Russia Council in Bucharest, Vladimir Putin said that Ukraine was an artificial country – yet someone here is blaming EU policy for the problems there! I cannot follow that logic. My second point is in response to the call I heard for us to ‘grow up’ and to recognise a real threat. What is a real threat? I always thought it was when someone starts to violate the rule of law and international law, because those are the bases of our wellbeing. We have agreed that our commitments to law and to order will determine not only the way we treat each other but also how we treat our neighbours. This is predominantly what we base our security on. By the way, Catherine Ashton is not here not because she wants to avoid a debate with the European Parliament but because she is also dealing with Russian diplomats on the very complex Iranian issue. She is doing everything possible to prevent the Iranian issue becoming a hot topic for debate here. And she is moving in the right direction, in part thanks to constructive cooperation with the Russian diplomats. So our insistence on Russia living up to its commitments vis-à-vis international law and the rule of law does not prevent us from working with Russians on other important hot topics around the world. My third point concerns self-deception. The problem is that the same people who have always called for us to respect the sovereignty of third countries’ decisions are now questioning our own policy, which is based on that. The thing which needs to be very clearly underlined is that there has been a Ukrainian request to postpone the provisional application of the economic part of the Association Agreement – and that was also underlined in the discussion that President Barroso had with President Poroshenko and Prime Minister Yatsenyuk. The reasoning was logical and understandable. The economy and financial system of Ukraine face a huge test because of the events in the east, not to mention the impact of the illegal annexation of Crimea. They expressed the wish to have more time to prepare for accepting the tariffs being negotiated. In today’s ratification of the Association Agreement by the Verkhovna Rada, in parallel to the ratification providing consent, this body clearly underlines the commitment of Ukrainians to the text being negotiated. Another thing needs to be underlined to which no one has really referred, and to all of you who spoke in favour of peace prevailing, I would like to make this point clear. The Russians have their troops on Ukrainian territory and they have also made it absolutely clear, repeatedly, on the record, that once the Association Agreement is ratified by the Verkhovna Rada, on that very day – rather than later when they might face economic or trade difficulties, although we do not share that opinion – they will not only repeal the Commonwealth of Independent States Free Trade Agreement with Ukraine, but will also adopt further restrictive economic measures against it. So, in addition to the military threat and possible escalation, we have also been facing the threat of a full-scale economic and trade war. We have the ratification of the agreement which, as described by my colleague, has been negotiated over four years. We will have the provisional application of the political part. We will have the continuation of reforms, because we asked that question and, in the discussion that President Barroso had with Prime Minister Yatsenyuk on Saturday, we agreed on a number of elements: we will go ahead with the structure provided for in the Association Agreement; we will have the Association Council, the committee and various subcommittees; and we will start our work. The European Agenda for Reform, as agreed with the Ukrainians, is very much about the implementation of the Association Agreement and it will go ahead. Implementation of the action plan, which was also adopted today by the Verkhovna Rada, operationalising the Association Agreement, goes ahead. Our preparations for the donors’ conference at the end of this year – to focus both on the implementation of the Association Agreement and on the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the east of Ukraine – go ahead. The mandate and focus of the Ukrainian Support Group, which has started its work already, remain the same, and the coordination mechanism provided for by the Ukrainians for the implementation of the Association Agreement will go ahead. There is no a delay as a result of Russian blackmail. Now, the last point: a number of you spoke of dividing lines – we are being accused of creating dividing lines through the Association Agreement – and I believe the time has come to prove that the Association Agreement is actually one of the building components of what could, in future, be a European economic free zone from Lisbon to Vladivostok. Whether or not some of you call the Eurasian Union a project of Putin, it is a matter of reality.

The European choice of Ukraine, through this ratification today, will be institutionalised in the form of an Association Agreement and will in future bind the European Union and the Ukraine together. During the past 10 months, Ukrainian citizens proved to be committed to European values and willing to fight for the country’s democratic development. Ukrainian society has paid the highest price for their European aspirations, grieving the deaths of numerous people, suffering territorial occupation by Russia and experiencing a deteriorating economic situation. The European Union was extending assistance to the Ukrainian State. From the EU side the EU has assisted Ukraine economically and politically and with this ratification it gives Ukraine the strongest sign of support.   Economic support on the Union’s side is substantial, with a financial package amounting to up to EUR 11 billion, and it also covers political support, which is embodied in the creation of the Support Group for Ukraine in the European Commission, the organisation of the International Donors Conference and efforts towards establishment of the technical assistance plan in a number of areas, from constitutional to judicial and administrative reform. This ratification is a milestone in Ukraine-EU relations. The ratification of the Association Agreement follows the signing, in two sequences in March and June, of this agreement and it is such a milestone in spite of the regrettable proposal on delayed implementation of the Agreement which was recently discussed.  The ratification of the Association Agreement is a success for both Ukraine and the European Union. Today’s vote on ratification, which will happen at 12 noon simultaneously in two European cities, Kiev and Strasbourg – the capital of Europe and the capital of Ukraine – and by two democratically elected parliaments, both chambers seeing each other on the big screens, by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine and the European Parliament, the highest legislative directly elected and democratic body of the European Union. It is a strong symbolic message to Ukrainian society and the proof of sharing the common European values and destiny.  This gesture is even more necessary today than it seemed to be some time ago, in the face of the increasing pressure, invasion and warfare directed against Ukraine by Russia. We need to restore the credibility of this relationship in the face of external threats. An Association Agreement is not the definitive goal of Ukrainian-European Union relations. Ukraine and the European Union have a common future in front of them and this future must be protected from external Russian pressure, to become a reality. What can be done? The only way for the Union to effectively stop those threats and stop Russia questioning this relationship is to introduce increasingly heavy sanctions, until the cost for Russia becomes too high for it to sustain its policies. We need to enhance and accelerate financial and economic assistance to Ukraine and contribute to increasing the military capabilities of Ukraine. Ukraine should be assisted in protecting its territorial integrity and in introducing the agreed necessary but difficult reforms at the same time and in parallel. The Association Agreement to be ratified today will be protected from any changes which might be requested by any third counry. We start and embark on the new European future for Ukraine.

It falls to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs – where the decision was split – to take responsibility for Article 17, the legal migration and neighbourhood aspects of this Association Agreement, which are nevertheless very important aspects. We were very conscious of this and take very seriously our responsibility to have a vote in parallel with the Kiev Parliament.

We have heard in the last debate on foreign affairs why neighbourhood policy must be consistent. Despite all the sufferings of the Ukrainian people that we have heard of, we need to be consistent in our neighbourhood policy.

What does it really mean? It means, on the one hand, that we are going to prolong the autonomous trade measures vis-à-vis Ukraine. So they will continue to be able to export onto our European markets as if the agreement were already in force. Let me point out that, since June when we decided on the autonomous trade measures for the first time, exports by Ukraine to the European Union have increased by 15% in just a couple of months. So this is a very effective tool. It is up to the Council of Ministers to change the decision on provisional application, and with respect to the autonomous trade measures it depends on codecision by the European Parliament and the Council whether or not these autonomous measures are prolonged. This is a decision to be taken by you and by the Council of Ministers in a very democratic process. With regard to provisional application, which is the other side of the mirror, the question of whether we have free access to the Ukrainian market, and whether we can continue with sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS) and with the technical barriers to trade, is in the hands of the Council of Ministers. There is currently a decision on provisional application, and the Council will have to change that. We are going to make a proposal to them to do so for definite periods of time – specifically until the end of next year. Why have we been working to make the agreement that was reached on Friday? Some have said it is non-effective, a sign of weakness or a mistake. The reason we have been doing it, Ms Harms, and the result of the long process which started in July, is to make ratification possible. Without this agreement on Friday, there would no ratification today. And what are the results of that ratification? There are at least three. First, it gives new economic opportunities to Ukraine to export into the European Union and to have economic growth. If we really want Ukraine to become a fully-fledged democracy and part of the European House, what you will need there is economic opportunity, growth and jobs. And that, by the way, is the reason why these people protested in the Maidan: because they want freedom and they want economic growth. When the Soviet Union split apart, the per capita income in Ukraine was a little bit higher than it was in Poland, and now the per capita income in Poland is four times higher than that of Ukraine. That has been the result of Poland becoming a member of the European Union. Secondly, ratification establishes a bond between Ukraine and the European Union which is very important because that is what the people really want. They want to establish this bond with the European Union, and once the ratification has taken place it is no longer merely a matter of words. It has become a legal relationship: it has become a treaty. Of course, the Member States will have to ratify it. Six have done so already and it will be very wise for the other Member States to do this as soon as possible. Ratification establishes a bond between Ukraine and the European Union which will be very difficult, if not impossible, to undo because it establishes a treaty. At the moment, what Russia is trying to do in Ukraine is to create a new frozen conflict in the east of the country. That is what they are trying to do – just as happened in Moldova with Transnistria, just as happened in Georgia with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and just as happened in Nagorno-Karabakh. At that moment in time we, as the European Union, are saying ‘OK, we will make a treaty with you, we will make this bond with you.’ This is a legal bond and we are not going to undo it, but rather we will make further discussion possible and will ensure that the elections on 15 October take place under acceptable conditions. We are ready to make a sacrifice – yes, an economic sacrifice – and delay the provisional application of the agreement for a very limited period of time.

The Moscow Stock Exchange is falling, the ruble has fallen to historic lows against both the euro and the dollar, with $51 billion in capital fleeing the country. All this proves that these are real, strong, effective sanctions. On the other hand, it is true that sanctions also harm European economies, but they are much smaller than what Russia suffers. Russia needs us Europeans more than the other way around. International law, the protection of the Ukrainian people who have been victims of territorial aggression and respect for European core values are more important than the temporary problems caused by sanctions. More than that, it is important that the EU cannot credibly criticise a non-Community state until it has resolved the problems of fundamental rights within its own borders. Unfortunately, the Hungarian example has shown that there could be a reorganization of the rule of law and democratic rights after EU accession.

Today, they expect solidarity from Brussels in the form of urgent and adequate measures to make up for their losses and protect them from new ones.  Unfortunately, the secondary effect of the embargo can prove even deeper and more devastating for some industries, including job losses where agriculture is the sole livelihood of the population. Farmers are among the most affected by the political crisis between the EU and Russia, but it is not right for them to pay this high price themselves.  In this regard, I find the eur 125 million compensation envisaged to be extremely insufficient and call for their increase. However, this should not be done solely with funds from the CAP Crisis Fund, which was foreseen for crises in the internal market caused by drought, floods, low harvests or diseases, and this is not the case.

The European Parliament here in Strasbourg and the Verkhovna Rada in Kiev will immediately ratify the Association Agreement between the European Union and Ukraine. The fact that two parliaments in free self-determination are voting on this Treaty at the same time today is free democracy in free self-determination; this is the opposite of managed democracy. (Interjections and applause) The ratification of this Treaty, which has remained unchanged since the first days of the peaceful demonstrations on the Majdan, is a golden hour of democracy, especially in view of what we have seen in recent months. I would like to ask you: a few months ago, who could have imagined that borders in Europe would once again be shifted by force, that the security architecture that we have painstakingly built up in this continent, especially after the end of the Cold War, would be called into question? Who would have thought it possible for the law of the strongest to re-enter Europe? We stand for the strength of the law! Ladies and gentlemen! The fear of war has returned to Europe. What has happened and is happening in Ukraine concerns us all. I would therefore like to repeat here, particularly in conjunction with my colleagues in Kiev, that the European Parliament has always defended Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty, and we will continue to do so. (Applause) We will therefore do so so that the dream of the people of Ukraine, the dream of the people who fought on the Majdan, so that the demands of the Ukrainian people can become a reality. We are fighting for a democratic Ukraine, for a constitutional Ukraine whose constitution and electoral law have been reformed, a country that wants to crack down on corruption, in which human rights are respected and, above all, the rights of minorities are protected. We support a Ukraine whose economy is thriving, where the social divide is closing and all people have a good future. The day on which this Ukraine becomes a reality will be the day when the promise of the peaceful revolution on the Majdan is fulfilled. We – and I believe I am speaking on behalf of the overwhelming majority of Members of the European Parliament – will support the Ukrainian people in fulfilling this dream of The Majdan. That is why this vote is taking place today. (Applause) Before we proceed to the vote here, I have the great honour of giving the floor to the President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, who will now speak to us from Kiev, beyond the distance and thanks to modern technology. After that, the vote will take place and, after the vote, I will sign the European Parliament's letter of transmission to the Council before your eyes in order to initiate the formal process for the final procedures.

I would like to say that the atmosphere here in the Verkhovna Rada reminds me very much of the atmosphere we had here in 1991 when we gained our independence. Who is ready to die for Europe? That is the question that is now posed by researchers who research the influence of Europe on the creation of a state. It is something that is quite natural, to give one’s life and to die for one’s country. The first 100 Ukrainians who died in February and the 872 who died in the east died not only for Ukraine; they died so that Ukraine could take its place in Europe. Starting from the Second World War, no other nation has paid as high a price for the right to be European. Tell me, please, who will dare close the door of Europe to Ukraine after this? Who will be against the prospect of membership in the European Union towards which we are taking today our first, but most decisive, step? Over seven years – ever since the EU-Ukraine Paris Summit – we have been preparing the text of this Association Agreement. I would like first of all to thank everybody who took part in this process – the diplomats, the experts, and most of all the citizens who very decisively supported us on our European course. Last autumn we thought that everything was absolutely ready for signature, because the whole country was resolutely in favour, and the arguments of those who were against appeared extremely feeble, but on 29 November 2013 in Vilnius we were all waiting for this signature. The necessity of signing this agreement then and now is also very evident for Ukrainians. Ukrainians revolted against what Yanukovych did in turning the express train to face eastwards. I am convinced that our vote today will demonstrate this very clearly. The internal or external forces that try to stop our progress have already been defeated. You know that this agreement, which was signed in June 2014 in Brussels and is being jointly ratified today, is going to be a feast – not only for us Ukrainians, but for all of united Europe, because without Ukraine there is no united Europe. We did not cede to any blackmail. We endured, and I want to underline that in the text of this agreement no paragraph, no comma, no word will have been changed, and that is the text which I will sign today. I shall ask the Ukrainian Government tomorrow to make this agreement enter into force tomorrow. Friends, implementation is very easy. It is freedom of speech; it is the no-visa regime; it is the investment climate; it is democracy. All of that is a way of implementing our agreement. We have no right to wait any longer. Our last negotiations in Brussels allow us to enlarge upon even what this agreement foresees. We will have preferential treatment until the end of 2015. European products will come into the Ukrainian market under the international agreements in the framework in force today. Ukraine will be able to compete with other countries and other producers. I also want today to thank the European Union for the incredible support that they have given us in these very difficult times. On the other hand, our European partners want only one thing in exchange: reform. Please do not delay. Neither the war, nor the political situation can be excuses to not proceed with reform. I am convinced of the fact that the national plan for reform for 2020 will be presented. We will do this together, not each and every one of us thinking of ourselves: it is the President, the Government and the Parliament that must work together and we will go on the path to victory. If anybody tries to open an inner front against this, we will not allow it. Moreover, these reforms foresee Ukraine becoming a very important centre for anti-corruption laws. I will propose anti-corruption laws in the framework of a bureau or of a committee for this. This is what we have taken upon ourselves as part of the ratification and implementation, and I think that this will be the best way to say that we have already started.  In the 1920s, Mykola Khvylovy – a great Ukrainian author – said: give us Europe! We understand Europe as a psychological category which allows us to move forward towards progress. Today we are making steps on this new path of return. The start was difficult, but we will win. Glory to Ukraine! Glory to Europe!

This is the Second Annual Budget of the European Union under the new Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020. As such, it must be functional, both at the start of the programmes being defined in the various policy areas and at the completion of the 2007-2013 programming measures that are being closed. These are precisely the features that the Council has taken particular into account when defining its position on the 2015 budget, in the awareness of the importance of adequate financial support from the Union for the objectives of growth and employment and for the pursuit of the Europe 2020 strategy. Of course, in taking these objectives into account, the Council has also taken into account the fact that the financing of European initiative programmes must take place in a context of sustainability and budgetary discipline, in line with what the European Union requires of the Member States with regard to national budgets. Having said all that, we believe that the solution identified by the Council adequately interprets the needs for synthesis between these different objectives, and above all allows the European Union to have the necessary budgetary resources for 2015, in order to honour the commitments already made and to start new interventions in the various sectors quickly with a view to sound and efficient financial management. In particular, the size of the appropriations that has been provided to the programmes by measures promoting growth and employment, starting with that of young people, confirms the sensitivity towards these priorities, in line with the conclusions of the European Council of 26 and 27 June last, as well as the allocation of resources reserved for interventions in the other sectors, from communications to research and rural development, to the emergence of immigration, is the result of a specific attention that the Council has also paid to these priorities. This is even though, in adopting its position, the Council considered that, in comparison with the proposal presented by the Commission, savings in expenditure on certain items were necessary and possible.  Necessary, in the sense of the desirability of maintaining adequate margins of resources available for commitments and payments to cope, during the financial year, with unforeseen circumstances and events. Possible, in the sense that the reductions were all based on an in-depth analysis of the programmes, both as regards their real expenditure needs and as regards their possibilities of financial absorption in 2015, and were therefore identified in such a way as not to adversely affect the implementation of the new programmes, nor the implementation and closure of current interventions. In any case, as I will explain later, the Council's position provides for a 2015 budget which, even after these reductions, considered, as mentioned, necessary and possible, shows an increase both in terms of commitment appropriations and payment compared to the 2014 budget. It is understood that Italy, as President-in-Office of the Union, will work with the European Parliament and the Commission to reach agreement on the 2015 budget, trusting in the constructive spirit and climate of cooperation that has always been established between the three institutions in the search for a compromise on the Union's budget. However, let us now turn to the detailed content of the Council's position, a position which provides for total appropriations of eur 144 billion in commitments and one hundred and forty billion euros in payments. With regard to the Commission's budget proposal, the Council has therefore provided for a reduction of EUR 502 million for commitments and EUR 2.1 billion for payments. As I have already mentioned, despite these reductions, both commitments and payments increase compared to the 2014 budget, also taking into account the amending budget 1/2014 already approved; in particular, an increase of EUR 2.4 billion for commitments, equal to 1.71% out of their total, and an increase of EUR 4.6 billion for payments, equal to 3.32% of their total. I think it is significant to stress that the Council's position does not imply any reduction in the EU budget, even if it is compared not only to the 2014 budget currently in force, but also when compared with the sum of the balances of the current budget and the balances of the amending budgets for 2014 proposed by the Commission and on which the Council is still making its assessments.  That is why, as I said earlier, this position combines in a balanced way the need for adequate support for the socio-economic development policies promoted by the European Union with the need for sustainability and budgetary discipline. All the more so when we consider the declaration annexed to the Council's position, in which the Commission is asked to present a draft amending budget as soon as the level of appropriations for payments during 2015 proves insufficient to meet the financial needs linked to the headings most affected by the phenomenon of so-called RALs. It is no coincidence, moreover, that a very broad consensus was reached in the Council on this position with the vote in favour of almost all the Member States.  I shall now refrain from going into the details of the headings by heading, on the understanding that I will of course then be available at the clarification stage, but I repeat that, even at the level of each individual heading, the principle that the Council's position nevertheless implies an increased budget compared to that of 2014 remains valid, precisely for each heading. Let me conclude by summation of the three principles that guided the work done in the Council to examine the draft budget for 2015. Firstly, the need to provide sufficient funding for policies that are closest to the hearts of European citizens, namely the fight against unemployment, especially youth unemployment, investment in research and innovation, support for small and medium-sized enterprises, management of international crises such as the one in Ukraine, management of migratory flows and humanitarian aid.  Secondly, the need to be vigilant on the public finance front, in view of the continuous efforts required of the Member States to contain their budgets. In this respect, particular attention must be paid to keeping administrative expenditure under control, as we trust in the ability of the European administration to seek and achieve a higher level of efficiency. Finally, thirdly, the need to adopt a prudent and reasonable EU budget, with the necessary margins below the various ceilings provided for in the multiannual financial framework to deal with unforeseen circumstances. As I have repeatedly stated in my speech, the Italian Presidency is convinced that the Council's position on the draft budget for 2015 represents a balanced compromise solution, combining the need for adequate budget allocation to meet the various challenges facing the European Union, with the need to consolidate public finances, which concerns the , in addition to national budgets, also the European budget. At the same time, however, I repeat that Italy, as President-in-Office of the Union, will work with the European Parliament and the Commission to reach agreement on the 2015 budget that takes equally appropriate account of the sensitivities and priorities expressed by all three institutions. In concluding my speech, I thank you for your attention, certainly a calm and constructive discussion, and I remain available for this purpose to respond to any requests for clarification and in-depth analysis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 274, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Jacek Dominik", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Madam President, honourable Members, Ministers, thank you for the opportunity to address you today. Before I start my speech I would like quickly to react to some comments by the Presidency on the EU budget – both the present one and the future one. I want to highlight two figures which may give you a broader picture: the 2014 budget, if finally adopted with all the amendments proposed by the Commission, will still be about EUR 4 billion below the payments actually adopted for the year 2013; and the budget for 2015, if adopted as presented by the Commission, will still be EUR 2 billion below the 2013 budget. So we are still far from a return to the level of expenditure we used to have, and, although there has been mention of some increase in the EU budget for 2015, actually, if you compare the figures, there is a slight decrease in nominal terms. Taking this into account, the Commission has to reiterate its position today that it is disappointed concerning the Council’s reading of the draft budget for 2015. The Council has taken a ‘business as usual’ approach although we are facing an unprecedented situation. The Commission has already expressed its assessment on previous occasions, and now, at this crucial moment of the budgetary procedure, I would like to focus on the main elements. The Commission proposal for the 2015 budget was drafted in a challenging context. The main goal is to contribute to the economic recovery by investing in programmes that foster growth and jobs and allow the implementation of the new legally adopted programmes for 2014-2020 to start. We have been tasked with doing this not least by the European Council, which confirmed these objectives in June 2014. The biggest difficulties, however, concern the payments. First we need to secure adequate resources for financing the political priorities we have agreed under the new financial framework. Second, we need to find a solution and take under control the increasing backlog. We must be able to pay the bills outstanding from the 2007-2013 period and reimburse the Member States and other beneficiaries within a reasonable timeframe. We simply cannot ignore the claims coming in. To achieve these targets, the Commission has proposed to use the maximum available resources for 2015 and the maximum available flexibility provided for in the current financial framework. In line with the political priorities, the Commission has proposed under Heading 1a, competitiveness for growth and jobs, an increase of 5.8% in commitments and an increase of almost 30% in payments, which is needed to cover previous years’ deep reductions. Yet the Council has returned to its tradition and seeks to reduce commitments by half a billion euros and payments by over EUR 2.1 billion, with more than 60% of the cuts affecting Heading 1a, the heading which provides the very resources that should be helping to contribute to growth and jobs, and particularly to tackling youth unemployment. For Heading 1a alone, this is a cut of around EUR 1.3 billion in payments. For research, the reduction by 10% would impact, under Horizon 2020, on around 600 projects, involving more than 7000 participants, of which around 1400 are SMEs. Similarly, for our external policy – in spite of the EU’s commitments and engagement in recent crises, in particular in neighbouring countries – substantial reductions of EUR 384 million are proposed to the Commission’s draft budget. We need the full amount of payments the Commission has proposed, both in 2014 and 2015, and the full use of flexibility arrangements if we want to stabilise the situation. There must be some limit to pushing payments into the next years, over and over again. We must re-emphasise in this context that what the Commission requests for 2015 might suffice only if we keep on track with what is required in 2014. The annual budget is about implementing the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), not changing the political agreement on which it is based. The political priorities have been decided on during MFF negotiations and now we have to find a way to implement them through annual budgets. Against this background of the current experience with a shortage of payment appropriations in 2014, the Commission can only regret the position taken by the Council in its reading of the 2015 budget. The Council acts as if the situation called for a ‘business as usual’ approach, ignoring current priorities and the budgetary situation. It is taking a two-step approach, whereby first a low level of payment appropriations is authorised in the budget, with the understanding that a supplementary amending budget may be needed in the course of the year. That is not a sound budgetary approach: it creates a major liquidity problem for the annual budget. I would appeal to you, the Parliament, to take account of these concerns during the advance preparation for your reading of the 2015 budget. We should work together to break this vicious circle by putting the right amount of resources in the 2015 budget, from 1 January, in order to implement our common priorities, provide the means to address our obligations stemming from previous years’ commitments and curb the global growth of outstanding commitments – the so-called RALS (restes à liquider). I would like to emphasise that the level of payments proposed by the Commission for 2015 can contribute to stabilising the situation with regard to the 2014 payments only if the 2014 payments are also addressed, and Draft Amending Budget No 3 for the year 2014, with the request to use the remaining margin under the payment ceiling of EUR 700 million and to activate the contingency margin mechanism for an amount of EUR 4 billion, is fully adopted. Developments on the revenue side in 2014 provide an opportunity to work in this direction. Exceptional additional revenue from fines means that the additional payment request for 2014 will be at virtually no cost to Member States. This is welcome at a time of tight national budgets. We should seize the chance to try and take control of the situation. Finally, we need to agree that, in order to stabilise the situation, we must use all the flexibility arrangements provided for in the new financial framework to address all the unforeseen needs and to stabilise the payment situation. I look to our interinstitutional meeting on 24 September to help us jointly to find a sustainable approach. I would already like to thank Parliament for its initiative in convening and hosting this meeting, and in particular the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Arthuis, and the budget rapporteurs for 2014 and 2015, Ms Gardiazabal, Ms Hohlmeier and Mr Deprez.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 275, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Monika Hohlmeier", "mepid": "96780", "text": "  Rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome the Presidency of the Council. Although I am responsible for Parliament itself and the other sections, I would like to begin by saying, with regard to the Commission budget, that I can no longer understand the Council at all. We have defined a multi-year, seven-year financial framework. I have the impression that the Council no longer knows it. We have only recently adopted it, and the Council is deviating from it to such an extent that I can no longer understand the Council.  Secondly, they say that they want to promote investment and growth. Why then is research and innovation being cut back and the area of SMEs that you want to give special support to is also being cut? Why, on the one hand, do we stress that we want to increase humanitarian aid in Syria when, on the other hand, you are fully aware that, unfortunately, you have cut it in the budget? Development aid must be increased, for the reasons around us that we know, but it is still being cut. I have to say quite frankly that, even since the many budget negotiations in which I have been allowed to participate, it has become more and more clear to me that payments and payment obligations are falling apart, that we have more and more invoices and that fewer and fewer payments are made available.  In any way, I would like the Council to slowly reconcile words and deeds in some way. I may be forgiven for being direct, but some of them do not understand it when I hear growth all the time and research is being cut back. Then I no longer know whether the Council is actually enforcing this, which it is personally discussing. With respect to the other sections and the European Parliament, Parliament itself is going to pull the strings. We will not make any additional increases compared to those we decided on in the spring. We already have the Members' Statute included in this: since this requires us to receive tens of billions of euros in the budget as a result of the statute, we have also saved this ourselves accordingly and will consistently stick to a sensible and orderly line here. However, I also have a few comments on the European External Action Service. The European External Action Service also faces the problem of the fact that it is actually a service growing up, but still does not get the funds for it, especially since its resources are then also distributed rather confusingly between the Commission and the European External Action Service. That is why I think it is imperative that we should perhaps set up security rooms so that we can no longer read the speeches of our external representative on You Tube, and that the Council should not make this out.  A second, final point concerns the European Court of Justice. The Council has long decided that it must be extended. We have serious risks to our budget because we have the first complaint because the proceedings are too long. The duration of the procedure is now more than three years, and that means serious financial consequences for the budget. Perhaps the ECJ should finally be given the new judges that have been promised to it for a long time, so that it can return to orderly work.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 276, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Eider Gardiazabal Rubial", "mepid": "96991", "text": "  Rapporteur. - Madam President, Mr Zanetti, Commissioner Dominik, the truth is that you may be surprised by the coincidence of priorities between this Parliament and the European Council, and then how far away the positions on the budget are because, as you very well explained — and we have long discussed this — one of the great priorities of the European institutions has to be to get out of the crisis , relaunch the economy, generate growth and fight unemployment, especially youth unemployment. Those are the short-term measures. More so in the long term, we can talk about complying with the Europe 2020 Strategy and, above all, getting the European Union competitive in the world in which we live. And for that we have to invest; and I think we have to invest in order to compete, in this world, in knowledge and that is why I believe that the games devoted to research, development, education and aid to small and medium-sized enterprises must be strengthened, as they rightly said. Or we can also talk about infrastructure or even energy, which is one of the great challenges facing the European Union in the future. But when we go into detail and when we look at the funding that the Council wants to devote to these programmes and the one that the European Parliament wants to devote, that is where we see the big difference. Because we, in our reading — and you will see the agreements we will reach in the coming days — will strengthen many of these programmes and, on the other hand, you, in your reading of the Council, cut, for example, 195 million in research and development, 35 million in the Connecting Europe Facility or 75 million in large-scale infrastructure. And we therefore see that there is a contradiction between what the Councils decide — as the Ecofin has said, as the European Councils said in June last year — and what they then do in the European budget. And this about commitments. But if we look at the payments, we're in a much more serious situation. And the problem is that you, with your reading of the budget, not only don't solve the problem, but aggravate it. We ended 2013 with 25 billion euros in unpaid bills and, in this budget, instead of strengthening that line, they want to cut 2.1 billion more. They said cuts are feasible; I think the Commission has made it very clear that these cuts are not being feasible. I am not going to go into the technical details - the Commission has explained very well what the situation is - but I do want to tell you two things: first, cutting the budget on payments is not saving on the budget, because all they are doing is not paying what we are having to do, because they are not complying with the agreements of the financial framework and because worst of all they are delaying the implementation of projects that are vital to the future of the European Union. And to cut I think it is a double error in the European budget, because if they intend to solve national finances by cutting the European budget, it is clear that they will not make it — hopefully only with a small cut in the European budget we could save the state of finance!—. And the problem is that they are denying the added value of the budget and I do not think we are recognising the European project as such. In conclusion, I am simply asking the Italian Presidency, in truth, to look closely at the problem of payments and to examine very thoroughly the possible solutions within the Council. If you really address this problem, you will have this Parliament helping and working side by side to prevent this from going forward.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 277, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Jean Arthuis", "mepid": "124773", "text": "  Chairman of the Budgets Committee. Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, I would like to point out that the elections of 25 May delivered their verdict with severity and it is little to say to recall how strong Euroscepticism has been. Criticism has peaked as growth is sluggish and unemployment is high, it is reaching desperate levels among young people. As populism rumbles across the continent, the IMF and OECD are concerned about the stagnation of the eurozone.   The real question is whether the European Union budget can remedy this and restore confidence. To answer this question, we need to clarify three prerequisites: first, to prepare the revision of the multi-year financial framework adopted at the end of 2013. It sets spending limits and revenue levels for seven years. Voted before the election, this framework clearly did not attract the support of the electorate. Democracy therefore orders us to prepare its revision. Can we expect some inflections as early as the 2015 budget? Is there no urgency to present a \"combat budget\" in the face of the volatility of circumstances? Is it reasonable to lock ourselves in a rigid budget tunnel, insensitive to economic situations, as well as accidents of course?  To a large extent, the 2015 credits will settle transactions launched in 2012 or 2013! At a time when Europe is under threat of economic collapse, such inertia deprives the budget of responsiveness. Are we finally ready to implement specific and maximum flexibility as early as the 2015 budget? Secondly, I want to sound the alarm again about the growing gap between commitment credits and payment credits. As of December 31, 2013, the remains to be liquidated are soaring to new heights, unpaid debts are accumulating and increasing: 5 billion at the end of 2010, 24 billion at the end of 2013. And yet the treaties forbid the Union from taking on debt. However, it is a sneaky debt that takes shape and puts operators in difficulty. This vicious circle is irresponsible.  The EUROPEAN Union budget is modest, accounting for just 1% of gross domestic product (GDP). That is why it should be conceived and executed with discernment, method and coherence. I ask the Council to let us know about its plan to take the weight of the past and allow us to get off on the right foot. Finally, what will be the sources of funding for the 300 billion investments announced by the President of the Commission on 15 July? These cannot be transactions that, in any event, would have been financed by the markets. If Europe is to have a driving effect, it means that it has to take on a risk, and this risk-taking is absolutely expression in the budget. Since everyone recognizes the urgency, what will be the budget translation in 2015? The credibility of the President of the Commission is at stake. In conclusion, I would like to express my strong hope that the 2015 budget should not be a mere extension of previous budgets, bearing the mark of a new plank in payment appropriations. Europe is in crisis, Europe is in danger, we have been elected to restore its aplomb and restore confidence to Europeans.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 278, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Enrico Zanetti", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Mr President- in-Office of the Council. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the requests relating to the multiannual financial framework, we know that there is a possibility in the medium term of its revision in the light of changes in the macroeconomic scenario. Clearly, this is not the specific forum in which we can deal with this issue. Here we need to talk about the draft budget for 2015 given the current multiannual financial framework. In this context, I think I can say that we are not going to question the priorities in any way, but we are clearly going to decline them in the implementation phase of budgetary choices with a gradual approach. A gradual approach that starts from two fundamental points.  The first, as I tried to point out earlier, of a Council position that nevertheless brings a 2015 budget of expansion compared to the current 2014 budget and in any case not lower than that which would emerge on the basis of the consideration of the further proposals for amending budgets made in relation to 2014 by the Commission on which, as we know, in relation to that year, the Council's position is still being assessed. However, with regard to 2015, the Council's position is already becoming a starting point which, compared with the previous year, is seen as a point of arrival, therefore no downsizing.  Furthermore, alongside this stake, there is the other, which consists of the declaration annexed to the Council's position, which calls on the Commission to submit amending budgets for 2015 if it is appropriate to submit them, precisely for matters relating to payments. With regard to the issue of competitiveness for growth and employment, so heading 1a, I would like to mention the numbers anyway, because with regard to this heading the Council's position has set commitments at seventeen billion and one hundred, with a reduction therefore compared to the Commission's proposal of three hundred and twenty-four million euros, but nevertheless with an increase compared to the 2014 budget of six hundred and forty million euros , and payments to EUR 14.2 billion, a reduction on the Commission's proposal of EUR 1.3 billion, but nonetheless an increase over the 2014 budget of as much as EUR 2.8 billion.  It is also important, I believe, to stress that absolutely no reduction compared with the Commission's proposal has been provided for under this heading by the Council with regard to resources for small and medium-sized enterprises, for investment in research and innovation through the COSME programme, as well as for the education and development of skills through the Erasmus+ programme, while the appropriations paid for Horizon 2020 and The Connecting Europe Mechanism , on which most of the reductions proposed by the Council for the heading in question have been concentrated, they have nevertheless increased compared to 2014. The CEF programme has an increase in appropriations in payments of almost 60% and Horizon 2020 by more than 30%. After that, the Council is fully aware of the extreme importance of the EU budget and its role in reviving growth and employment, particularly in the current economic crisis. The Council hopes to ensure adequate funding of the European Union's priorities, in particular with regard to youth unemployment, research and innovation funding, as well as support for small and medium-sized enterprises, but, as we mentioned, the Council itself cannot fail to adopt a realistic approach in the preparation of the EU budget, based both on past and present rates of use of the allocations and on the foreseeable absorption capacity of European funding. Having said that, in thanking you, of course, for this interesting and constructive exchange of views, I am sure that a good understanding of our mutual positions will be the necessary condition for reaching agreement on the 2015 budget, and I therefore believe that today's debate is a good starting point. The Italian Presidency will do all it can to reach an agreement, in a constructive spirit, with a view to responding in the best possible way to the expectations of european citizens, because we are well aware that Europe needs a budget that responds adequately to the citizens' demands, and on this I am sure that together, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, will succeed in finding the right ways to achieve this goal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 279, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "President. -", "mepid": "28115", "text": "   The debate is closed.

Liquidity problems threaten the survival of companies and the functioning of the real economy, leading to an ever deeper loss of confidence in the institutions. It is therefore necessary to unblock and speed up the problem of payments and to reallocate resources in key areas, such as employment, small and medium-sized enterprises, the fight against corruption, immigration and micro-financing, cutting the administrative waste within the European institutions and their consultative bodies. More realistic spending planning would help to avoid constant requests for additional funds through amending budgets within the European budget, which is in stark contrast to the need for Member States to contain their budgets.

Its budget for the 2014-2020 programming period provides for over EUR 77 billion, representing a real increase of around one third of the funding available for research and investment compared to the allocations of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research under the 2007-2013 programming period. Behind this considerable increase, decided by the Heads of State or Government, there is therefore the political will to increase spending on research and investment, which are essential to stimulate European competitiveness and growth. Horizon 2020 is therefore our common goal and the most important pan-European research programme agreed in the context of the EU 2020 strategy. On the 2014 budget, the Commission, in its proposal for amending budget No 3, provided for an increase in the budget for the research sector of around EUR 230 million, most of which was allocated to the Horizon 2020 programme. The Council's position on this proposal is being defined, in preparation for discussion with the European Parliament and its approval. With regard to the 2015 budget, as I also had the opportunity to point out earlier, the Council adopted its position on 2 September, with some reductions compared with the Commission's proposal for appropriations with regard to the level of payments. This position has just been presented in detail, and I would like to point out in this connection that it must be read as a whole as an effort to mediate between the requirements of adequate support for the various Community policies, especially those oriented towards growth and employment, but at the same time safeguarding budgetary discipline. The Council is convinced that its position on the 2015 draft budget represents a fair balance between these needs while respecting the political priorities defined by the European Council for a more competitive Europe. Furthermore, I would like to point out that, although the budget for horizon 2020 has been reduced in relation to what the European Commission proposed in its draft budget for 2015, it is still increasing by 33%, as we mentioned earlier in relation to the budget currently entered in the 2014 budget. This shows that the Council has not been insensitive to the objectives of this programme. In this respect, it should be borne in hand that heading 1a is the one that proposed the highest increases in the Commission's draft budget compared with 2014, in view of programmes that are still in the start-up phase and for which a smaller spending trend is expected in the early years and gradually growing in the continuation of programming.  At the same time, for other items of expenditure, such as heading 1b, relating to the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, the Commission has highlighted the need to meet expenditure commitments already entered into and reports already submitted by the Member States, for which the Council has therefore really reduced the reductions to a minimum. As you can see, therefore, the exercise has been very difficult, as the situations are complex and heterogeneous and all require attention from the institutions, which are therefore obliged to make choices in a public finance scenario that is certainly not favourable. I am confident that, together with Parliament, we will be able to reach an agreement as soon as possible, in order to give Europe its budget and ensure full operation on all policies, including and indeed starting with Horizon 2020.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 283, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Máire Geoghegan-Quinn", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Comhalta de chuid an Choimisiúin. - A Uachtaráin, tá mé buíoch gur eagraíodh díospóireacht thábhachtach den tsórt seo inniu.  Parliament’s decision to include a debate on the structural shortage of payments in the Horizon 2020 budget is very timely, particularly just after the debate we have had already with Commissioner Dominik. Since 2011, research and innovation programmes have suffered from a recurrent and accumulating lack of payment appropriations, and I will return to this in more detail in a few minutes. The situation has deteriorated under Horizon 2020 because the payment ceilings provided for in the 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework are tight. This situation has obliged the Commission to put in place drastic measures in order to meet its contractual obligations and to avoid payment delays. Two key measures have been adopted already in 2013: firstly a reduction of the average pre-financing rates for all research grants; and secondly the postponement of calls for proposal closure dates, thus spreading the payment needs to later years. The implementation of these drastic measures has reduced payments by up to EUR 1.5 billion in research programmes for the year 2014. We should not forget that these payment appropriation needs are, in reality, merely being pushed back to 2015 and beyond. Indeed, if current trends continue, such unmet accumulated payment needs would result in more than 40% of Horizon 2020 commitments remaining outstanding in 2020 and without proper payment coverage. However, these measures will no longer suffice to avoid payment delays if the requested payment appropriations are not met. In short, the approach of putting off to the future has reached its limits. Concretely, for 2014 and despite the implementation of these measures, an additional EUR 230 million, requested through Draft Amending Budget 3/2014, is urgently needed before the end of the year for the research DGs to avoid payment delays. In addition to this already challenging situation, I must draw attention to the sword of Damocles that hangs over Horizon 2020 in the 2015 budget. The proposed 10% cut in the Commission’s draft budget for research payment appropriations – representing a EUR 1 billion decrease for the research budget – would lead to a situation where research DGs could fail in their contractual obligations to thousands of research beneficiaries. In practical terms, let me repeat what Commissioner Dominik has already mentioned to you: around 600 collaborative projects under Horizon 2020 would be affected, involving more than 7000 participants, of which around 1400 are SMEs. I believe it is important to clarify one particular issue with regard to this proposed 10% cut in funding. Some would seek to obscure the reality by presenting the situation on Heading 1a as some sort of a huge increase for R&amp;D spending by comparison with 2014. What such a narrative fails to mention is that 2014 constituted a highly atypical year in terms of the scale of the payment appropriations budget for research and innovation. Indeed, in 2014, due to the phasing-in of Horizon 2020, some 15% less has been budgeted by comparison with 2013. The ‘increased spending’ narrative neglects two important factors: the step increase of the commitment profile in the last years of the seventh framework programme (FP7), as FP7 was backloaded; and, secondly, the overall limited availability of payments which we face. Thus, 2014 cannot be used as a valid benchmark for judging the budget trend in 2015. In fact, 60% of our spending in 2014 and 2015 is actually legacy-related payments from FP7, meaning that the full roll-out of Horizon 2020 is, de facto, being pushed even further into the future due to the lack of payment appropriations. In short, an outcome which provided for a cut in spending on the scale originally proposed by the Commission for 2015 would seriously call into question the reputation of the European Union as a reliable funder of research. This is a dramatic situation for a flagship policy that is intended to support jobs, growth and competitiveness.  It is also highly regrettable in the current economic situation, given our collective search for growth-enhancing measures and knowing that research and innovation are crucial to new growth and jobs. Such artificially low investment in research will also negatively impact on other initiatives such as the Digital Agenda, the energy technologies plan and our climate change policies. Such a large cut in 2015 would, moreover, be at odds with repeated affirmations in support of the Europe 2020 Growth and Jobs Agenda, most recently articulated through the Strategic Agenda for the Union in Times of Change. It goes without saying, therefore, that a new boost for jobs, growth and investment cannot be achieved if we continue to reduce planned investments in research and innovation. We are counting on you, the Members of the European Parliament, to give us your active support in addressing this problem by adopting without modification both Draft Amending Budget 3/2014 and the draft budget for 2015 as presented by the Commission.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 284, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Krišjānis Kariņš", "mepid": "96901", "text": "  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, i would like to thank the \"A lot of us have children.

The Council and the Commission have reiterated on numerous occasions their desire for the EU budget to promote growth and jobs. If they are to live up to this commitment they must do their utmost to resolve any issues around financing Horizon 2020. I note that the Council is proposing quite a significant cut of nearly EUR 1 billion – i.e. 11% – to payment appropriations for the EU research programme. In contrast, cuts to the cohesion payments amount to just 0.4% and those to agriculture 0.1%. EU research has been disproportionately hit by the Council’s proposals. I understand that the package of cuts is brought about partly by tighter budgetary controls put in place by Member States that are net contributors. I approve of this and I think it is inappropriate for the Commission to blame the Member States for it. The fact that we have to make these cuts is the fault of the whole Commission being unable to manage its budgets effectively. The Commission has been too liberal with commitments without tracking available payments. This has been going on for years and is getting worse. The result of this poor management is that crucial research funding is suffering and this is because of bad budgetary practice in other areas such as structural funds.

In early 2013, the Council wanted the funding for Horizon 2020 to represent real growth compared with the 2013 level. As late as 27 June 2014, the Council stated that: ‘the credibility of the Union depends on its ability to ensure adequate follow-up on decisions and commitments’ and that ‘the Union needs bold steps to foster growth, increase investments, create more and better jobs and encourage reforms for competiveness’.

In this House we can disagree on many things, but I believe that none of us here can deny, or even relativize, the immense importance that the Horizon 2020 programme can have for European science, nor its very clear and proven multiplier effect on our battered economy.

Despite the fact that it is the British Treasury and the treasuries of some other rich Member States who cause all these problems, this will be another UKIP and Tory – I think it is more UKIPisation – party strategy. They will blame Brussels for the fact that it is the British Government, it is Mrs Merkel, it is the Austrians and the Danish and the Finnish Governments who are creating the problem here.

We need research, even if I prefer that to come through the Member States rather than from the EU. But how about starting with EU overregulation? The European Union should operate according to the principle of subsidiarity. Everything that could be dealt with at a local level should be dealt with at a local level.

It is now clear that the European Union should have started to apply to itself rules of budgetary rigour. The situation of payments has reached a very alarming point, by the admission of the senior members of the Committee on Budgets. The unpaid bills have thus accumulated without the Council obviously being alarmed. How could he have allowed the situation to deteriorate at this level? The European Union is in the process of going into debt and there is indeed a structural deficit and not just a cyclical deficit in payments. This is the responsibility of the EPP and the PES that co-direct.  As in France, where the UMP and the Socialist Party have brought our country to the brink of bankruptcy, where the local authorities led by the right and the left are constantly increasing debt, blowing up operating expenses and increasing the tax burden.  The Horizon 2020 programme, which overall includes excellent projects, is part of a multi-year framework. Given the situation, how can you still commit to seven years? The volatility of the economic situation should make you think, also given your demonstrated inability to set a rigorous fiscal framework. Even more worrying, ladies and gentlemen, is your reasoning. At a meeting of the Committee on Budgets, which I attended last July, Mr Zanni asked a common-sense question. He asked whether the Council could consider re-establishing the situation by saving money.

The problem we are talking about – the problem of non-payment – is the universal problem of the European budget. We are talking today about research and development shortcomings, but a few months ago we talked about the dramatic humanitarian situation on which hundreds of people in refugee camps in Syria depend. In no other area than research and development (where innovation is concerned), there is no greater gap between declarations and opportunities between promises and resources at our disposal.  I would like to say to all the critics that, at national level, as at European level, budgets are currently scarcity management, but the distinguishing feature of the European budget is that annual tasks, annual ambitions can be quantified, can be expressed in figures called 'commitments'. If there are no payments to cover these commitments, which are agreed jointly by the countries and Parliament, the emptiness of these declarations is revealed, precisely because of this, more acutely than at national level.  The reasons for the current state of affairs are well known and diagnosed: under-payments at a time of crisis, when more than 20 countries were in an excessive deficit procedure, with bills rising at the end of the 2007-2013 programming. This is obvious. Low payment ceilings for 2014-2015, and at the same time new promises called frontloading, precisely concerning the scope of Heading 1. The effect is known, it is also diagnosed. No way out of this crisis is blame game. The way out is an amending budget for this year, solid budgeting for 2015, so that I believe that the Italian Presidency and the next Commissioners responsible for research and development will have their hands full.

If that does not happen, the lines of credibility and trust between the institutions will be broken, as the Commissioner rightly said. The Horizon 2020 component associated with research, science and innovation will predictably in the next Commission as responsible for the new Commissioner Portuguese. This new Commissioner is well aware of what it is to cut funding in science, research and innovation. The government of which it has been a part of the last three years has brutally reduced public investment in science and innovation and reduced research grants by more than 50%. I only use this example because it's a concrete example. The result is in sight. With these choices, Portugal regressed in gross domestic product and Portugal regressed into highly qualified employment.  This is a sign of what can happen if the whole Union adopts this strategy. I do not believe that the new Commissioner will want to repeat in the European Commission the policies he has pursued in his country. Ensuring timely payment of commitments is your first test of fire. Here will be its weight with Jean-Claude Juncker and the new Commissioner for the Budget.

In heading 1a there is COSME, there is the Joint Research Centre, which is very important. There are so many significant chapters. In the Horizon section, for example, there are emerging future technologies that are being cut, those that can give Europe and European industry a dominant and, let us say, significant position in international competition.

Then I'll explain why. I have two reasons for this: firstly, in my view, the programme contradicts one of the main principles enshrined in the Treaties, namely the principle we call subsidiarity. I think it is clear here that the investment in research is best done by the person concerned by the research, that is, a particular company, and it is not for the European Commission to decide at all. Secondly, there has been a cliché here several, perhaps a thousand times today, that we need investment in research to support growth, employment. Why do I say it's a cliché? That's probably true, but it's very important who invests in research. I think companies are supposed to invest. Who invented the microphone, the fluorescent lamp, the cell phone, the Wi-Fi? Do you think these things came from subsidies redistributed by an official? No, it was always companies that expected a return on their investments that invested in research.

If the Commissioner says this now, it means that the response given by the Council of 'we knit that right' and 'we are getting close', is incorrect.  At the last plenary session, we discussed cohesion money. There, the gap between payments and liabilities is more than EUR 20 billion. This is fundamental. And it also affects our own payment morale. We have adopted the directive on late payments for our own public organisations, for companies: pay within 30 days! What are we doing with the Council ourselves? We sit there with dry eyes, things are pushed through for a year and sometimes more than a year. This is not correct.

I would also like to begin by thanking the Commissioner for the clarity of the presentation. Horizon 2020 is an emblematic programme for Europe 2020 and, especially at the moment, it is a crucial programme, in the face of a youth unemployment rate that we could describe in Europe as unbearable.  Europe has the challenge of growth and competitiveness, but the truth is that, so far, the only measure we have seen put on the table to work for that competitiveness has been a reduction in wages in each of the Member States to combat the crisis, that is, an impoverishment of workers. But even if we believed to this extent, it is clearly insufficient. In the medium and long term it is essential to bet on knowledge, innovation and quality jobs. For this purpose Horizon 2020 was born, with this objective, although more and more important are the doubts we have regarding the Council's position — already at birth, it reduced it by 30% compared to the proposal made by the European Parliament, which called for 100 billion; he finally got an endowment of 70,000. The 2014 budget was reduced, and we are announced that in 2015 it will also be reduced by 190 million euros. The Commissioner's presentation highlights the serious problem of non-payment of committed programmes, which puts thousands of companies at risk, many of them small and medium-sized enterprises. Therefore, what we are asking for is a commitment by the Council, a commitment to the future of young people, to the future of the European Union and, above all, to entrepreneurs, to SMEs, industry and to scientific society, whom we create so much hope when we approved Horizon 2020 in 2011.

What don't they like? Growth, The Intelligent or the Inclusive?  In fact, it seems to me that it is obvious that the Council has already lost its horizon even before 2020.

The strength of the West today is the modern economy, its innovation and competitiveness. It should therefore be a necessary priority for the European Union to secure the necessary financial resources for research and science and the transfer of knowledge to industry.  The Horizon 2020 budget seems satisfactory, but we are currently discussing spending reductions for next year as well as the whole outlook for 2020. It therefore appears that, in view of the priority objective of Horizon 2020, the previously planned amounts should be maintained, in particular as regards expenditure on the small and medium-sized enterprises sector. Indeed, the knowledge economy is the only chance for the European Union to compete effectively with the United States, Japan, South Korea and other countries of the world.

I have also taken good note of the position of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the 2015 EU budget as they expressed it in their vote on 2 September 2014. It is appropriate that, in the week when we meet and have this discussion, the world university rankings have just been published. These show that we have two European Union universities joint second in the world ranking: Cambridge and Imperial College. Both institutions benefit substantially from EU research funding. When we talked about Horizon 2020 and putting the programme together, we worked with the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy to ensure that it meant exactly what Mrs McGuiness talked about: collaboration, getting rid of duplication, and ensuring that the best of European researchers work together with companies, the private sector, SMEs to ensure that we get this synergy going and that we ensure European subsidiarity. Companies like Jaguar Land Rover which also benefit and are present – very present – in the framework programmes were very supportive of what we were trying to do in relation to simplification and other elements of Horizon 2020. We need the budget that the Commission has asked for in order that we can roll out Horizon 2020. I count, therefore, on the continued active support of the whole Parliament in addressing the payment shortage issue.

The amount envisaged by the EU for Horizon 2020 is not insignifiable in the budget, but it is also not infinite. The spending must therefore be targeted, proportionate and transparent. In no case may they be abused.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 337, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Elnök asszony. -", "mepid": "102886", "text": "   Next point is the Commission statement - Digitised Single Market (2014/2840(RSP))", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 338, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Michel Barnier", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Vice-President of the Commission. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to meet you and first thank three of you, on behalf of the EPP Group: Andreas Schwab, Burkhard Balz and Kri-j-nis Kari's for their initiative to put this subject on the digital agenda, the digital single market on the agenda of your plenary session. Fortunately, the free movement of goods and services encounters fewer and fewer technical obstacles, making the persistence of legal, sometimes fiscal or political obstacles all the less understandable. These obstacles are even less comprehensible when this digital single market also has, and probably first of all, an economic, social and human dimension.  The digital economy generates 2.6 jobs for jobs lost in more traditional sectors. There are many opportunities in big data, cloud or connected objects. This important potential of the digital single market, we must exploit it. Just two figures, ladies and gentlemen. If we increase broadband usage by an additional 10%, we gain one more point of GDP. If e-commerce, e-commerce accounted for 15% of trade within the single market, instead of today's 5%, an additional 1.7% growth would be gained. We need to look for growth where it is. Right now, it is an emergency for citizens. And to do that, we need to establish a proactive regulatory framework.  Thanks to the commitment of your Parliament over the past five years, significant progress has been made. Do not count on me to be complacent, there is so much work waiting for the future Commission and waiting for you. I just want to make very specific reminders around three main areas of work: the ambition of our European Digital Strategy, the collective momentum given with the decisive support of your Parliament - Andreas Schwab knows this - on the Single Market Act I and II, and finally, the targeted nature of the action plan for trade and online services. I would like to telegraphly to remind us where we are today. First, telecommunications. The digital economy must be able to rely on a strong single telecoms market, promoting fair competition, reducing costs for consumers and developing new services that also attract private investment.  The regulation that we proposed in September 2013, under the leadership of Neelie Kroes, and of which your colleague, Mrs Pilar del Castillo is rapporteur, aims to bring the telecommunications sector really into the era of the internet and the internal market. The aim is to encourage operators to invest, to design new business models to integrate the twenty-eight national markets, which have so far often been juxtaposed next to each other, in a single market.  This regulation will make it easier to have more consistent rules for spectrum allocation and, as you have hoped, to end roaming charges, roaming charges, voice, text and data by the end of 2015. It will also set out the principles of net neutrality, which must both strengthen consumer protection measures for which Internet access must not be blocked or limited - neither blocked nor throttled - and develop innovative telecommunications tools for business users. I hope that an agreement will be reached quickly between your Parliament and the Council on this important package.  Since I am talking about net neutrality, I would just like to say a few words about the issue of your resolution on net neutrality. The Commission is, of course, very committed to ensuring that the internet operates in an open, non-discriminatory manner in all its dimensions, including search engines which have become, as we well know, an important tool for all users, consumers and service providers and many others. With regard to the Google investigation to which you clearly refer in your resolution, frankly, I will not add anything and will not comment on the information that has already been provided to you by my colleague Joaquin Almunia, who is in charge of this case. I think it is important for the European Parliament to be concerned about this subject, which in many respects affects very closely the functioning of our society, but an investigation is under way. The Directorate General of Competition, as always, does its job independently and in accordance with the rules and procedures in place, including listening to and responding to all complainants. That is all I can say about that. Second major project: services Online. In recent years, we have also acted with ambition to develop a diversified range of online services within the single market. The January 2012 e-commerce communication had identified three priorities often supported by your assembly.  First priority is to develop the legal and cross-border offer of online products and services. This is the aim of the guidelines on the implementation of Article 20 of the Services Directive adopted in June 2012, which will eliminate discriminatory requirements based on the nationality or place of residence of the recipient of services. The Commission has shown again this summer - and I have made sure - that we are determined to enforce these rules. For example, I reminded car rental companies that they had to respect the rules of the internal market and fight against price differences depending on the country of online booking.  The second priority is to improve operator information and consumer protection. This is the purpose of the agreement reached in April 2013 on the online settlement of consumer disputes, which should help to strengthen confidence in online purchases. Finally, there are the payment services, of which your colleague Antonio Tajani is responsible for rapporteur, and reliable and efficient delivery, which is in particular the objective of our December 2013 roadmap for improving the delivery of parcels within the single market. I met at length last week with all the presidents of the European postal operators who have committed to concrete results for the summer of 2015, so in a very short time, on the availability, quality and accessibility of parcel delivery solutions. With regard to payments, I proposed in July 2013 the revision of the Payment Services Directive, for which your colleague Pablo Zalba is responsible, and a regulation on interchange fees. I trust Parliament to reach an agreement there in the next few months, perhaps even before the end of my mandate.  Third project: copyright. For the past five years, I have been leading, with the support of President Barroso, a programme of reforms based on a common objective and method. Copyright, which is so important, must live with its time. Now, the time today is the time of the internet and the time of the single market. We must also, and at the same time, take into account the interests at stake and the great diversity in the positions of the Member States and the different operators and proceed in stages, without ideology, on the basis of solid analysis and evidence.  I think, ladies and gentlemen, that this pragmatic approach has been the right one. I take as proof the results we have achieved together: the adoption by the co-legislators of two pieces of legislation, namely the Orphan Works Directive, for which Lidia Geringer of Oedenberg is responsible, and the Directive on Collective Copyright Management, which owes so much to your former colleague, Marielle Gallo, adopted in February 2014 with the almost unanimous support of Parliament and the Council. In addition to these two texts, we can cite the signing of two international treaties, one of which on access to cultural content to whom I have paid great attention, like you: this is the Marrakesh agreement, which has occupied us a lot. Thank you again for your support for this initiative, as well as other non-legislative initiatives. Those are the achievements.  We have also opened the work of reforming the European framework for copyright. Just a word of the very intense work that has been done on this delicate subject: in addition to economic and legal analyses, dialogue with all stakeholders, the positive exercise on licensing for Europe - Licensing Europe - we launched a public consultation in early 2014. Nearly ten thousand citizens, industry actors, companies and public authorities have responded and highlighted, through this consultation, three key questions that a future reform should take into account. The development of supply throughout the single market, for example by removing barriers faced by consumers, citizens who wish to access video-on-demand services existing in non-Member States than their own.  Second, the link between copyright and new digital uses. I am thinking, for example, of the problems related to user generated content or what is called text and data mining. Third, the functioning of the market and the balance of the value chain, ensuring fair remuneration for authors and creators, while encouraging the emergence of new offerings and services.  On all of these issues, we have conducted intense discussions within and outside the Commission. For reasons related to the timetable, at the end of our mandate, I think it will be difficult now to move forward one step further, with the adoption of this white paper, as we would have liked. Nor am I prepared to distort the balance of work that we have done. I do not think, as some do, that copyright should be detracted from in order to create growth in Europe. On the contrary, I am convinced that the remuneration of investment in innovation, creation, the work of creators, including journalists and many others, and the development of the digital single market go together. We must find a common path to reconcile these two dimensions. It is regrettable that there is no white paper at this stage. I am convinced that all the preparation, consultation and drafting work, which I have just summarily recalled, will remain useful for the future initiatives of the new European Commission.  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, telecommunications, online services, copyright, in these three areas we have made concrete progress in serving consumers and businesses.  I would also like to say a word - finally - of three other important successes for the Digital Single Market. The data protection regulation, carried by my former colleague and your new colleague Viviane Reding and today by your rapporteur Jan Philipp Albrecht, is another key issue of trust in digital technology. New provisions will make it easier for citizens to control their personal data, to better protect it, and for businesses to work more easily across borders.    The second topic is dematerialisation, the digitalisation of public procurement and the directive on electronic billing, of which Birgit Collin-Langen is rapporteur. I would like to remind you, since there is a lot of talk about jobs and growth, that if we achieve a real digitalisation of public order, ladies and gentlemen, which accounts for 18% of European GDP - 18%! If we can achieve, with the reform of public procurement and the concessions that I have proposed and which have been adopted, electronic billing and electronic signature, e-authentication, we could save every year by this simple digitalisation, which is at our fingertips, between 50 and 70 billion euros. We have to look for those savings and direct that money to other, more productive investments. Then, thirdly, we opened up the cyber security project, which Andreas Schwab is well aware of, by strengthening cooperation between Member States to deal with threats, which is a condition for the development of the digital economy and in particular to facilitate the use of secure online services between citizens, businesses and public services. At the time of all these espionage cases, I can say, as Commissioner, Vice-President of the Commission or as a citizen, that it is urgent that we all find or build together the tools of our strategic autonomy. All of this is part of it. On the basis of these achievements, we must continue our efforts, it is a reality. Technical progress has always been one step ahead of politics. It must be acknowledged that many obstacles still remain to build this true digital single market. To cite just one figure from the digital strategy dashboard, only 14% of European small and medium-sized enterprises trade online. Only 14%! This figure, moreover, has stagnated for four years and remains far from the target we set for 33%.  We need to create this digital single market, give these companies a broad business base, equivalent to that enjoyed by American companies in their own market. This will allow us to build on this foundation to succeed in creating growth in globalization. To achieve these goals, we must continue to remove obstacles one by one. We identified a lot of them with you in the Single Market Act I and II. We must go further by developing a comprehensive, comprehensive and comprehensive approach, which involves networks with the best global standards, a level playing field to enable the emergence and development of innovative and competitive European players and a comprehensive plan to adapt the skills of Europeans to the jobs of tomorrow. We must also rethink our governance, the commitment of all stakeholders by improving policy coherence, for example, copyright, taxation, data protection, competition, industrial policies. It all works together. and, from this point of view, the new functioning of the Commission, with its groups of Commissioners and Vice-Presidents, should allow for better coherence between all these subjects that work together - also by forming a grand coalition to promote the digital single market, using the newly created and I listen to structures, Founders Forum, Startup Europe, European Cloud Partnership , CEO networks. I believe that the single market is a great unifying project, which must remain a collective project led by the Commission, by you and by the Council, with pragmatism, without ideology and voluntarily. I simply hope, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President - as I have done in the field of financial regulation, by rebuilding with you the foundations of financial stability, which is the precondition for any growth and competitiveness initiative - than what we have done with my colleagues over the last five years on this digital issue. , is the basis on which the new Commission can now give new impetus, with the support, always, of your Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 339, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Andreas Schwab", "mepid": "28223", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Mr Vice-President, Michel Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. It is good for us that, after five years, when we in the European Parliament have been able to work very closely with the current Vice-President of the European Commission on the issue of the Digital Single Market, today, after a long election campaign in which Commission President-designate Jean-Claude Juncker has proclaimed the Digital Single Market as one of the priorities for the new Commission, we can once again discuss what has been achieved and discuss the issues. , which are still separating us from the real completion of this digital single market. Unfortunately, I have only two minutes left, and that is why I would like to make it very brief in general: I believe that, in principle, we have two essential issues before us which will concern us in the coming years. I therefore regret to some extent that it was not possible today to debate a motion for a resolution and to adopt it tomorrow. But we can also talk about the content orally. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for whom I am the first to speak, has always supported the completion of this digital internal market in the last few years by a very majority and very broadly – beyond the Committee on the Internal Market alone. I believe that we can say today that there are still major problems ahead of us in two places. On the one hand, we need more uniform rules, and this will only succeed – the Council has already left – if the Member States are able to broaden this egocentric approach to the preservation of their own rules and can work on it and want to work on creating more uniform rules in Europe. In this way, we are creating new growth, thereby strengthening small and medium-sized enterprises, thereby also creating opportunities for new employment – especially in the countries that currently have economic problems. Secondly, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that it is a question of creating a level playing field in which small, medium-sized and large companies, wherever they come from, have a fair market entry. I am pleased that the European Commission extended its investigation into a major search engine operator last week. I believe that in the end it is a question of finding a good solution and not necessarily a quick shot. Unfortunately, however, this is, of course, a difficult and long time, and we finally need clear regulation for small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe as well. This is the only way that innovative European companies can have a long-term chance.  I do not know whether six months will be enough for the programme that Jean-Claude Juncker has spent. It is an ambitious timetable. However, we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats want to do everything we can to ensure that this programme succeeds, because it not only entails clear rules, but also real opportunities for new growth.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 340, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Evelyne Gebhardt", "mepid": "1913", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group. Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her We Social Democrats have also said time and again that the digital single market is a very important area of European policy. It is also extremely important because the digital market is becoming more and more and more enamoured. It is becoming increasingly important that we ensure that clear rules are also created in this area – clear rules that also give our citizens legal certainty, and, in addition to the citizens, consumers, workers in this area, and, of course, businesses. Because where there is legal certainty, there is also good cooperation. It is particularly important in this area, which concerns so many areas of life – all areas of life in fact – that we define a holistic approach and an ambitious strategy. This is extremely important. We have just heard that there are many examples in which this digital market also plays a role. To give just a few examples: payment transactions, accounting, public procurement law, e-commerce, online dispute resolution, telecommunications and so on, and so on. There are a lot of areas that go into this area. That is why it is also very important that we pursue a sensible European policy in this area. And that affects a great many areas, as I have already said. One of the highest priorities for our group is, of course, net neutrality in the area of the Internet. That must be the ultimate objective, because that is the guarantee that there will also be justice in this area. It is also very important that we also achieve neutrality in search engines in this area, including in other areas – as Mr Barnier has just mentioned with regard to Google. After all, this is an over-pre-emption of consumers, if e-commerce is supposed to be 'yes, we want to serve you as well as possible and respond to you' then there is actually a paternalism of the citizens. That is not what we want. We also want small and medium-sized enterprises to have a chance, and not just the very big ones, who can put a great deal of money into their hands in order to get the right place. These are the issues that we need to address. We must also address issues that raise ethical issues. This is because areas such as medicine, healthcare and others are also increasingly being involved in this area of the digital market. Here, too, we need to think very carefully about how we want to achieve this. Data protection, copyright and others are just as many issues that we need to address. Unfortunately, I do not have the time to do this even longer. We have a very big task ahead of us here.

Today every market has digital elements, and Europe’s single market must not be left behind. Unlocking the opportunities of the digital world is crucial to delivering jobs and growth. In the G20, the internet economy is set to grow by eight per cent every year for the next five years. It is racing ahead of traditional sectors. But what do we mean by the digital single market, and what work do we need to do to achieve it? In e-commerce alone we could save our consumers EUR 60 billion a year as a result of lower prices and EUR 95 billion as a result of having more choices, but there is a lot of work for us to do. We need to reduce burdens on establishing new businesses, cut costs in our payment and settlement systems, and remove barriers which prevent the physical delivery of goods ordered online. Consumer confidence is vital. Buyers and sellers need to be sure that their rights and protections are no less than those afforded them in their traditional markets. Then there is fraud prevention, licences, copyright, logistics – issues which all need to be addressed. We must work with businesses and consumers to make sure that all legislation across the board is properly evaluated, impact-assessed and then future-proofed for the digital age.  The competition issues are also complex. Our laws must prevent abuse by market dominators, but must also strike the right balance between traditional operators and over-the-top players and ensure that the new peer-to-peer models are not blocked by incumbents.  But it is not just about e-commerce. If we want to get the best out of e-government, e-health and e-procurement, we need ICT systems which talk to each other. This is why finding solutions on interoperability is also on this Parliament’s agenda. Data are another priority, and remember that big data bring big benefits, not only economically, but to society in sectors like personalised medicines and health. Yes, we do need a data protection package but it needs to be one that is not only pro-individuals, but also pro-business and pro-innovation. I support a transparent approach to data, respecting privacy, but also staying open. To be able to share data, we also need to have confidence that they will not be misused, hence the work that some of our colleagues are doing on network security. Here Member States need to be able to cooperate in the fight against cybercrime. However, we must not stop individual countries from being able to take really rapid action to protect critical services. Last, but by no means least, there is the issue of inclusion. As we race to embrace a digital world, we must not leave parts of our communities – like rural communities – behind. Infrastructure is essential, both to reach our remotest areas, and to provide the deep coverage we need in cities. Different Member States are finding different solutions to deliver this digital access and to improve digital skills. There is no ‘one size fits all’, but we can do more to share best practices. Parliament colleagues, our Council and national leaders and our new Commissioners, we need to work together to get the right priorities and set them now. The digital world can bring us great benefits and we need to grasp them, because if we get this wrong, we will not get the chance again, and we will all live to regret it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 342, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Dita Charanzová", "mepid": "124708", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Madam President, on behalf of the ALDE Group, I am here to say that, for us, the digital market is not a future project: it is here today. It is already affecting all economic sectors and their value chains. This is the biggest challenge to the economy and employment. However, today the digital market is not a single one in Europe. It is broken up into 28 national markets, each defended by outdated protectionist policies and regulations. We must eliminate these barriers and we must modernise and simplify rules for online and digital transactions. National rules do not work when a business or consumer pays more for physical goods because his IP address is in Berlin instead of Prague. National rules do not work for digital goods or services especially where there is no logical or physical reason to block the free exchange and free movement of those goods. But today we have 28 different online rule books. We need harmonised rules, where appropriate, and increased mutual recognition on access to digital goods and services. A Czech should be able to buy music from France without hitting the firewall of obsolete copyright and data protection laws. We also need a clear European framework for the digital market on consumer and contract law. Without it, how can all European citizens trust that they are being treated equally? How can our SMEs truly work across borders? The digital single market must not be merely a goal on paper. It is a policy that every young European can understand.

Perhaps I am the one who pours a little bit of water into the wine – in connection with what has just been said. We are talking about the Digital Single Market, but we are far from doing so. We are working on it and we have to work on it, but there are difficulties. For I can already see that the situation is today, particularly in the areas of data protection.B or net neutrality, that companies that come to the European market from outside can choose which of the 28 legal systems they want to follow, and thus have a massive advantage over companies that are already in one of these 28 jurisdictions and want to sell their products and services to the other 28 countries. This is a problem for businesses in Europe. And it makes it a massive competitive disadvantage compared to those particularly .B from Silicon Valley, which are relatively unregulated in this market. But to conclude from this that we need to follow the Silicon Valley model and simply abolish or lower the rules, which I think is the wrong way to go. We are already losing the confidence of citizens, consumers, in our market. For we consumers are also concerned: in 90% of cases where my data are processed, European data protection law no longer applies. I can't trust that my data will be processed properly. In many cases, when it comes to IT security, cyber security is open to companies – everyone can go in there. It's so easy to get into the most sensitive systems - we basically don't have standards. We have to tackle this, and that also means making uncomfortable demands, to say that such a standard applies to everyone, that it cannot be lowered. Rather, we need a high standard in which people can trust, in terms of data protection, net neutrality and IT security and all the issues we are discussing. We must have this courage, including towards the Member States.

His project is a trap for citizens. It is based on an amalgamation and false promises. The amalgam is to artificially link the digital single market to net neutrality when these are two different things.  Net neutrality must be sought and protected because it guarantees the free access of all citizens, even the most modest, to the digital network. It is a shield against the will of some large companies to establish an access priority for those who are able to pay it a high price.  As I speak, the powerful GSMA association, which brings together mobile operators, is lobbying hard to bring down net neutrality. Will the Commission and the European Parliament be able to resist it? Nothing is less certain because the United States does not want net neutrality. However, the European Union usually ends up ceding to them.  False promises are about reforesting the future market with almost miraculous virtues. In its resolution of 4 July 2013, the European Parliament says it will bring 800 billion euros to the European economy, but a year later Mr Juncker lowers this forecast to 500 billion euros.

First of all, I can only strongly support the idea that we are also using the European Digital Agenda as a matter of priority to make small businesses, medium-sized enterprises, competitive companies on the world market and to promote them there in such a way that they can be successful in the future. Secondly, however, it is also important to put the so-called monopolists, whether they are search engines or of any other kind, in the way of curbing them and reminding them, even if they are outside the European Union, that they must abide by European rules. The question is whether consumers can be made aware of 28 different standards in 28 different countries. But I don't think so.

However, we must ensure that those who, for example.B, suddenly turn private data into public data through seemingly innocuous changes to the general terms and conditions, and suddenly claim millions of data and addresses for themselves and not for the purposes for which they originally obtained it. People expect us to do data protection in an adequate way without simultaneously overburdening every micro-enterprise with the same data protection rules that we place on companies that have billions of dollars in data and use it accordingly. I have the impression that, according to the monopolists, we are still very timid towards the monopolists and we need to put them in a pretty clear position, otherwise a digital agenda will not be successful, because the monopolists do not abide by competition rules.

Efficient digital single market cannot exist without reliable and high-speed infrastructure. A functioning digital single market needs connected European citizens all over Europe, but unfortunately the reality shows that Europe has fallen behind in the development of 4G networks.  Unfortunately, according to the Commission's latest data on high-speed broadband, only a small proportion of European households have a subscription of more than 100 Mbps. Recall that the objectives of the Digital Agenda 2020 are 30 Mbps for all citizens of the European Union and that at least 50% of European households have internet connections of more than 100 Mbps by 2020. What can the Union do to keep all its citizens connected, wherever it lives, so that we have a real digital society? With regard to the ongoing negotiations, I would like to ask the Commission what timetable it provides for the completion of the Telecom Package, because the Council is still very divided. I stress that the S&amp;D Group will strongly defend the European Parliament's first reading position, especially with regard to roaming, consumer protection and net neutrality.  Even if the Member States are very reluctant, increased harmonisation of spectrum, combined with the application of common principles for spectrum rights within the European Union, is a key remedy for addressing the problem of lack of predictability in terms of spectrum availability. This would allow the innovative use of wireless broadband, while protecting emission times and preventing interference.  Regarding 5G: what is the current state of 5G development and in particular the public-private 5G partnership launched by the Commission to provide solutions, architectures, technologies, standards for state-of-the-art communications infrastructures over the past decade?

The digital market has huge economic potential and at the same time has a secondary impact on the development of many sectors. Various studies predict its growth opportunities for the future. We know that the Digital Single Market still encounters many barriers. The reality is the diversity of conditions in Member States, which have their logical historical reasons, but are often built on purposeful barriers protecting the commercial interests of different companies. In general, therefore, I can only welcome the European Commission's announced ambition to complete the Digital Single Market. But this also has its pitfalls, we must not overregulate the market. It can increase the financial burden on businesses in the digital market, and further investment could be hampered by excessive legislative ambition.  Also, when we talk about the Digital Single Market, we need to recall again some aspects that are a prerequisite for its successful functioning.

The benefits of a digital single market are huge. This is something that citizens can feel very directly, and an example of an area where strong European cooperation makes an important difference. But the challenges are many. Overall, we must ensure a fair and fair rules across the EU. There needs to be a greater correlation between where digital services are consumed and their taxation. The Commission must ensure that Member States implement the rules uniformly, because digital knows no borders. If we do not have rules within the European Union that companies outside the EU must also comply with, yes, then companies are looking where the rules and, above all, the enforcement of the rules are relaxed. Europeans must be able to feel safe online. We need to get a new data protection regulation through. It must give European companies opportunities to compete, while at the same time making consumers feel safe. The discussion on online surveillance after the Snowden case clearly shows that we have not yet found our legs to stand on in the European Union. We need to have open standards in software policy so that neither users nor companies get caught up in proprietary formats. We need interoperability so that citizens can take their data with them unhindered when the data is in the cloud. A common European e-label may be needed to strengthen cross-border trade and, finally, we must of course continue the fight against tele roaming. Enhanced cooperation between telecommunications authorities can bring tangible benefits to consumers. We look forward to good and constructive cooperation, including with the new Commission.

We are talking here about an infrastructure of the 21st century that is important in terms of democracy– perhaps the most important one. We should make a massive following that we create an infrastructure here that is relevant to democracy policy and that stands up to it. This concerns net neutrality, and search neutrality. It is not just a question of giving companies equal access to search results, it is also about regulating or not regulating the information of our population, depending on how the laws are adopted.

Sometimes it happens in this House – and now I think it is such a time – when we have discussions – if you listen to them, if you understand something about the subject matter, you know what it is about, if you are a normal citizen, you sometimes think: what exactly do they discuss, what is the term digital economy, what is happening there?  We also need to talk about this in order to be able to assess the consequences. A colleague mentioned high-speed Internet. Yes, these are all things that are at stake now. But there is much, much more at stake. I recently read a study by one of the big companies in this area, and they talk about the fact that in the future there should be toothbrushes that report when brushing their teeth when something is broken, and immediately make an appointment with the dentist, that there should be refrigerators that refill themselves and think about what the owner wants, that there should be espresso machines that match their function with the calendar and then make a strong espresso when a bunch of appointments.  That is what we are talking about in the future. When we have such a situation, I believe that there is a core element of this digital economy, and that is data protection. As in the past, when our predecessors fought for the secrecy of letters, it is now time to ensure that all the sensitive data at stake is kept carefully, that it cannot be misused. This must become a central element of this digital economy.  A colleague from the top right said that we have to weigh up this, and we have to see whether it is not also a question of the interests of the economy. No, data protection takes this area before all other interests, including economic interests. It is not acceptable for anything else to happen here.

This is because the European Union's economic model is based on the euro pact. In other words, it supports the competitiveness of the old continent in the 'Chineseisation' of wages. However, in order to be competitive, the European Union cannot rely on low wages, since it cannot compete with the low wages of China and India. Instead, it must invest in the knowledge economy, education and training. But this is at the heart of Mrs Merkel's doctrine of primary surpluses and the consequent reduction in public spending on education, innovation and new technologies.

This trend is caused by the digital domination of the United States. But overregulating and over controlling the Internet will simply destroy innovation.

This afternoon we are discussing the Digital Single Market, growth potential, new jobs. Digital products and services will also come more from Europe in the future. However, all this can only work if consumers and citizens have confidence in these services. This also applies to our companies whenever they use online services. Can we all really trust that personal documents – business records, for example – are actually secure in a cloud? If we want to not only catch up with other bidders, but move forward, we need confidence in offers and opportunities. The fundamental right to data protection must become a priority, a basis for the further development of the Digital Single Market. And for that we finally need the European data protection reform. People must not only become the object of economic interests, but they should decide informs about their own data, about what data is collected and analyzed by whom and for what purpose and where and for how long. Users should be able to avaise these and other rights from providers, no matter where in the world this provider is located. This is an important prerequisite. Strong data protection is the key to a successful Digital Single Market. And it is precisely small and medium-sized enterprises that need to be increased in order to avoid risks in the area of cloud computing, for example. It is only when I know the risks I am taking that companies can act on, for example by using European and hopefully privacy-friendly cloud systems.

It is still not attractive to digital start-up companies because it cannot offer seamless access to the market. We have heard much about the achievements but, and I congratulate the Commissioner for being so straightforward, we have also heard that there is a clear acknowledgement that we have failed to achieve some of our targets and that we will continue to set ourselves those targets and aims for the future.

There is a clear list of priorities for realising a vision for completing this single market. I would like to focus my remarks on simply one of these areas.

This means that if you are to be the leading digital single market, you need to be the most digitalised market. A more digitalised Europe really means more Europe.  That is why we need to have structural reforms to get rid of 28 different local markets – it is so old-fashioned. We need to ensure that we can have lower costs and more investments, and that is why we need a single market with operators covering all the markets and delivering the best services.

I would like to mention two points that you raised, Mr Barnier, in your introductory remarks. Firstly, I am convinced that the Commission is now called upon to deal with Google and its market power in a tough but fair manner in order to finally present an acceptable solution here. Google has now proposed unacceptable things three times – I think it's enough! To assume that would not have been acceptable either. I am therefore glad that the Commission has once again postponed this. Transparency can and must be demanded of a corporation that permeates the lives of each individual in its breadth and depth and, incidentally, also affects diversity of opinion and media pluralism. The obligation to disclose previously secret search algorithms would be a tried and tested remedy here. We must also oblige search engines throughout Europe to apply only the same search criterion to all services. I am convinced that this criterion must be relevant.  Secondly, fairness can only be done in a truly open Internet. The Google case clearly shows what happens when business interests are put above the general interest. Politics has given Google a free hand for too long.  This must not happen to us again. If, in the forthcoming trialogue procedures surrounding the Regulation on the Digital Single Market Regulation, we allow ourselves to be drawn into the lax regulation of net neutrality and, through hardly regulated special services, open the back door to circumventing net neutrality, the Google case will in fact have been nothing more than a lukewarm air.  Comprehensive net neutrality, which must be guaranteed without exception, is the technologically necessary security for fair competition. It must not be undermined by special services, which is why special services must only be permitted where they are technically absolutely necessary and do not restrict the freedom and openness of the Internet.

Still, there is a need for some criticism. Where is the Europe that is setting the trend? Where is europe with its mobile phone standard, where it inspires Europe? I can tell you that in 2004, when I was also in this Parliament, I attended a conference on internet governance at the United Nations. That's where our European companies were at the forefront. What's happened now? You can see that the big American companies are in charge of the whole cloud thing. So we need to create a spirit that is different and also sets the trend. I think that's a trend from the bottom up. A trend of our education, of our companies, of young people starting start-ups in the app economy. A trend that actually determines our lives to a great extent. That's it. It's not always the case that Alibaba will set the trend, it's our people close to home. That is why I welcome the initiative that is now on the table. Putting two Commissioners on this digital, partly internal market is a very wise idea, because we have to move on.

We must introduce what is the basic rule in any market: the possibility of operating on equal terms. The third concerns copyright.

The internet alone is already responsible for 20% of economic growth and about 25% of job growth. For these reasons, the bodies of the European Union, including the European Parliament, should continue their efforts to remove barriers to the development of the Digital Single Market. One challenge is to tackle the legal fragmentation of this area in national laws, another problem is the lack of good cross-border rules and the lack of websites available in many languages. Attention should also be paid to dispute resolution methods, in particular for online purchases in cross-border transactions, as this is essential for the level of trust in online purchases.  It is very important for the development of digitalisation – it is also necessary to increase the level of e-skills among the inhabitants of the Member States of the European Union in parallel with investments, e.g. in broadband infrastructure, and in all age groups. It is about inducing e-readiness to use computer and information technologies, both in the economy and in communication with public administrations.  It is also important to regulate well the cooperation between private investors and private operators with the administrations of the governments of individual Member States. This entails an economically efficient pooling of market forces and the public interest. This is an excellent space for the development of public-private partnerships in all Member States of the European Union. I therefore call, also as the author of the Law on Public-Private Partnership in Poland, to promote and support PPPs in the Member States of the European Union.

For example, electronic invoices, digital signature – that's our people's every day. We can talk about the problems that we can already see.

In fact, I would like to stress that the problems of this market are not just economic problems. What my previous speaker spoke about is very important. A cultural and educational moment is very important, which has been little talked about. I am actually concerned that the Commission's digital programme is very much economic-oriented. Its time frame is very narrow, and we in Parliament should be able to expand it and also see how to work with a number of committees.  Currently, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is working on data protection, the Committee on Culture and Education on media content creation and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on everything concerning the market.

This is because we have established the common market for products, because we have adopted GSM, that is, the common mobile telephony system, a European innovation with a global impact. Unfortunately, today in the area of the digital single market, we are in danger of losing the train. Because when it comes to competition with other countries – and the example is the United States of America – we must first overcome the major disadvantage, which is none other than the fragmentation of the single market into 28 different markets. While products in the United States are aimed at 300 million consumers, products and services in the European Union could be aimed at 500 million potential consumers. However, we have not yet completed the institutional framework to take advantage of this comparative advantage. Mr President, I have said this before in plenary, politicians cannot create jobs. This is the role of the companies and entrepreneurs who take risks. But we have an obligation to create the conditions and the environment that will facilitate job creation. I say this because in Greece, because of the crisis, we have 178 000 over-qualified unemployed young people. We have hundreds of thousands of unemployed under the age of 25. And, at the same time, despite the crisis, we are seeing not only in Greece but throughout Europe, that those jobs that require digital literacy are flourishing and that is the very great need. To the point where in 2020 we estimate that in Europe we will have a deficit of almost one million 'digital' jobs. The evidence you have presented to us, Commissioner, has been very interesting because it shows the work you have done. But you also showed us that we have to rush. To rush to adapt businesses, to rush to remove obstacles. We often say that the European Union must be present on the big issues. What is happening with the digital single market is too great, because it covers hundreds of potential jobs that we urgently need.

Are we ready, for example, for countries that invest in digital to remove this from budgetary constraints? I think it needs to be done.

Commissioner, you have rightly pointed to the impressive potential GDP increase coming from the digital single market in Europe, but the question is: why were Nokia and Ericsson pioneers of the mobile era which then lost their supremacy to Apple and Samsung over the past 15 years? Twenty-eight national digital markets regulated at national level are a competitive disadvantage and a considerable burden for investors and consumers in Europe. We cannot afford fragmented regulation if we want to unleash the potential of our digital products and services. We have to remove the remaining fiscal and legal barriers. We need European regulators, pan-European operators and a truly Europe market. We also need an integrated online and mobile payments market. It is also high time to have fast fibre European networks in every household in Europe. A slow Internet connection is a competitive disadvantage for a company, and we see that especially in rural areas. We should set ambitious targets and respect them. We should aim to connect most European households, even in rural areas, with 100 megabytes of Internet connections by 2020.

We need rapid action to remove this digital fragmentation. Access to the Internet is a fundamental right and no one should be excluded from it. A discussion on the completion of the internal market must not spare these issues. But other conditions must also be addressed, such as the legal anchoring of net neutrality, the re-establishment of trust in the digital network through a rapid adoption of the data protection package, a copyright reform that harnesses the potential of the digital era, and finally better possibilities for data portability and provider switching in order to break up entrenching monopolies.

The digital agenda is a key part of the European Commission's new programme, and I would like to welcome two major initiatives by President Juncker. The first is to have made the completion of a digital single market its priority. The second is to have appointed a vice-president specifically in charge of this policy.

Not only what their theoretical rights are, but also whether they can realistically obtain them if, for example, they have purchased a poor quality product or service. In this context, it is important to fully implement and implement the legislative acts already adopted. Particular attention should also be paid to the elimination of discriminatory practices, which are unfortunately still a common reality of the internal market.

Corporate legislation is far from being harmonised, while the data protection regulation is nowhere near implementation. Too many barriers hamper companies’ investment in the use of ICT as well as cross-border and Internet-based economic activity. We want to encourage innovative entrepreneurship among our youth. We all want to see a digital market where goods and services flow freely among Member States, where competition drives knowledge forward and prices down, but that requires a shift in approach from a national market mindset towards a European one.

One of the major priorities in this area must be the issue of security on the Internet, in order to create confidence here: security against cyber-attacks, from mass spying, from economic espionage, from fraud. Ultimately, we also want to combat terror and crime through data and digital technology. We do not want a surveillance state here, but we also want the state to be able to fulfil its security tasks in the digital market as well.

Secondly, breaking the selfishness of the 28 countries, because this selfishness kills the possibility of developing the Digital Single Market. Thirdly, the development of investment so that access to high-speed internet has caused us not to have the situation we had today: with a delay of 30 seconds, almost a minute, we have heard our friends in Kiev. This is a weakness in internet speed. These investments clearly require market consolidation, breaking down fragmentation, including harmonisation when we share the future spectrum. Fourthly, there is a need to harmonise standards and services, including in the area of privacy, so that not 28 regimes, but one legal regime, decide on this digital leap. Fifthly, big data is a great opportunity for the economy, the development of big data is probably an additional EUR 280 billion to European GDP over the next few years.  But for big data to grow well, you need to combine three elements. First, adopt privacy and personal data protection arrangements. They build trust and they will also allow small business to grow across the European continent. Secondly, it is necessary to open data, reuse and use data with this development, so that the obstacles that sometimes exist in excessive protection, excessive copyright do not restrict the development, movement of various goods, products and data.

However, as we develop, we must ensure that we create a level playing field for all. The cultural sector in particular is supported by small and medium-sized enterprises in the creative industries and is characterised by linguistic and content diversity.  In order to promote and maintain this, a non-discriminatory, open and transparent Internet is essential. That is why we must ensure fair conditions of competition, especially for platforms, search engines and other distribution channels on the Internet. Search engines and platforms often perform a gatekeeper function that can quickly disrupt this diversity of creative education and media offerings. The bundling of search engines with their own offers of content and service risks distorting competition. It is therefore important that the Commission pays attention to transparency, openness and non-discrimination, particularly in the case of platforms with considerable market dominance, so that its own offers and services of platform operators are not privileged and others are penalised.  Market dominance must not lead to consumers receiving only limited other offers or to finding only certain suppliers on the network easily. Culture, education and also the media live on the great diversity in Europe. This wide variety of content and offerings is an invaluable value that needs to be strengthened and preserved. Finding the Internet will be the key to the success of any offer in the future.  That is why, from the point of view of the creative and educational sector and media pluralism, we are calling for the safeguarding of search neutrality and an open, transparent and non-discriminatory Internet.

Je veux saluer dans ce contexte le magnifique travail qui a déjo été fait par le commissaire Michel Barnier et son équipe. The future Juncker Commission also points to the digital single market as one of its standards. In reality, the development of the digital single market must be at the heart of the European Union's efforts to generate economic growth and employment, as well as to strengthen the competitiveness of the Union and its resilience within the global economy. Together, the European Commission and the Member States need to promote the application of existing rules and regulations and, where necessary, impose sanctions. It is necessary for the Commission to ensure rapid application of existing legislation in order to subsequently further open up the single market for services. The Commission must, in my view, ensure the application and enforcement of rules such as the Consumer Rights Directive, alternative dispute resolution and online dispute resolution, while ensuring the reduction of administrative burdens. Another challenge would be to ensure a level playing field for companies operating in the digital single market, so that they are able to compete.

Hence, let me share with you a few thoughts of the EPP’s youngest MEP. It is typically the younger generations in Europe that are contributing to the development of a competitive European digital economy. Examples such as Spotify, the South Cloud and Skype were all start-ups by young European entrepreneurs. I would like to further urge the Commission to foster an environment that makes it easier, more affordable and simply more desirable for my young fellow citizens to keep on thinking about the next wave of digital innovation ‘made in Europe’. It is the younger generations that not only drive and benefit from digitalisation but are most vulnerable to its potential negative consequences. Young people often share every aspect of their life, as well as important personal data, via Internet platforms and social media. This can and often has negative consequences for their career prospects, for their safety and their security. The spread of digitalisation can make such cases more common. Thus, although a dynamic, pro-business, pro-innovation and integrated digital market is something I encourage and embrace, it should be completed by a very carefully devised online security strategy. I urge the Commission to introduce standards guaranteeing the online safety of one of the most vulnerable social groups: European youth. I also would like to address you, not only as one of the youngest MEPs but also as a Member from a young EU Member State and, more importantly, a young democracy. One of the many advantages of the digital single market is that it can help us improve transparency and accountability through instruments such as e-government. E-government is a key priority of some Member States.  Yet countries like Bulgaria need European support for completing such an ambitious project.

Mr President, thank you to each and every one of you for the diversity, the intensity and the quality of this debate. I believe that Mr Schwab and his colleagues who have taken this initiative will not regret it, given the richness of this debate. He himself, like Mrs Raa Thun, and mr H-kmark and many others, at the moment Mrs Ouica, have spoken of the economic importance of the digital market and I have said the potential of it if a number of technical, fiscal and administrative barriers are removed. I also want to say - and this has been the mindset of my work over the last five years as Commissioner for the Single Market and Financial Services - that there is a dimension in the single market that is primarily economic but also social, human, civic, with issues related to data freedom and protection, and also a cultural dimension. It is by thinking of all this that we must give this impetus to a project, Mrs Ouica, which is indeed that of the present and not that of the past or the future. We are in the present to bring this digital single market to life. You have to move forward, that's what you're going to do with the next college. It is absolutely necessary to implement the rules agreed together. He insisted on implementation through directives, texts, monitoring, evaluation and your Parliament has a very important role of vigilance towards the Commission and the Council. That is what needs to be done, I say this to Mrs Spyraki who was asking for an increase in the pace.  You have to be as conscious or realistic. Earlier I was listening to your Estonian colleague, who has left us, Mrs Marju Lauristin, who was talking about a point to which I was very attached, I quoted earlier, it is the electronic signature which is, in the great project of the digitalisation of public order and many other issues, one of the key elements with electronic billing and the reform of public procurement that I have implemented. I could say to Mrs Lauristin that it took two years between the commission's proposal and the vote in Parliament and the Council to come up with a text that is not yet fully operational.  Ms Gebhardt, Mr Albrecht, Mr Borelli, Mrs Verheyen and many others spoke of net neutrality, as I had done myself. I think everyone should have access to services, applications on an open internet. The Commission has proposed European legislation to ban all kinds of blockages, strangulations, discrimination of specific content, applications or services, with very limited exceptions.  This regulation proposes the promotion of innovation as a guarantor of the open internet while allowing specialized services such as digital television or other services that may surface in the future provided that the open internet is not hindered. Parliament has supported this proposal and we hope that an agreement can be reached before the end of this year. On cybersecurity, Mr. Albrecht and Mr. Voigt asked the question of where we stand with regard to the legislative proposal on network security and information. Your House has adopted its report at first reading, the Council for its part is finalising its negotiations and I hope that the trilogues can start soon under the very active presidency of Italy.  Vicky Ford earlier and others have talked about consumer protection, which is a priority, which justifies the Commission's action in the area of data protection, I myself mentioned earlier. Another example of this consumer consideration is online payment, so that they are protected in daily payments, and - I say to Mr Albrecht - by pulling the standards up and not down.  Ms Ford also mentioned, like Mr Nica, this major project of inclusion which focuses on the digital single market. The whole single market, all Member States must be covered by the internet. All the citizens wherever they are, the most fragile, the most remote, the most isolated, must receive appropriate services and this justifies the investments that Mr Murean has mentioned with great skill and dynamism like your colleague Weiden Holzer. This is the meaning of the Telecom Single Market proposal, for which we hope for a quick agreement, and also the investments that can be made in this area of digital through the initiatives that President Juncker will propose to you.  I'd like to thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Many of you have pointed out the work I have had the honour of doing over the past five years and I would like to thank in particular, on your behalf, one of your younger colleagues, Mrs. There is no complacency, there is no nostalgia. The Commission has a continuity, a new impetus. A new era will begin by, I hope, emerging from this financial crisis that I had to face with all my colleagues. I simply believe, Mr President, that this debate, its quality and diversity is a very important signal for the new Commission. This area is a priority for her, which President Juncker has indicated, as Mrs Sander has said, by appointing Prime Minister Andrew Ansip to coordinate this work, and my colleague Gunther Oettinger, who will be in charge of this subject, as Commissioner-designate Mrs Bie-kowska responsible for the internal market and therefore for dialogue with small and medium-sized enterprises.  Many of you have spoken of the opportunity that this can be - if we want to if we make their lives technically, legally, fiscally easier - for small and medium-sized enterprises. I think it is a real issue to put consumer citizens and small and medium-sized enterprises back at the heart of the internal market. That was the goal I set for myself five years ago. We have made great progress, as you have indicated, but I think the next Commission will have to make more, with the voluntarism that President Juncker has mentioned.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 390, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Andrus Ansip (ALDE)", "mepid": "124696", "text": "  in writting. –  I would like to thank Michel Barnier for the Commission statement.

As Prime Minister, I co-wrote a letter with colleagues from three countries that first introduced the term to the European Council. Building the Digital Single Market was among my government’s top priorities toward the EU. I am excited to continue this work as a member of Jean-Claude Juncker’s team in the new Commission. During the first six months of our mandate, we will propose ambitious legislative steps towards a connected Digital Single Market. This will not be easy.

Still today, we face difficulties in our European cross-border trades; and far too many barriers still block the free flow of online sales and services across national borders. I believe that we must update the EU single market rules for the digital era, and we should aim for: 1. Enabling our businesses to compete across all EU countries by making online selling an option for all of our businesses; 2. Establishing a single area for online payments; 3. Fostering the involvement of SMEs, making them more knowledgeable about online systems; 4. Protecting EU consumers in the cyberspace; 5. Empowering our citizens and economies in the digital era.

We must not forget that Europe is part of a very competitive global economy, including in the digital sector, which is also constantly evolving and very rapid, and some Member States need support to catch up with infrastructure.  In this context, one of the key points of the success of the success of the digital single market or achievement in the European Union is the establishment of sound legislative and administrative safeguards to boost citizens' and business confidence in the digital economy, including through a legal framework for strong data protection, but also to increase the participation rate of small and medium-sized enterprises in e-Commerce up to 50%.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 393, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "23868", "text": "  in writing – I am very glad that the EP has played an important role in revital ingesting the internal market.

They will also need to strengthen the confidence and ownership of digital technology by citizens, SMEs and administrations.

We have high hopes and expectations that the summit will produce a climate of mutual trust between the parties and generate the political impetus necessary to contribute to a successful outcome of the international climate negotiations, with a view to a comprehensive agreement at the Paris Conference in December next year. As you know, the main objective of these climate negotiations is to ensure that the rise in temperature remains below two degrees centigrade. This commitment was accepted overall in Copenhagen and reaffirmed in Cancún. It must now be put into practice and everyone must contribute. The fifth evaluation report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change once again underlines the need for urgent global action if we are not to leave it to future generations to cope with the advancing climate change. The European Union therefore continues to work hard both internally and within the framework of the UNFCCC in the fight against climate change. Between 1990 and 2012, the European Union effectively managed to dissociate growth, which was by a plus 44%, from greenhouse gas emissions, which fell by 19%, thanks to a whole series of policies and measures. This shows that the two are not mutually exclusive.  The European Union and its Member States are determined to reach a comprehensive agreement in Paris in 2015. Ambitious mitigation commitments are needed to keep the global average temperature rise below two degrees centigrade below pre-industrial levels.  It is essential that the major economies and emerging economies take the lead. In March 2014, the European Council announced that it would take a decision in October on a framework for energy and climate policies until 2030. This will enable the European Union to present its contribution to the global agreement by the first quarter of next year, in line with what was agreed last year in Warsaw. Let us hope that others do the same. There is a high degree of awareness at EU and Member State level about the importance of climate finance. They are committed, along with others, to mobilising a hundred billion dollars by 2020, as well as being ready to start the initial capitalization of the green climate fund this year. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am fully aware that the same high level of ambition is shared by the vast majority of Members of this House.

It is very clear that we see eye-to-eye on what is the purpose of this huge international event on climate change next week in New York. It is clear that the purpose of such a meeting must be to try to create renewed momentum and more awareness. It is not a place where you negotiate in all sorts of detail the next climate agreement, everybody knows that, but I must say that I think it is encouraging that more than 125 Heads of State and Governments have now accepted Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon’s bold invitation. I think that is also a very good sign, because what it really means is that all these Heads of State, already at this stage, before they go to New York, have needed to ask in their own governments ‘what are we prepared to deliver in Paris next year?’ That is where the real significance of this New York meeting lies.  It is clear that the European objective must be that the agreement reached next year in Paris must be sufficiently ambitious to make it credible that the world will stay below the two degrees Celsius threshold, as was agreed by leaders in Copenhagen in 2009. It is also worth noting that we are actually to a large extent talking about a new generation of Heads of State, because governments have changed so fast that we really need to bring these messages and this issue to the top of governments, many of which have changed heads of state since the last similar meeting in September 2009. I must say that I am confident that the EU and its Member States will project a confident, united, committed EU at the summit. I think we have already had a rehearsal at the recent Bonn Ministerial meeting back in June, where we really made a united effort and portrayed a united Europe. It is a Europe that is both credible in our own action and responsive to the needs of the most vulnerable. That means that it is also absolutely key next week that our governments send a very strong signal that Europe intends to deliver on our financial pledges made in Copenhagen. I believe that the summit will see EU leaders reaffirm their commitment to the 2015 Paris agreement timetable and to tabling our contribution on time, which is the first quarter next year, after this October when we will have adopted our own 2030 targets. This is not just wishful thinking. It is something that the leaders of the European Union have twice said will happen, in March and again in June: that we will have the 2030 targets known by next month. Therefore, of course, Commission President Barroso will present at the summit our ambitious 2030 proposal for, among other things, a 40% domestic reduction target of greenhouse gas emissions. It is essential, though, that all the major economies in the G20 also table their contributions in the first quarter next year. The EU will press strongly for this during the summit. We want a single ambition and leadership across the different thematic areas of the Summit, which range from climate finance to energy, to agriculture, to cities and the economic case for action. And Member States of course have their own planned national announcements that will be made. The EU will also express its support for the many UN-led initiatives which will be launched at the summit, among them an initiative on HFCs; a statement on HFCs, which is very, very important; the Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture and the carbon pricing statement – it is a good thing that the carbon-pricing family is actually growing globally – and the global forest declaration.  The EU wants to ensure that the summit delivers a political outcome which meets our objectives for 2015, particularly on commitments to reach an ambitious agreement in Paris, on ensuring that major economies table their CO2 reduction contributions by March 2015, and on climate finance. Hopefully, as I said, the involvement of Heads of State will give a push towards Lima, because it is not all about Paris next year. In order for Paris to be a success, already in Lima we need to start to have text on the table and that is what we should push for with the momentum that can be created in New York next week. And then a final point: I also hope that the message will come clearly through that it is essential that all parties, particularly the big emitters, present no later than the first quarter of 2015 their contributions: what they intend to do. Why is that important? Because we need time, prior to Paris, to see whether the combined global effort will be enough to make us stay below the two degrees. That is basically what Paris should be all about and that must be the ambition level that we have for Paris.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 401, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Peter Liese", "mepid": "1927", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and for the way in which he has been rapporteur for her excellent Before I come to the Ban Ki-moon Summit, I would like to begin by thanking Connie Hedegaard. This may be the last plenary debate she is taking part in here in the European Parliament. I would like to express my sincere thanks for your work. I have often heard that the last five years have not been so easy for climate protection. That is certainly true. But anyone who says it was up to the Commissioner should imagine what would have happened if we had had a less committed, not so strong Commissioner. So thank you very much, Connie, for your dedicated work. You have kept climate protection alive in the European Union and around the world. It was a great achievement in difficult times. The next 15 months will be crucial for progress in the global fight against climate change. This week's summit will be a first step. But, for all the importance, we should not expect too much. The big solution, of course, will not come on Friday. We must continue to work gradually. I would like to support everything that has been said by the President-in-Office of the Council and Connie Hedegaard, and I would add that next year's G7 process will also play an important role in this context. When we talk about climate protection, many people think primarily of renewable energies. Renewable energy is also important in my view. I had a conversation last week with the chairman of Europe's electricity producers, Eurelectric. He has said he also believes that renewables will be cost-effective and competitive in a few years' time. But at the moment we still have a big cost problem. That is why we should all work even harder together on energy efficiency. I would also like to express my thanks to Jean-Claude Juncker here in plenary for his commitment to the new Commission: at least 30% energy efficiency binding.

I think Ban Ki-moon’s initiative in New York has the opportunity to engage the imagination of the public in a much more meaningful way. I look forward to that, because I think it could have real political influence. Of course, all the parties present in New York are already committed to agreeing a new global and legally-binding deal by COP 21 in Paris. In the ECR, we recognise that developed countries need to take a leading role in the reduction of emissions, but we have always questioned the sense of forging too far ahead too quickly with unilateral action. That action may disadvantage the EU economy without any real impact on greenhouse gas emissions. This has been a constant theme in the five years I have been in this Parliament. At times, it has seemed that the EU really has been acting alone. I know people talk about that as leadership, but there is another way of looking at that, which is isolation. I am pleased to say that I think this rather lonely position seems to be changing. I am delighted that this meeting is actually taking place in New York in the United States. I think it is fitting as a venue as we see at long last some real and meaningful action from the US Government. The US Government’s climate power plan is a real step forward, and I really do welcome that this summer. China – that other giant economic power – is committed to implementing a carbon market by 2020, along with tangible targets for emissions reductions. So I think the news is becoming more optimistic. This is the context for Ban Ki-moon’s meeting in New York. As I understand it, the climate summit will concentrate on highlighting the benefits of taking action, not just the cataclysmic Armageddon-style warnings, but looking at the real positives for the future of climate action. For too long we have been lectured and hectored about our obligations. It is high time that the tone was changed and that the moral high ground ceded to a spirit of true global cooperation and recognition of mutual benefits. We just need to look at the energy market as an example of where those two issues have become juxtaposed, I think to the benefit of us all.

It normally takes quite some pressure to get difficult political decisions and we must wonder how much additional pressure is still needed to finally take necessary measures in the field of climate. Scientific evidence is one, of course, and last week we saw the World Meteorological Report, which stated that CO2 concentrations are at the moment the highest ever. So, all the steps taken so far have been very small steps compared to what is still needed. Unfortunately climate change is still strengthening its grip on our planet. An alarming element of last week’s report is that oceans and forests are losing their capacity to absorb CO2 and that is really alarming. So, there is sufficient pressure to take bold measures, I would say, in these kind of reports. ‘But what about our economy?’ people say. Yes, well, let us look at it from an economic angle. Future costs due to climate change are astronomical and today’s new climate economy report shows that the road to a low carbon economy does not have to hurt the economy. Every economist should be in favour of ambitious climate policy. How much and what kind of pressure is further needed to have a positive outcome at the European Council meeting in October? I would say three ambitious and binding targets is what we need. The Parliament has endorsed that and the idea is gaining ground in the Juncker Commission.

I do hope that world leaders will do what UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has invited them to do next week, which is to bring bold announcements and actions that will reduce emissions, strengthen climate resilience and mobilise political will for an ambitious legally-binding agreement in 2015. We truly need a meaningful global agreement in 2015, and we must make progress in Lima. There is only one COP conference before the Paris Agreement, so pressure is mounting. Are we all on track, preparing our national commitments? Are our joint ambitions sufficient to make real progress in Paris?

So we are now promising eight years of stagnation as an EU for the rest of the world. What exactly are we going to promise after 2020? We are talking about minus 40%, but if you look at the negotiations now, we are going to take some rights from emissions trading after 2020 and from non-ETS sectors, all to make those minus 40% mainly a paper reality, but in reality this will not be anything.

This position should be reviewed on the basis of the need to guarantee the european Union's energy security and ensure the competitiveness of the Union's economies. The Union's non-reflective policy of dismantling the coal industry is self-harming and has the direct effect of making Europe completely dependent on focused supplies from the east. The direct effect of decarbonising eu economies is to increase the unemployment rate, which is the cause of severe social consequences.

Not only did it reduce its emissions, but it has liquidated its financial commitments with developing countries so that they, in turn, are part of the global effort to reduce those same emissions. The reality leads us to increasingly believe that the need for the involvement of our external partners in this process is crucial, in a context where the European Union accounts for a d-least share of global emissions. Underlying climate negotiations are two conflicting development models: one that remains stuck in the past and the other facing the future. The present economic context has made the transition between these two models much more difficult. The truth is that globalisation results in part from the competitiveness of industry, resulting in a loss of competitiveness of European industry vis-à-vis our external partners when they acquire advantages through environmental dumping. However, the current costs of investing in research, innovation and the reconversion of our productive resources, as well as into a societal model, are much lower than future environmental costs if nothing is done. As Europeans we will always be in a good position to take advantage of the economic opportunities that green growth offers.

Indeed, Europe is hypocritical. On the one hand, our economies are being imposed repressive and costly environmental policies in the name of global warming, and on the other hand, we are promoting globalized trade that is completely disastrous for our jobs and whose carbon footprint, to reason like you, is catastrophic. What environmental policies do, liberal policies do, defeat it. In fact, to take an example, when you import a toaster made in China, you not only have to transfer the raw materials to China, process them in factories that often have an energy efficiency three times lower than ours, but also re-export the finished product to Europe. The question is: how many trees do you need to plant to offset the carbon footprint of the manufacture and import of this toaster? So I ask myself the following question: is Europe, in pursuing this liberal policy, not really seeking to relocate pollution at the same time as jobs? When you go to the New York summit to demand that developing countries reduce their carbon emissions, remember that these countries produce pollution to produce cheaply the goods we import. So we have to stop the pretences.  Europe, at the New York climate summit, can show what its real priorities are. Either save both the climate and our jobs, or pursue unbridled and destructive free trade. We have to stop covering our faces. The climate objective and widespread free trade are totally incompatible.  That is why we advocate, for our part, the development of short circuits and localism, because only this mode of production and distribution will significantly reduce the energy balance and the carbon footprint of freight transport.

My view is that climate change must be better prevented, but not that our main mechanism is to relocate production to other countries or to trade in emissions, as this does not help either the economy or the environment. I am in favour of supporting more strongly low-carbon and green economies that create new jobs, protect the social security of employees and protect the environment. Better prevented than treated, it's an old folk proverb. We should listen to the people and already take concrete measures so that tomorrow is not too late for us, our children, our planet.

Of course, the UN summit is a valuable opportunity to immediately relaunch the urgent need for decisive decisions for a global policy to combat climate change. We must tell ourselves, the European Union has always played a leading role in climate policies, a role that will have to be reiterated in the new Climate 2030 package and which I hope the new Commission will love to interpret. It is also because what many speakers have said before me is true: promoting a low-emission society is not only the way to combine environmental protection, but also to set up and promote new industrial policies, to relaunch the competitiveness of our economies and also to create new jobs. But we have to be serious. The European effort alone is not enough, because then it becomes a zero-sum game for Europe. We, the fight against climate change, must do so with a global agreement, but unfortunately it has not yet been achieved.

In New York, there may be good food for 25 or 28 heads of government, but there are no jobs there. This will only be the case if the EU continues to increase its competitiveness.

I have already stressed it, but President Barroso will address the plenary, and he will do so as the first speaker in that plenary. That also says something about how the world perceives Europe’s role in international climate change. He will also bring messages – not only on our 2030 intentions and what we are planning to do and hopefully adopt by October – but he will also bring messages on financing and other key issues. He will also focus on what will come from the EU budget when it comes to international climate finance. I will, of course, also be there and will be participating in some of the thematic groups, while Commissioners Cioloş and Piebalgs will attend different side events. We will therefore have a strong representation there. Furthermore, 19 EU Heads of State and Government and of course the Italian Presidency will also be present. I must say that I am confident that the EU’s contribution on that day will help the UN Secretary-General to make the strongest possible résumé by the end of the day, with a view to pushing forward to Lima and from there on to Paris.  We also have a lot of other things planned on the sidelines of this major event. There is a major economic forum taking place, and the European Union has invited our good friends and allies from Durban. We will have a meeting of the progressive countries. A lot of things will take place that will, together, hopefully create momentum.  Mr Pargneaux asked about the Green Climate Fund and how it is that we – that is, the Commission – cannot pay money through a fund where we are not on the board. As far as I have understood it, it is an established practice, which is also accepted and endorsed by the European Parliament, that Community money can only be spent through international institutions if we actually have first-hand knowledge of how this money will be spent. That is a guarantee to European taxpayers. That is why, but it definitely does not mean that we will not give a lot of money to international climate finance through the EU Community budget, and this will also be made very clear in President Barroso’s speech.  Now, just one comment: I know that Mr Helmer has gone and I know that, even if he had been here, I would not be able to persuade him about climate change. But there is one thing I simply do not understand: how is it that efforts to reduce Europe’s energy dependency be blamed for rising energy prices in Europe? It could be that one of the reasons why we have higher energy prices in Europe than in other regions is that we have to import around 60% of our energy, meaning that today we are spending around EUR 400 billion each year. This is money that we send out of Europe to pay for our imported fossil fuels. Of those EUR 400 billion, EUR 140 billion is sent to Putin’s Russia. That is almost EUR 3 billion each week. Maybe that could also be an argument for European citizens being interested in knowing where their money is going.  Finally, thank you very much for the many kind words. I would like to reciprocate them by thanking many of you for the good cooperation over the years. I sincerely do hope that this new Parliament will help my successor to keep climate change high on the Commissions agenda, as well as on the EU’s agenda as a whole – including on our growth and economic agenda, which is where it really belongs. I really do believe that the world needs a strong European climate policy, and that it has to be very visible in the run-up to Paris next year.

The Committee on International Trade (INTA) immediately received the full text, and it will be made public shortly. Canada is the first G8 member with whom we have agreed on a comprehensive trade deal. The agreement is crucial for the credibility of our trade agenda, because it confirms that we can do deals – even very good deals – in this case with a developed economy with its own established approach and regulatory framework. Hence the challenging times during the negotiations. The agreement is also very valuable in its own right; it creates opportunities for our business. Canada offers a sizeable market for European products and services. The operators get the same treatment, which is even better than that received by US competitors. This is an important achievement, sustaining our quest for more jobs and growth in Europe when you consider the uncertain economic backdrop on our continent. Politically, Canada is an important ally. It is also an important destination for European investments, and it also invests massively in the EU, creating jobs and wealth. Canada is rich in natural resources and raw materials and is a significant source of know-how. In short, through CETA, both sides will eliminate almost all customs tariffs (with very few exceptions). At the same time, a few very sensitive agricultural products will remain protected. The outcome concerning services and investment market access puts us on an even better footing than the US under NAFTA. It will also in no way affect the ability of EU governments at all levels to provide and subsidise public services. We have also achieved an unprecedented result on public procurement. Under CETA we receive significant access to public procurement markets in Canada at all levels of government. On investment, the agreement establishes a system that sets a new standard for investor-to-state dispute settlement procedures. We are well aware of the concerns that exist. This agreement directly addresses all the concerns that have emerged so far. Also I want to highlight the result on geographical indications. We have achieved very extensive protection in Canada of the designations of Europe’s high-quality agricultural products, be they Parmigiano Reggiano, Schwarzwälder Schinken, Bleu d’Auvergne or 132 others which are fully protected. This is one of the parts which most visibly show how CETA can also benefit small and medium-sized operators across Europe. The EU-Canada trade and investment relationship will not come at the expense of environmental or social and labour standards. We are both aware that we have a responsibility here. We have a higher standard in trade agreements, and it is more than Canada has done before. In terms of what happens next, President Barroso and the Canadian Prime Minister, Mr Harper, intend to publicly announce the conclusion of the negotiations at the EU-Canada Summit in Ottawa on 26 September. Further to this, both sides will submit this text to their respective legislators for verification and ratification. In the case of the EU this means to the Council and Parliament. Because legal verification and official translations take so long, I would expect signature and formal transmission of the text to Parliament to take place well into 2015. Coming this far, at a pace which has been punishing for those involved, is an important achievement which the Commission is proud of, and I look forward to this legislator’s support for CETA’s contribution to the creation of more jobs and growth in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 453, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Salvatore Cicu", "mepid": "124854", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, we must not Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the aspects that have been mentioned by the Commissioner are important, particularly as regards the expectations that were there on this agreement. A troubled agreement, an agreement which logically raised the problem of transparency, raised the problem of protecting our small and medium-sized enterprises, but posed the problem of opening up a large market.  I believe that we have done an excellent job, and we have done an excellent job, particularly on the process of involving small and medium-sized enterprises. With the protection of geographical indications, an important result is achieved which sees one hundred and twenty-five of the one hundred and forty-five PGIs being protected, guaranteed and placed in a context, in an important international market. I would like to make a comment, however, on this point. I think it is important for each Member State to be invited to provide instruments, to give a leading role, to accompany a process of participation by small and medium-sized enterprises which, precisely because of their size and characteristics, are not capable of achieving in precise and concrete terms an immediate capacity to understand these rules, these schemes and these agreements. So, in order for there to be a production of effects, for there to be real automatism, we must, together with each Member State, realize the possibility that there will be a tutor, that there will be a trustworthiness, a reliability of financial and economic support. We are in a time of crisis, we are in a time where the small and medium closes, we are in a time where the suburbs are left alone to try to understand how to overcome this problem. I therefore believe that the agreement reached is important, but I believe that it is not enough, I believe that it is necessary that with sensitivity, with vision, we give dimension to this role of opening up the market to a Europe that needs, in its small and medium term, to find dignity, to find the capacity, to find an outlet that can certainly be achieved, because I would add, moreover – and it must be stressed – that the list of geographical indications is not closed. , the list of geographical indications still has the possibility, in addition to having Parmigiano Reggiano to have, for example – I come from Sardinia – Sardinian pecorino cheese and Pecorino Romano.  Therefore, my commitment – and I will also ask my other Sardinian colleagues – will be to include other protections, other geographical identities, other possibilities and opportunities for territories that need today, compared to a system that is suffering, to finally find a different outlet.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 454, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "David Martin", "mepid": "1403", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. –  Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner, for being with us this evening. On CETA, I really have more questions than comments that I wish to put to you tonight. Firstly, it is strongly rumoured that the Council is not going to initial this text. I may be wrong, but I think this is the first time that the Council has not initialled a text at the end of the negotiations. I would be interested to know if that is for political reasons, or if it has objections to the text, or if the Council does not regard the text as having been concluded. If indeed it does not regard the text as having been concluded, is there a possibility that investor state disputes could still come out of the CETA-negotiated text? As you know, Commissioner, my group would find it much easier to put its weight behind CETA if ISDS was removed from the text. We also have concerns in my group about generic medicines. We did hear from the chief negotiator in the Committee on International Trade, who gave me some reassurances, but I would like to hear from you tonight, Commissioner, that the CETA agreement will do nothing to limit Canadian production of generic medicines for the developing world. We also believe that the sustainable development chapter in CETA could be improved. And we also have issues regarding non-trade irritants, such as the seal ban, the visa-free travel that is denied to some EU citizens, and the issue of tar sands. Again, although they are separate from the trade deal, we would like to hear the Commission say that it is still working on solving these issues outside of the CETA negotiations. Just to be absolutely clear, though – just like the Commissioner, just as was outlined on the list – I see many positives in CETA, not least the issue of GIs, not least the opportunities for small and medium-sized industries, not least the access that dairy products are being given to the market and the beneficial access that spirits will be given to this market. These are all good news. However, we have certain principles in our group. We understand that trade negotiations mean that compromises have to be made on both sides, but there are certain things that we will not compromise on.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 455, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Ruža Tomašić", "mepid": "119431", "text": "  On behalf of the ECR Club– Madam President, at this session we have already considered the negative effects of the chilling relations with Russia. While I fear that the latest bans from Russia on agricultural and food products are not the last we will see from Putin, this example nevertheless makes it clear how damaging the closure of one major market can be for our products and services. But despite the alarming situation in trade relations with Russia, the European Union has a fantastic opportunity to finally improve its relationship with another major world state and tempting market - Canada. Under this treaty, Canada will open its public procurement market to European suppliers for the first time, and the expected 23% increase in exchanges of goods and services should lead to a 23% reduction in unemployment and annual gains for the EU of more than €10 billion. This is great news for Europe, which at the moment is in a bad way in need of new partners on the global stage. I understand reservations about ISDS, safeguards, but I don't consider them well-founded. Nine Member States have an ISDS instrument in their bilateral investment agreements with the United States, including Croatia. To my knowledge, there have been no problems so far to conclude that such an instrument is harmful to Member States. ISDS strikes a balance between the right and the state's need to regulate the market and investors' right to be protected from possible willfulness or discriminatory behaviour by national governments towards foreign investors. ISDS does not favour foreign capital before national sovereignty, as those who fear the application of this instrument think, but simply ensures respect for international law.  I believe that you will agree with me that the role of national government is not in opposition to profit, but indeed, ensuring a level playing field it participates in its creation. Through the ISDS instrument, private investors are guaranteed that national governments will actually fulfil their role, making the European market safer and thus even more desirable for foreign investment.

Congratulations on the results for Europe, but also for Canada. I hope this can be a true win-win. In all the complexities and controversies, we should not forget why we engage in trade negotiations at all. Our goals are clear: we seek economic growth and the creation of jobs for Europeans, especially as Russia has reacted to the much-needed EU sanctions for its aggression in our Eastern Neighbourhood. The best way we can alleviate the impact of the damage to European businesses and farmers is by facilitating exports and market access elsewhere in the world. Market access through procurement is an important accomplishment in the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) and, by and large, the standards in relation to the planet, privacy and food safety have not been traded away. That is important. More controversial, however, is the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanism. EU Member States have no less than 1400 bilateral agreements that include ISDS, and while the mechanism was sought after by Europeans investing in countries where the rule of law does not exist, it is now leading to controversy. In the CETA, I see that some improvements have been realised, such as the inclusion of provisions to increase the impartiality of arbitration judges and to provide more transparency and better protection against frivolous cases, but still the key question of whether or not we need ISDS between two mature democracies with the rule of law should be answered. This question is relevant not only for the CETA: many of us look at the text of this agreement with the anticipation of finding clues for the much more impactful \t currently in negotiation.

A chapter is crucial regardless of your political beliefs, since it is about justice. This text that we have received provides for the establishment of private justice between multinationals and states in place of public justice. This is the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism. This private court is made up of an arbitration tribunal that can be referred when a multinational based in France, for example, considers that the new laws, the new standards are unfavourable to its activity. The State will no longer be able to enforce the French people's social choices, their collective preferences, it must first take into account the interests of multinationals before making a decision.  For example, the Canadian government is being attacked in this private court by an oil company that accuses it of having a moratorium on shale gas. The private court is before us, Canada could be convicted for trying to protect its groundwater and the health of its inhabitants.

To be honest, I do not understand why, when Parliament receives the text on 6 August, you have still not published this text and have just said that you will do so in a few days' time. I believe that, in order to have a rational discussion among the population, the texts must be published quickly so that everyone has the opportunity to look in and know what it actually says. My second point is that there will certainly be some very positive elements that I saw at the first review – with regard to geographical indicators, with regard to the agricultural sector, with regard to market access, there is no question at all. However, we also have a few question marks about services of general interest and also the question of how the standstill clause actually affects the development of services, particularly in the case of re-municipalisation. We will have to analyse this in detail. The third point, Commissioner, is indeed the question of ISDS, the investment protection mechanism. I am not sure that such an instrument can still be tackled today. It was once thought of as a safeguard against insecure states, which then carry out undemocratic expropriations.

Local producers will derive some hope from the arrangements on cheese, and producers with recognised geographical indications (GIs) will be delighted with the increased quotas, and with the protection of the vast majority of other GIs.

Concluding an agreement with Canada makes ample sense because Canada, of all non-European countries, is probably closest to us in terms of culture, language, law and politics and, while this agreement took five long years, I think we have reached a reasonable agreement at the end of the day. There are difficulties, which have been highlighted, but on balance we can support it, while at the same time expressing our reservations. For that reason I have written to the Commission to express my concern on the treatment of beef products under the quota system for non-hormone-treated high-quality Canadian beef exported to the EU. I welcome the recognition that beef is a sensitive sector. Our beef sector is characterised by small-scale, environment-friendly production on permanent grassland, in an extensive manner based on the family farm model, which is a unique European social structure predominant in my constituency of Ireland South as in other areas in Europe. I believe the Commission was not alert to the distinction between high-quality cuts of beef, such as steaks, and lower-quality cuts. It is my assertion that more restrictive quotas should be placed on the high-quality cuts, as the current quota plan could permit Canadian exports to flood EU markets with high-quality steak at sensitive times of the year such as the barbecue season, undermining the EU sector. Nevertheless, I am prepared to vote in favour of this agreement because of one redeeming factor – the review clause. If, as I expect, there are difficulties, they can be reviewed and this can be taken into account when it comes to negotiating the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) agreement with the USA, because the TTIP could not be modelled on what is here in relation to beef. That would multiply the problems seven times over, as has been outlined in the study carried out by Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture.

The golden rule is that whoever has the gold makes the rules. That is what he said. I actually laughed about it at the time and didn't really take it seriously.  Now, when I look at what is happening with Canada, but also with the United States, I am not sure that I should laugh about it, because I am starting to get scared that it might actually happen. I really want you to understand that European social democracy not only has serious concerns about this ISDS, but that we see this as a threat to democracy and the rule of law, as a possibility exclusively for large investors, for large corporations, to evade state jurisdiction. There are examples of how this happens. Moreover, as a way for large corporations to influence state democratic processes differently from ordinary voters. We do not want and cannot accept that.

If ISDS remains in CETA it is a step closer to corporations writing our laws instead of governments, and the UK Government, to its shame, supports CETA as it stands.

As a result of this agreement, trade is expected to increase by EUR 26 billion. More trade means more investment and jobs. By strengthening our economic ties with Canada, we will infuse new powers into our economies as well as our competitiveness.  Colleagues, however, I would like to draw attention to one important aspect and it is that access to canada's market must be equal for the whole European Union, and for this the remaining visa restrictions for some member states, including Bulgaria and Romania, should be lifted. Our close partnership with the US and Canada implies a visa-free regime for all European citizens. This, Commissioner, should happen soon.  Canada's energy and raw materials resources could be a useful alternative for Europe. In the context of what is happening on our eastern borders, I am convinced that we need to deepen the North Atlantic partnership in the energy sphere as well.

However, Mr Leichtfried, I think you will sleep well. The first question came from Mr Martin: why does the Council not initial this agreement, whereas it would have done so for all others? The Council never initials an agreement. It has never done so. The procedure is that it is the Commission which initials an agreement after the legal scrubbing process, and the legal scrubbing has not yet been done. So what President Barroso and Prime Minister Harper will announce at the EU-Canada Summit will be the conclusion of the negotiations. That is the simple answer to your question. In relation to generic medicines, I can give you an assurance that we are not going to change the arrangements – not only those with Canada but also those with other countries. Take, for example, the negotiations with India that are not yet concluded: there too we have taken the approach that trade in generic medicines should not be hampered. On the non-trade issues, like the EU seals ban and tar sands, we have decided that it is up to the World Trade Organisation to decide. That was probably a sign of wisdom to a certain degree. With regard to the mandate, and to public consultation, I would like to make it very clear that we were asked to discuss and come to an agreement on ISDS – but I will return to that later. Mr Mineur and some other Members also said that this would only be an agreement for big companies and not one for SMEs. However, big companies do not need free trade agreements; the companies that need free trade agreements are the SMEs, because what you are really doing with this type of deep and comprehensive free trade agreement is giving them a new home market. That is what you are effectively doing, so the assertion is certainly not true. Mr Jadot and Mr Lange put a number of questions concerning access to the agreement. This is very simple: as soon as the negotiations were concluded we sent the outcome to Parliament, to you and your fellow Members, Mr Lange, and to the Member States. The text of the CETA will also be published: at this moment, both sides are coordinating their preparations, which include preparing a version for the visually impaired, as well as some minor editing, and the publication date should not be far from that of next week’s summit. It is very simple, we are not hiding anything, although I am not sure whether many citizens are waiting to read this agreement during the autumn nights. I have my doubts about that. If I could give you some advice, I would not read it! Even with some editing it is very dry stuff. Ms Beghin was afraid that citizens were not aware of the text. Ms Le Pen – who was here with many supporters but has now disappeared – asked you, for once, to vote in the right direction. She asks that all the time and I can only conclude that you are not following her advice, so maybe sooner or later you should explain why. Mr Kelly had a question on the quota system but I see that he too has disappeared. Everybody is leaving: perhaps it is because I am speaking for too long. With regard to the quota system and high quality cuts: there is differentiation between high quality and other cuts – very clear differentiation – and we know the difference. These are separate markets and you have to take that into account. Then there was a question by Ms Arena on whether we are going to change social, environmental and other norms and standards. Of course we are not, and you will not change them by discussing them. Changing those standards, Ms Arena, is a matter solely for yourselves in the European Parliament. With regard to the Citizens’ Initiative, a citizens’ initiative allows citizens to ask the Commission to use its powers to propose the adoption of legislation – it could, for instance, call on the Commission to propose concluding an agreement with a third country – but it does not cover requests to EU institutions not to do something, for example to stop negotiating a trade agreement such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), or not to sign or conclude an agreement such as CETA once the negotiations have ended. The matter is then in the hands of Parliament and the Council. For that reason the request not to conclude the CETA agreement and to stop the on-going TTIP negotiations has been considered inadmissible. The criteria on which the Commission’s decision here was based are purely legal criteria. I understand that you are going to oppose this and, of course, it is your right to do so. Now on ISDS – if I have some more speaking time, Mr President, because I have hundreds of questions on this and I understand this is what is keeping everybody awake – I will try to give an answer. Let me start by saying that in its April 2011 resolution on the future European international investment policy, the resolution in the Arif report which was adopted by a very large majority including the S&amp;D in response to the Commission’s communication on investments, Parliament did call for the inclusion of ISDS procedures in EU investment agreements by calling for measures to ensure there would be no abuses of the system. That is the starting point of my reasoning. The same goes for the mandate we received from the Council of Ministers. It is stated explicitly in that mandate, which was adopted unanimously, that we should go for an ISDS agreement. I do not know exactly why, but all of a sudden this has become the overriding issue when it comes to trade. Many Members have mentioned the public consultation, showing apparently that the whole of the European population is thinking along those lines. We will come next week, or in a couple of weeks, with the first analysis of the public consultation results. What it shows is that more than 50 000 out of 150 000 answers are identical. Normally, you have to get into the system; you have to answer 12 questions and then submit your answers. However, these respondents have found a way – I do not understand anything about the technicalities – to circumvent this and give an answer without getting into the system, and that of course makes it very easy to get 50 000 identical answers. You could have 500 000 – why not? Then there are another 50 000 who are simply saying ‘we are against’. But we will look into all the answers, and if there are interesting elements there we will certainly take them into account. Now, is the CETA a blueprint for the TTIP or any other EU agreements? I prefer to think that the CETA (along with the agreement with Singapore by the way) is more than a blueprint: that it marks a turning point in the European approach on investment protection. It demonstrates beyond any doubt that the Commission is generally committed to reforming the system. Let me cite a few of the novelties and unique improvements achieved in the CETA. First, there is explicit reference to the capacity of states to regulate in the public interest. Second, there is a precise definition of investment protection standards to prevent abusive interpretations. Third, there is full transparency in ISDS: all hearings are open, all documents are public, interested parties can make submissions. By the way, this goes much further than any proceedings in a commercial court. In a commercial court the only thing that is open is the judgment. You cannot get access to the parties’ files. There are many lawyers in the House – though not many tonight of course – and they know that you cannot dig into the file of the other party. You simply cannot do that. The judgment will be much more transparent here. It is the first ever agreement incorporating binding rules on ethics and arbitrators of conduct. There are strict controls on cost, and the ‘loser pays’ principle has been introduced, making sure that investors bringing spurious claims pay the cost. We have agreed that an appellate body will be established, based largely on the WTO appellate body practice, and this is the most effective way to create consistency in arbitration decisions, make arbitrators accountable and ensure predictability. There are many other improvements in the CETA and it is not excluded that further improvements of the EU’s approach in other negotiations are possible. One has to be clear, however, that the CETA and the TTIP negotiations are different. The CETA text has already been agreed with Canada. By contrast, the Commission has launched a public consultation to receive the views of stakeholders, and especially of citizens, on the TTIP. Analyses of the replies received in the consultation will inform decisively the EU position on the TTIP. So I can confirm that the CETA is not a blueprint for the TTIP, just as I can confirm that the process of reform of the system, to which the EU is committed, is a one-way street. There is no going back. What we have tried to improve in the CETA will only be further improved in future negotiations. Several Members put the question: why do we need ISDS in a CETA between countries with solid, mature judicial systems. The issue is more one of enforcement, however, than of the standard of maturity of the legal system per se. We need to make sure that EU investors can enforce their rights because the CETA would not be enforceable in Canadian domestic courts. It would not be enforceable there – as you probably know, Mr Leichtfried – because they have a dualist approach whereas we have a monist approach. Any trade agreements, including any guarantees on investment protection, signed by the EU with a third country, whether it be Canada or Singapore, would not be automatically enforceable by the domestic courts of either partner, and, under Canada’s consistent practice, domestic courts cannot give effect to international treaties. Secondly, the presence of a solid legal system does not mean the absence of problems for investors. The Energy Charter Treaty already applies between many countries with developed legal systems. Also, the EU Member States themselves have numerous bilateral investment treaties. According to recent figures from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), of the 271 cases registered between 2008 and 2013, 15% – that is 40 cases – are intra-EU cases: ISDS cases initiated by investors from an EU Member State against another EU Member State. We have proposed, by the way, having a different rule within the European Union, but many Member States – including yours, Mr Lange – refused to have different arrangements in respect of other Member States of the European Union. Thirdly, there are several imbalances on the policy side that we need to address: currently eight Member States have bilateral investment treaties with Canada and this means that only investors from those Member States are protected in Canada, while others are not. Finally, the CETA offers an opportunity for us to introduce reforms to the ISDS system. It could pave the way for a new era of investment agreements and serve as a model for the rest of the world, and that is a very important argument. I remember well a public meeting in Berlin, in which the Vice-Chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, participated and there was a very lively discussion – the kind of discussion I like. (That is why I have been doing politics for 35 years, by the way!) At the end, Mr Gabriel said there might be some positive elements in the agreement: for example, the fact that it is difficult to refuse ISDS clauses with the United States or with Canada and to ask for them with China. We have to set a template for the rest of the world, and I hope that Parliament too, in the course of the discussions on this agreement, will understand that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 488, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Der Präsident. -", "mepid": "2323", "text": "  Thank you very much, Commissioner.

The exclusion of discrimination is one of these, which is why I call for the inclusion in the agreement of the firm commitment to the abolition of visas still imposed on The Canadian side by Romanian citizens and other new EU Member States, in accordance with the European Parliament resolution of September 2013 on the establishment of the visa reciprocity clause.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 490, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Pavel Poc (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "96715", "text": "  Writing. – The EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) is a generally positively accepted agreement aimed at providing opportunities for economic growth and increasing employment on both sides of the Atlantic.

CETA also proposes the ISDS mechanism as a mechanism for resolving investment disputes. But here, too, it is relevant to ask, to whom will this mechanism actually benefit?

Just so they can make an imaginary \"pipe\" on the task of making a trade deal? In both cases, the incorporation of the ISDS mechanism is a requirement of the other party, not the EU. The task of the European Parliament and MEPs is to ensure that the activities of the European Union are in line with the interests of citizens. Non-transparent arbitrations made possible by the ISDS mechanism are clearly not in the interest of citizens.

MEPs, but also civil society, must be more involved in these far-reaching projects. Another point is the investment protection clauses with their out-of-state dispute settlement procedures (ISDS). I take a critical view of them, as they limit the political room for manoeuvre for the future at the expense of their own people. Canada and the EU have a highly developed rule of law and legal culture, and property protection and national equality are sufficiently enshrined in the legal system.

The Commission is committed to helping Member States respond to this challenge. This commitment was highlighted in the Commission’s communication of April this year on effective and resilient health systems, which, among other things, focused on increasing accessibility to health systems. The communication stressed the need for improved cooperation, ‘increased transparency and better coordination to minimise any unintended effects that current national pricing systems may have in terms of accessibility throughout the EU’. At the Health Council in June, the French delegation raised the specific issue of the new improved hepatitis C treatments which have recently received marketing authorisation in the European Union, expressing concerns in relation to achieving equitable access to these treatments. Tomorrow Member States’ experts will meet to discuss the new improved hepatitis C treatments. There will be a follow-up meeting with Member States’ competent authorities next month to discuss pricing and reimbursement. Of course, the discussion on the impact of prices on the affordability of medicines for public payers and patients goes far beyond the specific case of hepatitis C treatments. The Commission is therefore looking forward to the debate planned by the Italian Presidency on therapeutic innovation at next week’s informal Council of Health Ministers. The outcome of this debate will help inform the new Commission about the interest of Member States in continuing an EU debate on the affordability of innovative health products. As regards support to research and development, the Commission is hopeful that the ongoing Innovative Medicines Initiative will help speed up the development of better and safer medicines. EU pharmaceutical legislation contains a number of tools to facilitate early access to medicines for patients with unmet medical needs. In addition, in terms of success in helping the development and the placing on the market of medicines for rare and life-threatening diseases, the Commission has already authorised 106 of such innovative treatments. The Commission has, however, no competence to regulate the level of prices of medicinal treatments. These are determined by Member States individually. Thus there can be no price caps imposed by the Commission. However, the Commission can offer help, for example, by pursuing improved exchanges of information among Member States on their pricing policies with a view to minimising negative effects on the accessibility of medicines in the EU. Another way in which the Commission could assist would be by further exploring the use of the joint procurement mechanism to obtain more advantageous price offers from the pharmaceutical industry.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 497, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Miroslav Mikolášik", "mepid": "28178", "text": "  for the PPE Group. – This debate in plenary in Strasbourg at this late evening should galvany us into a high-quality debate, but above all tangible results. Today, we are talking about a person, a patient who is in great urgent need of his medication. Access to life-saving medicines is, after all, a topic of debate today. The fate of millions of patients, whether in Slovakia, Finland, Ireland, Italy, anywhere, lies at my heart not only because, as a doctor, I have also seen people die and I know from my former medical practice on the life-saving ward of a hospital how important it is to have the necessary quality medicines available and not only in the reanimation unit, but also in all hospital wards and, above all, that the patient with a serious illness has a real , real access to medicines. Medicines that are and will be affordable, in its social situation and income levels, and will also be of high quality and full availability. There is still inequality in access to the necessary medicines, which is partly due to the different levels of health funding in the various Member States, which is then reflected in the price of medicines, to different prices and to the constant increase in pharmaceutical expenditure, and the high price of medicines persists, partly because new technologies are costly. On the other hand, pharmaceutical companies that develop a new drug should not abuse their exclusive position and then drive the price of medicines to intolerable levels. It's unethical and immoral. Between 2000 and 2009, public spending on medicines increased by an average of up to 76% in EU countries. This expenditure on medicines is growing faster than the GDP of the Member States. At the same time, it should be borne in mind that there is an ageing population in the Member States, in other words there are more pensioners and the ever-dwinding price of newly-used medicines. In this context, it should be systemically allowed that the same molecule in the field of generics can be made available to patients as soon as possible and at a disproportionately lower price.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 498, "date": "2014-09-16.json", "name": "Biljana Borzan", "mepid": "112748", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D.

When a drug appears on the market that provides a 100% cure, I am sure that there is no doctor who wants to choose between the well-being of the patient and savings in the health budget. If we talk about the cost of health care, in this case an expensive drug that fully treats hepatitis, I ask the question: how much does society cost all hospitalizations that without cure this man will experience, all diagnostics, how much does all therapy cost, absenteeism and of course the most important thing how much does human life cost? It bothers me when billions of euros are spent on bailing out banks, and when it comes to medicine everyone is worried about costs. But on the other hand, I am aware that we need to think responsibly about a sustainable health system. Therefore, one possible solution, when it comes to expensive drugs, is to pay pharmaceutical companies from public funds only when there is a cure.  Furthermore, there is a possibility to shorten the duration of patent rights because when it expires the price of the drug falls rapidly.

Let me use this area of debate and responsibility which is the European Parliament to bring to the fore the indispensable priority of our work, which is to serve the general interest. What epidemic nature must a pathology acquire in order to be considered a 'public health crisis'? Are the 130 million hepatitis C patients in the world, 10 million of them in the European Union, enough in Spain alone?  Hepatitis C is an infectious disease that, when chronicted, becomes disabling and devastating. It's deadly in half a million cases a year. But now there's a cure. And that cure comes at a price. An unbeatable price of more than 50 000 euros per patient and treatment, fixed by the company that owns the sofosbuvir patent, taking into account only market criteria. Are we going to resign ourselves, again, to making excuses justifying European institutional paralysis? Are we just going to regret the fatality of corporate profit? I don't think so, ladies and gentlemen. I believe that we can act and that there are tools. Member States may implement Article 31 of the 2001 Doha Declaration, promoted by the World Trade Organization; they can issue a compulsory licence for \"public health need\" and manufacture a generic. They may also legally oppose the patent, as India has already done, as the molecule was previously patented against cancer. Or they can negotiate the joint transfer payment of the patent. Or, of course, choose to form a block and make aggregated public purchases. Egypt today imports the Indian generic sofosbuvir at a price 100 times lower. Another 90 developing countries will also benefit from India's decision. Can the Commission and this House commit themselves to promoting a common position to defend the general interest and compliance with the Treaties?

Mr President, the problem of the over-costing of medicines by pharmaceutical companies, which are intended to make over-profits at the expense of the health of citizens and at the expense of insurance funds, is real. But it's not the only barrier to access to the necessary medications. In fact, the competent bodies of the European Union not only do not care about over-costing, but also consciously promote policies of restrictions on public health spending that make it even more difficult for patients to access medicines. In the worst situation of all, there are countries under a memorandum regime, where the Troika pursues policies of violent poverty, with the result that patients are unable to pay their contribution to pharmaceutical costs and mortality increases. In Greece, deaths from 108 000 in 2009 increased to 117 000 in 2012, precisely as a result of this troika criminal policy. The European Commission ...

Mr President, we are still in a rather serious situation. I have listened to your proposals, but I find them a little weak. We have learned that 15 states have referred the case to the Commission for this hepatitis C drug, which is sofosbuvir. It should be noted that its cost is in the range of 50,000 to 60,000 euros per patient for a period of twelve weeks. So it's huge compared to the budget. And it affects eight million people in Europe.  At the same time, if it were only for this pharmaceutical company that is releasing this drug, but it is now a lot of drugs to treat breast cancer, kidney cancer. Many states are now playing rationing, that is, on the cost-benefit: if you are too old, you are no longer entitled to it because the social security budget will not be able to meet it. So it's really a public health issue. So why did we get to this point? Some have said earlier that it is a monopoly and patent issue. If these patents are over twenty years and states have too often played on the monopoly, there is an emergency exit which is the compulsory license. We have to tell the states to use this licence because it opens up the market and other laboratories can very well make much cheaper drugs. There is also the problem of research. Look at the Ebola case, the current crisis in West Africa. We have known about this Ebola virus since 1976, but no pharmaceutical company wants to make vaccines and treatments because it is not cost-effective! In other words, we are on a market policy. However, from the moment we put public money, when the European Commission puts public money, it is absolutely necessary to be conditional so that there is no monopoly and no patents.

It is unacceptable for such medicinal products to be available only to the privileged and the socially weaker to be excluded from such treatment. Then there are situations where the door to corruption and clientelism opens, which is what we want to combat in Europe.  If we are talking about lifesaving medicines, we should also talk here about situations where the possibilities of actively and fundamentally affecting the prognosis of the disease are exhausted. This is where palliative care should take place. In contrast to common therapies, this offers a higher quality of life even in cases of advanced diseases and in the terminal stages. It is a care that, with full respect for the dignity and rights of a person, ensures quality and comprehensive care for the severely ill or people at the end of their lives.

The problem is particularly acute in countries undergoing austerity programmes, largely because of the cuts to public services across the board, which of course limit access to healthcare and life-saving medicines. The Commission itself, in its country-specific recommendations, tells us that limitations on access to healthcare may weigh disproportionately on the more vulnerable sections of society, the people who rely disproportionately on public services.

On the other hand, it is high time that the necessary reform of the 1988 Directive on transparency in the pricing of medicinal products and their reimbursement should finally be unlocked and measures are taken to ensure the sustainability of different national health systems. Ladies and gentlemen, purchasing power cannot be discriminatory for access to life-saving medicines, as is the case or that of anticancers. Health care is not the responsibility of the European Union, but it is the internal market, competition or intellectual property rights and research.

The issue lends itself, of course, to pious and kind-hearted statements, and the Commission says it is concerned about the costs and difficulty of accessto various medicines and, surprisingly, the inequality in that access, and wants to help Member States in this area. The European Commission, the same Commission as part of the troika, the same troika which, for example, in Portugal, and illegitimately imposed an increase in the price of medicines and a reduction in state contributions, resulting in serious limitations in access to medicines.  Many users, especially older and lower-income users, now have an option: either medicines in the pharmacy or food. Some hospitals have stopped providing medicines to users in hospital pharmacies. It is often said: a lot helps those who do not disturb. Member States are responsible for the organisation of health services, health systems and the resources allocated to them. It is necessary to confront the transnational smeareof the medicine, but we cannot count on this European Commission to do so...

Needless to say, the sense of what you have suggested and reflected on here tonight will be conveyed to Commissioner Borg, who is responsible for this portfolio. He will also have people from his team who are listening to this debate and taking notes. As early as tomorrow, experts from the working group and from the Member States will meet and discuss this, so that could be one opportunity for Member States to try to continue this debate and take it forward. However, I have to say to Mr Ferreira, who in his closing remarks here talked about the pricing of medicine: I am sorry, but I have to restate that the pricing of medicine is not within EU competence. That does not mean that there is nothing we can do at EU level; there are other things, for instance, the exchange of information. There are other things, and as far as I understand it, the informal Health Council will actually have this on their agenda at their next meeting. Thank you very much for the input.
