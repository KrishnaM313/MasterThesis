Today we remember the people who were murdered 20 years ago in the massacre in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica. 8 000 boys and men were systematically and bestially killed within a few days, in the middle of Europe. In front of the world, Srebrenica was the worst war crime in Europe since the end of the Second World War – an act of genocide that should never have happened, a collective failure of the international community that still deeply shames us to this day. We bow to the victims. On behalf of the European Parliament, I extend our deepest sympathy to their families, to the bereaved. To this day, not all those murdered have been given justice. To this day, not even all those killed have found a final resting place. That is why we want to continue to fight to ensure that the victims and their bereaved people get the justice they deserve. In 2007, the Massacre was finally classified as genocide by the International Criminal Court. This was an important milestone, especially because the massacre took place in an area declared safe by the United Nations and became a symbol of an international community overwhelmed by serious human rights violations. We in the European Parliament have already taken a position on the Srebrenica genocide twice: in 2005 and 2009. At that time, we remembered all the victims of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. Today, 20 years later, we are renewing our commitment: we will not forget Srebrenica. For reconciliation cannot exist without memory. Reconciliation can only take place if experienced suffering and pain are acknowledged, if we remember how poisoned rhetoric and populist incitement pave the way for ethnic cleansing, if we remember how the multi-ethnic and multi-religious roots of the Balkans were denied – with the aim of redrawing borders. We are determined to stand in the way of all those who want to resurrect old demons and cause trouble again. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, commemorative events are important in order to remember that the destructive forces are always alive. I have asked my colleague, Vice-President Lunacek, to represent the European Parliament next week at the commemorative event in Srebrenica on 11 July. The European Parliament is working tirelessly for a European perspective on the Western Balkans, partly because a secure and stable neighbourhood is in our own interests. The door to Europe is open to those who are following the path of democracy and the rule of law, who also see reconciliation as a key to security and cooperation in the Western Balkans. I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to rise from your seats in memory of the victims of Srebrenica.

I believe that Greece and the European Union as a whole have arrived in a very difficult situation, which has led to this: you can read the debates in the European Parliament in which such a development was warned. You can also read what Martin Schulz – formerly as group chairman and later as President of Parliament – said about this in order to try to prevent this.  What is right now? What is right, what is wrong? In my opinion, the most important role of the European Parliament, the Chamber, which is directly elected by the citizens of Northern and Southern, Eastern and Western Europe, is now helping to build bridges that will lead out of the situation in which the European Union stands. I have to tell you, Mr Schulz – and it is not easy for me to say this because I had high hopes for the fifth President of the European Union – that I think my group is right, that the way in which you, as President of Parliament, interfered in the Greek debate was wrong was irresponsible – not because you supported the 'yes' vote. , but because you have contributed to the false charge and the confrontation that is taking place in Greece and other European countries. I would like to say to you at this point that I believe that you are not fit to play an active role for the European Parliament in this acute process. I would ask you to hold back because the damage you have done to the European Parliament is greater than the benefits you can now achieve.

In our view, it is not acceptable for the President of the European Parliament, the only institution directly elected, to interfere in a democratic decision-making process in a Member State. You did not do that when it came to Scotland, you did not do it during the referendums in the Netherlands – well, you were not president – nor with others. I have never seen a President of this Parliament who has announced that he will launch a campaign to intervene, to campaign for a 'yes' vote, who has at the same time declared that a government is at the end of the year, which at the same time has declared that this government must be replaced by a technical government which, at the same time, has declared that an elected president would be a manipulator, a demagogue. I believe that this has nothing to do with your responsibility here. They have competed in the last parliamentary term and in this parliamentary term in order to strengthen Parliament's rights. However, you have not received our support for believing that you are Parliament. They are not! They have been commissioned by us. We have not been asked what your position is.

Every people has the right to vote in a referendum on important issues that are relevant to them.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Hill, with this resolution, the European Parliament is expressing strong and strong support for the project for a Capital Markets Union. It is a first contribution to the setting of the agenda of the European institutions and an action plan of the Commission. The Capital Markets Union is a key component of a broader strategy to support growth and financial stability; it can allow greater diversification of financing channels to the economy, which must be complementary and not a substitute for bank financing, an incentive for a more efficient allocation of financial resources through the internal market, regardless of the geographical location of the lender or borrower, and can encourage better risk sharing and better shock absorption. In particular, we believe that the Capital Markets Union is particularly necessary in order to promote the development, growth and internationalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises and to encourage the channelling of financial resources towards long-term investments in support of the real economy, growth and development.  We agree with the Commission on the need for an approach which is both ambitious but pragmatic and practical. And, therefore, we also set out a broader, more forward-looking vision, but we fully support the first steps that the Commission has indicated. The resolution is very rich, mr Burkhard Balz will certainly help to explain it. I would like to highlight just a few points: of course, full support, as I have said, for the establishment of standards for high-quality securitisation, revision of the prospectus directive but also standardisation of certain financial instruments, support for access to information on companies, in particular unsused ones – on a voluntary basis, of course, but we can also think of a database and perhaps even an agency – and then we deal with , in fact, the most complex issues, such as the regulation on insolvency, the issue of taxation and, of course, the challenge of moving towards strengthening supervision to the goal of single supervision. In short, Parliament is ready to play its part. We are here and will actively contribute to the definition and implementation of a concrete roadmap for the Capital Markets Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 32, "date": "2015-07-06.json", "name": "Burkhard Balz", "mepid": "96997", "text": "   Author. Mr President, I would like to thank the The Capital Markets Union is an important project for this legislature. We support the Capital Markets Union because it promises greater diversification in the sources of funding for the European economy, because it wants to improve access to capital for small and medium-sized enterprises and because it can strengthen the internal market for financial services for the benefit of consumers. In other words, we support the objectives of a Capital Markets Union. At the same time, however, we also have clear demands for implementation. We do not give the Commission a blank cheque. From our point of view, the following is particularly important: we call for a holistic approach. The Capital Markets Union is not a substitute for bank financing, its task is to complement and strengthen proven financing models. It is therefore essential that the Capital Markets Union should involve financial intermediaries such as banks and insurance companies. Secondly, we call for a European approach. The Capital Markets Union is not a banking union, it must apply equally to the entire European market. We do not want to copy the models of third countries, but to develop an approach that fits into our European funding culture. And we are calling for a comprehensive analysis. The Capital Markets Union should be effective where there are barriers to capital market financing. These hurdles need to be analysed to see if they exist in the individual Member States or in the EU. The Capital Markets Union must learn from past mistakes. What went wrong in capital market financing during the 2007/2008 financial crisis must not happen again. Fourthly, we are calling for real benefits for small and medium-sized enterprises. The Capital Markets Union must not get lost in the small details of a set of rules, but must implement what it promises: better access to finance and better regulation for small and medium-sized enterprises. What is clear to us is that a Capital Markets Union can only improve the investment climate in Europe if further basic conditions are right.

This is a classic single market project for all 28 Member States: for those without developed capital markets, as well as for those with. Indeed, I would argue that it is Member States without strong capital markets which could stand to gain the most, because CMU will help create the conditions for capital to flow across borders and to SMEs, no matter where they are. To help this flow, we will look at venture capital, at angel investing, at crowd-funding and at private placement. It is, as we have already heard, a major priority of the CMU to broaden the range of financing options for SMEs, to complement banking, and to improve the funding conveyor belt. We have all seen examples of European ideas and European businesses going to the United States for their funding. I want those businesses to stay and grow here in Europe. We will review our Venture Capital Regulation; we will strengthen our venture capital industry; we will review the Prospectus Directive to make it easier for larger SMEs to raise money on the public markets; we will seek to free up bank balance sheets by reviving the EU market for securitisation through the identification of simple, transparent and standardised securitisations. That will help banks to lend more, including to SMEs. We are also looking at how we could improve SME credit information to make it easier for SMEs to attract investment. I think that Members of this committee know better than anyone about the steps taken over the last five years to improve the regulation of capital markets. Your resolution also rightly argues that we should take stock of the overall impact of financial regulation and be proportionate in our measures, and I agree with that. On supervision, respondents to the consultation argued that the ESA’s existing set of powers are sufficient, but some also called for greater supervisory convergence to ensure a level playing field. We also need to consider our overall macro-prudential framework. In terms of next steps, we are on track to publish our action plan in September. Concrete proposals will follow shortly afterwards. They will include a comprehensive package on securitisation, with updated calibrations for Solvency II and CRR, the definition of infrastructure and revised calibrations for Solvency II, and these proposals to review the Prospectus Directive. This is an ambitious programme. It will require sustained effort over a number of years, but we need to make quick progress, so I hope that these first proposals can be fast-tracked by the co-legislators. I look forward to developing this project with you, but most of all, I look forward to helping more European businesses, especially SMEs, get the funding they want, in order to increase choices for savers, to strengthen cross-border investment and also, I believe, to increase financial stability.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 34, "date": "2015-07-06.json", "name": "Pablo Zalba Bidegain", "mepid": "96763", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the latest developments in Greece these days are proof that we need more Europe, that is, more economic integration, more fiscal union and, ultimately, more political union — that is, with the same rules — and more economic growth. And the single capital market is precisely one of the instruments for achieving and reconciling both objectives. Because the single capital market will improve the allocation of financial resources between the different countries of the European Union. And also because, as Commissioner Hill has said, it will improve the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises, a real driver of economic growth and job creation. This is the way, ladies and gentlemen. Let us not deceive European citizens. Removing it from a sovereign debt that has an average gap of sixteen years will not boost growth. With growth, sovereign debt will be sustainable. Without growth, it hardly will be. And for growth, to boost economic growth, we know what we need to do: reforms at the national level — my country, Spain, it is an example — and more Europe, more economic integration, I insist.

Before you get any more involved in this project, I would like to draw your attention to four points. The first is to remember what happened in banking. You cannot build up a capital market without increasing the power, at the same time, supervision that is appropriate to the progress you want to make. You said you wanted these capital markets for financial stability. You will then need to strengthen the European character of supervision and regulation of these capital markets. In the same way, you will be forced to look at what is happening in shadow banking, otherwise you will create bubbles and speculative tools that will not serve the noble goals you display. The second dimension that needs to be taken into account is the specific disinterest in the euro area. We cannot pretend that the capital markets are totally ignorant of the currencies in which they operate. Now, you know, you have a real challenge in your hands.  With regard to the third dimension, you are telling us that all of this is to enable SMEs to have better access to capital markets. Is. But we must also use such an approach to direct capital flows where we believe we need them to finance the European project. From this point of view, there is a priority in terms of the imperatives that are related to a strategy for the ecological transition that you must carry and that you must have in mind when you move forward on the path of these capital markets. Finally, one last observation, I have seen almost nowhere, in your texts, the question of taxation. However, I think we cannot talk about a capital union without talking about taxation.

Its primary goal should really be to increase not only the diversity that companies have in looking for different ways of funding, but also the diversity that investors have in allocating their assets, especially in the longer term. Today we have entered a new era, and this is something that is also mentioned in your green paper: we have shifted from financial stability more into a position where we look at growth and job creation. It is also important to use the review clauses that you have at your disposal in the different legislative acts which have been adopted over the last couple of years to recalibrate and fine tune the system, to keep the stability that we have, while increasing the power, the diversity and the funding options for all in the markets. Second point: the capital markets union should really serve to remove barriers to private placements and crowd-funding, as well as to allow for the scalability of companies. We talk a lot about SMEs, but we also need mid-caps, we also need IPOs – I was the president of the IPO Task Force. We also need to keep our companies listed in Europe: the competence stays here and the financing stays here. This is also really important. Last point: we also have to make sure that we increase retail investors’ availability. We have seen them moving outside of the market – institutions as well – due to Solvency II and other regulations. We have to take a really good look at why, today, they are no longer investing in our markets. One of the issues there – and it is one of the things that is lacking in your plan – is the fact that you have not talked about, for example, the possibility of a pan-European private pension savings plan. This would facilitate the accumulation of the savings of many retail investors and the building of a true base for a capital markets union all across the European Union. The last point I would like to make is that we have to take a good look at how regulators are functioning. The gold-plating and the differences are really hampering the single market, and they should be tackled.

Mr President, I would like to thank the The Capital Markets Union is supposed to cure one of Europe's diseases: too little investment and banks that do not lend. But if you want to cure a disease, you first have to understand the causes of the disease before you agree on a medicine. And the reason for weak lending in the banking sector is precisely that we have had austerity in Europe, that wages have fallen, that pensions have fallen, that government spending has fallen. In such an environment, there is no dynamic demand for credit. The reason why banks do not lend was precisely due to the fact that they promoted, for example, a dubious securitisation market. If the Commission is just saying 'we want to promote simple, safe, transparent products', it must first answer why there is no private market for these products. This obviously does not exist because the risks are too high for market participants. That is why we say that the Capital Markets Union does not fit into the European landscape. There are reasons why Europe has always had a bank-centred economic system, because banks are more able to meet the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises.

We know that there are problems and that those problems have not become any smaller with the financial crisis. Our financial market has become more fragmented. Therefore, I think that the Commissioner has picked up on the right idea. At the same time, one has to be careful that we do not disappoint citizens by presenting expectations this project cannot meet. There is the danger that efforts like the capital markets union and developing open capital markets could be misunderstood to mean that it would largely replace the provision of credit to SMEs. For the reasons which have been mentioned, small businesses – also in the US – depend largely on banks and will continue to do so. It makes sense to complement their funding possibilities, and the Commission proposal also makes sense. However, what we can achieve will be limited if we do not tackle the biggest problems in Europe. The biggest problems for the opening of capital markets are clearly issues such as taxation, insolvency law or accounting rules. This will not change, and the Commission is not proposing to change it. Therefore, please do not promise too much. But I have one message for the Commission. I think it is important to reconcile this project with European values. This means that long-term funding and green bonds should not be governed by specialised instruments, but capital markets above a certain size should show that they have moved away from CO2 and are investing for the long term.

I consider this to be an important project in this parliamentary term. However, Commissioner, we must be honest about this, and there is a little more to come. Only through the revision of the Prospectus Directive and the strengthening of the securitisation market will we not achieve a Capital Markets Union in the European Union. We urgently need to take stock of what we have done in the meantime in terms of financial market regulation – as you have announced – and we then need to look at where there is still something missing or– to be honest – where we have perhaps done too much, so that banks can no longer do their job of lending. I would like to mention one key word: when I hear at the moment that the Basel Committee is considering the fact that what we as a Parliament have deliberately created – namely, that a correction factor for SME loans has been introduced – should be reversed, then it is the wrong signal to make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to access the capital market. Thirdly, we must ensure that we create greater coherence. We have partly legislated where we use the same terms in different legislative packages that no longer fit together. I am thinking here only of the disclosure requirements in various directives, which we still need to make coherent. And one of the concerns that is very close to my heart and which is very close to your heart, Commissioner, is, of course, the question of how we deal with third countries. They were in the US in the spring and dealt with the subject. We, as the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, will be in the United States in a few days' time to make some progress here.

We have a good paper that demonstrates, in a clear way, the priorities of Parliament on CMU – to increase growth and jobs across the EU – and, more critically, that underlines that growth has to be sustainable and should not prejudice financial stability. I support the emphasis on timing. Given that CMU should have been in place a decade ago, it is high time that we step up a gear on this. Commissioner, you said that in the autumn we are to receive two new regulations on securitisation and the Prospectus Directive. We eagerly await those. However, there are many difficult political obstacles that we need to tackle, and many colleagues have referred to them: the lack of consistent implementation by Member States, the 29 different tax regimes for debt, and likewise for insolvency procedures. Does the Commission have any plans to tackle these in the near future? Furthermore, if we are going to review the CMU over the next four years, is it not an omission not to address the technological innovations in the financial sector? This is evolving very fast, but the regulators and legislators are not keeping up with it. We also have to acknowledge that confidence in the financial services has taken a knock.

The problems of the European economy are different and stem from the deep stagnation of demand due to austerity policies, without lack of capital.

That is why Europe also needs a diversified capital market, capital markets that have better access to capital for small and medium-sized enterprises. Yves Mersch put it in a nutshell with a quote that I would like to reproduce. He said: \"The European economy is like an aircraft that only tries to fly with a turbine – with bank financing.\" In order to strengthen the speed and stability of this aircraft, a second engine is needed, namely capital market financing, and so it is: in the USA, medium-sized companies have five times more funding from capital markets than European SMEs. It is therefore not surprising that more and more European growth companies are raising money in the US, going to the US to operate in attractive private placement markets. The same goes for startups when they are big enough. When they are small, they need crowdfunding, but also with professional venture capital – there is no such thing in Europe.  Some key figures, bank financing versus capital market financing: seventy percent bank financing in Europe, thirty percent in the United States.

I believe that the document discussed and adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the future of the capital market is well oriented.

The first is the absence, I believe, of adequate reflection on the euro area's relationship with the rest of the Union. Forgetting that a substantial part of Europe is based on the euro area, that the euro can be a key element in organising a true capital market, I believe it would require additional reflection, a public debt issuance that would allow for risk-free assets. In any case, beyond this, the capital market wants or should regularize shadow banking, which in the end is non-bank financing.

It is extremely important that we get deeper capital markets in Europe, but I always get a little sceptical when people say that we are to launch a capital markets union. I would like to disclose to this plenary that we already have a capital markets union: it is called the European Union, and its aim is for an internal market and the free flow of goods, capital services and people. I say this because this discussion is very much about the shortcomings of the past, where we have not been able to get rid of the hindrances, barriers and fragmentation. We do have well-functioning capital markets in the Union, here and there, which are rather deep and which are providing the capital. The problem is not the amount of liquidity but the amount of profitable investments. There are some things we need to do in order to improve the capital markets of the European Union. First of all, we should skip the idea of the financial transaction tax. Secondly, we need to have a review of all the legislation we have dealt with so far: some good, some maybe not so good, and some which hinders. We need to ensure that we are not regulating in a way that creates hindrances and that we are opening up for the free flow of capital – that is the way to get more investments.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 60, "date": "2015-07-06.json", "name": "Olle Ludvigsson (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "96673", "text": "   Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr I look postively at the construction of a Capital Markets Union.

This part of the internal market is severely underused. There is a great European potential just waiting to be safeguarded. At the same time, it is important to also see the risks.

There is a clear lack of investment in Europe and, of course, capital is needed to make investments. It is not enough for the banks: it is therefore necessary to unblock those instruments that are not used through alternative forms of financing and therefore also to make greater use of risk capital, but I am also thinking of an increasing use of pension funds. However, if demand is not linked to supply, i.e. investors to small and medium-sized enterprises, these measures will not be enough. There is a lack of information for small and medium-sized enterprises, but even investors do not know what the potential is within 24 million European small and medium-sized enterprises. We therefore need to improve the flow and quality of data on small and medium-sized enterprises in order to satisfy the thirst for information that is there.  So why not create an instrument, which can be a telematics platform, can be a lean agency, to collect, analyse and disseminate data on small and medium-sized enterprises and therefore an exchange of information between businesses and capital? This instrument would therefore be a bridge between entrepreneurs, businesses and investors, assessing the need for credit and the growth potential of Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises.

I agree that it is important to develop European capital markets to diversify funding and improve access to financing, thereby restoring the stability of the banking sector. We succeeded in improving the text by defeating many amendments which aimed at turning the capital markets union into a deregulatory agenda for the financial markets. The text now clearly refers to the need for legislative action. In this sense, I am strongly in favour of a review of legislation in order to ensure the highest investor protection standards. I also agree with the need to address the taxation of capital markets, because it might represent an obstacle, despite the opportunities offered by a well-designed European Union capitals market.

The answer to this rests partly with a quick restructuring of its banking sector and with a reform of its financial system, which of course has consequences on the financing of the economy, on growth and, subsequently, on jobs. The capital markets union, Commissioner, represents one of the lessons that Europe has learned from the crisis, and by implementing it now it will ensure better financing for our economy and our SMEs. I would, therefore, like to particularly stress the importance of one element of the question put to you: SME-friendly economic and regulatory conditions. I think the Commission should indeed focus on ensuring the successful and diversified access of SMEs to financing in the capital markets union. Every detail from your side regarding this initiative will be very much welcomed. However, national particularities of the business sector and business models of the financial sectors in different European countries must also be considered when providing equal opportunities for financing. The banking sector should remain an important source of financing and funding for SMEs in Europe. Therefore, a genuine European approach should take into consideration the interconnected character of the banking and financial sectors in Europe and should be a support to the internal market in Europe, also with the aim of avoiding financial fragmentation, especially in times of crisis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 64, "date": "2015-07-06.json", "name": "Paul Tang (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "125020", "text": "   – Mr President, when Mr Juncker first coined the term ‘capital markets union’, I had some doubts. Was this a solution to the remaining obstacles to investments in SMEs in Europe, or was it a way of reintroducing the old problems under a new flag? I think the answer very much depends on the way we approach the capital markets union. Two key principles have to be at the heart of the capital markets union: it has to be safe, and it has to serve the real economy. Enhancing the safety and the stability of the financial sector still requires a number of measures. On securitisation, the resolution strikes a balance – the right balance. The Commission must show how shifting risks and freeing up capital leads to lending to SMEs. At the same time, high-quality securitisation requires an appropriate allocation of property rights and risks and requires powerful monitoring. There are problems with security-financing transactions which remain unaddressed: it is pro-cyclical in nature and it has the potential to increase systemic risk, and of course we still have to complete the banking union. We still do not have a Europe-wide deposit guarantee. As regards serving the real economy, the potential of banking beyond banks is largely untapped in the EU, so there is a possibility for Europe to diversify in financial instruments, and I think that is a good thing. It opens doors for SMEs and, with more risk-bearing capital, more SMEs can grow and develop in Europe, contributing to the European economy as a whole. But it cannot be restricted to regulation in the financial sector. If we want to have more risk-bearing capital, we also have to look at the tax regime and at debt-equity buyers, and the Commission has thus far been quiet on this subject. To conclude, the resolution rightly asserts that the capital markets union has to be fully compatible with past regulatory achievements. So yes, the capital markets union can offer an opportunity for a safer, service-oriented financial sector. This resolution offers a welcome starting point and strikes the right balance, a balance between the power of diversification and the necessity for proper regulation.

First of all, in terms of building from the bottom up, identifying barriers and obstacles and knocking them down, and building the capital markets union with people, rather than doing things to people: that is how I am approaching it. And that is why support for the capital markets union is very strong, as it happens, in the City of London – because they see the benefits that come to Britain from being part of a large single market. I think it is wrong to misrepresent the views of people in the City of London. In terms of some of the other issues that were raised, I think we need to identify and overcome these barriers. We need to be proportionate in our regulation and in how we regulate. The regulation that has been passed is clearly linked with the flow of capital through the union. Some specific points were raised about insolvency, taxation and private pensions. These issues are addressed in the green paper. We asked questions about insolvency and taxation, and we will follow those up in our response to it. We are considering a specific recommendation to do with the idea of having a voluntary ‘29th regime’ to encourage personal pensions. So a number of the points that have been raised are indeed being addressed. It is also important to emphasise that the point of what we are trying to do is to complement the funding streams we already have and to add to the banking system. If you have a system – which we have in Europe – which is heavily dependent on one source of funding – the banking system – and you have a contraction in the banking system, then you get the consequences we have seen: of businesses in the economy not getting the funding they need. I feel strongly that, if we can diversify sources of funding and give small, medium-sized and large businesses alternative sources of funding, we can make a contribution to growth and to creating new jobs. There is support for this way forward. I welcome the support I have had, and I welcome the arguments set out in the resolution. We have an opportunity to make some progress. I do not claim this is the Holy Grail, but I do claim that we have an opportunity now to do what we set out to do over 50 years ago, which is to achieve the free movement of capital.

Capital markets activity in some Member States needs to increase more than twice to achieve the average for the EU. This process can be triggered by finalising the CMU, which will enable more intensive flows of capital and will reduce discriminatory factors at play in access to financing, like the origin of the borrowers and the lenders or the business location.

As we know from the Greek crisis, if you become overly indebted, sooner or later you are going to go bankrupt. With bankruptcy, it is very hard to get yourself up and running again. However, if you bankrupt nature, then it is not only twenty years of suffering – it may even be the end of the game. This is the background for the whole resource efficacy debate, because we are bankrupting the planet. Each year, we are using up 1.5 planet’s worth of resources, and this figure is growing because there are more people, more needs for resources, more products and shortening life-spans of the products. It is not a question whether change is going to happen or not – it is a question of how it is going to happen. Is it going to be an extreme crisis – economic, welfare, health and humane – or can we create a true business opportunity out of this change? Indeed, this is a huge paradigm shift and a huge systematic change that we are facing. But while Europe is the most resource-dependent of all regions, we can benefit from resource scarcity or be hit hardest by it. We need to get the things right now. This enormous, hidden business opportunity can only be created by new business ecosystems and business models, like the lease economy and businesses working together in the zero—waste society, where the ends of some processes are resources for someone else. But to make this happen, legislative, economic, information and cooperative actions are needed. Firstly we need a proper set of sub- and whole indicators and targets. It is like accounting in companies: if you do not have harmonised, agreed and binding methodology, you lose all comparability and there is no point at all to the whole effort. We need a review of existing legislation, including financial legislation, because our linear history has ensured that our legislation fails to incorporate the value of ecosystem services. There are a lot of points that actually prevent the new business models of the circular economy. We need a product policy designing out of waste, and so we need an ambitious broadening of the scope and revision of the Ecodesign Directive. We need to make this happen soon, because we need predictability for investors in our economies. We need a renewal of the base directive, and we need a special focus on certain areas, such as sustainable buildings, since buildings represent 40% of our energy consumption. As this is a very slow—moving sector, we need to start by taking the decision now to make our building sector sustainable within 30 years.

First of all, this Commission remains strongly committed to presenting – before this Parliament and before the end of the year – a circular economy package which has a holistic approach on the issue – yes, on waste, but also on the re—use of finite materials and on other proposals that would create the environment for a new economy for Europe. Why do we need this, and why do we passionately believe in this? Because the future of the European economy is not in competing on low wages; the future of the European economy is not in competing on creating stuff with finite resources. The future of the European economy is in the circular economy – in reusing, in putting things back into the economic cycle, and in thinking in terms of cradle to cradle. Funnily enough, businesses have got this more – and got it better – than we have as politicians. Businesses are leading on this, and we should be leading, as well, as politicians. Why? Because we know where we are. We also know where we need to be, which is in the circular economy, but we do not know well how to get from where we are to where we need to be. And here is where politics needs to lead; here is where government comes in, and here is where the European Union is an essential link in getting us from where we are to where we need to be. I passionately believe in this transition. I believe this year, by presenting our package, we can make the first important contribution to this transformation (which is inevitable), and the report we discussed today is an important building block for what we are going to do. Indeed, we will look at the Waste Package, as I have said, and we will work on it so that we can present the new Waste Package before the end of the year – and, essentially, we will look at all the other issues we need for the circular economy. I believe in this because it is a huge business opportunity for European businesses. It is also a huge opportunity for the European economy and for jobs. That is why Vice-President Katainen and I work on this closely with all our colleagues – Commissioner Bieńkowska, Commissioner Vella, and many others – because we take a holistic approach. I would encourage Parliament to look at this, not within silos, but as something we have a common interest in, because a circular economy is not something we do just for the environment. Sustainability, of course, has an environmental angle, but sustainability has, especially, an economic and a social angle. If we do not take the three elements into account – economic, social and environmental sustainability – we will not succeed in creating the right conditions for the circular economy. I want to stress this. Why are businesses interested in this? Because it is the most interesting business model for the future; because they know it is sustainable; because they know it will lead to growth; because they know this is where Europe can lead worldwide. We should use that opportunity to integrate the three elements of sustainability – economic, social and environmental – and then, I believe, we will be successful. You can count on the Commission to take this holistic approach; you can count on the Commission to work closely with you. I am sure that we can look at the elements, particularly starting with analysing the situation in Member States and having comparable analyses from them, so that we can take it from the zero situation to the higher levels in the next couple of years.

As you heard, the Commission strongly believes in the circular economy. The circular economy will be a megatrend in the world economy similar to globalisation. The current linear model is not sustainable or reasonable from an economic, environmental or societal point of view. For instance, if you look at the car sector, the average car is parked around 90% of the time. If you look at office buildings, office buildings are empty some 50% of the time. So we have to look at the economy from a different angle than we have done before. As Vice-President Timmermans has just said, we have to look at the circular economy from a wider perspective. It is not only about recycling or waste, but we should focus on this as a complete concept in the market economy. That is why we need to find the right incentives for the business sector to further develop their business models. We also we have to find the right incentives for consumers to change their consumer behaviour and, by doing so, lead development by their own choices. At the moment the business sector is leading the circular economy, and this is a very good thing. As a regulator, we have to find the right things to support this development. We need the input of stakeholders in order to define what needs to be regulated – or even deregulated; how we can use the tools we have at EU level to promote better use of our resources and how we can strengthen the circular economy as an integral part of the dynamic market economy. We must also be careful not to overregulate everything. This is often a problem for a regulator, who may, even in good faith, sometimes do so. The ‘Report on resource efficiency: moving towards a circular economy’, as approved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) last month, sets the bar high. We appreciate and take note of your ambitious proposals. I would like to comment on some of the many issues your report raises. Let me start by what we call the other half of the circle. The Commission shares your view that product design is of paramount importance in getting things right from the start. There is the potential for an increased focus on circular aspects in order to design products that are made to last and that can be remanufactured and repaired easily, thus facilitating high-quality recycling. We are looking closely into this matter. We see a strong role for public procurement in creating demand for sustainable products, and we are examining the contribution that can be made by green public procurement in this respect. On buildings, we thank Parliament for its support for a more holistic approach to resource efficiency throughout the full life-cycle of buildings. To avoid burden shifting, we need to look at overall impacts beyond energy efficiency. The upcoming revised legislative proposal on waste is expected to focus on stepping up implementation on the ground and to take account of different levels of current performance in individual Member States, while keeping a high and achievable level of vision on recycling. It will be essential to base this work on sound evidence. Another important viewpoint is that Member States and stakeholders see real added value in cooperating at EU level to tackle food waste. To that end, we will closely examine possibilities for preventing food waste. To conclude, my mandate is to look at all the work we are doing in the circular economy from the perspective of growth, jobs, competitiveness and investment. I know that, if designed right, we can enable a triple win. First, there are economic gains to be made from using raw materials and resources more efficiently and being less dependent on imports. Secondly, there are environmental gains in moving away from a linear economy where we throw away products that could be repaired or recycled. Thirdly, there are social gains to be made from preventing waste and further improving local waste management, recycling, repair and reuse services.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 80, "date": "2015-07-06.json", "name": "Tiziana Beghin", "mepid": "124777", "text": "   Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

First we will understand it and first we will understand that gross domestic product and its growth rate are indicators designed to reflect a linear consumer model that has destroyed our land. We need to understand that prosperity and growth are two quite different things and that you don't necessarily have to increase consumption to live better. This is the basis of the circular economy.  I had the privilege of being the rapporteur for this dossier on the circular economy in the Committee on Labour where we took a clear position to facilitate the transition: to shift taxation from work to the use of resources, to differentiate VAT, reducing it for goods recycled or prepared for recycling and to prepare our countries for the new jobs that will be created by the circular economy, places widespread in the territory and in small and medium-sized enterprises.

I would like just to point out some important elements of our opinion. The first part is that we clearly need an ambitious new package from the Commission as soon as possible, which includes quantitative targets, not just wishes and also which has legislative parts. We need clear targets and legislative proposals to step ahead in the circular economy. Concerning some specific issues in the ITRE Committee, we would like to emphasise the importance of the following: incentivising both reuse and preparations for reuse through quantitative targets; a fiscal framework in accordance with the ‘polluter pays’ principle; addressing the production side (which was mentioned already by Commissioner Katainen); better production design standards to make products more durable and easier to assemble, and so on; and the fight against planned obsolescence in order to protect consumers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 82, "date": "2015-07-06.json", "name": "Karl-Heinz Florenz", "mepid": "1038", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Vice-Presidents, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent report, which is a very I was very pleased today that you made a clear commitment to the circular economy, Mr Timmermans, which was not quite so evident in the turmoil of the election of the new Commission. I am all the more pleased that you have both pointed out here today that, in the end, it is not a simple waste directive, but that this is really about much more: a circular economy. I can only say to all my fellow Members who think that they could rip something here with one percentage point or another: you are wrong. There is much more at stake. Ultimately, as Mrs Pietikäinen has already said, it is a question of us being one of the largest continents in export. But we have – my country, for example – only a bit of cement and a bit of cheese, and then it is already at the end of our raw materials. That is why we need to deal with this natural capital – I am personally a farmer and I know quite well what I am talking about – much better and more attentively. We are obviously on this path, because so far we are still depositing 70% of our raw materials in landfills in Europe. They are lost, so you can use technologies as you like. So I am pleased that at some point it will be a matter of recognizing from the ore mine to the bicycle: what have we needed, how have we dealt with it, how often can we recycle it – certainly more often with aluminium than with paper. We do not want to throw the baby out with the bath, but the important prerequisite is that we realise that we have to work on it. And that's where one or the other percentage - unlike my colleague - is supposed to be. Nor do I believe that we need to have binding figures in this paper.

The circular economy is not a dream, but an urgent necessity, a great opportunity.  This is urgently needed, because the Earth's resources are not unlimited, because it worsens the environmental quality of the planet, because the warming of the Earth does not stop and because a dramatic food emergency is becoming increasingly apparent. It is a great opportunity for Europe, because we, as the world's leading economic power, the world's leading consumer market, cannot depend 60% on imported raw materials and recover only 5% of this material. With a bold transition to a circular economy, it is possible to develop good jobs, increase Europe's wealth, become leaders in strategic sectors. Only the like and the deaf continue to ignore the fact that environmental quality will increasingly become an essential factor in the development of our economy. The cultural change, in lifestyles, in the methods of design and production that we want to achieve, is based on a simple principle: the raw materials present in the products must no longer be considered waste to be thrown away after a short life cycle. \"From cradle to cradle\" said the Commissioner: that is right. We want and must move from the culture of waste, the practice of disposables, from unbridled consumerism to that of reuse and recycling. That is why it is necessary to support innovation, research, the companies that innovate.  That is why we need a breakthrough in the design and production of consumer products, in construction, in the organization and operation of our cities, new regulations of public procurement in food production and consumption.  And here are few essential objectives: to increase our resources by 30%, by 2030; produce the same products with 30% less resources; to define parameters and indicators, binding targets on the reduction of municipal waste, strict limitation on the incineration of non-biodegradable waste.

Thank you very much for your very good introduction, Mr Vice-President. Remember, Mr Timmermans, 'trash is cash' you said recently, quite rightly by the way. Who the hell is throwing away valuables? Well, we produce five tons of waste per citizen per year. We're barely recycling a third. We throw away valuable resources. To think that Europe is particularly dependent on third countries for the import of its raw materials. The switch to a circular economy brings environmental benefits, but above all it is an economic necessity. Many companies, including at my home in Flanders, have already understood this well. From Europe, we need smart measures that remove barriers, stimulate innovation and new business models, provide long-term legal certainty. We need tools to effectively measure and reduce the use of raw materials, a well-thought-out product policy and smarter waste management. To me, these are the key messages of the report. If we want to make progress in the real world out here, and not just on paper, we need to reconcile ambition with a sense of reality.

As we are discussing the circular economy here, China is at the same time constructing artificial islands in the South China Sea. For what reason? For one single reason: to secure resources. The single pillar of Chinese foreign policy is to secure resources for its large population. And what about the EU? What are we doing in our external policy? Not a lot. It is close to nothing, although we are the most vulnerable region in the world where resources are concerned. We provide only 30% of the resources that we use for ourselves, so in external policy, resource efficiency is absolutely absent. But of course – and this is the main focus of today’s debate – resource efficiency also has a very strong internal dimension: the efficient use of resources in Europe itself. On this matter, I have to go back five years in time to 2010, when then Commissioner Potočnik presented his roadmap for a resource-efficient Europe. I must say it was a brilliant document and a very strong analysis, with a roadmap on what Europe should do to become resource efficient. There was a lot of legislation. It was not only about the environment but was maybe more about the economy. It talked about recycling, about better design, about creating economies of scale for the reuse of materials, the recovery of precious minerals like phosphates, and working on alternatives for our chemical industry through biomass. All that was in this brilliant document, and my question to the Commission is: what will be the difference with the action plan that will be part of the circular economy package? Is it just a delay of five years, or will it be a real improvement gained after five years? Finally, let me thank the two Vice-Presidents for being here representing the Commission.

Nevertheless, it has produced a document and a report that is very ambitious – and I firmly believe that the Commission will adopt it in this way – and will be a real basis for what we will be discussing here in the European Parliament in the coming years. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety therefore approved this report by almost a majority of votes, and this also shows that we may have found a compromise that is possible. However, let me also say a few critical words. I have been dealing with the issue of waste management quite intensively since my time in the national parliament, and I myself know how complex and treacherous this issue is, and that, especially with this legislation, there is an old lesson that \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions\". I would therefore like to stress once again here that realistic real-time objectives must be set, i.e. only those that are determined on the basis of appropriate scientific evidence and analyses. Let me raise one objection now. It's not just percentages. Some of you have already talked about this, but there is nothing worse than setting values and targets within percentages that will simply be circumvented by the Member States, because they are unable to practically meet them without causing large-scale economic problems. And they are not able to fill them mainly in the time frame. I ask that the Commission adopt impact studies for all Member States individually on this very binding document.

That sounds much better than in December, January, and perhaps there is a change from Saul to Paul. We hope so. We need rules on a planet where we will be ten billion. What worries me a little in your speech, including from Mr Katainen, is that you say 'no over-regulation'. But what does that mean? How do I intend to steer the economy in one direction in the long term – as you rightly recognised, Mr Timmermans – if we do not have tough objectives? Why are we making progress on climate policy? Because we have tough goals. That is why I assume that if you say that we are going to go long term, you will also be in favour of binding tough targets in 2030. Without it, there will be no direction for the economy. The second thing we need is to remove dangerous substances from the economy. I can't do meaningful recycling with dangerous substances. That is why REACH needs to be deepened rather than watered down. REACH is not over-regulation. We need less dangerous substances in order to make recycling possible in the first place.  The third reason why we are making tough laws is unfair competition from outside. In the case of tyres, new coated, i.e. very environmentally friendly tyres are more expensive in Europe than new Chinese tyres. If we do not have any laws, how do you intend to survive before the WTO in any way, and then, almost without rules, to protect the better European products or better products worldwide against dumping products? Perhaps you can be a little clearer in your answer afterwards.  Of course, we also want the Waste Framework Act not to be watered down now under this holistic rhetoric. We need strict rules there too.  One last thing: we have tailwinds in Europe, in Italy, in France when it is about food waste.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the use of resources in our economy is at the crossroads of many problems that the rapporteur rightly raises: waste, dependence on the outside world for the importation of raw materials and energy, or the lack of the recycling economy. While the importance of short circuits is highlighted and the report purports to draw a new paradigm, this text does not propose any real structural changes that would give Member States the tools necessary for a sustainable circular economy. Indeed, the intensification of international trade is not in question. However, it is one of the main vectors of overuse of resources and pollution.  Moreover, the text seeks to strengthen a regulatory framework that already suffocates our producers and artisans every day, who are nevertheless the pillars of local economies and the hopes of an entrenched circular economy. Yes, the local level is paramount and we need to take that into account in our analyses. For this reason, the Member States are legitimate and functional. Finally, in the area of hydrocarbon imports, I would like to remind you that the Union's diplomatic missteps are hurting this circular economy project.

But the approach is again indicators, changing perception, measuring progress, zero waste; targets that are in practice unlikely to be achieved.  But I wanted to dwell on a specific point in the report. It says that small and medium-sized enterprises should be put at the heart of the effort to make efficient use of resources. But it is these businesses that are being destroyed by the policies of the Union, a deeply undemocratic Union controlled by a bureaucracy willing to destroy not only small and medium-sized enterprises but entire peoples when they dare to resist its mandates. We witnessed an attack like this last week. Those who, with their memorial policies, have weakened the Greeks and President Schulz himself have intervened in an attempt to terrorize the Greeks in order to comply with the wishes of Brussels.

First, the growing demand for resources due to economic growth in third countries. The second, the shortage of raw materials on our continent, mainly one of the most valuable, since we only have exceptional deposits and difficult access. The third reason is our willingness to make environmental impacts minimal on the slope of natural resource exploitation and also on waste management. The objective is to reintroduce waste into the production cycle, thus generating a virtuous circle of efficiency, waste management, emission reduction and, in general, environmental protection. Very laudable task, but very difficult. That is why I thank and congratulate the rapporteur on the work she has done and which has not been easy at all. We must be aware that, in this matter, a good part of the effort has to be done and that companies and, ultimately, consumers and citizens have to pay for. I am in love that the new legislation in which the Commission works is ambitious, but at the same time realistic. On the basis of the waste hierarchy, the important thing is that Member States continuously improve the quality of waste management.

I must also repeat myself – as colleagues have just said, the two Vice-Presidents were here today. Apparently, the Commission then understood what was at stake, which perhaps was not the case at the beginning, but now we are really giving full force forward so that we can get a package – at the end of the year, it has been said. It is important that we first set up fixed quotas, voluntary measures. I have been a Member of this House for ten years. I've seen so many voluntary measures, they've all crashed into the wall, it didn't help anything. Robust legislation must be put in place, that is what matters, and that will also lead to the effect that we all want at the end of the day, namely a circular economy. We need a 360° approach at this point. If you're tinkering with this package, taking out a piece of cake here, taking out a piece of cake here, it's not going round. Then the circle will not work. In this respect, we should really give thought to this. Even if the Commission then needs more time until December, then we really need this package for sustainable development, that we conserve resources, save resources and really give a in the area of recycling, that nothing is deposited. After all, a ban on landfilling is also climate protection at the end of the day, because I prevent methane. What is very important to me is the marine environment. We should ensure that we really do take a serious approach here, so that less reaches the seas. And at the end of the day – as has already been mentioned – food waste: this must stop. It is a huge scandal that we in Europe are throwing away so many tonnes of food. We need to get better here.

So, before we start setting absolute numbers in our targets, we should carefully examine the impact of doing so. I have seen so often before that an own initiative report like this becomes not just indicative but somehow binding, with Parliament, in examining the legislative report when it comes forward, seeing any variance from these numbers as an unacceptable lessening and loosening of its position. A good example of this is the call for 70% recycling and reuse for municipal waste: very laudable – I support it. But before such targets can be considered, they must be underpinned by indicators to assess and measure improvements.

There are apps everywhere. Today, in particular, I would like to highlight our current methods of producing and consuming food, which are completely unsustainable.

For example, for me, over-regulation is when we talk here about ambitious, binding targets in public procurement law, which we only amended last year and where we have just introduced these green points of view as a way of taking account of procurement law that has not been the case before. I also think that we must be careful to include the inclusion of environmental risks in ratings and capital requirements. The revision of the Ecodesign Directive should also be carefully reconsidered. Hence the request to the Commission: it is a comprehensive, good report. In many places, I also agree 100% with Sirpa.

On the other hand, there is a need for action in this highly sensitive arc of tension between progress, economic success and resource conservation. But how much intervention, how much regulation is needed? The paradigm shift has long since taken place. The industry has recognized that today's customers are asking for and preferring sustainable products. In addition, the efficient use of all raw materials used is an important factor for industry in achieving its economic success. Isn't that all motivation? Circular economy is undeniably a sensible approach to more effective exploitation of valuable resources. It is therefore all the more surprising that state bodies themselves have a very preventive effect here, for example by refusing permits for industrial installations, which would ensure that the separation of substances is as pure as possible, which in turn is an indispensable prerequisite for the effective recycling of expensive natural raw materials.

But we would be wrong if we confined the circular economy only to an environmental policy. So you understand that the circular economy is not just what we want to do with waste, so it's not just what percentages of separate collection we want to achieve, where we want to deliver it.  The circular economy is undoubtedly the revision of waste legislation, which is an essential part, but it is much more than that. We must see it as a strategic axis of economic development and – let me tell you – even European industrial and even social, because it means, for example, wanting to design and produce products in such a way as to increase their durability, recyclability and repairability, supporting the secondary raw materials market and changing, and at the same time reorienting, business and business models.

We are already a long way off with the proper reuse of our waste. The waste incinerators already recycle a lot, especially in the Netherlands. Incineration, residues are released, including valuable raw materials. The suggestion is made that burning in particular is very unhealthy. But the technology used today is different and can also contribute to the circular economy, for example. The business model of reuse and processing makes combustion in a good mix of great importance. Phasing out too quickly makes no sense if the landfill ban is not properly enforced in the rest of Europe. Everyone should be able to come. In the Netherlands, garbage is not just thrown together. Waste is separated before it is incinerated or recycled. An informed decision. Billions have already been invested in waste disposal. If we change the frameworks, companies may be in trouble. And if valuable innovation is lost, we will run backwards. Finally, another point. For the agricultural sector, too, the use of the circular economy between farmers is essential. Recovery of scarce phosphate and other valuable raw materials from manure must be made possible in Europe.

Because if there are no binding targets, it will not really be possible to establish a circular economy system, because we are still a long way from the 'polluter pays' principle.

I would like to thank the rapporteur, Sirpa Pietikäinen, for a very good and interesting paper. As both First Vice-President Timmermans and I have said, the Commission takes this exercise very seriously, we are passionate about this issue, and we also recognise the big challenge ahead of us, because the circular economy is not a simple issue at all. We want to be very humble with this large entity in order to choose the right things which need European-wide regulation. We also have to recognise where we do not need European-wide regulation. Many colleagues here asked what I meant when I said that we have to avoid over—regulation. What I meant is that there are very good examples in Europe even now, especially in the industrial sector, of business models which represent the circular economy. If we over-regulate something, it means that those good examples will be killed, and we have to avoid this. Our aim is to set a target, and we want to be flexible on how to get there because the target itself is the main issue. For us, the circular economy is a matter of competitiveness; it is a matter of innovation; it is a matter of job creation, investment and growth. As Europeans, we need to find a way to create a better environment for the circular economy. In the United States they do not necessarily have that need, because they have some points they can rely on, and on which to build their competitiveness, but when looking at Europe, we have an economic necessity, an imperative, to be successful in this. When looking at Asia, especially China, they have an environmental necessity, similarly to us. So this is a competition situation – whether Europe is ahead of, for instance, the Chinese, when creating incentives to business and consumers to boost the circular model of our economy. So let us continue on this file. This is also very important from the internal market viewpoint. If we manage to create an internal market for used raw materials or a secondary market for raw materials, then we can again build incentives for healthier, more environmentally, socially and economically sustainable development on this issue. The public consultations will last until 20 August.

Secondly, a couple of comments on this discussion. To those of my colleagues who have fears over a regulation and think that voluntary actions alone would work, here are just a few reminders: why do we have regulations on ownership and paying taxes? Why do we not just say, OK,  taxes are a useful thing, so let us leave things on a voluntary basis so that everybody pays their right share, right? Or why cannot civilised people just agree among themselves whether they drive on the right or left, or whether they own something or they do not? Why do we need regulations on that? Because regulations give legal certainty. We do not have that legal certainty at this point about our circular economy, like we do not have it about the digital agenda or data security, because these phenomena did not exist about 20 years ago. But we have a lot of wrong kinds of incentives and regulations, and if we do not tackle this, nothing will happen. Thirty years ago we did not live in caves. We did already have the first indicators of resource efficiency. The Interface carpet company started leasing carpets, and we had a whole concept about resource efficiency and inefficiency, and the need to make the economy circular. Look what we have achieved in 30 years – very little. Alongside the good examples and knowledge, the use of resources has only been increasing. 30 years from now we will be living in 2050, and either we will need four planets or we decrease the use of resources from those of one and a half planets to within the limits of one planet.

I therefore hope that Vice-President Timmermans will keep his promise and present the circular economy draft by the end of 2015.

They say that a week is a long time in politics, but certainly I have to say that a year has been an extremely long time for dairy farmers over this last 12 months. Since last year, global supply has continued to outstrip global demand. We have seen the Chinese pull back from the market; we have seen the Russian embargo, and we have seen prices continue to tumble. We need only look at last week’s global dairy trade auction to see that volatility is wreaking havoc in the dairy market. The auction’s 5.9% decrease is the eighth decrease in a row and marked the lowest average price since 2009. Fact. The continuing fall in prices can no longer be dismissed as a blip. All the indications point to a dairy sector in crisis. I have repeatedly said that the Commission has failed to recognise the scale of the problem, despite assurances that were given in 2009. Commissioner Hogan may finally be starting to grasp it. In a recent interview on the BBC, he said he hoped the second half of 2015 would produce some evidence that we are coming out of this crisis. So I hope he will address that tonight and admit that there is a crisis in the industry. I hope that this is a long overdue recognition of what dairy farmers have been saying for some time. Is the Commissioner prepared to clarify his remarks and acknowledge that the sector is in crisis? In any case, Rabobank’s most recent report has made the Commissioner’s prediction look very optimistic, forecasting a recovery in the first half of 2016 at the earliest. Commissioner, dairy farmers cannot wait that long. Dairy farmers cannot wait until next year to see things turn. The Commission must act now. One measure that could make a real difference to dairy farmers in the short term would be a review of the current market intervention threshold. My report calls for a realistic safety net that accurately reflects production costs and market prices. In my own constituency, processers are paying an average base price of 20 pence per litre, with the average cost of production in Northern Ireland around 26.5 pence per litre. It does not match up. With the intervention rate so low, prices have fallen below the cost of production, and that is not unique to my area alone. We need to put a flow in the market to ensure no further decline arises. Another short-term major sector is the Russian ban. Mr Putin has now extended that embargo for another year in response to the latest round of EU sanctions. The onus is on the Commission to stand behind dairy farmers who continue to suffer the consequences of political decisions beyond their control. The Russian ban has emphasised the pitfalls in relying too heavily on one trading partner. Diversifying export markets is crucially important to the countries like my own, and we need to ensure that we diversify the markets and expand the markets that are already there. The Commission has made good progress in sourcing new outlets for our own quality European produce, but there is always scope to improve that. We also cannot ignore the longer-term challenges in the dairy sector. We need to look at imbalances in the supply chain between producer, processor and retailer, as well as own—brand labelling and the use of liquid milk as a loss leader by large supermarkets. We need to look at the possibilities of futures-market and fixed-term contracts, as more predictability would allow producers more flexibility. While these are major issues, I believe the single greatest challenge facing the dairy sector is volatility.

I welcome the fact that this is a full debate which reflects the importance of the European milk sector. It is a critical element of the EU agricultural sector, which is in itself a key driver of jobs and growth, contributing significantly to the Commission’s jobs and growth agenda. I want to convey my particular thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Nicholson, who has used his long experience in the sector to draft a report that is a very useful contribution to the debate that has surrounded the long-awaited and historic expiry of milk quotas just three months ago. But as he has said, this particular issue is not confined to that period of time. I read the report with interest, and I share most of the report’s assessment of the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead of the sector. Before commenting on some of the specifics of the report, I would like to say something about the current market situation. Perhaps not surprisingly, maybe even inevitably, there has been some price volatility following the end of quotas. This volatility, which has been contributed to by a global oversupply of milk, has led to downward pressure on milk prices, with the effects being felt most acutely in some Member States more than others. The EU average price in May was 30.48 cents per kilo. In absolute terms, and if applied consistently across the EU, this would represent a reasonable return for most farmers. However, I acknowledge that the variation in prices paid to farmers in different Member States can be quite significant. I am concerned about these developments, and I therefore instructed my services to assess the market situation more closely in terms of the Member States that have a very low price presently. In the Union, in 2014, we produced 4.5% more milk than in the previous year, while the other main world suppliers increased their output in the area of 2%. In 2015, and in spite of the limited reduction in deliveries during the first quarter, we are already on par with last year, and projections indicate that, in spite of moderate prices, we will end the year with an overall increase of 0.9%. Outlets have to be found for these quantities of milk. While we have some challenges to face, we are fortunate that we can count on a complete toolkit of measures available to the CAP to address these challenges, thanks to the work on the CAP reform by Paolo de Castro, Michel Dantin, Jim Nicholson and others. These are available, and these measures include the safety net tools, including the public buying-in of butter and skimmed milk powder as well as private storage aid schemes; the possibility to intervene in exceptional circumstances, as in the case of the Russian import ban; direct payments to support farmers’ income, including coupled support up to 13% of the national envelope; rural development policy, which allows farmers to finance investments, be better trained or receive compensation for being located in areas of natural constraint; the possibility to implement risk management tools; the milk package, which is yet to be fully exploited, and which can strengthen the integration of the producers in the supply chain; and the strengthening of the Milk Market Observatory Board, with more timely meetings and more time data available now, providing signals in the marketplace on a monthly basis. Dairy farmers can also benefit from the quality policy and from research and innovation, which are particularly relevant for producers oriented to niche products. We have more money in the promotion policy budget to accompany dairy operators in their search for new customers, and the identification of new markets is a personal priority for me. I have heard some suggestions recently that the Commission is doing very little to support dairy farmers. Any objective analysis of this matter certainly does not stand up to scrutiny. Let me illustrate the reality: the safety net measures – intervention in private storage, both for butter and skimmed milk powder – have been available to EU operators since last summer. By its rapid action, the Commission has provided economic actors with certainty and security. Special targeted support, for a total amount of EUR 40 million, was granted to dairy farmers from those Member States most directly hit by the Russian ban – the Baltic States and Finland in particular. After beef and veal, dairy is the second—largest recipient of voluntary coupled support, with 20% of the total amount, amounting to EUR 820 million in 19 Member States. As regards the Milk Package, which I said earlier has yet to achieve its full potential, we should not underestimate the huge progress that has been made. 13 Member States have provided for compulsory contracts. The number of recognised producer organisations is growing. What is more relevant is their impact on jointly-negotiated volumes of milk deliveries. In Germany and the Czech Republic, more than one-third of deliveries are negotiated by these organisations. In France, this figure is some 17%, and in Spain – 12%. Other Member States are following this welcome trend. The Commission recently approved 41 new programmes to promote agricultural products in the EU and in third country markets, worth EUR 130 million over three years. Some EUR 24 million are devoted to specific programmes on dairying. School milk schemes: last school year, 19 million children participated, with more than 300 000 tonnes of milk and milk products distributed for a total EU expenditure of EUR 66 million. As I mentioned, they have strengthened the role of the Milk Market Observatory. The economic board meets on a regular basis so that all actors can benefit from more timely and complete market information than ever. Some voices claim that increasing intervention prices is the solution. It is one of the options that are certainly mentioned in Mr Nicholson's report. In my view, this could be counterproductive, because this product has to be put out on the market in the future, and it is apparent that farmers and economic operators follow market signals. Let me also be very clear about proposals to increase intervention prices. This would do nothing but delay the inevitable – a necessary adjustment – and make it even more painful in the future, in our view. And as we move towards a market-orientated policy, which is the policy agreed by the legislators, such a move would give the wrong signal. There is a need to change our mindset. The goal is not to produce as much as we can, but as much as we can find a market for. While I accept that there is a short-term difficulty (being experienced in the milk sector – and I hope my words will not come back to haunt me, Mr Nicholson, in relation to that statement), I believe that we should concentrate our energy on helping the European dairy sector reap the full benefit of the long-term positive prospects in terms of world consumption.  This is a sector with enormous potential. There is an increased global demand of 2% and an increased middle class in the Far East. We must all work together to ensure that we get our main share of this particular market and achieve our full potential.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 144, "date": "2015-07-06.json", "name": "Petri Sarvamaa", "mepid": "112611", "text": "   rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control. – Mr President, first of all let me salute the rapporteur for this very extensive report.

The most important thing that we have to understand is that we are not just talking about the price of milk or counting who gets how much – we are not counting milk drops.

The milk-producing sector is living in very hard and nervous times in the face of the decline in market prices. Russia's announcement to extend the embargo against European exports of milk and other agricultural products has recently been added to the abolition of the quota regime last April. The sector has been dragging on difficulties in dealing with production costs and rising price volatility for years. Now, the situation is of great uncertainty and therefore needs the support of the European institutions. I believe that the European Commission and the Member States should listen to Parliament's complaints in the report we are going to vote on this week, in which we have tried to find solutions for the future. The European Union should be equipped with more appropriate and operational instruments than those offered by the current common market organisation to address the problems of the sector. For starters, the current safety net should be improved as it is completely inoperative. There should be an update of intervention prices that takes into account the reality of the market. On the other hand, a real crisis warning system must be put in place accompanied by the management tools necessary to prevent the collapse of the prices levied by farmers. It is of no use to have a European press observatory if it is not used in real time to alert you to the arrival of critical situations. To make efficient use of this observatory, it would be necessary to define crisis levels, in accordance with the indicators established for the whole European Union, which should include the loss of economic margins by dairy farms. It seems to me, moreover, that producer organisations should be endowed with greater bargaining power in the face of the links in the food chain in order to reduce the level of great helplessness in which farmers often find themselves. In many countries, like mine, the market is dominated by raw milk, so it is also necessary to encourage the improvement of the added value of production and innovation measures. Measures must be taken to prevent the use of milk as a claim by commercial establishments. The dairy sector is of great...

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has It was right to assess the milk package and to critically question what works and what needs to be improved in this regard. Within the EU countries, this package has been implemented in very different ways, and many have not taken advantage of the opportunities to set up producer organisations and pool milk producers. Even during the quota system, different milk disbursement prices of eight to ten cents were normal within the 28 Member States. The price of milk has never been uniform, and the dairy structure and the different production ranges would never have allowed it. Now, after the end of the milk quota, the situation on the milk market is very difficult. There is great uncertainty among farmers, not least because the Russian embargo was a political decision. We must not leave farmers in the rain here. Personally, three things were particularly important to me in this report: rapid data collection from the Member States in order to monitor the market in a timely manner and to take swift action, special protection for the less-favoured mountain areas – the importance of the dairy industry for rural areas and the cultural landscape is very high here – and, thirdly, to use the super-levy funds – EUR 900 million this last year – for specific purposes in the milk sector. The current situation in the dairy sector clearly shows that an effective safety net is essential to preserve family farms. The possible market measures are not enough. In addition to private storage, a moderate increase in the intervention price may also be necessary. In addition, the income-generating direct payments of the first pillar will continue to be an important addition in the future. I am very concerned about inequality in the supply chain. All Member States are called upon to support the possibility of bundling. I would like to thank the rapporteur, whose words I am happy to agree with.

I want to commend Mr Nicholson for his work, but I would have preferred Parliament’s report to have been more adventurous in issues that would address price volatility, particularly around the issue of an intervention price. An intervention price is a strong tool to balance a volatile market, but the intervention price has to reflect the cost of production.

Even more thousands of cowsheds are simply not accepted socially. Nor is there any balance at all in this report between animal production and plant production, and there is a complete lack of animal welfare. We need to bring milk back to grassland. We must bring milk to regions where milk production is reasonable, and that is precisely what the report has not sufficiently included.  We are now back at the beginning of a crisis. In Spain, 20 000 litres of milk have now been sprayed on the fields again. In France, dairy farmers are already mobilising again. In Spain, the aim is to reduce the price to eighteen cents.

What is absent is a clear strategy for the industry to ride out the current market pressures. Action is called for on symptoms without always a clear understanding of causes. The report highlights that the CAP has failed in its intended social outcome to keep farmers viable regardless of their size. However, this is not a reason to start market interventions with consequent trade distortions.  Calls for a cost-of-production formula assume that there is a single magical figure. In reality, cost of land to rent or for mortgage, repayment on loans for farm buildings and equipment, proportion of unpaid family labour, access to cheap by-products for feed, the impact of nitrate-vulnerable zones (NVZs) and other regulations make a single cost-of-production figure quite impossible. And of course, some producers concentrate on low-cost milk but have to accept lower prices, and some vice versa. If we want to keep farmers on the land for purely social reasons, then Pillar 2 is more appropriate. Current market pressures are affecting large farmers just as much as smaller colleagues, but the rush to expand, post-quota, is not always based on objective business planning. Despite these low prices, agricultural lenders tell me that they have plenty of requests from clients to fund dairy expansion. I would urge dairy farmers to look at the pig, poultry and egg sectors, because that is their future.

Mr President, the end of milk quotas leads to the concentration of farms, job losses and the destruction of rural areas. In 30 years, the number of dairy farms has been divided by five and 20% of dairy cows are located on farms with more than 100 cows. As a result, one in three farmers is at risk of disappearing in the coming years. Agriculture without a peasant, as survivors are obliged to obey the laws of free trade productivity, this is what we have been denouncing for 30 years.  Our farmers must also suffer the consequences of your diplomatic vassalisation with the Russian embargo, not to mention the consequences of your transatlantic treaty on the dairy sector. Your text therefore increases the supervision of producers vis-à-vis banks and private capital. Since the reform of CAP 92, farmers have been left with their feet tied to the laws of the market.  We have seen this again, most recently, in France, where producers' anger at mass distribution is becoming more and more despairing. Your plan is suicidal. It is the futures markets that are killing farmers, and you want to build on that mechanism. Also taking advantage of price volatility to increase competitiveness, as you ask in your project, is to have the will to sacrifice the least profitable farms on the altar of free trade. Smaller farms could also concentrate on the internal market, thus promoting local circuits and food independence, especially in disadvantaged areas, which would also be a means of preserving the territorial balance, as desertification threatens rural areas.

The price of milk has been determined by supply and demand for the last seven years. Volume control by Brussels was from then on unnecessary. It is good that the milk quota has been abolished.

We need specific measures and support here. It will not work differently in these areas and will not be any different, but only with specific measures. And I believe that Europe must not look the other way. We need these high-quality products, and above all we also need the services of farmers in these areas, which really guarantee comprehensive milk production in Europe. And here again my demand – and we have also discussed this in some debates – is that the revenue from the super levy, which really comes from the sector, should be returned to the sector for specific purposes. This would be a huge relief, especially for investment and the like, if it were to cost the European taxpayer nothing, because it comes from overproduction and it is a matter of fines for farmers.

The sector is the most sensitive sector in agriculture, so it deserves special attention. Dairy producers are particularly vulnerable to the differences in revenues and risks that the market brings, and the demands for greater competitiveness of products are broken right across their backs. Manufacturers have high market energy production costs and prices are volatile. Ultimately, production costs often exceed milk sales prices, which leads small family farms to ruin. If we add to this the unfair trading practices and the Russian embargo faced by milk producers, then it is clear that it is necessary to take targeted measures and adopt a crisis program.  I call on the Commission to adopt a crisis programme, as without it milk producers will be in an even worse position and milk purchasers and large corporations will gain more power. I therefore emphasise the need to oblige milk purchaser to conclude longer-term contracts on an integrated supply chain, forward contracts and fixed margin contracts, in order to allow the milk price to be fixed corresponding to the actual production costs for a fixed timeframe. This is important because in many areas with difficult production, mountainous and island areas, milk production is the only generator of family income and employment and the continuation of milk production is important to avoid leaving the country and to keep young people living in the countryside.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 175, "date": "2015-07-06.json", "name": "Maria Noichl (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124836", "text": "   Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his excellent work and for the work she has done.

Many farmers in my region are struggling with TB as well. It is a tough industry to work in and they face volatile times. But quotas and supply management are not the answer. We cannot hold back the whole of the EU just because of a few small farms in the mountains or in islands. However, we do need to make sure that farmers remain on the land in all parts of the EU.

In Pillar 1 they have coupled payments, LFA payments and redistributive payments, and they also have rural development programmes.

And how can it be that one can speak in favour of the abolition of the milk quota and thus of more production, even though it is now whistling the sparrows from the roofs: milk is a product that makes us human beings sick. Talk to nutritionists! Milk is extremely harmful to the environment and, incidentally, milk production is an unacceptable animal cruelty.

In the Netherlands, the milk price currently stands at 30 cents per kilo. The actual cost in the family business is at least 40 cents per kilo of milk. As a result of the fall in the demand for dairy products from China and the Russian boycott, dairy production is no longer cost-covering in the Netherlands. The sector is under pressure. Last year I warned of the potential risks that the end of the milk quota could pose to our family and family businesses. As the dairy sector faces an uncertain future, we need to see what instruments we can use if the current situation persists. This also applies to other sectors. A fair sandwich for farmers and farmers at the kitchen table and the preservation of the dairy sector in Europe are of great importance. Dairy farming plays an indispensable role for our countryside, our food security, the economy, tourism and agricultural nature management in the Netherlands and in Europe. This may cost money, but we must be careful not to take hasty measures that distort the market. (The President deprives the speaker of the floor.) The European Commission is finally providing scope for closing the cycle, of which the innovative mineral concentrate is also an indispensable part.

We therefore need new supply management tools, not comparable to those of the previous ones, to counter extreme price volatility.  The new agricultural guarantee model, presented by the European Investment Bank (EIB) last March, could be used by Member States to create new financial instruments and facilitate access to credit for dairy farmers. Eib intervention to manage the end of the milk quota system could be an important step: financial support from the EIB, in synergy with rural development programmes, would enable the dairy sector to achieve a multiplier effect in terms of growth and income.

This extremely negative situation runs through the sector across Europe, it is true, but it is a particular focus on the Azores, an outermost European region whose milk production accounts for 46 % of the regional economy, in which its producers are looking to us to ask for help, given the distressing situation they are experiencing.

I see that today, as a result of the crisis, things have changed a little. These tools must no doubt be consolidated and a framework that has real visibility for both producers and other players in the dairy sector. When the price of milk was good for producers, we were told that we should not make contracts, that it was much better like that; the industrialists themselves did not want contracts. Today, the tone is changing, industrialists are also finding that it would be better for them to have volumes guaranteed over time. I believe that this policy must be pursued, but at the same time we must remember that milk is a tool of land use policy.  The observatory we have set up gives us important elements. It must be completed on the charges component. I would remind you that in the CMO we have now introduced a criterion which allows the Commission to intervene when producers' expenses reach a price that is no longer in relation to the market price.

The disappearance of milk quotas seriously and unacceptably exacerbates the imbalances between large and small farmers, so that the existence of the latter is seriously jeopardised. The embargo imposed by Russia on dairy products and beyond is likely to cause market changes, generating imbalances in countries that did not have direct trade relations with them. Thus, in some countries, including Romania, the price of milk has reached ten eurocenters per litre, well below the cost price, with small farmers on the verge of imminent bankruptcy.  In view of price volatility, the Commission must immediately introduce measures into its work programme to strengthen and protect this sector at European level, and finding new markets such as that offered by TTIP, as well as developing existing ones, must be a major concern.

I want to acknowledge that there are challenges arising from changes in policy, but also that in the market place there is considerable volatility, and that has been acknowledged by me and indeed other speakers in this debate. So we are as one in terms of acknowledging that there are challenges in that area at the moment. But there are many tools that I have outlined in my contribution earlier, that have been used to cushion incomes for dairy producers. And one of the ones I mentioned was the voluntary coupled support, where EUR 820 million has been spent, and is being spent over the next few years, in helping dairy producers in 19 Member States. I will give you some examples in terms of how it is impacting farmers in some Member States: this turns into EUR 74 a cow in the mountainous areas of France that Mr Andrieu mentioned, up to EUR 530 a cow in Finland, EUR 300 a cow in Hungary, EUR 114 a cow in mountainous areas in Spain, EUR 250 per cow in Romania, EUR 65 a cow in Croatia and EUR 145 a cow in the Azores under the POSEI scheme, in addition to whatever the regional government wishes to give under the rural development programme. I give those as examples of where policies are being put in place to cushion the incomes of dairy producers, which has often been ignored: the contribution and the choices that you as legislators have given to Member States and regional governments in order to do that. Market intervention thresholds always come up but, as I mentioned in my contribution, the product that goes into intervention has to be put on the market at some place in the future. It is interesting at the moment that skimmed-milk powder is not going into intervention, and it would be interesting to analyse the reasons why. I am very conscious of the Russian ban and its impact on agricultural exports from dairy, and I am looking into how we can actually assist producers and, in taking account of some of the measures that have been made already, how we can roll those over in the future. I hope to be in a position to come back to those particular measures for farmers and for people in sectors other than dairy in the future. New markets are very important. In fact, butter products have achieved a buoyancy in 2015: up 8% in the first quarter, while skimmed milk powder has gone up 17%. Other products, like cheese, have gone down. So there are certainly some measures where the glass is half full. There is certainly a need for more promotion, and the budget has been increased in order to find third-country markets. In terms of volatility, there is a structural issue (I think Mr Smith is quite correct about that) in some Member States, particularly in the United Kingdom. I think that we need to look at ways in which we can assist in the establishment of better contractual relations between farmers and the industry and how some coops – in fact in some Member States – are establishing a lock-in price over a period of time at a very reasonable price. There are structural problems, I agree. At the European Investment Bank, in spite of what my friend Mr Flanagan said, it is not a compulsory option to take out a loan, but there are opportunities for people to get access to finance whether they are young farmers or whether they are people who want to expand. The food chain continues to be a source of concern, and we are watching carefully what is happening in the United Kingdom and Spain in order to give us some experience, and we look forward to the report of Ms McGuinness later this year, which will give us more information and explanation about what action we can take in order to improve the situation for the producer here. Super-levy instalments are the only policy vehicle at my disposal, because it was agreed by legislators back in 2003, confirmed in 2008 and again in 2013, that we were going to have a super levy. Farmers produced more milk in 2014 knowing that they were going to have to pay a super levy. The Council of Agricultural Ministers could not reach an agreement on a soft landing in relation to the super levy payments, so I did what I could, which was to apply a three-yearly interest-free instalment arrangement for the payment of that money. I will do what I can to maintain as much of that money as possible in the agricultural sphere. These are important issues that have been raised here this evening. I can certainly say, in the context of the Russian ban, new markets and volatility of the food chain, that we are making considerable efforts to implement measures that will meet the concerns you have expressed. There are direct support provisions which have not been mentioned too loudly here tonight, but I am bringing to your attention the fact that a considerable amount of expenditure – EUR 820 million – is cushioning farmers, even though the price of the product is reducing. I again want to thank the speakers – the rapporteur in particular – and the shadow rapporteurs for their input, and it has produced sufficient information for me to be able to take cogniscence of measures that can perhaps be taken in future on many of the areas that have been mentioned in the report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 193, "date": "2015-07-06.json", "name": "James Nicholson", "mepid": "1318", "text": "   rapporteur. – Madam President, can I first of all take the opportunity to thank everyone who participated in the debate. I think what it has proved here tonight is that there are many problems facing the dairy sector throughout the European Union. They may differ in different regions, and there may be different problems, but certainly the problems are there. There is not much doubt about that. I would also like to thank the Parliament services for ensuring that we had a full debate on this report tonight. That has proven to be very worthwhile as well. I am totally in agreement with many of the things that were said. The report covered wide issues, and none more than the needs of people in mountainous areas and peripheral areas. I tried to address that, and it is not an easy problem. It is a very serious problem, and it is more difficult for those who actually live in those areas. I have to be honest, Commissioner: I think that the Milk Market Observatory is not fit for purpose as it stands. You are going to have to do more, and you are going to have to do it more quickly. I would hope that, by autumn, you will come to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) with proposals as to what you are going to do there. Now is not a time to be following in Europe – we should be leading in Europe. I also believe that the money collected in the super levy should be kept within the industry and should not be taken by any other parts of the industry or given to any other parts of the Commission. Everybody speaks about volatility, but nobody has really got the right idea about how we actually deal with it or how we handle it. It is a very difficult subject. I would like to echo what Mairead McGuinness said: do not leave it too late. Mariann Fischer Boel promised us in the AGRI Committee, when she was in your position, that never ever again would dairy farmers have to wait so long for support. Do not leave it too late. Commissioner, I fear your honeymoon period is coming to an end. I noticed in my local agricultural press at the weekend that my local minister said that you and your staff were living in ivory towers in Brussels. I would not say that about you, because I know you are a much cleverer man. You will take on board the many things that have been said about the Commission here tonight. However, we do need the Commission to take action, to take these views on board, and to do something in the name of the dairy farmers who are suffering hardship at this present moment in time.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 194, "date": "2015-07-06.json", "name": "La Présidente. –", "mepid": "96952", "text": "   The debate is closed.

I am pleased that following the discussions and negotiations on the dossier, the proposal pays special attention to the impact of the Russian embargo, as well as the assistance of the most affected countries such as Bulgaria. The second main argument in the proposal is that previous decisions on quotas must be maintained in order to avoid further market volatility.

Manufacturers should be able to foreshadow some price margins in order to develop a market strategy tailored to the actual market requirements.  I believe that a revision of the reference price for the products subject to intervention is necessary so that the measures adopted so far by the Commission are effective and more attractive. I believe that the Milk Market Observatory could be improved by equipping it with a set of indicators for better market monitoring. These indicators should provide information on price margins and include both the Member State and the regional dimension, without increasing the administrative burden.

The European Union therefore needs to focus on protecting the interests of dairy farmers and strengthening the dairy sector. My fellow Northern Ireland MEP James Nicholson has put a producer-focused report on the table. I agree with him that the milk package's policy based on producer organisations and the strengthening of producers' bargaining power in negotiating are the paths on which we must move forward. Specific efforts should also be made to protect dairy farmers in disadvantaged areas and mountainous areas. The amounts withdrawn by the milk production levy should be kept within the agricultural budget and used for the competitiveness of the dairy sector.  The powers of producer organisations need to be further strengthened and their influence on the establishment of collective supply contracts should be further increased. The performance of the Milk Market Observatory still needs to be improved. Both of Hungary proposals to increase the effectiveness of crisis management have been included in the report. The European Commission should be called on to adjust intervention prices to the real market price and production costs. Furthermore, in the event of a major crisis, the application of export refunds should be activated on a temporary basis.

Since January this year, the buying-in prices of milk in Bulgaria are at the lowest levels in 5 years. In addition to the abolition of the quota regime on milk and milk products, the extension of the Russian embargo by another year further complicates the situation in the sector. I welcome the report as it proposes a number of measures to strengthen the bargaining position of dairy farmers and their ability to withstand market crises (strengthening contractual relations, stimulating association in the sector, risk management tools). Price volatility, as a consequence of the abolition of quotas, requires further action to preserve the livelihoods of the most vulnerable – small producers, producers in mountainous and disadvantaged areas. I therefore call for the return of superannuation funds back to the sector, providing for temporary emergency support to EU dairy farmers if the situation continues to deteriorate.

The report looks into the European Union’s common commercial policy and its impact on so-called public—private partnerships (PPPs). As everybody knows, PPPs are arrangements where the public sector and private sector act together in order to deliver certain types of services of general interest to the public. Those services could be, for instance, infrastructure, like roads, public transport, power plants or water treatment plants. They could also be some kind of social services, like health care or education. Last, but not least, in recent years, they could be realised in the field of innovative high-tech sectors. What is important to stress is that they are not current practice in well—developed countries, but they are becoming more and more important and widely used by donors in developing countries. PPP projects account for roughly 15% to 20% of total infrastructure investments in those countries. The report concentrates mainly on two aspects of PPP projects. One is, of course, the EU’s own interests, which means promotion of EU trade interests. Participating in PPP projects provides EU companies with a great opportunity to grow and to gain new markets, if we take into account the current market conditions, slow economic recovery and the remaining high levels of unemployment in Europe. We can all agree, I hope, that European companies can achieve growth only if they go international and enter other non-European markets. Therefore, we have to build success stories, models and good practices concerning PPPs to encourage our companies to go there. We also have to create things like one-stop shops or user-friendly platforms. We should use the good experiences of institutions already engaged in those projects, like the European Investment Bank and others. At the same time there is another goal, namely pursuing our development agenda. This is a crucial point. I think that we can create synergies with our development objectives by pursuing PPP projects. We all know that massive investments are required in developing countries in terms of infrastructure, energy supply or access to water. A substantial part of this funding will need to come from the private sector, where PPP can play a crucial role. Of course we also have bad examples, particularly in some developing countries where PPPs were in trouble. There were badly designed projects, engineering problems, too much bureaucracy, delays in realisation and poor project management. That is also why it is so important to work towards a common approach to tackling all those challenges. I think that this report could play a positive role in that. This report, I need to stress, does not make any attempt to establish new legislation or bureaucracy or anything like that. It just urges the EU institutions to take the necessary steps on the existing playing field to promote the participation of EU companies in PPP projects. It has been prepared in a spirit of very good cooperation between the political groups and committees.

The report underlines the high importance of public-private partnerships as a tool for economic growth, innovation and job creation. This has been the case in the EU and is increasingly true in our neighbourhood and in developing countries further afield. The report also underlines the opportunity provided by EU Trade and Investment Policy in negotiations to promote public-private partnerships in third countries and thereby increase the market access of EU companies in this area. The Commission welcomes the report’s call for improved transparency and fair competition in public-private partnerships in international trade relations. We will continue to strengthen efforts to include public-private partnerships to the greatest extent possible within the government procurement chapter of international trade agreements. Indeed, there are many points expressed in the report with which the Commission fully agrees and certainly welcomes. I want to give you some examples. Firstly, that public-private partnerships can foster innovative solutions and mobilise long-term private finance, facilitating complex projects in the public interest, notably in the infrastructure sector or other capital-intensive sectors. Secondly, that cooperation between the private and public sectors can foster innovation, research and development through increased competition. Thirdly, the importance of facilitating the participation of SMEs in public—private partnerships. Finally, PPPs give opportunities abroad, which can increase European companies’ market access in government procurement in countries outside the EU and redress the asymmetry between EU and other countries’ levels of openness in government procurement. At the same time, these represent great opportunities for developing countries to create wealth and develop the infrastructures that are needed for business. The Commission had welcomed the references in the rapporteur’s draft report to the positive synergies of public procurement and investment protection policies. In this regard, the Commission would have preferred a more explicit acknowledgment of the need to employ the EU’s investment policy to ensure that assets invested by EU investors in the context of long—term projects in third countries are effectively protected, including by negotiating adequate and impartial means of resolving potential problems. The Commission will be taking careful note of all of the recommendations made in this report and will continue to strengthen its efforts to ensure that the opportunities provided by PPPs can be best utilised.

There are large differences in the rate of organisation between Member States, but they reflect different starting points, and which therefore cannot justify the failure of policies. Increasing the organisational rate should remain a priority for the fruit and vegetables scheme.  The Commission's report and a study by Wageningen University draw attention to the lack of legal certainty, which is a significant obstacle to the development of POs, and I welcome D'Hogan's commitment to simplifying the fruit and vegetable regime.  We also draw attention to the need for funds to address the management of producer organisations. In direct contact with many of your representatives, we realize that there is a lack of qualified managers, and the fact that you are a capable producer does not mean that you are a good manager. And therefore, easing the organizations of producers of funds that allow to hire capable managers is a novelty that I would bring to this report. There also seems to be a consensus that crisis prevention and management tools are not being used sufficiently, and it is good to see that crises can arise not only because of market conditions, but also less often because of health problems or even for political reasons as in the recent case of the Russian embargo. We know that farmers are not at the root of the political crisis with Russia, and for this reason the European Union must continue to support all sectors suffering the consequences of the embargo.  In the report I also call on the Commission to step up its efforts to protect farmers from the unfair commercial practices of large retailers, large areas, which crush and impose prices which often make activity and, consequently, the association of producers unattractive. And one of the problems for which I have tried to draw much attention in the European Parliament has to do with the need to renew agriculture generationally, to ensure that the younger ones see agriculture as an activity that is appealing. So this report draws attention to the fact that only 7.5 % of farmers in the European Union are under 35 years of age. If producer organisations are more effective and more attractive, younger people will certainly find an alternative to their lives there as well.

Therefore, most producers are excluded from the direct benefits provided by the European Union regime, and on the other hand fruit and vegetable imports are growing, domestic fruit and vegetable producers are exposed to unfair competition and unfair trading practices.

At the same time, they continue to be exploited by the greats. The troika, with its proposals, dissolves the primary sector in Greece and calls for the abolition, firstly, of special schemes for farmers and, secondly, of refunds on motor oil, while promoting an increase in the tax rates on farmers' profits, all although the income of Greek farmers has been reduced by one and a half billion euros and the taxes paid have increased by 150%. Particular support should therefore be given to the fruit and vegetable sector in Greece, as without this aid it is extremely difficult to support and move forward with new fruit and vegetable producers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 247, "date": "2015-07-06.json", "name": "Ivan Jakovčić (ALDE).", "mepid": "124754", "text": "   - Madam President, Dear Mr. Rapporteur, I would like to draw your attention in some way to the two elements you presented in your report, which are particularly close to me.

On the one hand, unfair competition from third countries that produce with environmental and social conditions that are not allowed in Europe, and to whose products we allow entry. And, on the other hand, the pressure of the large distribution chains, which suffocate the producer and pay him prices of misery. The sector is mainly located in southern Europe and is very threatened, even though we are in deficit in fruit and vegetable production. This report makes it very clear that urgent action must be taken, because other words, land will continue to be abandoned and youth will continue to flee the camp. Southern farmers feel abandoned by Europe, and rightly so.

Secondly, I agree with the rapporteur that there is a crisis in farming. I have seen this personally over the last couple of weeks, speaking to young people and seeing the attitudes towards farming and the number of people who are not getting involved in farming. It is a massive problem. Thirdly, the report mentions children not eating enough fruit and vegetables. I would suggest that governments should be doing more in that respect. There is, though, a danger of too much of a top-down approach. We have seen that where schools start policing what is put in children’s lunchboxes, this can cause hostility and become counterproductive.

It certainly offers me an opportunity to briefly address some of the issues that have been raised in relation to fruit and vegetables here. The Russian import ban has been mentioned by a number of speakers in respect of European fruit and vegetables. It once again highlights the vulnerability of the sector, where surpluses of perishable products can cause large market disturbances and falling producer prices. I am examining this issue at the moment to see what can be done to assist producers. It also shows the importance of strong producer organisations to collectively deal with such unexpected and adverse situations. The current CMO regulation offers the tools for strengthening their bargaining position vis-à-vis major retailers, as well as through production planning, innovation, and crisis prevention and management measures. Therefore I welcome Mr Melo’s report as a contribution to the debate on how producer organisations can be strengthened even further to become even more efficient and also more attractive to both current and future members. The EU fruit and vegetable regime is certainly on the Commission’s political agenda. President Juncker has asked me to focus on reviewing this potential for further simplification within the first 12 months of our mandate. This meets one of the main requests of this report, which is to increase the attractiveness of producer organisations by increasing legal certainty and reducing the administrative burden. Throughout this year the Commission will carry out a simplification exercise regarding the fruit and vegetable rules that are contained in the Commission-level legislation. This will improve the functioning of the scheme and provide a clearer legal framework. However, we foresee no changes to the basic act this year. Producer organisations and their operational programmes thus remain a cornerstone of the regime. The issue of an increase in the overall level of support to producer organisations and to APOs, which requires a change in the basic act, will not be addressed as part of this simplification exercise, where we are concentrating on secondary legislation. Unfair trading practices in the food supply chain are also on our agenda, as you know. For abuses of relative bargaining power, or unfair trading practices as they are known, there is currently no regulatory framework at EU level, but a large number of Member States have now begun to regulate the issue at national level, particularly in the United Kingdom and Spain. I will continue to work with Ms Bieńkowska, who is the Commissioner for the Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs and the lead Commissioner on this issue, in order to address issues that have been brought to the attention of this House tonight, and on other occasions, relating to unfair trading practices. The Commission has asked the food chain to agree on a self-regulatory mechanism at EU level for the moment. All food chain representatives agreed on a list of principles of good practice in contractual relations as far back as 2011. Furthermore, key stakeholders have been implementing an EU-wide voluntary scheme, the Supply Chain Initiative, since the end of 2013, but regrettably not all actors in the food chain are participating at the moment. The Commission will make an assessment of existing national and EU work streams and unfair practices at the end of this year and come to conclusions about where to go from there. Let me welcome again the European Parliament’s initiative and Mr Melo’s report, which will of course further enrich the ongoing debate regarding the reform that is required in the fruit and vegetables regime.

The conditions created encourage producers to come together and establish international cooperation. It is not insignificant that organisations can set up an operational fund derived from contributions from their members and from EU financial assistance.  A number of indicators demonstrate that the policy in the fruit and vegetables sector was justified. However, these effects do not apply to all Member States. In less modernised regions, the organisation rate remains low and producer organisations are small both in terms of the number of producer members and the total value of market production.  Therefore, in order to encourage producers to set up organisations, administrative procedures need to be simplified, bureaucratic burdens reduced, organisationally supported and clear control rules put in place.

If the Commission does not take appropriate measures and does not take into account the rules that are sometimes too complex for some countries that are only at the beginning of the organisation phase in the OP, this imbalance situation could adversely affect all European producers who are already facing problems because of the Russian embargo.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has done What is the best way to get from Weimar to Lisbon? Despite the Internet even today, it is not an easy question to answer. The needs of travellers are very different. Some want to get to their destination as quickly as possible, others want to travel in the most sustainable way possible, and others are interested as tourists in choosing a well-worth seeing itinerary. Existing online travel planning services usually offer only a very limited range of travel options, which relate only to a few modes of transport and often only to travel within a Member State. Unfortunately, therefore, citizens keep coming back to their own cars as a travel alternative. Our aim should be to promote multimodal travel and to achieve seamless door-to-door transport with a single ticket, not only within a region, but across borders. Within my report, we are making specific demands to overcome the existing obstacles and difficulties on the way to EU-wide multimodal travel information, travel planning and ticketing services. Travellers need to be provided with a wide range of information that will give them a real choice between the different connections. Fair and equal access to real-time travel information is an important first step. Particular attention must be taken to the specific needs of persons with reduced mobility and of the elderly. Local and regional authorities need to be aware of their important role for the first leg of a journey – that is, the way from the front door – and the last section to the destination address. Without the networking of local and long-distance traffic, nothing can be done here. And national roadmap information systems need to be cross-border. Clear and transparent passenger rights for multimodal travel should also be defined. These do not exist at all today. Due to this legal uncertainty, travelling with different modes of transport is still unattractive. We must therefore significantly increase the attractiveness of multimodal travel, because they not only provide an efficient solution to existing congestion, but also promote sustainability, economic efficiency, energy efficiency and tourism in Europe. That is why we expect the Commission to provide a framework that concerns, at least once, the first step, that is, access to travel information. As far as ticketing services are concerned, the Commission should leave it to the sector itself to find appropriate solutions. However, unless significant progress can be made by 2020, it must take legislative action. Travellers should be given access to real-time information on possible disruptions, as well as on alternative travel options, both before and during the journey. Of course, a high level of data protection must be guaranteed in all processes. Finally, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs. They enabled broad cross-party support for the proposals in the Committee on Transport and Transport. We can now put these proposals on the way to industry and the European Commission.

In this way, through IT, we will create new jobs.

We also fully share the report’s emphasis on the end user and expected societal benefits. This is very much in line with the spirit and objective of the digital single market agenda promoted by the Commission. We need all the information we can get to deliver on key European transport policy goals, for instance in terms of reducing the environmental impact and increasing safety and security as well as enhancing the competitiveness of the European transport sector for the benefit of jobs and growth. Achieving all these goals has to be made compatible with the evolving mobility needs of society, notably urban mobility. The expected social benefits of more comprehensive multimodal travel information services are manifold and include better modal integration and more flexibility in case of disruptions. Ultimately, this information service contributes to efficiency gains in overall transport system management and in transport operations for both passengers and freight. For these services, the quality of the underlying data layer is a key aspect because it allows the provision of accurate and complete information to the end user. With the objective of setting a framework facilitating market—driven developments, notably in the field of ticketing, the Commission has already taken a number of these initiatives. The market shaped by people for people should offer travellers complete and reliable information on various travel options which is displayed in a neutral way, not biased by any communication or commercial interest or restricted according to the traveller’s geographical location. Particular attention should be given to symptoms of unfairness and disloyal competition. In the case of data related to road traffic and road infrastructure, mechanisms for sharing that data amongst public and private shareholders are being implemented in the Member States. However, the same cannot be said for travel information, as has already been pointed out. Accessible and available good—quality multimodal travel data that this interoperable and high quality is lacking so far. Timetables across the modes, as identified by Parliament, are one of the key data elements. In this context, the implementation of the ITS Directive provides the opportunity for the Commission to promote fair and equal access to data, an aim which also underpins different existing initiatives. By definition this is a cornerstone for creating a sound framework for better services and an essential element for a level playing field among service providers. The Commission welcomes action by the Member States targeted at improving the interoperability of ticketing systems, including across borders, as well as public sector initiatives enabling stakeholders to share market opportunities and improve service management, like the smart ticketing alliance for public transport and the full service model in the rail sector. Let me stress that the Commission fully agrees with Parliament’s assessment that the provision of information should be tailored to the needs of all travellers, including persons with reduced mobility. Another important point concerns transparent market conditions and fair and non-discriminatory access to the market, as well as a clear definition of the rights of the end users: consumer protection, data protection and privacy. This would greatly benefit the provision of more and better services.
