The Council attaches great importance to such investigative journalism. Not only have these revelations been instrumental in providing bases for informed policy-making, but they have also helped in creating political awareness. It might be the case that many of the practices described in the Paradise Papers are formally legal; however, we cannot exclude that certain schemes exist with the sole objective of reducing the taxes that would otherwise be due. This is unfair for those citizens and enterprises who are paying their fair share of taxes. Against this background, Member States are working very hard to change the legislation so that unwanted practices leading to loss of tax revenue would become illegal. Here, we have to work in the context of 28 different systems of national law which, strictly speaking, fall into the area of national competence, but progress is being made.  The Council and the Commission have worked hand in hand. The Commission was quick to present new proposals to tackle the problems identified and the Council swiftly found necessary compromises and has adopted tax legislation. The list of EU legislation that the Council has adopted against tax evasion and tax avoidance over the last four years, under the unanimity rule, is impressive, especially compared to the previous decades. Clearly, our response is picking up speed. Just to name a few: the revision of the Savings Taxation Directive and of the parent Subsidiary Directive, the adoption of four successive revisions of the Directive on Administrative Cooperation in Tax Matters, the adoption of a new Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and of amendments concerning hybrid mismatches, the adoption of a new Directive on Dispute Resolution Mechanisms and, lastly, the conclusion of EU agreements on automatic exchange of information with five ‘third countries’ to the European Union.  In some of the cases, for instance with regard to hybrid mismatches, the measures are just about to be implemented by Member States. Their impact on the tax avoidance practices highlighted in the Paradise Papers will therefore only be visible in a few years’ time. We have also adopted conclusions at the Ecofin meeting in November 2016 setting out the process for establishing an EU list of non-cooperative third country jurisdictions for tax purposes. This important work is led by the Council’s Code of Conduct Group for Business Taxation and has been particularly intense over the past months, including in terms of dialogues with a number of countries. At this stage the Code of Conduct Group is seeking commitments from jurisdictions to address the issues that were determined by our experts in the areas of tax transparency, fair taxation and the implementation of anti-base erosion and profit shifting standards. This work of promoting good tax governance standards is also carried out in coordination with the OECD and G20 agenda.  The Code of Conduct Group also continues to perform other important non-legislative tasks such as peer review of our Member States’ potentially harmful tax regimes, development of new guidance to enable fairer tax competition between Member States, dialogue with our immediate neighbours (recently Switzerland and Liechtenstein), and an update of the tax good governance clause to be included in EU agreements with third countries.  All in all, these legislative and non-legislative initiatives just mentioned have been politically important steps for the EU. Among the results achieved so far, we have seen bank secrecy de facto coming to an end, a shift of our policy focus from removing double taxation to tackling double non-taxation, development of new EU policy instruments to combat tax avoidance, and steps taken towards harmonisation of our national practices affecting the functioning of our single market.  However, we cannot be complacent. More work will be needed, since tax planning methods are evolving constantly. We are currently examining several proposals, inter alia the revision of the Mandatory Disclosure Rules Directive, which would require tax advisers to disclose aggressive tax planning schemes to their tax administration. In addition, work is ongoing on several VAT legislative proposals, where we hope to adopt the VAT e-commerce package at the next Ecofin meeting on 5 December.  The Presidency has also initiated a debate on the taxation of the digital economy, which should provide input into OECD discussions. We are also happy that the Commission has announced that it will put forward a legislative proposal on this matter next spring. On this front, we will need the cooperation of our global partners so that international tax rules could be revised and adjusted to the reality of digitalisation. We are, in this respect, closely monitoring international developments. The Council is taking the Paradise Papers revelations very seriously and is moving fast to deliver progress. A fairer tax system is what our citizens expect from us.

Every day, new information appearing in the newspapers of all our countries sheds more light on what must be called a planetary, perfectly oiled circuit of aggressive tax planning. A real system of aggressive tax planning. I am shocked, but I am not surprised. We have known for a long time that multinationals, wealthy taxpayers, consulting firms and banks work hand in hand to exempt huge sections of income from tax and that they spare neither their money nor their imagination. We are not here in the face of isolated incidents, but in the face of practices that are systemic, which are global and which are organized. These aggressive tax-optimization schemes are all the more shocking in that many of them - this remains to be verified - are apparently legal. Therefore, we must respond on the ground of law to a defect in the law, with a new regulatory framework. If it is legal, as some claim, then the law has to be changed and that is what I want to do with the help of this Parliament. This is why, since the start of my mandate at the European Commission, I have emphasized transparency, because I am convinced that transparency is our first weapon. It is this that will put an end to the culture of secrecy and the feeling of impunity of the practitioners and beneficiaries of tax evasion. These are a bit like vampires in a way: they fear nothing more than the light. It is up to us to shed this light. Today, there are three major proposals to be finalized to ensure greater transparency in our tax systems. In what Concerning the first, I proposed to you, last June, new transparency rules for tax intermediaries, that is to say the lawyers, bankers, consultants who sell these tax optimization schemes. Behind that, there is an approach, indeed, quite commercial. If the proposal I made is accepted, they will systematically have to declare these arrangements to the tax authorities of the buyer's country. If these schemes are illegal, then tax administrations can take legal action. If they are legal, tax administrations can spot the loophole and fix it. I hope, and I say this firmly here, that the Council adopts the proposal on tax intermediaries within the next six months. This is an easy proposition, which is simple, and therefore it is above all a question of political will. There's no time to lose. There is no real reason to delay this adoption. At the same time, as you know, my colleague, Vera Jourová, has proposed more transparency on beneficial owners within the framework of the directive against money laundering. This information must be public in order to fight against the opaque structures that the “Paradise Papers” have revealed. Today, I must admit that the negotiations are struggling to find a satisfactory answer and outcome. I deeply regret this and encourage the co-legislators to do their utmost to ensure that these new rules can be applied as quickly as possible. The citizens would not understand our inaction after the new warning shot constituted by the “Paradise Papers”. The second proposition that I fundamentally hold on to is targeting businesses through mandatory public disclosure, country by country. What would this publication actually change? It would give every citizen a power of control and pressure that he does not have today. If that is achieved, we would have a publication accessible to all, to citizens, to the media, to NGOs, to you parliamentarians, of accounting and fiscal data which, today, are made available - this is already progress - of tax administrations, but only them. Because it is through pressure from the press, it is through pressure from public opinion that the rules can be changed. These \"Paradise Papers\", like all these scandals, are good news and bad news every time. A bad one because they reveal, a good one because they are a very decisive spur. Here again, I say to those who are hesitant in the Council: I do not believe that we should oppose transparency and competitiveness. On the contrary, I think that transparency is a factor in the competitiveness of companies and that a company always has an interest in behaving as a good citizen, as a good taxpayer ex ante rather than being then denounced ex post in revelations or leaks. . Do not be afraid of this publication of information country by country, I insist on this notion of publication. That’s what I’ve been saying since the first day I’m here. Finally, this is my third proposal, we must equip ourselves with a European blacklist of tax havens that the Member States wanted to establish on their own responsibility, the Minister spoke about. I made a commitment to complete this list quickly after the Panama Papers scandal, and the Commission quickly made its proposal. I urge Member States to adopt it this time around, not in six months, but at the next Council of Finance Ministers, the Ecofin Council on 5 December. On December 5, we must have a blacklist of tax havens. The work undertaken so far in this framework has already led, at this stage, to interesting advances. 92 third countries were, as we say \"screened\", examined, and the vast majority have cooperated with experts from the European Union. Several of them have already committed to reforming their tax laws to bring them into line with European standards, but I am convinced that we still have enough to make a credible list. The other problematic countries still now have the opportunity to make commitments at the highest political level, in writing, by the end of this week, not later. Member States have indicated that these commitments will be taken into account when the blacklist is adopted in early December, but I call on Member States and the Code of Conduct Group to stand firm and united on the demands of the European Union and to accept only very concrete commitments. These commitments must be sufficiently precise on the substance, in particular for third countries which, today, do not apply any tax on profits. In my opinion, not applying income tax is a serious breach. The absence of taxes should not be used by these countries to artificially attract profits made elsewhere and thus encourage the establishment of \"letterbox companies\". What I want is a list that is credible, ambitious, with dissuasive sanctions. No mystery. Fraudsters and tax havens must be hit with the wallet to shake things up. It is a crucial fight to be won in the coming weeks. The last discussion of the Ecofin Council made me rather optimistic, even if I still heard from some ministers such and such nuance that they will be able, I hope, to erase it by 5 December. Yes, sanctions are needed and yes, having no income tax is definitely a problem. I say that to some of my colleagues who spoke at that time. A word on another notion. Along with transparency, we also need a convergence of rules fiscal. It is the absence of common rules in Europe that allows companies to practice this aggressive tax planning. This system thrives and endures thanks to loopholes in current national laws, as well as to the differences between these laws. That is why, here again, I call on the Member States to adopt the European corporate tax base as soon as possible. The CCCTB would indeed make it possible to further limit the artificial transfers of benefits between countries which are one of the major problems we are facing. Here again, the ball is in the capital's court to move forward on this major project. It is imperative to speed up the discussions and adopt a timetable for concluding this common and consolidated European corporate tax base in 2018. It is essential that this text is now the subject of an agreement. Ladies and gentlemen parliamentarians, remarkable progress has been made in the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion under this mandate. I do not want and I cannot let it be said that the European Union has sinned by inaction. No, we have made progress together that had not been made before and we must not flog each other, beat each other up. We are not responsible for what goes wrong, but we are responsible for trying to make things better. Bank secrecy no longer exists across Europe, not just the European Union, since this year. Taxation of profits where they are generated limits the transfer of profits to countries with favorable taxation. It exists thanks to us. With the adoption of the measures currently on the table, which I have recalled, our anti-escape shield would be considerably strengthened. If these measures had been put in place over the past three years, if transparency was the rule, if the light was shed, so I think we could have avoided the latest scandal. Member States must assume their responsibilities by transposing the measures already adopted as quickly as possible. Some of the cases raised by the \"Paradise Papers\" result from legal provisions that will have to be repealed as part of the application of the anti-tax avoidance directives. Why wait until the last moment and let practices continue that should no longer apply? We must speed up the work by adopting the list of tax havens on December 5, adopting rules on tax intermediaries within six months, and adopting the European tax base for corporate tax within a year. You can see that I am setting an agenda for our common work for the coming year. I know that I can count on the European Parliament because de facto we have been allied since the start of this long-term battle with different sensitivities and positions to push the Member States down this path in which they do not always engage spontaneously. , but that they always end up following thanks to you and a little thanks to us. I want to thank you warmly here, because none of the progress we have made together over the past three years would have been possible without the support of the European representation. Now we have to take another decisive step, again we will do it together.

We do not know how many millions of documents, with more than 100 000 names, constitute illegal behaviour. Maybe most of them are actually legal; but they matter, not only because in the view of many people they are immoral – they matter because they are harming our society. Extensive use of loopholes in tax systems, or intentional or unintentional creation of special tax regimes by some tax authorities, are harming our economy. They are harming competition, they are creating unfair ways of increasing inequality. They are harming fiscal policy and, as a consequence, citizens are losing their trust in our society.  How to react on actions that can in a broad sense be legal? There are two basic tools. The first one is better, simpler and clearer tax rules, and we should make them. And the second is to convince the others to do the same. As the European Union, we are in an extremely good position to pursue this agenda. First of all, we are a superpower. We can not only lead by example, but more decisively use soft and hard powers to persuade the others that are making the game unfair. And secondly, we must acknowledge that many of the problems are not outside the EU but within the EU.  This is the moment where I have to turn to the Finance Ministers, because they have the power. This is what the Treaty says. They have power but they also have responsibility, so I ask you, or rather I urge you, not to use the cheap excuses, not to insist on small benefits for you that are paid for in multiples by the others, and not to hide behind the unanimity rules and to act.  We should modernise the tax regime. We can close the loopholes. And in some cases, do not be afraid to go for harmonisation. I am not talking about tax rates, I am talking about the tax base.

Our economy is devoured by a cancer: tax fraud and fraud. It is shameful that, while states were being forced into austerity horse care, some multinational corporations and private citizens stole billions of euros from public coffers by not paying taxes. We have denounced this shame as Socialists and Democrats and we must acknowledge the Juncker Commission and Commissioner Moscovici in particular for having put important and courageous proposals on the table. I am thinking of reporting country by country: we want information on their financial activities to be reported country by country in the financial statements of multinationals. It is right for citizens to know where the multinationals make their profits because it is in that country that they have to pay taxes. We repeat it to the point of boredom: taxes must be paid in the country where the profits are made. Parliament approved its position on this. What is the Council doing? What are the Member States doing? Very little, almost nothing. We also want a clear and credible definition of a tax haven. The current list contains Trinidad and Tobago, that's ridiculous! Make a credible list and foresee sanctions. On this too, the Member States are holding back. Furthermore, those who are smart must pay. Competent authorities must suspend or revoke the banking licenses of financial institutions and financial advisors who help organize fraud. Behind all these scandals there are always the usual suspects, the usual consultants, the usual banks. On these commitments we challenge the Council.

We are dealing with another major leak, the fourth such leak in just two years. We had the Luxembourg Leaks, we had the Panama Papers, we had the Bahamas Papers, and now the Paradise Papers are coming. Every time such a scandal arises - and slowly one desensitizes oneself to the word “scandal”, slowly one no longer perceives it to be so scandalous because one such leak comes after the other - it says: Well, it it may well be that it was all legal. We must not turn a blind eye to it. If all of this were so legal, the people who do it would hardly be allowed to do it on any Caribbean island. Then hardly anything would happen somewhere in the dark. We have to be very clear: Even if it is technically legal, then it was against the meaning of the law because this kind of secrecy was practiced. And it's not just that the things are perhaps formally legal, but it goes beyond the area of ​​aggressive tax avoidance into the area of ​​tax evasion, money laundering, corruption, terrorist financing, and it works, as we have seen have even entered the realm of targeted political murder. In Malta, for example, where whistleblowers who have disclosed something have to die for such things.

We saw it in the Panama Papers - exposed by journalists. We saw it in the Bahamas Papers - exposed by journalists. We have now seen it at the Paradise Papers - exposed by journalists.

I would like to thank the journalists again for their work.

The Committee calls on the European Union and its Member States to properly implement and reinforce its legal tools, to shift from secrecy to transparency, mutual cooperation and exchange of information. It urges both the Commission and the Member States to step up their efforts, commitments, cooperation and investment in financial and human resources, to improve supervision and enforcement. It counts on the leading role of the Commission in setting up criteria for a common EU list of non—cooperative tax jurisdictions, and calls on the Council not to dilute, but rather to increase, the ambition of the criteria of the said list. It calls for more efficient sanctions against banks and intermediaries that are knowingly involved in illegal tax or money laundering schemes. There are more than 200 recommendations adopted by the Committee. The way to prevent money laundering, tax avoidance and tax evasion is charted, and a lot has already been done, but still more needs to be done in the area of adoption, implementation and enforcement of legislation.

What will they gain in the eleventh, can they finally hope for fair taxation? Assuming that nothing here is illegal, which we can doubt, is it legitimate? Because one thing is certain, fiscal injustice is not the product of a natural phenomenon, it is on the contrary the result of deliberate political choices. It is not without their knowledge that for 30 years, the elected political majorities in Europe have made our taxes less and less progressive and have competed in creativity to create the loopholes in which the profiteers of the system are engulfed. But why, why, even today, those who govern us, like here in France, Emmanuel Macron, continue to pass tax laws that benefit the richest? Of course, there is in some the will to lick the hand that feeds them, or perhaps will feed them one day. But above all, there is this sham that making the rich richer, and protecting mega-corporations, benefits everyone. In reality, all of this only reinforces their capacity to extract rent from our societies and the planet. This is why the tax administrations have been reduced to a dry regime, which is why the accounting transparency of multinationals and that of the beneficiaries of trusts, foundations and shell companies is still not the rule.

(Interjection from Mr Lamberts: ‘So what?’) Now I say this at a time – I am going to come back to ‘so what?’ and it may have some personal interest for you as well – when the use of money and the influence it may have had on the Brexit result, or the Trump election, has reached a level of virtual hysteria. Just last week the Electoral Commission in the UK launched an investigation to find out whether the Leave campaign took offshore money or Russian money. This came about as a result of questions asked in the House of Commons by one Ben Bradshaw, somebody linked to an organisation called Open Society.  I just wonder when we are talking about offshore money, when we are talking about political subversion, when we are talking about collusion, I wonder whether we are looking in the wrong place. And I say that because George Soros recently gave Open Society – his organisation, which of course campaigns for free movement of peoples and supports supranational structures like the European Union – USD 18 billion. And his influence here and in Brussels is truly extraordinary. Open Society boasts that they had 42 meetings last year with the Commission. They have even published a book of reliable friends in the European Parliament and there are 226 names on that list, including yours, Sir. I thought you would find this interesting.  We even had last week Mr Verhofstadt lobbying on behalf of Mr Soros at the Conference of Presidents in a battle that is going on with Viktor Orbán, the Prime Minister of Hungary.  If we are going to have a debate and we are going to talk about full, political and financial transparency, well let’s do it. So I shall be writing today to all 226 of you asking some pretty fair questions: ‘Have you ever received funds, directly or indirectly, from Open Society?’ ‘How many of their events have you attended?’ ‘Could you please give us a list of the meetings of all the representatives, including George Soros, yourself.’ And I think this Parliament should now set up a special committee to look into all of this.

I would like to refer to a Scandinavian study on the subject of tax avoidance and tax inequality based on an HSBC dataset from the Swiss Leaks, which says that recipients of very large capital incomes engage in tax evasion when the risk of discovery is as low as possible, and that even applies to countries with a high level of social cohesion and high legal compliance as in Scandinavia. Corporations, on the other hand, do not evade taxes, they optimize their assessment by means of license fees, trademark rights, patent boxes or internal transfer prices - all completely legal - with the aim of minimizing the tax burden. And the EU has responded with two pillars, namely with two areas of action: increasing transparency and closing tax loopholes. Great progress has been made in both areas over the past year and a half; more than a hundred states have committed to sharing information on financial accounts. There is country-specific reporting, there is a catalog of measures against tax avoidance, and there is the OECD's BEPS action plan.

That is why the responsibility of the Member States is not only to improve cooperation between the authorities, to introduce reporting requirements and to draw up a black list of non-cooperative third countries, but we have to ensure order within the European Union ourselves. That is why the European Parliament decided on its measures. It is not enough to say: it is the others who do it, we have to start.

The Apple leak shows that Apple settled on Jersey, but it also highlights the role that the Irish Government played in helping Apple set up its new tax avoidance structure. In 2014, the Irish Government claimed it was abolishing the notorious ‘double Irish’ but not only did they provide an absurdly long phase-out period, they also created a grace period that allowed new companies to be established which could then use the double Irish until 2020. The Paradise Papers show Apple took full advantage of this move to set up the ‘double Irish’ structure in Jersey. How many more billions in profit will this scheme allow Apple to avoid paying in tax over this period? Apple has repeatedly shown its contempt for ordinary taxpayers by using every trick in the book to avoid paying its fair share of tax, and yet this is the company that the Irish Government is desperately trying to avoid collecting unpaid taxes from.

Due to the active complicity of certain Member States, large American digital companies, such as Apple, legally manage to pay an effective tax on their European profits which is close to zero. Profits made throughout the European Union are in fact reallocated to parent companies, notably in Ireland and Luxembourg, where they are subject to insignificant taxation before their final departure for tax havens.

The only way to combat the phenomenon is legal regulation, the severity of penalties and sanctions. Let us consider on a case-by-case basis the imposition of severe prison sentences, the abolition of parliamentary immunity, the confiscation of property and the deprivation of civil rights. Such a legislative initiative will bring all of us face to face with the responsibilities of our actions and deprive professional politicians of entanglement of their freedom of impunity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 65, "date": "2017-11-14.json", "name": "Romana Tomc (PPE).", "mepid": "125104", "text": "- We are all outraged when we find out about a new affair, but it doesn't end there.And we cannot say that we have done nothing at European level to prevent tax evasion, but we obviously still have a great deal of room for maneuver.Although we can do a lot with legislation, control and sanctions are just as important, and this is where the rule of law works.If this is not the case, it is all in vain.I support greater transparency, the restriction of unconditional tax secrecy and blacklists, but these lists must not be an end in themselves.In my opinion, however, we should also deal a little more with the causes of tax avoidance in this issue.Of course, it is clear that we do not even support tax evasion.If the law allows a company not to pay tax at all, then that is not fair.However, countries should be careful in designing their tax systems and not use their systems to drive businesses elsewhere.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 66, "date": "2017-11-14.json", "name": "Maria Grapini (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124785", "text": "- Madam President, Commissioner, we have been debating an extremely important subject for two hours, I have debated it before.

What I'm seeing, I'm not surprised either, is a very strong convergence of views between us on political will, but also on the measures to be adopted. This alliance between the Commission and the European Parliament is fundamental if we want to continue our fight against tax evasion, fraud and aggressive tax optimization. Basically, now the stake is on the table, and it is to win the battle against tax evasion. To those who say the opposite, I still answer that we have made, yes, a lot of progress over the past three years and I am impressed by this real revolution in transparency, which is underway, with all the same a historic advance. that we must promote is the end of banking secrecy in Europe. But, you are all right, this is not enough, in the face of a phenomenon that is systemic and global. We must therefore continue to act with determination and quickly, with even more determination, even more speed. In 18 months, our citizens will vote to elect a new European Parliament and if we do not show change on this fundamental subject, we will lose all these elections to the benefit of the populists, the cynics who, in truth, are the allies of the fraudsters. We must therefore all take our responsibilities. All? Who is he? It is first of all the Member States, which have already started their evolution, but which sometimes still have hesitations, which must go further, which must speed up their work, which must quickly conclude on the proposals that are on the table. I am thinking of the announcement, on December 5, of the European list of tax havens and dissuasive sanctions. I am thinking of rules like the fight against tax intermediaries within six months. I think about a European tax base for companies within a year and I am also thinking, of course, of the ongoing trilogue on money laundering. It is then the European Commission which must assume its responsibilities. Believe it, this Commission, and myself as Commissioner responsible for taxation, will continue this battle relentlessly until the last day of our mandate. There will be no final year, shy on this ground. Other proposals will come which will all push for more transparency, more cooperation between tax administrations and, until then, I will continue to urge Member States to adopt this list of tax havens. To make it credible and ambitious, we cooperate well with the OECD, I mean, but we have higher ambition, simply because we have a higher degree of integration and criteria that are more powerful. The Commission will be the guardian of this list, but be careful, do not overlook this list, it is not us who propose it, it is not us who draw up it, it is the Member States. I would add, finally, that it will then be necessary to prosecute offenses against States that do not respect the rules, but here I make a commitment: if the blacklist is not up to the task, if it is not enough credible, if it is not substantial enough, if the sanctions are not dissuasive enough, then I will say so, because I believe that we must not be hypocrisy, things must be extremely clear. The European Parliament must also take its responsibilities, that is to say maintain the pressure, continue to exert its influence through the legislative proposals that are on the table. I will come in December to discuss the PANA report here, I congratulate its members, it is an excellent report, I have to say it. I invite your assembly to continue this work, whatever institutional form you will choose. Finally, collectively, we must, I believe, open two avenues for the future. The first one may not bring us all together, but I formulate it all the same, with my personal convictions. We must help European states and others, those who have made tax evasion a bit of a state business, to develop another economic and social model, and I say this for those for whom it is a business, but also for those for whom it is still tolerated practices. This revolution will not happen alone, this is the very meaning of political action. Finally, we must, I believe, decide on the passage of tax issues to qualified majority before the next European elections. Our fellow citizens - you meet them, I meet them - keep asking us for more social Europe or real tax harmonization, but let's not tell them stories, there will be progress in social Europe, there will be progress in fiscal transparency and convergence, but there will be no decisive progress for social Europe and for fiscal harmonization as long as we remain in a system where the will of one can paralyze, block , what everyone wants. The Commission, as you know, its President said, here in front of you, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, will make proposals in 2018 in this direction. I know how difficult this fight will be, I know that it requires political courage and I know that for that it will be necessary that your assembly, by our side, put all the necessary energy, but I know, I believe I can count almost by definition on your majority support and I want to tell you that on all of these topics, well, I'm going to need it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 69, "date": "2017-11-14.json", "name": "Matti Maasikas", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, thank you to the Commissioner and all the Members who have spoken in this in—depth and highly thorough discussion, which I have listened to with great attention.

I do not want to prejudge today the result of the trilogue on the Anti-Money Laundering Directive but I can reconfirm the rock-solid commitment of the Estonian Presidency to have an agreement by the end of this year on this piece of legislation.  All things need to be seen in perspective and in context. I know people do not want to hear how hard other people’s work is. Therefore I will not list again all the constraints that we have to face in the Council while working on tax matters; which include unanimity, and this, Mr Bullmann, explains my diplomatic language.

However, the revision of its operation pointed to a number of limits that prevent more effective enforcement of the set rules. Supervisors in the EU's internal market must work together on a literal basis on a daily basis and have sufficient powers and tools to deal with cross-border cases. This need has been exacerbated by the development of e-commerce. I recall that the proposal is one of the priorities of the Digital Single Market Strategy. The presented update of the existing rules on cross-border supervisory cooperation is intended to ensure faster, more active and more consistent enforcement. We need effective mechanisms that also prevent divergent approaches to law enforcement for the same infringement. Let me outline a few concrete measures that this regulation is intended to help increase consumer protection and create fair conditions for all businesses in the internal market. The proposed legislation will significantly strengthen the powers of supervisory authorities in the areas of investigation, law enforcement and corrective action. To facilitate investigations, it now has the possibility for supervisory authorities in all EU countries to control purchases of goods under a hidden identity. The supervisory authorities will have the power to impose sanctions and require the trader to undertake to offer appropriate redress to consumers who have suffered damage. The new rules will also improve the enforcement of consumer rights in the online environment. In the event of an imminent risk of serious and irreparable harm to the interests of consumers, supervisory authorities will be able to request the suspension of a website if its operator does not respond and refuses to seek redress. Supervisors should also have the power to request information from domain registrars and banks to identify the responsible trader. Fraudulent internet sites are a growing phenomenon that is currently difficult for the responsible authorities to combat effectively. An important part of the regulation are the rules for exercising these powers. Here, we have been very consistent in ensuring that enforcement is proportionate in accordance with Union law, national law and the principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. As before, Member States will continue to be able to choose whether the competent authority will exercise its powers directly or through legal proceedings. This is already happening under the current regulation and, in my opinion, there is no need to change anything in this regard. One of the innovations brought by the revision is the institute of the so-called extensive violation of consumer protection legislation with an EU dimension. It is a new instrument that involves complex investigations and coordinated enforcement in a large number of Member States. The coordinating role will always be entrusted to the Commission in this case, but each of the actors involved will know clearly what is expected of him and how to proceed. The functioning of the database and the information exchange system will also be improved, and the European Parliament will make the whole system of cooperation even more transparent. The revision of the rules will also improve the position of consumer organizations, which will be able to formally provide information to supervisors on suspected infringements. With so-called first-hand information from consumers, supervisors have often not been able or willing to work, which will change. Trade associations, which are also well acquainted with the market and have information that supervisors often do not have to access, will not be left out either. Supervisors will also be able to more easily coordinate consumer market investigations. At a time when market trends, consumer complaints or other indications indicate that large-scale infringements of consumer protection law could or are already taking place, a Europe-wide survey may be convened and binding measures may be taken in all Member States. So far, this has been done to a limited extent and only in an online environment.I believe that the regulation will be an effective tool for prosecuting all well-known illegal practices, but it will also serve, for example, in combating dual product quality and wherever consumers are discriminated against or treated unfairly.Facilitating the exchange of knowledge between supervisory authorities from individual states and the possibility of intervening together is the main currency of this legislation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 83, "date": "2017-11-14.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the revision of the Consumer Protection Cooperation Regulation, which you will vote on today, is a key deliverable of the Commission’s consumer strategy. I would like to thank the rapporteur on this file, Ms Olga Sehnalová, and all the shadow rapporteurs who have spared no effort to get a good deal for EU consumers.  Europe has the best consumer legislation in the world. However, it needs more effective enforcement, as was shown in the recently performed fitness check of EU consumer and marketing laws. This has confirmed the outline of our consumer strategy, which means focusing on public and private enforcement of consumer protection rules and laws. In the coming months the Commission will continue to ensure that consumer law is fully complied with and that no consumer is left without the chance for better individual redress, especially in mass harm situations. This will also be one of the main objectives of the measures that we are going to propose as our new deal for consumers in the spring of next year. The Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) review has responded to the trend of the opening and digitalisation of the consumer markets, which has also increased possibilities for illegal and unfair practices. Unfortunately public enforcement systems in most Member States date back to the pre—digital era, and in all Member States the reach of public authorities is limited by national jurisdictional rules. It was therefore high time that we modernised the public enforcement of consumer laws in the EU. We have proposed to reform the way public authorities work together and, with the Commission, to tackle illegal practices harming consumers’ interests and fair competition, as well as trust in the European single market. I would like to thank Parliament for its support throughout the negotiations, which were swift, focused and very purposeful. Once the new regulation is implemented, our citizens will be able to benefit from better working institutions securing fairer markets. Public authorities throughout Europe will have modern enforcement tools to tackle online offences, such as the power to find out who is behind an illegal commercial online practice, trace back financial flows, block online content or issue appropriate online warnings.  A real breakthrough is that consumer protection authorities will get more leverage in their joint negotiations with multinational players. Equipped with the power to accept traders’ commitments on remedies to consumers, as foreseen in the respective national laws, the authorities will be in a position to correct traders’ practices swiftly in all the Member States concerned with large—scale breaches of consumer rights. This will also avoid many lengthy civil court actions in situations where harm has been caused to many consumers across borders. Last but not least, the Commission will have a key market surveillance role. It will be in a position to request Member States investigate in a coordinated manner practices that do not look right when such practices concern a large part of the Union. The Regulation on Consumer Protection Cooperation review that you will approve today is a key part of the mosaic of the consumer strategy of this Commission. Thank you in advance for your support.

The agreed text is the result of months of compromises between the Commission's initial proposal and the positions of Parliament and the Council, and provides for modern, effective and efficient mechanisms. As a shadow rapporteur for the European People's Party, I want to applaud 5 fundamental aspects of the text that we are going to vote on. First, it strengthens the enforcement of consumer laws across the Union, without affecting Member States' competences in this area. Second, it provides an extended common set of minimum powers for the competent authorities of the Member States. Third, it increases the level of harmonization which translates into effective and efficient cooperation between the competent public authorities, covering the entire dimension of the single market. Fourth, it establishes the involvement of consumer and merchant organizations in the mechanism. And fifth, it creates a common procedure at Union level for generalized infringements at Union level, guaranteeing the Commission a strong coordination role. Contrary to what some claim, the exercise of the powers of this regulation must be proportionate and appropriate to the nature of the infringement and respect the provisions of national and Union law, including judicial guarantees and fundamental rights.In conclusion, Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur Olga Sehnalová, the fellow shadow rapporteurs and the European Commission on the result achieved which clearly benefits consumer rights in the Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 86, "date": "2017-11-14.json", "name": "Nicola Danti", "mepid": "124821", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, with the text that we will approve today, European consumers will be better protected in their rights when they decide to buy, including online, in another EU country. A further step towards the creation of a single market, also in its digital dimension, closer and more attentive to citizens and consumers, who increasingly buy online, we are talking about about 290 million Europeans. The revision of this regulation has two main objectives: on the one hand, to adapt the current consumer protection rules to the new challenges posed by digital and the rapid spread of electronic commerce, which was worth around 530 billion euros in 2016, and on the other hand, making the cooperation between the different national authorities, which are already responsible for their implementation, more efficient. The latter will see their executive powers strengthened and increased, such as that of imposing sanctions and that of obliging the inflation manager to compensate harmed consumers. These are necessary tools to prevent significant abuses that are not identified or addressed adequately today, also and above all due to their cross-border dimension. In addition, an ad hoc mechanism will be set up to combat abusive practices that occur in more than two thirds of countries and which therefore risk threatening the common interest of European citizens. With the approval of this regulation, consumers and authorities will have more effective tools to combat widespread cases of fraud against European citizens, as has unfortunately happened in the past, starting with the Volkswagen case.

It often happens that some legislation is not complied with, the Commission proposes a new one instead of enforcing compliance with the existing legislation. The result is 2,700 open infrared proceedings, ie infringement proceedings, of which 320 are in the area of ​​the internal market. The result is that, by exaggerating consumer protection, we make him an unruly sheep. This may apply to the Member States and their legislation more than to the Union. Another problem is priorities. The Commission has too many, and some of them are contradictory. Consumer protection legislation often unnecessarily complicates the lives of businesses, and improving the business environment is also one of the Union's declared priorities. Entrepreneurs then often do not know the law, they cannot recognize it and legal certainty is low. However, consumers themselves also suffer as a result. At the same time, I understand that in the area of ​​e-commerce, if it is cross-border, legislation is needed at European Union level. I appreciate the rapporteur's efforts to seek and find a real and fair compromise. In my opinion, the resulting proposal has the potential to improve the enforcement of existing rules, especially in cross-border trade. I want to believe that other changes, such as the minimum powers of national trade inspections, will also help to enforce existing laws.

Only a voice at the other end of the telephone line saying: ‘but I can see your room on my website.’ I am completely sure that all of us have had such an experience when buying online: fraudulent websites selling incredibly cheap products that are actually never delivered; websites offering products that turn out to be counterfeit; the ‘free-trial’ scams that promise consumers that they can try a product for free, only to find out later on that they have to pay something for the services... The list can be long and this piece of legislation today is directed at those consumers who have been deceived on the internet while buying products. It will make sure that consumer protection authorities collaborate better and prevent these infringements going on in the EU.

Dieselgate has shown that we cannot leave this up to the discretion of the companies. Illicit profits would need to be restituted.

On top of that, it establishes overreaching internet blocking measures that are neither proportionate nor suitable for the goal of protecting consumers and come without mandatory judicial oversight.

The result is that fraud affecting consumers in multiple countries is not resolved in a coordinated and coherent way, to the detriment of all citizens, as in the Volkswagen scandal involving eight million vehicles in Europe. It is therefore necessary that the European national authorities have minimum powers in common, in order to guarantee a basic level of consumer protection, below which it is not possible to go down. This regulation on cooperation between national consumer protection authorities is a step forward in this direction. Authorities are given the opportunity, for example, to find sensitive information across borders, such as financial flows. Consumer associations are involved and can report suspected fraud directly to the States and the Commission. But we ask that we be more ambitious towards citizens in terms of compensation.

Consumer policy in the EU is based on the protection of the weaker side of the commercial relationship. As we can see, we are facing a totally new situation because the position of the consumer in the online world is very different from the position in his or her shop in his or her street. This asymmetry of power is something we have to address. The second pillar is that we need to have our consumers in the EU legally well-equipped, with the possibility of defending their rights themselves. That is why we are focusing, on the one hand, on better public enforcement: we are doing this through the CPC Regulation review and I am sure we are doing the proper thing for EU consumers. On the other hand, there are dishonest traders who cause much harm to consumers.  The second thing, which we plan for Spring next year, is to improve the situation in private enforcement for consumers. You know that we are considering some possibility of European Union collective redress. Of course, as Justice Commissioner, I also have in mind to come with measures which will not increase the workload for the European courts, so I welcome alternative ways to settle disputes and this is where the CPC review can help.  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your support and I hope for your positive vote later today.  Commission Statement (in writing) The European Commission declares the following. Article 21 requires competent authorities to take the necessary enforcement measures to cease widespread infringements. The Article sets out (in a non-exhaustive manner) in what situations enforcement measures are particularly appropriate. Amongst these situations, Article 21 lists: in paragraph (1) (d) commitments which are insufficient to ensure the cessation of the infringement or, where appropriate, to remedy consumers harmed by the infringement; and in paragraph (1) (e) the failure by the trader to implement those commitments. Article 21 (1) (d) and (e) must be read in consistency with the objectives of the Regulation, which are to set up an effective and efficient enforcement cooperation among competent public enforcement authorities to detect, investigate and order the cessation of intra-Union infringements and widespread infringement, and with the main provisions on remedial measures contained in the Regulation, in particular Article 9 (4) (c). In coordinated actions, where a competent authority has sought to obtain commitments from the trader to offer adequate remedies to the consumers concerned by an infringement, it may be particularly appropriate to take enforcement measures when those commitments are insufficient to remedy consumers harmed by the infringement or when those commitments are not implemented.\"", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 107, "date": "2017-11-14.json", "name": "Olga Sehnalová zpravodajka.", "mepid": "96718", "text": "- Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the shadow rapporteurs, namely Carlos Coelho, Richard Sulík, Jasenka Selimovič and Julia Red, as well as the European Parliament's administration for constructive cooperation and support throughout the work.

In order to fully exploit the growth potential of the digital single market, the EU needs to firmly tackle illegal and unfair practices that directly harm consumers and the trust they place in e-commerce. Consumer protection must therefore be pursued by strengthening the powers of the competent national authorities in order to ensure the commitment of economic operators to compensate consumers in the event of illegal practices, with fair conditions for all and with efficient and transparent procedures, with a coordinating role of the European Commission in the event of infringements that threaten the collective interest of consumers.

Indeed, the increased momentum of e—commerce as well as widespread consumer law infringements across the internal market call for an overhaul of the Regulation, so that the latter does not fall short of what would be needed in order to ensure strong and enforceable consumer rights for everyone in the European Union.

Finally, I consider that a structured dialogue between public enforcers and consumer associations is paramount as these entities very often become aware of infringements much earlier than the competent authorities.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 110, "date": "2017-11-14.json", "name": "András Gyürk (PPE)", "mepid": "23816", "text": "in writing. - The amendment to the regulation aims to strengthen the consumer protection rights of EU citizens in order to prevent cross-border infringements and enforce the penalties imposed.

Illegal and unfair practices used by companies harm consumers and distort healthy and fair competition. Improving legislation by adapting to changing conditions is essential. However, there is already significant consumer legal protection, which is not effectively enforced across the EU. I particularly emphasize the introduction of the concepts of 'extended infringement' and 'extended infringement with a Union dimension'. The systematic and massive use of illegal and abusive clauses-practices by the banking system in various Member States, especially in Cyprus, which is an example to be avoided, has been a widespread infringement with a European dimension. The abusive behavior of banks and, at the same time, the ineffective implementation of European legislation to eliminate abusive clauses and practices contributed significantly to the economic catastrophe that culminated in 2013, the terrible consequences of which a large part of the population in Cyprus is still experiencing, and demands justice.

We need efficient tools for cooperation between the enforcers of consumer law that are effective enough in the digital age to ensure consumers a safe online shopping experience. The reform of the CPC Regulation empowers consumers by giving the national authorities powers to impose fines and penalties payments, or to seek to obtain commitment to compensate the consumers for the harm done.

In order to ensure legal certainty and the effectiveness of enforcement actions in relation to cross-border infringements and to avoid differences in treatment between consumers and businesses in the single market, it is necessary to introduce a limitation period. This means a specific period of time during which the competent authorities may impose sanctions, compensate consumers or recover the proceeds of the infringement in compliance with the rules governing cross-border infringements. However, let us not forget that it is up to the Member States to decide whether the competent authorities will exercise these powers directly within their competences or by making statements to the competent courts.

Each Member State must therefore respect, protect and promote them. Three weeks ago I intervened in this Chamber after the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia. We all condemned this barbaric crime and expressed the expectation that the perpetrators would be brought to justice.  We were all in agreement that media freedom is an indispensable pillar of our democratic societies. For this reason, freedom of expression, media freedom and pluralism are guaranteed in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. They are among the core basic democratic values on which the European Union is founded. In October, the Council held its annual rule of law dialogue, which was an important opportunity to take a critical look at the rule of law situation in the Member States and the Union. This year the dialogue was about media pluralism in the digital age and about the challenges that the digital age brings to the rule of law. In the context of that debate, all Member States agreed that free, reliable and pluralistic media underpins effective democracy.  The continued debate on these issues shows again that the protection and promotion of the rule of law and human rights are a constant challenge. This challenge requires unwavering attention and efforts across different policy areas. Our core values are put to the test every day. Our societies are still facing multiple inter—related crises, be it in the area of migration or internal security. Discussions such as the one today are important. Our citizens must be able to have trust in the functioning of our democratic institutions.  We commend the Maltese Government for having acted immediately as news broke of the assassination to ensure that justice is done. The Maltese authorities also opened up their investigations and sought international assistance. The police force asked for assistance and teamed up with the American FBI, Dutch and Italian forensic forces, as well as Europol, to make sure that no stone is left unturned in the investigation. I would like to recall the readiness of the Member States to help in all matters as needed.  Malta has shown that its institutions are well—functioning in responding to this challenge. Ensuring the rule of law is an absolute priority and has to be our joint commitment – of the Member States and of EU institutions together. Equally, fundamental rights need to be upheld and defended as our best guarantee for sustaining stable, open and free societies. We trust that the Maltese authorities will ensure that justice will be delivered in the case of the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia.

A nation in mourning. We all saw it.  The Commission condemned this brutal assassination in the strongest words possible. The rights of a journalist and blogger to investigate, to ask uncomfortable questions and to report effectively is at the heart of our values and needs to be guaranteed at all times. There can be no free and democratic societies without free media. The Commission takes the view that ensuring an independent and thorough investigation of the facts and bringing those responsible to justice must be the top priority for the Maltese Government. The Maltese authorities and institutions must deliver on their clear commitment to do everything in their power to ensure that the perpetrators will be brought to justice. More generally, Malta needs to show to Europe – and indeed the world – that its rules and regulations are healthy and robust. This is why it is important that the Maltese Government has indicated that the investigation and prosecution should be allowed to run their full course regardless of the consequences. I want to add that, on every occasion that I have to talk to members of the Maltese Government, I make this point and it is acknowledged by them that they will do so and that they will commit to that.  But this also includes making sure that the rules that we agreed at European level are implemented on the ground. The fight against money laundering, for instance, is a key priority for the Commission in this respect. With regard to the issue of money laundering in Malta, the Commission has conducted a fact-finding exercise and an analysis. The guiding principle was to identify quality and reliable data. The facts as they resulted from our analysis – and let me stress this – raise no general concerns on Malta’s overall compliance. However, improvements could be made on various levels. In this context, the Commission recently sent a letter to the Maltese authorities regarding follow-up investigations to recommendations after the Maltese Financial Intelligence and Analysis Unit published its report, and we are now carefully studying their comprehensive reply. As part of our efforts in the fight against money laundering, moreover, we are making sure that all Member States, including Malta, adopt the necessary provisions to transpose the Fourth Anti—Money Laundering Directive. The Commission decision on infringement proceedings against those Member States which have not yet notified their national transposition laws is imminent. We encourage those Member States to adopt the necessary rules now, without further delay. The Commission regularly collects data on the functioning of the judicial systems of all Member States in the EU Justice Scoreboard, and we are monitoring corruption in Member States as part of the European Semester. The Commission agrees with Parliament that we need to improve the protection of whistle—blowers throughout the EU. The revision of the Fourth Anti—Money Laundering Directive, currently under negotiation between Parliament and the Council, will enhance the powers of the competent authorities to prevent and fight money laundering. I hope that this legislation will be adopted soon. Finally, the Commission encourages Malta to swiftly join the European Public Prosecutor’s Office. This would send a strong positive signal of Malta’s commitment to working actively together in the area of freedom, security and justice. In conclusion, let me say that every time I have the occasion to meet with the Maltese authorities – I met with the Minister for European Affairs and Equality, Ms Dalli, and the Minister for Justice, Culture and Local Government, Mr Bonnici, last week – they have clearly expressed their determination to do whatever is necessary to make sure that these things are implemented to the full, and also to make sure that those responsible for this atrocious crime are brought to justice. The commitment of the Maltese Government on this was made very clear to all its partners in Europe.

We cannot remain silent, so today we ask for three concrete actions. First, we want the Commission to immediately launch a rule of law dialogue with Malta.

Freedom of expression and the media is the key to the existence of democracy, so these issues are of particular concern to me. My Maltese colleagues assure me that the Government is making every effort to investigate the murder, which has involved independent international experts and organizations. I very much welcome that. I also welcome the modernization and radical substantive changes in the field of media and other laws, especially with regard to defamation, protection of applicants or whistleblowers, the abolition of censorship for works of art, and the financing of political parties. The assassination has also exacerbated issues of corruption, particularly in political elites, money laundering, the involvement of politicians in scandals, the role of banks, reports of the sale of citizenship, and the politicization of some public institutions.

Nevertheless, I cannot welcome the greatly exaggerated reactions of colleagues, especially from the EPP, who after the murder of the journalist announce that there has been a collapse of the rule of law and the system in Malta.

This is basically saying that the boss of the supervisors is at the same time the boss of those who should develop the sector. Therefore, the Commission should take action to clarify what the status of a financial supervisor is, and what conflicts of interest in that area mean. Malta has recently had big financial and economic success with online gambling and I would like to say on behalf of our Group that there is nothing wrong with online gambling as such, but there is a problem if the cross-border provision of these services is based on hyper-low taxation, and secondly, on the illegal provision across borders through the internet, which allows financial companies to make at least EUR 1 billion just for the transfers to the respective societies. So the question is: isn’t there a hole in the application of national and European law in the area of online gambling? There were also important questions about the buying of voters in the last Maltese elections, and there is the question why do Nexia BT and Pilatus Bank still have licences in Malta?

Some of Daphne’s last written words were: ‘there are crooks everywhere you look, the situation is desperate’. Well, depending on where you looked, you always saw the same thing and that is prominent people from Azerbaijan – very prominent people from Azerbaijan – in the company of very prominent people from Malta – virtually half the leadership of the Labour Party, be that the Prime Minister, be that the Prime Minister and his small party who travelled there unaccompanied and brought back I don’t know what, or be that Mr Farrugia, who is still the speaker of the Parliament of Malta and who has nothing better to do than regularly travel there and applaud them for the brilliant elections that they hold.  This is what has rotted Malta through – the fact that a country like Azerbaijan could insinuate itself in the form of a bank called Pilatus, in the heart of a European democracy, and from there reach out its tentacles to stifle democratic expression. This is what we are confronted with. This is why this murder needs to be investigated. And this is why no angle needs to be left untouched in this investigation.

Otherwise this Parliament risks losing credibility. Worse, it risks devaluing the values that we all claim to believe in. A brutal assassination has taken place in Malta. It has shocked us all. Justice needs to be done. In the investigation the Maltese Government has called upon the Dutch and US police authorities, as well as Europol, for help, but the outcome of one murder investigation, whatever and whenever it is, cannot be held to reflect on the rule of law here or wherever. Malta is being assailed for perceived deficiencies in the rule of law on the basis of jumbled facts and semi—facts, unproven allegations taken at face value, innuendos and issues irrelevant to the rule of law. Is this being done as a tit—for—tat related to processes about the rule of law that other Member States are being subjected to? Yet the Maltese Government has repeatedly agreed to receive delegations of this Parliament to investigate issues that are raised and it is still doing so. It has accepted – indeed invited – Commission scrutiny over a variety of areas, as Mr Timmermans has told us. Partisanship over the rule of law will undermine the moral basis of this House, when it has to raise issues related to it. This is being done because, in the wash of interests and allegiances that define this House, it is easiest for EU Member States to overlook Malta’s realities and to cast doubts on the motives of the Maltese Government. Yet that Government has just been re—elected with an absolute majority, possessed by no other party that is represented in this House. It has guided the Maltese economy towards growth rates that are among the highest – if not the highest – in Europe. Attitudes in a debate like this should be objective. They are being tendentious. We need well—informed assessments. Instead we have prejudice and polemical opinions brewed like instant coffee. Subjected to such a methodology, all Member States can be made to smell foul.

We have to ask: What is this Pilatus Bank doing in Malta and is it set the appropriate limits? Those are the questions that need to be asked here.

The cowardly and abject assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia demands that the European Union and beyond the international community act in a determined and urgent manner to end illicit financial flows and tax havens. The work of whistleblowers and the media is essential in revealing the scale of tax fraud and tax evasion. Their protection must be legally guaranteed and reinforced throughout the territory of the Union. I am obviously very happy that we voted in favor of a general protection mechanism at European Union level, but we must go further and put in place a legal status for whistleblowers, which could if necessary, give rise to compensation. One thing particularly troubles me, Mr Ferrand, is that - and I regret it - Malta has chosen not to participate in the European Public Prosecutor's Office, which brings real added value in the protection of the Union's financial interests. Once in place, it would allow us to strengthen investigations into financial fraud and would be accountable for independent investigations. While the protection of the Union's financial interests is the shared responsibility of the Union and all its Member States, I find it shocking and unacceptable that Member States can evade their obligations to fight fraud, knowing that 'they benefit from European aid.

The problem in Malta is the capture of the State, through members of the Government, deputies, supervisory authorities, magistrates, police, officials, by financial interests or services of intermediaries, such as Nexia BT. For this reason, Malta opposes transparency on the beneficial owners of the trusts that this Parliament proposes in the negotiations under the 5th anti-money laundering and terrorist financing directive. The problem is not confined to the current Government: it was decades-old deregulatory policies, transversal to political parties, orchestrated from London with the approval of Brussels, which made Malta a tax haven within the European Union, developing an industry there specialized in aggressive tax planning and the multiplication of shell companies, instrumental in money laundering, corruption and other criminality schemes. The Maltese and European nationality sales program is at the heart of these policies with greater risks to the security of Malta and the European Union. The bombing of the courageous journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia is an alarming testimony. Prime Minister Muscat keeps the chief of staff and minister exposed by the Panama Papers and has not yet allowed an independent investigation into allegations about an account linking his wife to the Pilate bank. How can you ensure that the Maltese Government guarantees, as it should, the independence of the means of supervision, the depoliticization of the police and the judicial authorities? It is not even proposed to end the accumulation of political and state functions with the provision of financial, fiscal and business services! We cannot deceive ourselves. Malta has to rethink its development model and stop serving as one of the European centers specialized in facilitating tax evasion and money laundering.

The last of them has taken the life of Daphne Caruana Galizia ahead, which shows supremely the unacceptable sacrifice of the whistleblowers who have the courage to work for the public exposure of the unacceptable, corruption, seeking transparency and serving to the expression freedoom. The sacrifice of one's life has indeed taken place in Malta, which does not have a general problem of a decline in freedoms or the rule of law. It does have a problem of a financial system used to inadmissible practices of raising money of illicit origin and unfair tax competition, extremely vulnerable to the penetration of money from organized crime and laundering. And, therefore, Malta has to make an effort and clearly show its commitment to reparation, not only by urging a full and independent investigation in which Europol and Interpol collaborate in the clarification of each and every one of the crimes and , especially, this one. But, as Daphne Caruana's children Andrew, Matthew and Paul dramatically ask us, Malta has much more to do. It has to combat this corruption in its financial system, joining the European Public Prosecutor's Office as a crucial tool for the investigation of serious transnational crime. Because that will be the definitive sign that their sacrifice will not have been in vain and that the European Union is willing to take to its last consequences the repair of this vulnerability of the Maltese financial system and to do the good job for which Daphne Caruana Galicia has sacrificed his life.

For this reason, the government must, on the one hand, identify and arrest its killers, but at the same time provide convincing answers as to whether there is corruption in the country or not. Of course, Malta is an independent state and is trying to apply the principles of the rule of law within itself, but can the government guarantee the protection of the press as well as the protection of scandal investigators and whistleblowers? It is true that the main source of wealth for the country is the provision of services, but does this justify turning the country into an economic paradise?

If it is done in this way I surmise it is not just to silence her but also to send a clear message to anybody else who might want to investigate things. That is why the way this murder was carried out is reminiscent of the attacks on Borsellino and Falcone. So what we are dealing with here is a very serious matter that needs to be pursued, and the investigation should be allowed to run its full course and no stone left unturned. That is why it is good that the Maltese authorities also engage in international cooperation with the FBI, with Scotland Yard, with the NFI in the Netherlands, calling also on the European institutions and on Interpol to help them. What is not on though is already today to draw conclusions about who did it. I think we should be clear that we stress that this investigation should be allowed to run its full course, regardless of the consequences for anyone anywhere in Malta, or elsewhere by the way. But I would caution in drawing conclusions today, as some appear to be doing here, about who is responsible for this. That is not for now. My second point is this. Many questions were put here today, many pertinent questions about many issues relating to the situation in Malta in a number of areas. I give you the assurance here today that the European Commission will pursue all these questions and give you answers when we can, especially Mr Giegold had a number of questions – we’ve taken careful note. Other Members had also a number of questions. We will pursue those questions and then provide them with the answers whenever we can and continue to pursue them if we need to investigate further. But again, what is not on as far as the Commission is concerned is to start with a conclusion and then look for facts to support that conclusion. That is not how we do this. We first look into the questions that were put on the table, and then if we come up with conclusions on those questions it is soon enough to then see what other steps might need to be taken. I think every Member State deserves that way of acting when we look into issues pertaining to the rule of law and other such subjects. One issue I want to briefly highlight, because it was raised by many Members, is the so-called sale of passports. In our 2017 citizens’ report we announced that we would produce next year, 2018, a report on national schemes granting EU citizenship to investors. And by the way, Malta is not the only Member State that has such a scheme. A few Member States have it and, aside from that, other Member States have schemes to grant permanent residency to people who invest. So it is not just a one Member State issue, it is a broader issue and we will refer to that in our 2018 report. This report will describe the Commission’s actions in this area, current national law and practices in all Member States, and provide some guidance. We are working on this report right now. Member States – and this I can already say now – should use their prerogatives towards citizenship in line with their international and EU law obligations and in a spirit of sincere cooperation with other Member States. Simply because, if you become a citizen of one Member State that grants you access to all the other Member States. So you have to have an attitude of sincere cooperation with all Member States. So we will go into that in our report. And I want to stress also, because that was raised several times, the Commission insists with Malta to really seriously look into the possibility to join the European Public Prosecutor’s Office. It would be in Malta’s interest. There is another Member State that I know very well that also did not want to join the EPPO but now, with a new government, they have changed their mind and they have expressed their intention to join it, and I welcome that. I think Mr Michel is right when he says that it would be good for all Member States to be part of that so that we can have these European investigations into the use of European funds. Let me conclude very briefly by saying that I do express the hope that, given the seriousness of this issue, and given the seriousness of the questions that were put on the table, we do not turn this into a party-political fight. That is not what she deserves. That is not what Daphne deserves. Let’s continue to act as this House has always done with integrity and perseverance so that we allow the investigation to run its full course so that the ones responsible for this atrocious crime are brought to justice, and if we discover systemic issues that need to be addressed, that we address them in a spirit of cooperation with the Member State concerned.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 213, "date": "2017-11-14.json", "name": "Matti Maasikas", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, the Estonian Presidency and the Council as a whole attach great importance to upholding the rule of law and fundamental rights in all Member States and in the Union.

The Maltese citizens seem to believe that as well, according to a recent opinion poll. One observation of a more general nature: the EU is much better at dealing with the political issues between the Member States than within the Member States because that is what the Union was created for.

That murder led to protests in Malta. The Country Report on Monitoring Media Pluralism 2016 identified the high risks of market pluralism and political independence for the Maltese media. They were exacerbated by a number of factors, such as the lack of protection and self-regulation of journalists and editorial autonomy, political ownership of the media, and lack of media literacy. The 2017 Freedom of the Media Index, published by Reporters Without Borders, found that in Malta, freedom of expression is particularly restricted by defamation laws, which can be used to impose fines or imprisonment and are widely used by journalists, especially against politicians. Politicians representing the entire Maltese political spectrum had brought several charges against Daphne Caruana Galizia on the grounds of defamation. His bank account was also frozen earlier this year by a court ruling related to a defamation lawsuit filed by a government minister that had not yet been resolved in court. The Maltese media is reported to have come under intense pressure from Pilate Bank, which is the subject of money laundering allegations. Pilatus Bank's customers have mostly been politically influential Azerbaijanis, for whom the bank has not exercised due diligence as required by the Anti-Money Laundering Directive. Malta has been found to be selling its citizenship for EUR 650,000 to third-country nationals, such as Russians, who are also acquiring EU citizenship and related rights.

It is a critical moment for WTO. A strong, multilateral trading system with the WTO at its centre is very much in the interests of the EU and the world. It is the best way to deal with international trade issues and it is now being seriously challenged. Both central features of the WTO; its negotiating and its dispute settlement, are under severe pressure for the moment. A month from MC  11??, the prospects of a negotiated outcome still remain highly uncertain, although some elements are becoming clearer. We will see a difficult process of negotiations regarding a possible ministerial declaration where the questions of how to prioritise work for the future will be key.  Preparations for the conference are significantly affected by the situation surrounding the ?? body where the unprecedented decision of the United States to block the appointment of new members put at risk the functioning of one of the most important and well-functioning elements of the WTO. We are, of course, ready to discuss possible concerns regarding the ?? body but we cannot and we will not accept measures which weakens it or puts its independence into question. Today, it is more important than ever that the EU shows its strong support for the work of the organisation. Following the success of the last two conferences in Bali and Nairobi – notably they accepted the adoption of the trade facilitation agreement – and an agreement on agriculture export competition, it is important that the positive momentum is maintained and that concrete outcomes are agreed.  The European Union is working very hard in Geneva with other countries and we have taken the leadership in preparing such outcomes by tabling texts in several key areas. Unfortunately, the divergences among the members are still strong. Despite our efforts to build convergence among members, there is a huge uncertainty. The WTO members are pursuing the objective of reaching agreement on public stock-holding for food security and fishery subsidies. We support this; this would be good, but we strongly believe that it would not be enough; it has to be part of a broader package, in particular, including e-commerce, domestic regulation in services and new transparency rules benefiting SMEs. In this context it is necessary to accelerate the work towards a balanced package. Let me just give you a few details on where we are. Firstly, public stock holdings for food security purposes and fisheries subsidies have garnered support of most of the membership in terms of aspiration for outcomes. If this is not sufficient in terms of the outcome, we will continue to work in these areas, but also it has to be accompanied by progress in other areas. We have tabled together with Brazil and other WTO members a former current proposal for a comprehensive solution addressing domestic support in agriculture and public stock-holdings, and we really think this is a realistic proposal. However, there are other proposals on the table reflecting unrealistic ideas that are not boding well for a substantial outcome in agriculture. Regarding fishery subsidies, the political commitment to implement the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals on marine resources has contributed to advance work here, but it remains doubtful whether we can be able to achieve an ambitious outcome. Secondly, we also believe that other issues that are of relevance to many WTO members and relevant to today’s global trade should be addressed. As I mentioned, domestic regulation of these services, e-commerce, transparency of regulatory measures; these issues are right for the MC 11. Moreover, it would be important to agree on a strong future-orientated element which would set the stage for the post-Buenos Aires work avoiding contentious and sterile debates about Doha Joe and non-Doha work.  Thirdly, there has been call by some members, notably the United States, to reform the WTO. We are ready to engage in discussions on this, but we need to see concrete proposals on what precisely such reforms would entail. We are also finally committed to work on trade and gender, and we support the declaration on trade and women’s economic empowerment, and that will be adopted in the margins of the conference. Mr President, Honourable Members, this is an up-coming conference which is of utmost importance. We need to make sure that we can defend a strong, functioning WTO with concrete outcomes because it has to be at the centre of the multilateral trading system. I very much appreciate the support of the European Parliament and I am looking forward to seeing the big delegation that you will send to Buenos Aires in four weeks. Thank you very much.

Ultimately, we succeeded in setting up a parliamentary assembly for the WTO on equal terms with the Interparliamentary Union and the European Parliament in 2003, the main task of which is to educate the MEPs of the least developed countries and to help them with their governments to negotiate at the same level.

Only if we succeed in continuing to work on a rule-based level can we guarantee that trade is beneficial for development. That's why we're so behind it that we will also have a success in Buenos Aires. We need a clear signal that the overfishing of the seas through illicit subsidies will end. We must also give a clear signal that food storage, in order to guarantee food safety, has a longer-term solution. We also have to look at how we can integrate the goals for sustainable development, as well as the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and also the question of trade and gender balance.

But now to my most important concern: At the forthcoming 11th World Trade Organization Conference, the conclusion of the so-called Doha Round is of particular importance.

These obligations should also leave the necessary margin of freedom to shape the current CAP, also in the future, including the possibility of using instruments currently classified into the so-called amber box, and thus support disturbing international trade.

Only by thinking globally, but also joining forces with like-minded partners, can we advance the multilateral trading agenda.

As a result, the EU's efforts in the WTO, the G20 and other formats are crucial to tackling this problem, which is caused by unfair subsidies to certain sectors. An example is the steel sector, where Chinese government subsidies have caused the crisis. The solar modules and batteries sector faces the same challenges. This also directly and negatively affects Lithuanian producers.

We can change this and we must, if we are to defeat the forces of nationalism and reassure our citizens that globalisation can work for them. Forgive me if I doubt the extent to which this concern was considered seriously at the recent WTO discussions.

The agenda of the upcoming 11th WTO ministerial conference in Buenos Aires is dominated by issues related, inter alia, to internal support for agriculture in the world. It is good that the European Commission adopted a proactive approach in the context of this meeting, although the joint EU-Brazilian proposal did not satisfy everyone.

Certain forces are putting that into question. I can tell you that it is not only the US, there are also other countries who are problematic in this regard, but we are really working towards that aim in the European Union. Our team in Geneva is doing a fantastic job to reach out to the different embassies and delegations there. I have personally spoken to a lot of different ministers, and our people around the world are trying their utmost to see if we can find compromises that are as broad as possible. As I told you, we have in the EU, sometimes together with other countries, put forward proposals that we think would bring the multilateral agenda forward. We always had the least—developed countries in mind at the centre of this, in order to see how we can help them to further integrate into the global trading system. As for the proposals, you could say that they are not ambitious enough, but they would still move the global agenda forward in a way that is reasonable in 2017. Bilateral trade agreements are today necessary as a complement to that – the WTO cannot solve all the issues that ambitious trade agreements can do bilaterally, but the multilateral system is still key in this, together with its disputes system.

The summit in Brussels should be forward-looking, injecting new dynamism and providing a clear political vision for the future of our Eastern Partnership. If the Brussels summit lacks this and is only a stock-taking summit, if its final declaration lacks novelty, then the November summit will demonstrate the inability of the European Union to meet the challenges ahead of us, and it will be another missed opportunity. The European Parliament is far more ambitious than for instance some EU Member States. We in the Parliament fully acknowledge our responsibility for the consequences of any failure of our Eastern Partnership policy. That this why in our recommendations we propose very concrete steps to be taken by the European Union in order to guarantee that our Eastern Partnership policy is a success. The European Parliament is playing its legitimate role. Its recommendations to the summit should be taken into account and duly reflected in the final declaration. Among other important aspects of the EP recommendations, we propose an EAP Plus format which includes the establishment of a trust fund, a new European investment plan, a financial support mechanism for the implementation of the association agreements, etc. All these proposals are for the countries which have association agreements and free trade agreements with the European Union and enjoy a visa-free regime with the EU, namely Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova. When that time comes, when the homework is done and the necessary requirements fulfilled, potential membership of these countries in the customs union, the digital union and the energy union should be considered as an option. Secondly, differentiation is key, as our resources are limited. The principle of ‘more for more and less for less’ should be implemented. We should focus our resources much more on those Eastern Partnership countries who have made remarkable progress on their European path. A few words now about the trust fund and the new European investment plan. In the present geo-political context, and taking into account the geo-political realities, we should offer Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova – and in our recommendations we proposed that – a new European plan for these countries, including a new investment plan to boost investments and economic development. According to international experts, a sizeable doubling of the volume of investment, for instance in Ukraine, of up to EUR 5 billion annually can result in 6-8% annual economic growth in the country over the next 5-10 years. Conditionality is in place also. I have in mind structural reforms and the creation of an investment-friendly environment, the strengthening of the rule of law and the fight against corruption in the countries concerned. This is absolutely a must. The investment support is dedicated not to the oligarchy – not to profit oligarchs in these countries – it is dedicated to ordinary people, notably in such fields as energy savings, road infrastructure, jobs, public services, small and medium-sized businesses and reconstruction if, as in the case of Ukraine, the country is at war.

Because we would like to contribute to the summit and show that our report also provided attractive long-term models for an expanded Eastern Partnership. Accession to the customs union, energy union, digital union, the Schengen area and the gradual abolition of roaming charges indicate a wide range of ways in which this Eastern Partnership can and should be further developed. This applies first of all to the associated states. But we also agree that the path must also be open to others who follow within the Eastern Partnership. We recommend that the Commission do its utmost to encourage multinational or multilateral financial institutions such as the European Investment Bank to become more involved. Various types of trust funds are also conceivable, as we have shown. But we also have to say very clearly that we are the Eastern We want partnership and that we have ideas to further develop it intensively. The prerequisite for this is the implementation of the agreed reforms. So far we cannot be satisfied with this implementation everywhere. The summit must therefore not only talk about what has been achieved, but must also clearly state what still needs to be done and where schoolwork has to be done. This is not about the rules that we make out of Brussels. Every country is free in its decisions. Nobody has to do Commissioner Hahn or President Juncker or Mrs Mogherini a favor. However, the results of our cooperation must be tangible for the local people. The results of our cooperation are important for the citizens in the partner countries, and therefore it is important that we not only talk about infrastructure, reducing socio-economic disparities and visa-free travel, but also about the fight against corruption, for example. It is also important for our fellow EU citizens to want to know from us who we are actually benefiting from with our measures. They don't end up wanting to hear that a few oligarchs got richer. They want to hear that something is moving in the system. To conclude, let me say one thing: I know that this is always critical here: relations with Russia are also important for the economic and political stability of our eastern neighbors. The Soviet Union no longer exists, everyone has to get used to it. But those who do not take their neighbors and their interests into consideration will not be able to live in peace with them in the long term.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 259, "date": "2017-11-14.json", "name": "Matti Maasikas", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, I wanted to participate in this debate because the Eastern Partnership Summit is coming up and I would like to share with you some thoughts and to listen to your recommendations. The fifth Eastern Partnership Summit on 24 November will be the key event in the Eastern Partnership since the last summit in Riga in 2015. I do not have to underline the importance the Estonian Presidency attaches to this event and indeed to the whole policy of Eastern partnership. In Riga, we reaffirmed our strong engagement and our firm determination to pursue closer, tailor-made relations with the six partner countries. This summit, which will be held for the first time in Brussels, will build on that. It will provide an opportunity to reaffirm the EU’s united and strong commitment to its Eastern partners and project a message of confidence. It will also highlight the value of the Eastern Partnership for citizens of the European Union and the partner countries, while providing them with tangible solutions and concrete benefits. The summit will take stock of developments across the four priority areas of cooperation: economic development and market opportunities; strengthening institutions and good governance; connectivity, energy efficiency, environment and climate change; and, fourthly, mobility and people-to-people contacts. There has been much progress since the Riga summit. Association agreements between the EU and Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine have fully entered into force. Significant reform efforts in Georgia and Ukraine have enabled visa liberalisation for the citizens of these countries. Relations with Belarus, Armenia and Azerbaijan are being enhanced on a tailor-made basis, either through the pursuit of new Framework Agreements or through new coordination arrangements. The Eastern Partnership has also further advanced on the basis of the revised European neighbourhood policy and the EU global strategy. However, the summit will also have a forward-looking and result-oriented agenda and will provide an opportunity to discuss ways of strengthening bilateral, multilateral and sectoral cooperation. The Council is currently working hard on the summit joint declaration, with the aim of reiterating the inclusive, consolidating and forward-looking nature of the Eastern Partnership. On the basis of the 20 deliverables for 2020 prepared by the European External Action Service (EEAS) and the Commission, in cooperation with Member States and partner countries, the summit is expected to provide guidance, in particular, on the four priority areas of cooperation with their tangible and visible impact on people’s lives. The list is long. It includes the fight against corruption, the modernisation of public administrations, improved transport and energy connections, digitalisation, greener economies, trade and investment promotion, support for small and middle-sized enterprises, educational exchanges and youth empowerment. Several important events have taken place in the run-up to the summit, demonstrating that the Eastern Partnership goes beyond inter-governmental relations to involve civil society, media, businesses, youth and other stakeholders. I would like to recall the following events that have contributed to preparing the discussion among the summit participants: the third Eastern Partnership Youth Forum in June in Warsaw; the second Eastern Partnership Media Conference in September in Kiev; the Eastern Partnership Civil Society Conference and the Business Forum in Tallinn in October. In addition, the Estonian Presidency organised an e-Partnership Conference at the beginning of October in Tallinn, as well as four ministerial-level meetings: on justice and home affairs, transport, and the digital economy as well as a post-Gymnich informal lunch for Foreign Ministers, devoted to common challenges in the security field. As you see, the preparations for the Eastern Partnership Summit go hand in hand with the activities undertaken by the European Parliament when preparing and adopting the report containing the recommendations to the Council, the Commission and the EEAS. The Council agrees that further actions need to be built on the previous commitments and on citizens’ expectations, and they need to provide new impetus for the future of the partnership. Last but not least, we will work to ensure that the visibility of the EU’s engagement in the Eastern Partnership demonstrates that we are stronger together. The Eastern Partnership is based on a free choice of the parties involved and is aimed at promoting prosperity, stability and good governance without affecting third parties. The Eastern Partnership is the only EU policy in which we state that the policy is not directed against anyone – and, of course, this is true. Bearing that in mind, we also need to recognise that the Eastern Partnership has become part of the EU’s policy towards Russia. In March 2016, the EU Foreign Ministers adopted five guiding principles for the EU’s policy towards Russia: one of the principles is strengthening relations with the EU’s eastern partners, and rightly so. Active communication about the summit and its objectives is being coordinated with EU Member States and the six partners, with the aim of providing factual information and countering disinformation. I would like to thank the honourable Members for their attention, I will listen carefully to their recommendations and I will convey them to my colleagues in the Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 260, "date": "2017-11-14.json", "name": "Cecilia Malmström", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, this discussion is, of course, extremely timely in the light of the summit that starts in a week, but, as the President has indicated, the summit has already started in a way. There have been a number of related side events involving young people, media, civil society, business, etcetera, because the whole point is to engage broadly, putting citizens at the centre of this partnership. Our engagement goes well beyond governments and, as you know, it has a very strong parliamentary dimension. The Euronest Parliamentary Assembly ordinary session took place two weeks ago in Kiev, and I know that both the plenary and the various working groups were conducted in a very constructive atmosphere, and the message of the Euronest bureau was adopted unanimously. That has sent a very powerful message to those involved in preparing for the summit. We welcome the attention that the European Parliament is paying to this, and I would like to thank the two rapporteurs and acknowledge all the work that has been done in the various committees and groups. As the report highlights, the summit is an opportunity not only to build on achievements to date but also to inject new dynamism into relations with the partnership countries. We are building on the existing policy network and particularly the global strategy for foreign and security policy, the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) review and previous summit declarations. However, let me also stress, as your report does, the importance of the 20 deliverables for 2020. This is an ambitious programme aiming at very concrete achievements. The report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs takes into account some of the key elements that have been identified for the summit: firstly, supporting an ambitious investment for the trans-European transport core network; secondly, increasing political ownership of energy efficiency; thirdly, supporting SMEs and their access to finance; fourthly, paving the way for a reduction in roaming tariffs among partner countries; fifthly, boosting trade opportunities with the EU and among the partner countries; sixthly, providing broad and targeted support to grass-root NGOs; seventhly, supporting young people, and especially addressing youth unemployment through entrepreneurship education; and, finally, stepping up strategic communication through a comprehensive approach based on the four priorities agreed in Riga and the new Eastern Partnership visual identity. These initiatives are all in line with the 20 deliverables. Our priorities are perfectly aligned and they all stem from the most urgent needs of our citizens. We take these deliverables very seriously and we want to make sure that they are implemented in a transparent and accountable way. The recent evaluation shows that, overall, we have made good progress on our commitments, especially with respect to the milestones set for the summit. But, at the same time, each country from the Eastern Partnership has specific needs and specific aspirations, so differentiation is an important principle of the partnership. Association agreements are now fully in place with Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. We have concluded negotiations for a comprehensive and enhanced partnership agreement with Armenia – we will sign that on the fringe of the summit – and we are negotiating a new comprehensive agreement with Azerbaijan. Relations with Belarus are evolving through the EU-Belarus Coordination Group. We have taken note of the proposed ‘EaP+’ model contemplated in the report, seeking to offer new opportunities especially for the associated countries and, while we remain ambitious in our proposals, we must also remain realistic and preserve the inclusive nature of the EaP which involves all six partners. This inclusivity is key, not only to bringing our people closer together, but also to contributing to further coordination and cooperation between the partners themselves. This has been part of the logic behind the whole partnership from its inception and, for these reasons, we believe the focus should be on implementing existing commitments reflected in the various agreements and documents and the 20 deliverables, as I mentioned. In doing that, the Eastern Partnership should be taken forward not in isolation but in conjunction with other global commitments: the Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement, etcetera. Sustainable development in the Eastern Partnership matters to the European Union. We all realise that our neighbour’s strength is our own strength, so our neighbours’ security and stability are very much linked to our own security. The fact that five out of six partners suffer from protracted conflicts is a reflection of the challenging security situation that we have in our neighbourhood. Our Eastern partners are indeed experiencing at first-hand the challenges of the European security architecture, as the Foreign Affairs Committee report highlights. The Eastern Partnership was never designed as a conflict-resolution mechanism, but it has a unique framework for building confidence and progressively strengthening the resilience of states and societies. We believe that the resolution of conflict in the region requires respect for international law and that peace will come in the framework of agreed negotiated formats. But peace also requires good governance and democracy, better economic opportunities for all, better infrastructure and closer people-to-people contact. This is what the Eastern Partnership is about and this is what we will highlight at the summit next week – not a partnership against anybody, as the Presidency said, but a partnership for the economy and for trade, a partnership for resilience and good governance, a partnership for democracy, the rule of law and human rights. The summit next week is essential to achieve practical progress on all these issues. I know this House is very committed and we count on your support not only in the run-up to the summit but also afterwards, to help in implementing and moving forward.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 261, "date": "2017-11-14.json", "name": "David McAllister", "mepid": "124806", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen! Indeed, the Eastern Partnership Summit in ten days' time is about finding new ways to achieve the objectives of Article 8 of the Treaty on European Union. It is about building special relationships with our neighbors and at the same time creating an area of ​​prosperity based on the values ​​of our Union. Just as the Commissioner has just done, I would also like to make the association agreements with Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine, which have come into force over the past 18 months, very positive. Nevertheless - and everyone in this room knows the six countries concerned - regional tensions and strong deficits in democracy and the rule of law slow our partnership to varying degrees, depending on the country. In order to increase the willingness to reform in the countries of the Eastern Partnership, the European Union should - and it should do this more clearly than before - formulate requirements that are more concrete and measurable, better support civil society in the partner countries and, in particular, the principle \" Apply more for more and less for less ”more consistently. These key points are contained in the report by colleagues Andrikienė and Fleckenstein. It's a good report. It was passed by a large majority in the Committee on Foreign Affairs.

The importance of these countries is shown by the way other actors like Russia behave when we try to bring them closer to the European project. We have already managed to achieve a lot and to show the benefits to our partners, including visa liberalisation, the freedom to travel across Europe, and economic exchange which has only increased in recent years. And yes, more appetite for the democratic functioning of their societies. But here, referring to the shopping list, I will start first by referring to the frozen conflicts. We have and we need to have the courage to discuss the frozen conflicts because these are the ones which destabilise not only those countries, but equally, the region, and have a negative impact on our Union as well. In addition, let’s not forget hybrid threats and cyber—threats to our partners and the daily propaganda campaigns that destabilise and negatively affect the perception of our Union within those societies by trying to destabilise the functioning of the institutions. The November summit should enhance East StratCom capabilities and focus on the way to fully promote the principles of democracy, the rule of law and good governance. In a nutshell, all the advantages of EU integration. But let’s be open, let’s be wise and be strategically driven, to treat the region not in terms of how much money we spend but of how many strategic benefits we take out of this more stable, better functioning region.

This September has finally seen the full implementation of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) with Ukraine and talks continue to progress with Armenia, in concluding a comprehensive and enhanced partnership agreement – one that does not affect its membership of the Eurasian Economic Union. We also see an existing Association Agreement in DCFTA with Moldova and Georgia already in force. All of these initiatives are important, improving economic and political links between the European Union and each of the respective Eastern Partnership countries, but we can still do more. If the Eastern Partnership is to become a meaningful instrument, its incentives must move beyond those on offer to other third countries further afield. This resolution proposes, therefore, the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP+) model which would plot a course beyond visa liberalisation and Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) to potential membership of the Customs Union, the Energy Union and perhaps the Schengen area. This would follow the mantra of ‘more for more’ and act as an incentive to encourage further reforms and bring the Eastern partners more closely into the European orbit. Allowing greater benefits as outlined in the EAP+ model would offer a favoured relationship to countries with whom the EU is geographically, culturally and historically linked.

It is a solid and forward-looking document which contains very concrete elements of further engagement, such as Eastern Partnership Plus and fully fledged CSDP missions, just to mention a few. I call on the summit to read the document very carefully, and most importantly, to come from a perspective that is the role of the European Union to act, and to be an engaging and responsible partner. Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine are the only EU neighbours with Europeanisation and pro-European reforms clearly set as their national and strategic goals. They expect reaching a true partnership with us, the European Union. If the summit fails, despite being action- and engagement-oriented, this will only mean that our partners are addressed with a message of a new, so-called ‘paper curtain’ – another effort to keep Europe divided with a huge bureaucracy, distrust, and indifference that we brand as ‘fatigue’. It must not be us and them, it must be all of us together, it must be about a Europe whole and free. My worry is, however, that the ‘more for more’ principle so proudly proclaimed in Riga is now being turned into a ‘one-size-fits-all’.

There is no talk of that today, despite the Association Agreement and more for more. Some target countries are migrating to alternative integration projects. The Associated Ukraine and Moldova are politically stagnating or experiencing regressive social developments. The intended standard export from the EU to these countries is politically ineffective. The hopes that the peoples of these countries have attached to the EU for support for social, political and economic transformation for all members of societies are disappointed.

Democracy and the rule of law in our neighborhood are the best assurance that we too can continue on our peaceful and stable path in the European Union. Just after your speech, I would like to point out again that, in my opinion, the reforms to which the states in our neighborhood - our partners - have committed themselves in the association agreement, are taking place under much more difficult conditions than the reforms that are being carried out in the Baltic countries or in the countries of the Warsaw Pact - including in your home country.

The multilateral dimension of the Eastern Partnership is of key importance here for countries such as Belarus. The example of Armenia, which joined the Eurasian Union in 2015 and then signed a \"Comprehensive and Deep Partnership Agreement\" with the EU in 2017 shows that some limited form of diversification is possible.

In the light of the commitments made by the European Union through the 2020 strategy, which refers to raising the employment rate in Europe by 75%, we need to ask ourselves a question. The important question is whether trade policy plays a central role in ensuring that growth, prosperity, employment and the maintenance of the welfare state are all interconnected. I strongly believe so. In fact, millions of jobs depend on the European trade agenda, looking for new markets abroad and certainly, also and above all, defining effective tools that protect our European industry. The question we are discussing today is not only whether China is a market economy or not a market economy, but rather that of understanding whether our European system can and must - in an obligatory manner in my opinion - fulfill the condition of giving rules that are equal for all and to give rules that start everyone from the same starting line, that is, fair and loyal competition. We know that European industry employs 34 million workers in our Member States, including hundreds of small and medium-sized enterprises, that between 2000 and 2014 the share of European production fell from 18 to 15%, which between 2008 and in 2014 3.5 million jobs were lost, and in the steel sector alone there is an overcapacity that becomes logically dangerous compared to the international market. I say this to make people understand and underline the strategic importance of this measure, which has aroused great interest from European industry but also legitimate concern, and which has always aroused motivation and interest here in the European Parliament. I am convinced so that the result we are arriving at is an important, fundamental, central result, with great work. And it is thanks to the collaboration of all the political groups and shadow colleagues of the Commission and the Council that it has been possible today to arrive at a shared text and a text which, in my opinion, is the best result we could have achieved. I try to quickly indicate which are the fundamental steps. First of all, the possibility of continuing to use an alternative method of calculating dumping compared to the standard one, the strengthening of the definition of significant destruction and with the inclusion of criteria that finally become complete and strong, also especially to the contribution of Parliament with respect to the valid Commission proposal, and which also go in the direction of finally giving an opening to the social, to the environment and also to the passage of the burden of proof, where the declaration of the Commission was precisely that there will be no further burdens on the our industry with respect to the procedure, transparency and reports of the Commission.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 328, "date": "2017-11-14.json", "name": "Cecilia Malmström", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, allow me to congratulate you on your first session in your new job, and I think it is also your birthday today, so let me congratulate you on that as well.

We have jointly put in a lot of work on this legal text, in the trilogue and in the different committees and the groups. There has been a lot of effort and a constructive approach to the Commission proposal. This legal text will introduce into our anti-dumping legislation a new method for calculating dumping on imports from any World Trade Organization country where there are significant distortions. This is essential in order to address the realities of today’s international trading environment and to restore a level playing field. It will ensure that European industries remain well equipped to deal with the unfair competition they may face from dumped and subsidised imports in the future, without, as the rapporteur said, placing an additional burden on them. I have repeatedly stressed the importance of free but fair trade, and this agreement endorses that view. We must be able to tackle distortions in exporting countries that affect free market principles – distortions that result in prices and costs which are not in line with reality. The new anti-dumping methodology will be country-neutral and it will deal head-on with the many distortions that we know exist in a number of exporting economies. It will also be the first time that our legislation will acknowledge the significance of social and environmental standards in the trade-defence field. This is an important development, and the efforts made by the legislature in striking the right balance here can only be praised.

This was renewed with the steel industry. Basically, we have a structural problem in Europe, which is that we were built on the defense of consumers, the defense of the market, but because of national sovereignty over industry, we have no policy. industrial, we do not have a real producer protection policy. Precisely on this point, for the first time, we are embarking on this approach and I am very proud that, within this Parliament, with the Council, we finally have social dumping and environmental dumping recognized in our protection policies. our industries, our employees, our jobs and, of course, the protection of employees and the environment.

Also may I restate my birthday greetings to you, Madam President, and if it’s not presumptuous to congratulate you on your immaculate chairing of this debate. Trade takes place, it has to take place, under agreed rules that are set internationally. It should be noted that we are talking about international rules, not EU rules. If a trade partner behaves in a way that is unfair, then the wronged party must be able to take appropriate action. Almost always, the unfair practice takes the form of exporting below the cost of production, in one word: ‘dumping’. And, by the way, it’s a huge relief that in the jargon-ridden etymology of trade, ‘dumping’ is a great word – it conveys more or less exactly what it is. So far, so good. But there’s a problem. There’s an EU problem. The EU is a Customs Union. Anti-dumping duties imposed by the EU have to be agreed by every Member State. As some of us will remember from two years ago, the European Steel Association, EUROFER, was crystal clear that China was systematically dumping steel. However, by the time the Commission finally got an agreement and imposed anti-dumping duties, it was too little, too late: the EU put on only a 40% tariff. By comparison, the United States had previously, and quickly, and almost in time, put on a 300% tariff, i.e. one that really worked. In the debate that took place on steel and China two years ago, our distinguished colleague made an important point that was partly valid. He was right: the Cameron-Osborne UK Government of the time would have been unlikely to impose the necessary tariffs on steel produced in China. However, the point is not what they would or wouldn’t have done, the point is that outside the EU the then-British Government could have imposed the necessary tariffs. The fact is that the European Union is just too large, too awkward, too clumsy, too divided, too inept, to be able to make proper and timely decisions on trade defence instruments.

The Chinese government has already announced that it will oppose the reform in the WTO, and the latest Congress of the Communist Party of China has clearly indicated that China intends to increase state control over its domestic economy and have a say in the foreign companies that operate. in China.

This proposed amendment on protection against dumped imports brings very important positive innovations. First: If there are market distortions such as a lack of environmental protection measures, child labor or government intervention in production, this test leads to the composition of the import price. The costs that exporters have saved on the environment or on workers can ultimately be offset with the help of protective tariffs from the Union. Second: The protective measures take effect whether a state has market economy status or not. Specifically, this means that European companies can continue to protect themselves effectively against the glut of imports, for example cheap steel from China, in the future. Third countries lose the chance to force domestic products off the domestic market through aggressive production and raw material subsidies. In the case of textile products, which were created under possibly unworthy working conditions, especially child labor, under the principles of massive environmental destruction, the price competitiveness will be interfered with and this will be taken away.

This is the very meaning of the English word dumping, unloading, dumping in heaps, in this case by container ships.

This is what he told the Chinese president with the outspokenness that we know him.As the European Union ramps up all-out free trade agreements, Trump has announced the United States' withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.The President of the United States therefore defends the interests of his citizens rather than those of multinationals.We can and must do the same.(The speaker agrees to answer a \"blue card\" question (Rule 162 (8) of the Rules of Procedure))", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 356, "date": "2017-11-14.json", "name": "Emmanuel Maurel (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "24505", "text": "Question \"blue card\".- Madam President, I have just heard what colleague Nicolas Bay said and, indeed, the European Parliament's resolution 2016 was a very important resolution, because it marked the will of Parliament, almost on all its benches,to recall the extent to which Europe had to protect itself.There is just one problem in your demonstration, it is that this resolution, you did not vote it, you courageously abstained in committee and I this systematic distortion between words and actions, that poses a problem for me, Itherefore wanted to call the assistance to witness.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 357, "date": "2017-11-14.json", "name": "Nicolas Bay (ENF)", "mepid": "124760", "text": "\"blue card\" response.- My dear colleague, you are not a novice in this house and you therefore know that, very often, the very complex texts which pass in committee or in plenary session indeed contain quite diverse provisions and that, sometimes, one can appreciate suchor such aspect, to consider that it constitutes a lesser evil, without appreciating a text in its entirety, including when it imposes very negative effects on our economy.Often, the abstention position is a nuanced position, a reserved position, a partial support position.I guess, I imagine and I dare to hope that these are nuances that do not escape you.But the main thing is to put an end to the logic of free trade which characterizes the European Union in all circumstances and which places our economy, our industries and our farmers in a situation of unfair competition which is untenable.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 358, "date": "2017-11-14.json", "name": "Santiago Fisas Ayxelà (PPE).", "mepid": "96729", "text": "- Madam President, dear Commissioner, I would like to congratulate my colleague and friend, Salvatore Cicu, for the great job he has done.

It does so in a country-neutral way. With this, we go away from our old system of dividing countries into non-market and market economies. The new methodology will look at all countries to see if there are distortions. This is not – and I would like to repeat that – this is not about giving market economy status to China. It never has been. The historical writing here should be revised a little bit: it has never been about this; it has been about respecting our commitments in the WTO. China is not a market economy – if it were, it would be much easier. This is not about China – it is about any country. The anti-dumping methodology is to capture market distortion; it is linked to intervention in third countries or in sectors of the country. It will ensure a smooth transition to the new methodology for the measures already in place, the grandfather with a clear time frame, and we strengthen our anti-dumping instrument to increase our ability to capture the full magnitude of subsidisation by making it possible to address subsidies identified in the course of the investigation.

It will be an important summit and it is crucial that the voice of the European Parliament can be heard there in this context. I wanted to begin by warmly thanking the fellow shadow rapporteurs for their collaboration. We have arrived at a balanced text which presents a strong position of the European Parliament on the need to renew our partnership with Africa. One of the major recommendations of our report is the need to strengthen political dialogue with the African continent. Indeed, I am convinced that political dialogue must be increased between the two continents, in order to set up a win-win partnership which responds to common challenges in a spirit of reciprocal sharing and respect. It is necessary to change the paradigm to go beyond the donor-recipient approach and move to an approach between two equal partners. In this relationship which unites the European Union with Africa, it is nevertheless necessary to recognize the special links which unite us with the group of ACP States. This is why we reiterate in our report the need to maintain this acquis, while improving and strengthening the regional dimension within the framework of the post-Cotonou process. If the political dialogue must be strengthened in order to have a relationship that responds to shared challenges, this also involves making resilience a central axis of cooperation between the two continents. This resilience must be addressed in these five dimensions: political, security, economic, environmental and social. To promote political resilience, governance and respect for rights need to be of man of the founding elements of our partnership with Africa and to support more frequent political exchanges between the various mixed parliamentary assemblies in order to exchange without taboos. The security issue is also crucial in our relationship with Africa. Indeed, as we underline in the report there are close links between development and security. Without security there can be no development and vice versa. This is why it is necessary to strengthen cooperation between the two continents to fight against organized crime, human trafficking or terrorism. While the European Union is a major player in guaranteeing security on the African continent, all African countries and regional organizations must also be involved in matters of peace and security. It is indeed important that Africa builds its own capacities. Another major challenge is to ensure the economic resilience of the two continents by creating quality jobs. This must involve investments in key sectors such as the blue economy, research, digitization, but also energy, basic infrastructure and even agriculture. The decisive role of the private sector and SMEs is recalled in our report, because we all know it is necessary to create wealth on the African continent. And this created wealth must stay there. Each year, more than $ 50 billion illegally escapes Africa. It is more than official development assistance. We must strengthen the tools to fight tax evasion and corruption, this is a sine qua non for ensuring sustainable development. Environmental and social resilience are also important elements of our report. In addition to the demographic challenges that we must take into account, the issue of climate change is crucial for the African continent, in view of the increasing number of natural disasters over the past 10 years and their increased intensity. Finally, migration and mobility are issues in our relationship with Africa that we cannot avoid. Indeed, the migratory flow that we are experiencing must be able to be better controlled and not be suffered. In my opinion, it is important that the phenomena be approached in a coordinated and comprehensive manner between the two continents, involving the countries of origin, transit and destination in order to make it a tool for the development of both continents, which requires a long term approach. And finally, several European initiatives deserve to be mentioned, the FEDD, the various trust funds or the migration partnerships which should make it possible to fight against the root causes of irregular migration. For lasting solutions to be put in place, it is urgent that the Member States contribute financially to the various funds set up at European level, as President Juncker reminded us. There are many challenges to overcome for the 218 million people who are victims of extreme poverty on the African continent to emerge from it. This is a challenge that we must meet together and I sincerely hope that the next summit in Abidjan will provide answers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 381, "date": "2017-11-14.json", "name": "Karmenu Vella", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Ponga, for an excellent and very useful report.

According to projections, sub-Saharan Africa needs to create around 18 million new jobs each year up to 2035 in order to absorb new labour market entrants, compared to the three million formal jobs created today. It should be a priority for both Africa and Europe to turn demographic developments into a dividend. We require inclusive development and sustainable growth for large-scale job creation. The leitmotiv of the fifth AU-EU Summit taking place on 29—30 November this year in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, will be investing in youth. More broadly, this will provide a critical opportunity for the EU and Africa to build a stronger political partnership and increase our cooperation in the international arena, guided by: the UN’s 2030 agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals; the African Union’s Agenda 2063; the global strategy for the European Union’s foreign and security policy; as well as the new European consensus on development.  The finalisation of your report just a few weeks before this event is very timely, and it is appreciated to see key teams and priority areas reinforced by its content. The summit should strive to bring Africa and Europe closer together through the strengthening of economic cooperation and the promotion of sustainable development, with both continents living side by side in peace, security, democracy, prosperity, solidarity and human dignity.  The summit should confirm and strengthen our mutual engagement and joint action for the period 2018 to 2020 in the framework of the Joint Africa-EU Strategy. As you know well, the Africa-EU strategic partnership is based on shared values. It promotes common interests and shared strategic objectives, which are at the centre of the political and policy dialogue between the African Union and the European Union, as well as between the African Union member states and the EU. This also involves a fruitful dialogue and cooperation between the European Parliament and the Pan-African Parliament, which we strongly encourage.  I am glad to note that the meeting between the European Parliament and the Pan-African Parliament will take place on 27 and 28 November in Abidjan. This partnership must also go beyond political institutions and involve all stakeholders: non-state actors such as civil society organisations, youth organisations, the private sector, as well as economic and social actors. The summit agenda will be built around five key themes: peace and security; governance; investment and job creation; knowledge and skills; and mobility and migration. The overarching theme of youth will be prominently reflected throughout the summit’s agenda. We are exploring the possibility of strengthening the involvement of different stakeholders, in particular of youth, beyond the customary presentation of the recommendations in the opening session.  The European Union aims for concrete outcomes that make a difference, setting a collective agenda with ownership and contributions from all in the priority areas, with strong commitments from both sides coupled with concrete joint initiatives. For example, digital technologies and services are major drivers to boost development and a major source of growth and quality jobs for youth in various sectors, while also empowering women and girls. Sustainable energy and agriculture, the blue economy, building climate resilience, and research and innovation are equally important, and the list goes on. Significant work has been undertaken in preparation of the summit with the clear objective to go beyond declarations of intent and to establish concrete proposals for implementation. In the run-up to the summit, two successful summit side events have already taken place: the Civil Society Forum in Tunis in July and the Youth Summit in Abidjan on 9 and 11 October. A number of other events will follow and I would like to mention the EU-Africa Business Forum on 27 November. This sixth EU-Africa Business Forum will be entitled ‘Investing in job creation for youth’, with a specific focus on youth and women’s entrepreneurship. It will also deal with innovative financing and provide a platform to promote the EU’s new external investment plan, agri-business, renewable energy and digitalisation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 382, "date": "2017-11-14.json", "name": "Fabio Massimo Castaldo", "mepid": "124812", "text": "draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are at a crucial moment for relations between Europe and Africa.

The European Union and its Member States are the main partner for Africa, a continent that will double its population by 2050. Precisely for this reason, the main aspect on which we must focus is support for African youth, a theme that is at the heart of this conference, but which must be so in deeds and not just in words. If we really want to build resilient societies and fight against the causes that are at the root of radicalization, that's where we need to act, it's by creating jobs, creating participation, giving hope to those who don't have any today that we can change the face of a continent that is the main mirror of our geopolitical ambition.

Difficult topics such as migration and mobility, and highlighting the role of young people as well as addressing recommendations related to the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda, are also included in this report.

We'll adopt a good report on Thursday. Thank you for the constructive cooperation.

The report also makes it clear that we are ruling out demands that are repeatedly made - migration policy and the conditioning of development cooperation. Development cooperation remains a priority for poverty reduction, and conditioning to the recipient countries according to the motto “Keep the refugees off our necks, then there will be development funds” must not take place. We therefore also want - and this is what the report makes clear - legal migration opportunities in order to somewhat prevent the disasters that have been going on for years in the Mediterranean Sea and in desert areas. We have brought in some of our key positions. We want there to be fair access to land and water as a means of strengthening smallholder family businesses. In particular, we want self-determination to be guaranteed in family planning. And here I am addressing a point that is very important: if we want to curb overpopulation, we need clear messages, then we also need self-determination. Otherwise, many of our development cooperation efforts will be of relatively little use if, as a result of unbelievable population growth, the aid and whatever progress we have made is essentially undone.

Africa and Europe are neighboring continents, I think this is too often forgotten. We are linked by a common history, sometimes painful, sometimes perspective, we share cultures and languages ​​in common and I think - I have already pleaded for this for a very long time - that Africa and Europe must forge a common strategy and an authentic and ambitious partnership which definitively abandons paternalism and turns its back on unacceptable forms of neocolonialism, which still too often trot in the heads of certain decision-makers. We need a real political and economic partnership. It would be profitable both for Europe and for Africa. The best path would be the economic development of Africa. This is the reason why I have always defended economic partnership agreements. Africa is in dire need of a vibrant market economy which could create prosperity by harnessing its immense resources and which could also lift millions of citizens out of poverty and in particular, as a colleague said, millions of young people. who are unemployed and without prospects. But if Africa needs market economies, it also needs strong states that guarantee a fair distribution of this wealth that is created. Too often it happens that, even where there is growth - sometimes even, there was a time, in double digits, I think of Latin America -, poverty does not reduce, because it is concentrated in those who create it selfishly, it must be said. The state must therefore play an important role. We must also become political partners in geopolitical space.

You cannot fight poverty in a few years and fighting the root causes of migration takes a lot of time: certainly an entire generation. Africa faces a huge demographic challenge. Many young people are looking for work and a better life, and we must and can help with that. But then we must be prepared to make a long-term commitment to the developments in that continent, then we will have to act more fairly, invest more fairly and not spend our development money on closing borders but on poverty reduction.

It is therefore urgent to help Africa, out of solidarity towards Africans, but also in our interest, because if we do nothing, we will experience an unprecedented migratory flood. To help Africa, the European Union must increase its grants under the European Development Fund. For their part, European states must respect their commitment to devote 0.7% of their GDP to development aid, in order to intensify their cooperation with Africa. The Ponga report is right to reiterate these objectives, notably by endorsing Jean-Louis Borloo's proposal to electrify Africa. But it disappoints in three ways. First, by wanting to deliver Africa to globalized free trade, which would amount to ruining its traditional agriculture when it should be encouraged instead. Second, by not supporting enough the G5 Sahel, an African counterterrorism intervention force, created by five African states, with the help of France.

Not only since the Paradise Papers did we know that European companies, in cooperation with corrupt African regimes, are very good at bringing the profits out of the continent and not paying taxes.

Protecting biodiversity is not only necessary for nature itself, but is essential for our well-being and prosperity. For example, one in six jobs in the European Union is dependent on nature and the added value of Natura 2000 is many times greater than the management costs. Erasing the biodiversity strategy will cost us 50 billion euros per year. Stopping biodiversity loss must be a political priority. The Bird and Habitat Directives are a vital link in this story and must be fully implemented. This is the core message of the biodiversity report adopted by the European Parliament in February 2016 and for which I was rapporteur. At the end of 2016, the Commission finally cleared the uncertainty about the Nature Directives. The Commission also decided that the guidelines are fit for purpose and that the focus should be on their better and accelerated implementation. The Action Plan for Nature, People and the Economy proposed by the Commission earlier this year is without a doubt a step forward. But at the same time, the plan is inadequate and insufficient to achieve the biodiversity goals. Without additional efforts, we will miss the appointment again in 2020. The Environment Committee has a number of clear and concrete questions and wants to use them to send a strong signal about what can and must be improved. The action plan contains only one reference to the biodiversity strategy. How will the Commission respond to Parliament's more general requests for effective achievement of the 2020 targets? Moreover, the action plan only extends to 2020. It will remain silent for the period after 2020. What strategy does the Commission consider necessary for that post-2020 period? Financing is also essential. How will the Commission ensure that adequate funding is available, including in the next Multiannual Financial Framework? Is the Does the Commission intend to introduce a tracking mechanism for Natura 2000 expenditure to improve transparency, accountability and efficiency of EU funds, as recommended by the European Court of Auditors? Furthermore, the action plan does not respond to important initiatives for which Parliament has long been a requesting party. I am thinking of the creation of a trans-European network for green infrastructure, an EU initiative for pollinators and measures against illegal killing of birds, to name a few. When will the Commission publish its proposals on this matter? Finally, the coherence between biodiversity policy and other areas such as the common agricultural policy, including cohesion policy, remains a huge challenge. How does the Commission intend to increase this coherence? How does the Commission intend to integrate Natura 2000 and wider biodiversity measures in those areas? How does the Commission intend to monitor the impact of the common agricultural policy on biodiversity? We expect not only concrete answers from the Commission, but also a clear commitment. A lot of precious time has been lost and the clock is ticking. For the health, well-being and prosperity of future generations, we must do everything we can to safeguard nature and biodiversity. It goes without saying that the commitment of all actors is required for this. Biodiversity is everyone's business.

As you know, the plan is the result of a comprehensive and participatory evaluation process and a fitness check on the Habitats and Birds Directives. The findings of the fitness check were fully endorsed by the College of Commissioners during an orientation debate in December last year. The conclusion was clear: there is no essential problem with the legal framework of the Habitats and Birds Directives. It remains fundamentally sound, but there are problems with the application of the framework, and that is why we do not get the results that we want. There are funding shortages and we need more knowledge and more commitment. These are the key issues and that is why we prepared a strategic plan to address those gaps. Let me turn to the specific questions you have tabled for today’s debate. Your first question is about the links between the Action Plan and the 2020 Biodiversity Strategy. The Action Plan includes 15 concrete actions. These reflect the findings of the fitness check on the Habitats and Birds Directives and address the main shortcomings revealed by this evidence-based evaluation. The aim of the plan is rapidly to improve the practical implementation of the directives, to accelerate progress towards the EU 2020 goal of halting and reversing the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and to improve consistency between the Habitats and Birds Directives and broader socio-economic objectives. Implementation of the Action Plan is essential in order to make progress on Target 1 of the EU Biodiversity Strategy, to – and I quote – ‘fully implement the Birds and Habitats Directives’. It will also contribute to achieving other targets in this strategy, namely Targets 2, 3 and 4, on restoration, agriculture, forestry and fisheries. Most of the actions are being launched in 2017 so that the Commission can report on their delivery before the end of its current term of office in 2019. We are aware that further efforts are needed to reach the 2020 biodiversity targets. The upcoming initiative to address the decline of pollinators is just one example of the Commission’s response to the calls made by Parliament to achieve the 2020 targets. Since you also asked about the Commission’s intentions from 2020 onwards, I can tell you that the nature Directives provide a solid and long-term legal foundation for EU biodiversity policy. The Commission plans to evaluate the EU Biodiversity Strategy and to report on its finding by 2020. The outcome of this evaluation will feed into thinking on the follow-up to the current EU Biodiversity Strategy, along with a global biodiversity framework for post-2020. Let me now address question two, which concerns specific initiatives on the Trans-European Network for Green Infrastructure (TEN-G), and also pollinators, access to justice and the illegal killing of birds. On TEN-G, I referred to Action 12 of the Action Plan which consists of providing guidance to support the deployment of EU-level green infrastructure, including through improving connectivity of Natura 2000 areas by mid-2018. A strategy framework to facilitate a more integrated approach to green infrastructure will be proposed under the current Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), providing some lessons for future inspiration. In addition, Action 1(b) of the Action Plan will motivate decision-makers to invest in green infrastructure through the provision of deeper guidance and appreciation of the value of ecosystem services.  On pollinators, the Commission intends to launch a dedicated initiative to complement the Action Plan. On access to justice, as a previous legislative proposal did not prove successful in Council, the Commission adopted in April 2017 an interpretative notice, presenting and explaining the substantial body of case law of the Court of Justice on the subject, including on the nature Directives. The Commission also undertakes many measures to eliminate illegal bird trapping, killing and trade, in cooperation with international conventions, and enforces the provision of the Birds Directive prohibiting trapping, killing and trade. Financial support is provided through the EU LIFE Programme funding.  The Commission assists Member States in fulfilling their obligations under the Birds Directive, for example through the ongoing LIFE European Social Enterprise Training (EuroSET) project, which is developing action plans and management plans for 16 threatened bird species. The third question is about mainstreaming Natura 2000 and wider biodiversity measures with other policies, especially with the common agricultural policy (CAP). As regards the current funding framework, Natura 2000 and wider biodiversity measures can be co-financed under several EU policies. As decisions on the allocation of EU funds under shared management rest primarily with the Member States, they are not obliged to take up the opportunities for financing Natura 2000 from the EU budget. Actions 9 to 12 of the Action Plan aim to facilitate full and effective use of the financial resources allocated for biodiversity protection and Natura 2000 sites in the period 2014-2020 under the various programmes and, where feasible, to promote increased allocations and uptake. In the context of Action 9 under the Action Plan, the impact of the CAP on biodiversity will be addressed in a specific evaluation scheduled for the second half of 2018. In accordance with the Commission guidelines, such an evaluation includes an assessment of consistency between the various policy areas concerned.  Let me now turn to a specific issue which is also the subject of the third question: large carnivores. The return of large carnivores, especially the wolf, to areas where they have been absent for a long time represents a significant challenge, especially at local level. The Action Plan envisages a series of measures to help address these challenges. For example, the Commission will update and actively promote, in all EU languages, its guidance document on species protection rules, which will include clarifications on flexibility within the existing legal framework. The Commission will also bring together experts from different Member States at bio-geographical level to address common challenges. This may also cover large carnivores whose populations are often transboundary. Action 13 of the Action Plan specifically proposes providing further support through the involvement of local and regional authorities, in order to inspire dialogue and help find solutions at a local level. The Commission will encourage the full and effective use of the financial resources under the European Agricultural Rural Development Fund (EARDF) to support coexistence through rural development measures and, in this context, support can be provided to farmers for preventive measures aimed at mitigating the risk of damage by large carnivores to livestock farming. Lastly, in question four, you ask about the next MFF. Here, I will be very brief as the Commission is now preparing its proposals for the post-2020 MFF. The indicators and the results from the ongoing financing period and the measures taken under the Action Plan will inform the debate and the reflections on the next MFF. It is too early to give indications of how Natura 2000 and wider biodiversity measures will be taken into account.  I thank the Members for their attention and I look forward to any further thoughts they may have on this broad, but important, topic.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 423, "date": "2017-11-14.json", "name": "Herbert Dorfmann", "mepid": "96787", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen! The Natura 2000 guidelines are now almost exactly 25 years old. And if you look back over these 25 years, you can say: on the one hand, a lot has been achieved, but on the other hand, there are perhaps hardly any guidelines in our legal texts that also cause such friction on the ground. This has to do with the fact that the Natura 2000 directives very often follow a top-down concept, that is to say that the Member States have the feeling that something is being imposed on them and, on the other hand, that the management of the Natura 2000 areas is not as before there are big gaps. That is why, Commissioner, my group is in favor of the action plan that has been submitted because, in our opinion, it is a step in the right direction and because we believe that the Natura 2000 directives must, on the one hand, be implemented in a subsidiary and cooperative manner. Subsidiary with those who are affected locally - with the administrations in the Member States and the regions - and, above all, cooperatively with those who are really affected, and these are mostly the landowners. But let me come back in a couple of sentences to a question that you just raised, Commissioner, and that is the question of large carnivores, particularly the wolf. Wherever the wolf returns today, it usually creates problems, because it does not return to a natural landscape, but to a cultural landscape - a cultural landscape where there are farmers, where there is breeding of small animals, where there is tourism where there are people and where there are usually massive problems. I fear, Commissioner, that a multilingual information sheet is not necessarily enough and that you cannot necessarily satisfy the farmers if you say: OK, we will pay for that from the Agricultural Fund. That means de facto that the Farmers can pay themselves.That is not the purpose of providing compensation for damage that undoubtedly occurs.I think we have to realize that the wolf is no longer an endangered animal, that there are populations that are in good conservation status, and that maybe it is our job to think about taboos tooQuestion to ponder: How can wolves also be managed where the good conservation status has been achieved, and do wolves really have to return all over Europe?I think that's our job.Only then will we give a sensible answer to those affected on site.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 424, "date": "2017-11-14.json", "name": "Karin Kadenbach", "mepid": "97014", "text": "on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen!

A 75% decline in insect pollinator populations; just under 10% of our freshwater fishes are now threatened; one in ten of our bee species is facing extinction; a 72% decrease in butterflies. Animals and plants are disappearing across Europe. It is a silent crisis.  The Birds and Habitats Directives are conservation’s gold standards. Yet even they still miss their targets. Why? Is it the fact that the funding is going astray, or the political will to deliver is missing? Or because the public can’t see what is happening? And they really do care about nature. Well-financed Natura 2000 sites help create jobs, building green infrastructure with businesses, but again we are not going to meet the 2020 biodiversity targets and we’ll see further deterioration of nature.  So where’s the transparency? Where is the money going? Is the money being used effectively? We need to know. This House wants to work with the Commission and Member States to tackle this silent crisis. This time, Commissioner, let’s make it happen.

This action plan is an important step forward, as it aims to improve the practical implementation of the nature directives. But is it sufficient? Is it comprehensive enough? Despite the strong positive commitment to addressing the root problems, I think that the European Commission has failed to propose actions to tackle the drivers of biodiversity loss, including agriculture, transport and energy.  Firstly, the Commission must improve coherence with common agricultural policy and make sure that all infrastructure developments are fitted with proper environmental safeguards. Financing is also a very important issue. According to an IEP report, the current EU budget covers only up to 19% of the funding needed to properly manage Natura 2000 sites. Why does the action plan not better highlight the urgency of the need to scale up financial resources? Biodiversity has to be mainstreamed in the EU budgets beyond 2020, with nature protection earmarked in each individual instrument in addition to the dedicated biodiversity scheme.

This important combination is what the Action Plan of the European Commission and reality revolve around. A flexible implementation approach contributes to eliminating unnecessary conflicts and problems that have arisen between conservationists, governments, farmers, estate owners and fishermen. By developing improved guidelines with regulations and best practices, the Commission should provide effective support for implementation by provinces and governments. That also means financial compensation. Landowners should also be able to receive market-based compensation for green and blue ecosystem services for nature, landscape and water. When it comes to the explosive growth of geese and cormorants that threaten other waterfowl and rare fish species, game management is required. The same also applies to the wolf. The real danger posed by wolf-dog hybrids must be combated by consistent hunters: grazing livestock and the safety of our citizens are paramount.

Dear Commissioner, you also had the opportunity to speak to anglers, pond farmers and fishermen in my home state of Brandenburg. Of course there are problems that still need to be addressed. With us it is the cormorant; the population has recovered very well and there is great competition for the fishermen when it comes to catching. I think that one really has to think about regulation.

In addition to the destruction of habitats by humans, climate change, environmental pollution and the spread of exotic animal and plant species, intensive agriculture is largely responsible for this sad development. We therefore need a new European agricultural policy that no longer focuses on mass production and growth at any price, but rather on the production of healthy food and the preservation of nature - which of course has to be rewarded financially. The previous agricultural policy is, with regard to the extinction of so many animal and plant species, but also in many other respects - a single catastrophe. It is time we took action. We also need a massive increase in funding for ensuring the Birds and Habitats Directive, for Natura 2000 and for many other measures.

This is a good balance. The preservation of biodiversity is an objective that we must share with the population, with the entire population, those directly concerned by the measures taken as well as populations further afield. Natura 2000 is thus a constructive approach if it is accompanied by sufficient means for its implementation, allowing the adoption of new practices by the population and the development of an active and dynamic economy. But this is not the case with our current management of large predators, large carnivores in particular. The Commission is determined to maintain strict protection of the wolf, without taking into account the impacts on breeding and life in rural areas, including tourism. Today the breeders have tried everything. They have no effective means of protection against predation from the wolf, a determined, intelligent and cunning animal. The idyllic vision of the wolf is part of an urban approach far removed from the real life of the territories it frequents. I come from there. Commissioner, let me ask you two questions: Have you ever had to deal with a desperate shepherd who collapses in front of you in tears?

That this does not apply to the wolf could be observed a few days ago in my southern German homeland. For the first time in a hundred years, a wolf killed farm animals in Baden-Württemberg, there were three sheep. Today's debate on the nature conservation action plan is about the question of coexistence between humans and animals, but also between farm animals and wild animals. During the aptitude test, we agreed not to open up the EU nature conservation directives, but rather that their implementation must be better. I therefore welcome the action plan. The guidelines allow the necessary flexibility between humans and nature. However, the Commission must further clarify the application of this discretion by the Member States by developing further guidelines. Based on the beaver management of my neighbors in Bavaria, it can be shown that regional management is quite feasible. Addressing the Member States and the regions: Of course, there must also be a clear political will for real management of wild animals. Addressed to the European Commission: If there are clear impulses from the regions and member states and the favorable conservation status is also proven, then the Commission must act.

It's almost like a fairy tale: After an absence of over a hundred years, the wolf is back in Europe. It is spreading rapidly, that sounds spectacular. But when the returnees have reached their own terrace, it is more difficult to be happy. Because the wolf is definitely not a cuddly kitten. From Lower Saxony I keep getting pictures of cracked sheep, cattle and even dogs. It seems only a matter of time before a human falls victim to the predators. We understand these concerns. When strictly protected species have achieved a good conservation status and at the same time endanger sustainable development in rural areas, the Commission must act. Incidentally, this also applies to the cormorant. Its massive expansion in recent years has had a devastating impact on fish stocks. For example, on the Dümmer in Lower Saxony, the important predatory fish population has collapsed dramatically due to the cormorant. No wonder that a cormorant eats up to half a kilo of fish per day on average. The local people urgently need more room for maneuver. It cannot be that flexible solutions on site fail due to rigid European guidelines. Tomorrow we have the chance to bring Europe closer to its citizens again.

I have heard, Mr Vella, the Commission 's answers, but words must be combined with deeds. I am referring to the protection of Natura 2000 sites in Greece. A recent example is the brutal violation of the legislation for the protection of the Natura 2000 area in the area of ​​South Karystia, on Mount Ochi in Evia, where the installation of wind farms that will produce 50% of the total wind energy in Greece, destroying the environment , flora, fauna and especially wild birds.

Mr Dorfmann talked about the Natura 2000 sites and said that a lot has been achieved. A lot has been achieved in identifying the Natura 2000 sites, but I am not satisfied that a lot has been achieved in terms of managing them. In fact, only about 50% of the identified sites are being managed – and that is on land. When it comes to marine protected areas (MPAs), in the seas, we have only reached 6% of the area that we are targeting, whereas on land we have reached 20% which has been identified, but only 10% which is being managed. On the large carnivores issue, many mentioned large carnivores and that they could be problematic, but there are solutions and some Member States have found a number of solutions to a number of their problems. In our Environmental Implementation Review (EIR) we will be presenting a peer—to—peer. If Member States are lacking solutions whilst others have the solutions, we will hopefully be able to bring the best practices from one Member State to another. The important thing is not to move away from the problem but to find a solution. To Ms Kadenbach, yes, the issue of whether the legislation is in place, and whether we have the necessary funding to manage the sites, was one of the problems identified in the REFIT Fitness Check. One way of dealing with this, first of all, is that for funding which is being allocated to other sectors, especially agriculture under the CAP, we have to make certain that output is compatible with the nature directives as well. She mentioned pollinators and, as I said, we will be presenting a dedicated initiative on this. I agree with Ms Catherine Bearder that we are almost testing our biodiversity to its limits and that the news is not good, but I have to say that improvements – hopefully – will be made. That is the idea of this action plan, because if we were to continue with a ‘business as usual’ approach, things would have continued to deteriorate even further. Obviously there are many reasons; most of the reasons we can handle, some of the reasons will be a little bit more problematic but we still have to handle them. I am referring for example to agriculture. I am not talking about all agriculture, because agriculture has some good practices and it has some bad practices. We are not after taking away a single euro from the CAP, what we are after is making certain that every single euro which is spent in the CAP is spent sustainably and in protecting and strengthening nature as well. Ms Boylan expressed her interests and her concerns about Ireland, and again she mentioned the Natura 2000 sites. As I have already said, these have been a success story, but a lot more could be achieved. We are always talking about the Natura 2000 sites, which cover only 20% of our land, but we have to keep in mind that we still have to manage and protect our biodiversity in the other 80% which is outside the Natura 2000 areas. Mr Jávor asked whether this action plan is enough. I say, no, it is not enough. Why? Because it is an action plan and unless it is implemented, then the whole purpose of coming up with this action plan would be totally meaningless. He also mentioned the three sectors: transport, energy and agriculture, and their financing. As I said before, we have to make certain that every single euro spent in the multiannual financial framework (MFF) is spent with greening and sustainability in mind. Ms Schreijer-Pierik mentioned the unnecessary conflict between farmers, NGOs, authorities and I do agree with at least one word: ‘unnecessary’. Why? Because there have been some good examples of local solutions with the participation of all the stakeholders, including farmers. When we talk about the farmers and biodiversity, we have to look at the farmers as part of the solution and not always as part of the problem. I have spoken with a number of agriculture ministers, with a number of agricultural organisations, and I have to say they do understand the problem and most of them are very willing to be part of the solution and not of the problem. It is also in their interest, because when we come up with directives, with legislation to protect water, air, and soil, it is in the interest not just of nature but it is in the interest of farmers themselves. With regard to what Ms Melior said, that we have the directives and we have to implement: Yes we have the directives, some of the directives we have had for 38 years and one of my reactions when we said, ‘Ah, we have to implement them’ was: But should it take us 38 years to realise that we have to start implementing directives which we came up with 30 years ago? Ms Melior mentioned Brandenburg, I was there, I was present, I talked to the fishermen and this week I had a team from my services there and the report that I have back is that they have agreed on a list of actions, on a programme that they will take together and hopefully if this sort of programme works, we will be able to introduce this to other regions as well. Mr Eck said that by 2020 that we will not achieve our targets, even with the action plan. My reaction to that is: imagine how we could achieve them then without the action plan, how we could achieve them with the ‘business as usual’ approach. I agree that we will not reach it unless we are prepared to act. Mr Dantin spoke about ‘nature, people and economy’ in the title. I agree with him, that is the sustainability concept. We are not talking environment, we are not talking only nature but we are talking about sustainability. Sustainability does not start and end with nature, it does not start and end with people, it does not even start and end with the economy. The idea of sustainability is that one of these sectors does not move forward at the expense of the others. The issue of wolves came out several times. I have spoken about wolves in several of our Member States. The last time I spoke about wolves was about two weeks ago in Sweden, where they have a different problem because the problem in Sweden is, from an environmental perspective, their genetic status, not a question of numbers. It is time that we took the issue of wolves – not wolves in Spain, or wolves in Italy, or wolves in Sweden – but the whole issue of wolves across Europe so that we can come up with some good ideas how to manage this species. When we talk about problematic species – we are dealing with about 1 500 species – we are always mentioning the same five. We should not disregard the whole action plan and the whole directives which are dealing with 1 500 species simply because we have a problem with two, three or four of these species. On what Mr Lins said, there is no better solution than a local solution, very often it happens positively that solutions are found locally between all the stakeholders, where we have farmers, NGOs, fishermen, authorities and whatever. When these solutions are solved at a local level, we never hear anything about them in practice. Unfortunately, when local solutions are not found, then the authorities and everyone throws those problems back to Brussels.  Mr Gieseke spoke about the wolves again and Mr Stanislav Polčák spoke about the gaps between the directives and their implementation. A very good, important point that was mentioned was the need for the local and regional level. When we talk about implementation, very often we discuss implementation with central government but the implementation is taking place on the ground at local and regional level. I believe that that is where the focus should be. I agree with Mr Tolić that we have not only to implement but to speed up implementation because there is a lot of urgency. Unfortunately, I talk about this urgency because I fear that things are happening quicker than we were expecting, and I always give the example of the Great Barrier Reef which I mentioned this week in Bonn. When scientists started talking about the Great Barrier Reef and the problems it will have with climate change, this was 20 years ago and they predicted that by 2050 the Great Barrier Reef and other reefs will have problems. Today, 30 years before 2050, we have a big percentage of our reefs which are already gone. I fear that things are moving fast even than our scientists are telling us. It is not just a question of acting but acting with urgency as well. We often discuss, as Mr Kuhn said, even on a bilateral basis, the issues of cormorants which could be not always problematic, but they can be problematic in some areas for some economic activities. As is the case with Brandenburg, we are trying to solve and we are trying to be part of the solution as well. With regard to Mr Marias, I will look whether the specific issue has been handled or not and I will get back to you.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 439, "date": "2017-11-14.json", "name": "Πρόεδρος. –", "mepid": "28586", "text": "I have received a motion for a resolution to end this debate.The discussion is over.The vote will take place tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "google"}]
