I grew up in Slovakia in the years after the Velvet Revolution. For people of my generation membership of the European Union basically meant a guarantee of life in freedom and democracy. The EU was meant to be a place where you don’t get imprisoned if you speak out freely, which is what the Communist regime did to my grandfather, who was a dissident intellectual. The EU was meant to be a place where you don’t get thrown out of your job for disagreeing with those in power, which is what happened to other members of my family. But the problem is that this image of the EU, the image of my youth, the image of the EU as a guardian of democracy is now being shattered and instead it has developed a very high tolerance – an unacceptably high tolerance – for authoritarian politics. We have at least one Member State which can no longer be considered a democracy; we have another Member State – Poland – in which judges can be prosecuted for a verdict against the interests of the ruling party; and, in many other Member States, we have thousands on the street protesting against years of corruption and state capture, all of which begs the question where has the EU been while national governments have undermined democratic institutions or plundered public resources? The proposal that we put before the plenary should put the EU in a position to do much more. What we need is a permanent, legally binding mechanism that, first of all, streamlines and makes more effective the rule of law instruments that we have; second, covers all aspects of Article 2 and all values enshrined there; and, third, ensures that compliance by Member States is not just reviewed periodically but also enforced. Enforcement action is precisely what has so far also been missing from the Commission’s otherwise thorough and very welcome report last week. But it is clear that monitoring alone will not bring back judicial independence in Poland, nor will it save the Index media in Hungary. We really we do need enforcement. For instance, in Poland, the Commission still hasn’t come up with a request to impose fines, despite the fact that the Polish Government is disrespecting the ruling of the European Court of Justice, and we can continue on and on. But, equally importantly, the Council needs to stop diluting the budget conditionality proposal. We know that EU money has demonstrably fuelled the rise of authoritarian and corrupt politics in our Member States and this cannot continue. But the problem is that it will continue if the proposal of the German Presidency is adopted because it is weak and will not protect either the EU budget or the rule of law in Europe. If the Commission and the Council are serious about restoring the EU as a community of shared values, I would expect them immediately to begin negotiations on the proposal that Parliament is putting forward for a binding mechanism as soon as possible. We know that there will be pushback and we know that some Member States might reject it outright, seeing as they are willing to hold the entire continent hostage to rule of law conditionality, but there is a piece of good news as well. The Council only needs a qualified majority to negotiate and adopt our proposal and therefore reclaim some of the EU’s aspiration for a democratic project.

Nothing less than the survival of the European Union is at stake if journalists are attacked in the European Union, corruption is not combated, the independence of the judiciary is jeopardised. It is therefore right that the Commission should produce an annual report on the rule of law, but it is an aberration that this report lacks the aspects of fundamental rights and democracy. How else should we tackle this when, for example, LGBTQI-free zones are created in a Member State? We therefore need the monitoring mechanism for democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights called for in this report. This mechanism is effective when it is underlined with a strong conditionalisation in the budget. That is what we will continue to fight for.

Let me first thank the rapporteur, Mr Šimečka, for his work dedicated to defending the fundamental values of the EU and such a comprehensive report. President von der Leyen said it clearly in her State of the Union speech of a few days ago. Mutual trust is at the very heart of the Union and the way we do things together. Breaches of the rule of law cannot be tolerated, and we will continue to defend the rule of law and the integrity of our European institutions. European values are not for sale. We share the objectives of the proposals of the Parliament to set a positive agenda for promoting, protecting and reinforcing Union values in accordance with Article 2 of the Treaty. This also corresponds to the objectives of the Commission for a new push for European democracy, including the first annual rule of law report published on 30 September as part of the new Comprehensive European Rule of Law Mechanism, and the Commission is well aware of the request of the Parliament for a broader mechanism covering not only the rule of law but also democracy and fundamental rights. I would like to underline, then, that the scope of the rule of law mechanism is already comprehensive, as it is covering four areas: the national justice systems; the anti-corruption frameworks; media pluralism and media freedom; and other institutional issues related to checks and balances. The wide scope covers issues which are particularly important for the European Parliament, such as the enabling framework for civil society. All these aspects contribute also to the promotion of democracy and respect of fundamental rights. In the next years, the Commission will consider consolidating its monitoring in these areas and could cover additional aspects. The Commission also recognises the necessity to further promote democracy and respect for fundamental rights. We believe that it requires a diversity of tailor-made approaches and instruments. As regards fundamental rights, the Commission intends to present, still this year, the new strategy for the application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Particular attention will be given to the application of the Charter in the Member States and impact on citizens daily lives. And also by the end of this year, the Commission will present another flagship initiative – the European Democracy Action Plan – which will focus on countering disinformation and adapting to evolving threats and manipulations, as well as supporting free and independent media. The European Democracy Action Plan will specifically contribute to upholding fundamental rights and strengthening democracies through three integrated themes. They are: elections’ integrity; the second is strengthening freedom of expression and democratic debate; and the third theme is tackling disinformation in a coherent manner considering the need to look together at all the means used to interfere in our democratic system. The Action Plan will also have a particular focus on citizens’ participation and the role of civil society. Other initiatives and strategies will also further promote our basic foundations, for instance the forthcoming EU citizenship report and other strategies to build a Union of equality. The Commission will continue to monitor the impact of measures adopted in the context of the COVID-19 crisis as regards compliance with EU law and ensuring free and fair elections and a fair democratic debate until restrictions are lifted. As regards more specifically the concrete Parliament proposals for the rule-of-law monitoring and its follow-up, I will now give the floor to Commissioner Reynders.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 11, "date": "2020-10-05.json", "name": "Didier Reynders", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Grazie, Presidente. Honourable Members, I would like to reinforce, if it’s possible, what Vice—President Jourová just said: the Commission fully agrees with the European Parliament with regard to the importance of strengthening the EU’s capacity to monitor respect of our common values.  For this reason, the Commission presented last week – as was said by the rapporteur, Mr Šimečka, and thank you for your report – its first annual report on the rule of law, at the centre of a comprehensive European rule of law mechanism. The mechanism is broader than just the report. The mechanism is a yearly process with the aim to prevent problems from emerging or deepening, notably by having open debates and by changing best practices.  The aim of the rule of law report is to look at key developments as regards the rule of law across the whole European Union. It covers both positive developments and challenges, and provides a country—specific assessment of all the 27 Member States.  With regard to the methodology as proposed by the Parliament for the annual monitoring cycle, the Commission agrees on the importance of the consultation of stakeholders and on using a variety of sources, including via visits in the Member States. This has been the approach already for the first annual rule of law report. All the Member States provided written input and we also carried out a targeted stakeholder consultation where over 200 stakeholders provided written input. We also conducted more than 300 virtual country visits, meeting with Member State national authorities, with judicial and other independent authorities and with relevant stakeholders, including civil society organisations. We made sure that this process was robust, transparent and inclusive. We have also kept the Parliament fully informed of all progress. This report represents the Commission’s assessment, but it relies also on assessments prepared by a variety of independent experts and bodies, including the Fundamental Rights Agency and the Council of Europe.  Let me also say a few words on the follow—up to the report. Its aim is to kick-start an inclusive debate at European and national level. I know that is precisely one of the objectives of the draft report of the European Parliament discussed today. In this respect, we welcome in particular the proposal that the Parliament and the Council discuss the content of the annual report presented by the Commission. We should maximise this momentum to bring about change in the Union.  In this regard I know technical preparations in Parliament have started too. Your first meetings with national parliaments are in October, November. I can only welcome this as a very positive development. We are committed to work on strengthening the cooperation with the European Parliament and the Council through regular meetings and exchanges of views in order to build this process together in an inclusive and constructive way.  We have a common interest to swiftly set up the rule of law mechanism, and the publication of the rule of law report last week is an important first step towards this objective. Pursuing this under the existing institutional arrangements would ensure the effectiveness of our cooperation. We should develop our modus operandi step by step. Whether in the future such cooperation should be codified in an interinstitutional agreement will have to be assessed at a later stage on the basis of the experience gained through the application of the European rule of law mechanism. So we will continue a permanent debate year after year on the basis of the next report, and maybe we’ll try to organise better cooperation, year after year among the two institutions.

So let me begin my remarks by reminding all of us of Havel’s words, and I quote: ‘Keep the company of those who seek the truth, run from those who have found it.’ Havel saw the truth his whole life, often doubting his own thoughts. He believed in reflection, critical thinking and honest discussion – something that Communism forbade for decades and something that Havel saw as the essence of a free and democratic Europe. He believed in an open Europe and worked relentlessly and successfully for the return of central Europeans to our common European project. So let’s think of people like Havel and the Europe of the past, divided and weak, as we discuss the current need for an effective mechanism on democracy, rule of law and fundamental rights. Europe must protect common democratic principles and the sense of European justice in order to maintain its purpose and have a meaningful future. Today’s discussion is about fundamentals, which we must monitor, guard and protect diligently, but also fairly, with respect to all Member States. This mechanism is not about a single country or the naming and shaming of particular individuals. It is about the essential foundations of democracy and institutions that should work for the benefit of all Europeans. I want to thank the rapporteur for steering our work on this report along these lines. We have a solid text and we should send a strong message from this House this week to the Council and the Commission about the necessity for joint ownership and joint protection of rule of law.

Because the values of the rule of law are not pecuniary values, they are fundamental values. As my colleague Bilčík and my colleague González Pons said here, these are fundamental values of Europe's identity, of the identity of democracies. And so we have to think of a mechanism that applies even to all States, and not only to those who are net-income states of EU funds, because there cannot be a mechanism for monitoring democratic values and the rule of law that applies only to the poorest states, to those in convergence.

I think that developments in the EU in the last decades show that we had undermined something, that we believe that the rule of law principle, democracy, fundamental rights, all these universal – not left and right – but universal European values will last forever, that they do not need any kind of effort or any kind of protection. We were mistaken. That’s why now we are trying to enlarge our toolbox and enlarge our possibilities to address the problems we see in the Member States and to tackle the problems together with the Member States. It is the meaning and purpose of the rule of law report which we presented last week. We needed to have a new preventive tool which we will create in the report, we will develop it in an inclusive manner, using transparent methodology which will invite us for the dialogue with the Member States, and I believe in dialogue, even with the Member States where we seem not to have very welcoming reactions. We also needed to come with a conditionality relating to EU money. We are going to distribute EUR 1.7 trillion in the next years for a very good reason: the European Union has to use the money for the best purpose to help European citizens to get out of this crisis and to develop new qualities and to open the chance for development in promising areas. But it cannot work to distribute such a big amount of money while we are in the atmosphere of decreasing trust. It cannot work. That’s why we want to achieve this conditionality to be introduced in our system. The Commission will work also, as I said to you, on the strategy on the implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Democracy Action Plan. You’re calling for covering the whole scope, which we see also in Mr Šimečka’s report, which I heard many times from Sophie in’t Veld and other Members of Parliament. The Commission is addressing all three, but uses three different, if I may say, vehicles or methods. In the European Democracy Action Plan, we want to come up with efficient measures on how to protect free and fair elections because whatever positives we do to protect democracy and the rule of law in the Member States, the first and the last word is for the citizens living in the Member States. That’s why I think we should do more to protect their right to cast their free vote and that’s why in the action plan, we will focus on protecting the system where there is a level playing field for campaigning and financing of the political parties and political campaigns. We would like to have guaranteed fairer judiciary oversight over the elections and, last but not least, access to objective information, so we will focus on the freedom of speech and pluralistic media, which will deliver objective information. I think that we have to continue our work. It’s quite obvious also from today’s debate that there is a very demanding job for all three institutions, be it the Commission, Parliament, or the Council. We have to find a way to continue the work and not rely on the naivety from the past that our rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights are some kind of perpetual pillar which will last forever.

Madam President, I would like to thank Members for the very broad support that has been given to the defence of common values. This is important because these common values allow us to develop a climate of trust within the European Union and to make it work in all its aspects, such as cooperation between the courts but also the internal market and many other elements of relations between citizens. I would like to go back to a few points on the annual report on the rule of law, which is part of that mechanism. I would like to remind you first of all that this report by the Commission, the guardian of the treaties, presents the 27 Member States of the Union on an equal footing. This report does not contain recommendations in the formal sense of the word, but clear assessments, which will enable the Commission and any other institution to continue monitoring in future editions. Secondly, the Commission will continue to use all the tools at its disposal, the report, infringement procedures, or Article 7 procedures, which are currently under way before the Council in order to provide an effective and proportionate response to any breach of the rule of law. The Commission is ready to participate in the implementation of additional tools, including an effective tool to protect the European budget, in line with respect for the rule of law. I would also like to point out that the Commission is committed, on the rule of law, to an inter-institutional dialogue which a number of members of this House have called for. And we look forward to continuing to talk to you and the Council not only about the first report but also about the mechanisms to be put in place in the future.  I would therefore like to reiterate once again that it is indeed a Commission report before you, but there will of course be nothing to prevent Parliament from involving experts in its own work and debates. And we also count on your support, ladies and gentlemen, to engage in dialogue with national parliaments. This will be an important opportunity to debate not only here in the Council, as the German Presidency has already scheduled the debate meetings on the report and on a number of Member States, but also in the European Parliament and in national parliaments. And I would remind you, as I said in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, that if you also want to address reports by Member State in Parliament, the Commission is at your disposal. And then, of course, the report deals with the Member States, but in order to be able to talk about the rule of law and respect for fundamental values with neighbours, candidates, partners, including in Africa or elsewhere in the world, we must first also think about doing the work at home. That is what a whole range of procedures we use are for, that is what the annual report will serve, which will open up an ongoing debate on the rule of law within the European Union, and it is an important condition to be credible when we defend common values that are dear to us, even outside the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 40, "date": "2020-10-05.json", "name": "Michal Šimečka", "mepid": "103746", "text": "  rapporteur. – Madam President, I would like to thank everyone who took part in this debate and, specifically, I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who have worked on this file and made it a better text. They were all very constructive and helped produce a report which, I hope, will gain a broad majority in the vote tomorrow. Let me also very briefly respond to some of the critical comments and, specifically, to Mr Fest, who is somehow suggesting that this is a disingenuous exercise because we don’t criticise Turkey or some African Republics. Obviously, I would love it if Turkey and countries in our neighbourhood subscribed to the same rule of law mechanism and conditionality that we have here, but that’s not possible. I think that, precisely to have credibility externally, we need to do this at home, to make sure that our Member States subscribe to the values and principles of the EU.

It is obviously to enlarge the scope, but also to put it on solid legal grounds through an interinstitutional agreement, which the Parliament can propose, because there might be Commissioners after you who will not have the same kind of commitment.

However, in order for this to work, respect for the principles of democracy, including the rule of law and respect for human rights, must also be objectively assessed and punished in the event of serious violations. I therefore welcome all initiatives calling for the establishment of a fair mechanism for the regular evaluation of this area in all EU countries in the same way. A few days ago, the European Commission published its first assessment of the state of the rule of law, giving Poland and Hungary the worst mark. However, the government in Budapest subsequently described the report as unfair, based mainly on information from so-called 'Soros' organisations. It is all the more important that any new monitoring mechanism produces only absolutely objective reports. Today, however, there is talk of making the absorption of European money by the Member States conditional on respect for the rule of law. As a last of all, this means suspending funds for the state government, which does not comply with these principles. I am not opposed to the fact that the European Commission's new monitoring tool contains a well-defined mechanism for how the money allocated to a given state will reach its eligible beneficiaries without going through government instruments.

It's starting to look like a lot. When we talk about undermining democracy, the rule of law and the fundamental values of the EU, we euphemistically refer to 'illiberal democracies' and 'autocracies'. We do not dare to say out loud that there are Member States that are no longer democracy and are ruled by dictators. Human Rights Watch said recently: \"Ten million Europeans live under authoritarian rule.\" Ten million. In the EU.  The tools at our disposal to protect the basic values of Article 2 VEU are not adequate. We are now working on solutions, but once again the Commission and the Council are putting the brakes on. In the Council's proposed mechanism to link the multiannual budget to respect for democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights, we only check whether Member States are not harming the EU's financial interests. That didn't help a judge, no journalist, and no LGBTI citizen. And the newly launched monitoring system for the rule of law does not monitor democracy and fundamental rights.

Madam President, honourable Members, I would like to thank the commissionerfor the way in which we have been a member of parliament. I thank you all from the heart for once again having the opportunity to take part in such an important debate. However, I am somewhat stunned that Members dare to equate the European Union with a communist dictatorship.  Many of us represent states in which people have had to live their lives, have been persecuted and discriminated against precisely because they have stood up for these European values: freedom, democracy, the rule of law, an independent judiciary, respectful treatment of minorities – of whatever kind. When I met LGBTI activists from Poland last week, Mrs Kempa, I made it clear once again that this is not about special rights. It is about equal rights. Nobody expects special rights for minorities. But minorities are right to be treated in the same way as those who feel part of the majority society. Yes, who would have thought decades ago that we would end up in a situation where we are no longer sure of what holds us together at the heart of the European Union. After all, we are not primarily an internal market or a monetary community, we are above all and first and foremost a community of values and a community of law. Last but not least, the decisions of the European Court of Justice in relation to the decisions of some Member States have made it clear that there are quite objective shortcomings that need to be rectified. I would like to make this clear once again for the German Presidency of the Council of the EU: all Member States should be treated equally. It is not a question of pointing the finger at a few. That is why I see this debate – including the debate we have just had – as a tailwind for our debate, which is admittedly painful, tedious and highly controversial. After lengthy discussions, the German PRESIDENCY of the Council of the EU has put forward a proposal, building on the decision of the European Heads of State or Government. I can well understand, honourable Members, that one or the other is dissatisfied. If I were here as a representative of the German Government, I could even join in this dissatisfaction. However, I stand here as a representative of the Council. I represent the Council. And not even the proposal we have put forward has received the support of all the member states' delegations. This is our offer for negotiations with you. I can only appeal to everyone to reach a substantial result as soon as possible. I can assure you once again, and I hope you trust me, not me as a person, but you trust the German Presidency of the Council of the Eu and you trust what the Chancellor said to the European Parliament in her speech here: strengthening the rule of law is high on the agenda of what we have set out with you and with the Commission. I would ask you to respect the fact that conditionality on the rule of law is only a building block.  Following the commission's intensive report on the rule of law situation in Poland and Hungary at the last Council meeting under the Article 7 procedure, the German EU Presidency will continue the Article 7 procedures because, from the Commission's point of view, the serious concerns have not yet been fully addressed. In other words, we will look again– presumably in the form of hearings, at the situation of the rule of law in these two states. We are very grateful to the European Commission for presenting, for the first time ever in the history of a united Europe, a report on the rule of law, which concerns all Member States and which, incidentally, also contains some critical comments for my own country. We will deal with this report twice, because we all know that we lack, above all, a common understanding of what we are up to. The rule of law no longer unites us – and this is a bitter, sad finding – and the rule of law divides us. And that weakens us even in a world where democracy has come under pressure and authoritarianism is growing. That is why we must see that we hold this shop together. But there can be no political rebates when it is in question. Conditionality of the rule of law is now the new element.  Yes, we have made a proposal that cannot and must not ignore what the Heads of State or Government have agreed on. But I would like to reiterate to all those who are worried about the is also a working tool, shout: yes, that is it, because it is about breaking the rule of law. Already in the 2018 proposal there was a concrete reference to the EU budget. We have not come up with this again. I would also like to make it clear once again that the reference to the European Council does not entail a veto instrument for the European Council, but it has been the proposal to refer the matter to the European Council once again, if a Member State so wishes, in order perhaps to achieve once again the necessary level of common ground that we need. But there are two legislative bodies: this is Parliament, and that is the Council, and that is not the European Council. That is why it is not a veto for the European Council. It is just another way of getting rid of Gravamina as part of the dialogue.  In this respect, I would ask you all to play your part in ensuring that, within the framework of this very complicated and complex issue – 'Next Generation EU', MFF, climate mainstreaming, gender mainstreaming, own resources decision – we also create a regulation that makes it clear what we in the European Union are all about, namely the rule of law. When someone asks what this is all about, the very points that were also the basis for the report by the European Commission are also outlined, namely the independence of the judiciary, issues of checks and balances, media pluralism and media pluralism, and also an effective fight against corruption in all EU Member States. In this respect, Mr Lagodinsky, there is nothing wrong with the Council, and Mr Villumsen is also wrong. No one puts their hands in their lap. We are as close to a solution as we have been for a long time. But for that we need a constructive spirit of willingness to compromise and cooperation in all the EU institutions. That is what I ask you to do from the heart.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 50, "date": "2020-10-05.json", "name": "Didier Reynders", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking you for the invitation to debate today the conditionality of respect for the rule of law, in the context of the multi-year financial framework. In this regard, I would also like to thank the German Presidency for the inclusion on the agenda of each meeting of the General Affairs Council on this issue of the rule of law by the end of the year. In her speech to the European Parliament on 16 September, President Ursula von der Leyen reiterated that the Commission attaches the utmost importance to respect for the rule of law. The European project is based on respect for this rule of law in all Member States. This is perhaps the most essential question in defining who we are in Europe. This is not only a moral imperative, but also a prerequisite for respect for democracy and fundamental rights, the proper functioning of the internal market, the correct application of European law, mutual trust and the maintenance of an investment-friendly environment.  It is our common duty to defend the rule of law in all Member States, because citizens expect their rights to be protected with this rule of law as a cornerstone of the protection we owe them. Ladies and gentlemen, in 2018 the Commission proposed a regulation to protect the EU budget against rule-of-law deficiencies. I thank the Parliament for its strong support for this proposal. The agreement of the July European Council on the Multiannual Financial Framework and Next Generation EU has created important expectations across Europe. The COVID-19 crisis presents an unprecedented challenge to all of us. The lives of millions of people, the future of hundreds of thousands of companies and the prospects of many regions depend on our recovery plan. Once adopted, this will be the largest package ever financed through the EU budget - a total of EUR 1.8 trillion. This makes it even more important that an agreement on the MFF and Next Generation EU is accompanied by a full set of measures to protect the EU budget. The Commission will continue to ensure that the EU budget is spent in line with applicable rules and principles. And so, every project financed by the EU budget will generate added value. In addition, the Commission fully agrees with the Parliament's request on the need to ensure the protection of final recipients and beneficiaries, and the Commission is committed to addressing this and other issues in all trilogues. The European Council's conclusions on the next MFF and Next Generation EU contain a clear commitment to the rule of law and to the protection of the financial interests of the Union. The Council Presidency has now a mandate for negotiations with the Parliament on the Commission proposal. The Commission has always said that it's ready to work with the co-legislators to improve the proposal on the table. I want to insist that we hope that the trilogue will now allow for a rapid adoption and for setting up an effective mechanism. And I insist on that: it must be effective, for European recovery and resilience will mean little if we get lost along the way. So we'll be very strong on such common defense of the values. Ladies and gentlemen, I am obviously counting on the strong support of the European Parliament to reach an agreement and quickly put in place the new generation of programme. Protecting our budget is in everyone's interest and we will obviously hear your comments and comments very carefully.

Attacks on freedom of the press, civil society and judicial independence are seemingly becoming the standard in some Member States. Press freedom and the independence of the judiciary should not be privileges for the few; they are the fundamentals for free and functioning democracies. We just cannot allow the values enshrined in our Treaties to be systematically threatened or violated by any – and I underline by any – of the Member States while EU funds continue to be reserved by the responsible governments.  The citizens and taxpayers of Europe deserve a properly functioning conditionality mechanism on the rule of law, linked to the budget. The clock is ticking, and now we have to deliver, but a mechanism that cannot ever be triggered in practice due to back doors or indecisive processes serves only the interests of those who do not wish to see any measures taken.

But if the Council blocks on fundamental issues and the Commission finally weakens, the Union resents it. That is why we must as soon as possible solve a fundamental problem, such as respect for the rule of law, because other hand, we will not be able to move forward. My group has long asked for a mechanism of respect for the rule of law, linked to the budget. We finally have a proposal on the table, but it's still insufficient, because it's not just about tacking corruption—we take that for granted, it would be more lacking. The rule of law goes much further: it is a common constitutional heritage that requires those who aspire to enter the European Union and assumes those of us who are already members. Article 2 of the Treaty says: the Union is based on values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights; pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between men and women. This is at the heart of the European project , let us not forget – much more important than the market. The role of the European Commission is to ensure compliance with the Treaties and, therefore, their assessment must be objective and, in order to strengthen their capacity, it would be good to be able to set up a specialised advisory panel. A strong Commission is essential for the proper functioning of the Union, it cannot be alibied by the Council's blockades. If a Member State makes a deaf ear to the European Commission and the European Commission sends its observations to the Council, the Council cannot be maniated by a qualified majority. Similarly, the Council must understand that European democracy gives the role of supervision to this House, to the European Parliament. Let's get it right and avoid blackmail and haggling. Europe doesn't deserve it. Someone should be interested in talking about a supposed struggle between democratic quality and economic recovery. I want both. That's why I ask you for responsibility and not to feed the divisions. We all have to be very careful with respect for our democracies, because, with the rise of populismos, the risk spreads across our countries, and because no one here is nobody's police nor can they look over the neighbor's shoulder. Democracy is conquered every day. You can never take it for granted. And that is why it is also important that this message reaches citizenship— which aims to help — and that is why we have insisted so much that the final recipients of the funds are not harmed. I have heard in this House use twisted arguments to say that we are against Hungary and Poland. Nothing further from reality. What we want is to defend the men and women of the European Union no matter where they live, what they believe, from whom they love, because that is the rule of law. Let's not go overboard now.

Your political opponents do not have effective access to a judge, a right enshrined in Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

This complaint denounces forgeries and use of forgeries committed by these three persons in the course of their duties and particularly in the context of an investigation by OLAF against Ms Le Pen, concerning her European parliamentary assistants. However, the investigating judge in Brussels has repeatedly asked the king's prosecutor to lift the parliamentary immunity of the three.  To date, more than three years later, what is the European Parliament's attitude to this request? The institutions of the European Union are not listening. Where is the respect for this rule of law invoked at every turn? Mr. Roth, where is the independent justice that you mentioned earlier? However, the speed of the parliamentary majority is known when it comes to lifting the immunity of members of the opposition, most often for alleged crimes of opinion or because of acts that are part of their political activities.  Your indignations are at the head of the client. The rule of law, as it must be applied, is first and foremost respect for the democratic choice of peoples. The Hungarian and Polish governments regularly triumph in the polls. Let us respect the decisions of Hungarians and Poles alike. Let's end the threats with this conditionality device.

If we cannot rely on the legality of our societies, the bottom will crumble from everything. Some Member States have seen such worrying developments and repeatedly that we cannot move forward together until we have a mechanism that works. At the moment, EU money is used to support those in power who do not respect and do not intend, and do not want to respect the rule of law. The wording of the presidency's proposal is so weak and the way in which it is decided that this proposal does not provide any certainty that this will create a mechanism capable of effectively addressing activities that threaten or combat the rule of law.  It is quite clear that if the judiciary is neither free nor independent, such a country will not have a credible way of investigating possible misuses of funds. This in itself creates such a risk to the budget that it should be sufficient. It should automatically trigger the measures, but this is not the case in the mandate presented. There is quite a burden of proof on the Commission to point out the misuse of the budget before sanctions are imposed. Decision-making should be a relative majority. The majority should oppose sanctions separately. If action requires a majority vote, it is very unlikely that any sanctions will ever be imposed on anyone.

And we are all also aware of the need, of the urgency of reaching an agreement as soon as possible so that programs can start without delay.

Of course, I am concerned that they will change the reverse qualified majority by a qualified majority, or that they have barely given a sentence to protecting the final beneficiaries, because, I repeat this, we do not have to be wrong about what is decided in the Council, and that they give the European Parliament almost a mere advisory role or, at most, validation of what is decided in the Council , because this is already starting to be worrying.

So what we have is that the European Union’s official position is that we have a Member State where corruption is off the charts, and there are basically no guarantees against the government pocketing EU taxpayers’ money. So the question is obvious: when are we going to do something about it? When the rule of law is in danger, these projects should be directly managed by the Commission so that they reach the final beneficiaries, the small businesses, the civil society, those who need it the most.

The fact that the Commission has, so to speak, divided its speech here today between the Commissioner for Legal Affairs and the Commissioner for Budgets is also an expression of the fact that this is a package, that this must be seen together, that the issue of the rule of law, conditionality, is an integral part of the European budget. I hope that, in the next few weeks, we will not reach agreement here , and I am saying this now as Commissioner for Budgets – in the face of all the difficulties, an agreement that respects the principles of the rule of law, which are necessary for a serious implementation of the budget, but which, at the same time, understands that we are in a difficult situation.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. We are not having a debate on governments today, we are having a debate on a new instrument today. I would like to reassure you that we agree in principle that, after many years, when there was no agreement on this instrument, this instrument was not yet on the table as a concrete proposal – we have only been talking about it since 2018 – and we have a unique opportunity to use a new instrument to help us regain new certainty about it. , who we really are in the European Union and where we want to go together.

However, I would ask you to do one thing: let us talk about the content! We are not the accomplices of criminals, nor do I fall to my knees before any dictator. I think that, despite the understandable emotionality, we should try to keep looking at where we can move towards each other and how we can move towards each other. I would also ask for respect for the different roles of these bodies. A Member of Parliament has just sat down and said that if it goes after him, it will have time with 'Next Generation EU'. I have always understood this differently, honourable Members. I have always understood this in such a way that we have all made a common promise that the necessary means to combat the pandemic will be as quickly as possible where they are most needed. Yes, and there is a difficulty that we in the Council have to overcome. You can count on us to address this difficulty. But with respect, on an equal footing. We need unanimity for the regulation on the multiannual financial framework and we need unanimity for the own resources decision. We even need ratification in all 27 Member States for the own resources decision. The President of this Parliament has repeatedly asked critically, in the direction of my own country, whether we can do so in the few weeks that remain. With SURE, as you will remember, the national ratification process has also taken a long time. In this respect, I would like to reassure you that, for all the difficulties of getting it off the way without the agreement of all the national delegations, this mandate is an honest offer for honest negotiations with the European Parliament. We would like to see a speedy conclusion on the overall package.  Of course, it is about the principles of the rule of law. If the Commission has a central role to play in all the proposals and considerations before me, then I also take very seriously what the Commission has said so far about the core elements of the rule of law. Then I take note that it is not just a question of budgetary issues. It is about the independence of the judiciary, it is about checks and balances, it is about an effective fight against corruption, and it is about media pluralism and freedom of the media. And we take that seriously. There is also a specific reference to Article 2 in this draft, because we are aware of the difficulties and because we are aware of the fact that the European Court of Justice has repeatedly applied serious gravamina in some Member States. But it is an instrument for all of us.  That is why I would ask you all: let us not deny our intentions! Let us now move quickly into the final stage of the outstanding negotiations and make it clear that the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament are pulling together on issues of the rule of law, and that this is still in the same direction if possible!

Let me start by being very clear on an important point: the Commission fully supports the right to demonstrate peacefully. Peaceful demonstrations constitute the exercise of a fundamental right which exists in all democratic countries and must be fully respected. The demonstrations show that citizens attach great importance to an independent and efficient judiciary and also to good governance. The Commission is also aware of the announcement made by Prime Minister Borisov on a possible revision of the Bulgarian Constitution. It is not for the Commission to comment at this stage on the details of the proposed reforms. However, we stand ready to support Bulgaria in its reform process.  As I already said in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) in September, like in any Member State, constitutional reform should be subject to a large and inclusive debate, take the time to be able to reflect a large consensus and achieve the necessary checks and balances. A best practice is to seek the specific advice of organisations like the Venice Commission.  Now let me turn to the cooperation and verification mechanism (CVM). As regards the CVM, as you know, it had been set up at accession to help Bulgaria in making reforms and to allow for monitoring this reform process based on a given set of benchmarks to achieve. The Commission considers that the CVM has proven to be instrumental in the reform process, which has put in place legal and institutional measures to address the mechanism’s objectives.  As underlined in the October 2019 CVM report, Bulgaria made sufficient progress to meet the commitments made at the time of accession. The situation now, looked at from the perspective of its institutional and legislative framework, is no longer the situation of 2007. At the same time, in the October 2019 CVM report, the Commission was also clear that Bulgaria needs to ensure continued implementation of the necessary reforms, notably relating to judicial independence and the fight against corruption. Wrapping up any leftover from the accession process has always been the objective of the Commission. It emphasises the need for stability, and no backtracking on past structural achievements and continuity, which means pursuit of the implementation of reforms and the fight against corruption and organised crime.  Before taking a final decision on lifting the CVM in Bulgaria, the Commission will also take duly into account the observations of the European Parliament and also of the Council. It would be premature to give a date at this stage. (Interruption owing to problems with microphone) Mr President, thank you very much for your help. You will see from what I am going to say that it was indeed important, because the only missing sentence was that the Commission will continue following the developments in Bulgaria. It remains essential that these do not reverse the course of progress underlying the baseline assessment of January 2017.

The scope of the rule of law mechanism is broader than the cooperation and verification mechanism (CVM) and it covers not only judicial reform and the fight against corruption, but also – as we have discussed just before – freedom and privileges, as well as institutional checks and balances. The rule of law report was just adopted last week and, as I explained in my presentation to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) last week or around then, the report on the country chapters developed for each Member State cover the rule of law situation in all of them, including Bulgaria.  More particularly, as regards Bulgaria, let me underline some of the most significant developments taken into account in the report. As regards judicial independence, Bulgaria still needs to finalise, taking account of the opinion of the Venice Commission, legal procedures concerning the effective accountability and criminal liability of the Prosecutor—General. In addition, the composition and functioning of the Supreme Judicial Council has been subject of further debate. On a more positive tone, controversial provisions relating to the automatic suspensions of magistrates in case of a criminal investigation and to the obligation for magistrates to declare their membership in professional organisations have been repealed. However, and it also confirms past CVM findings, despite a comprehensive reform of its legal and institutional anti-corruption framework and improved cooperation between the authorities, there is still the need to establish a solid track record of final convictions in high-level corruption cases. It is important that the authorities are provided with sufficient resources in order to be able to fight corruption effectively. The necessary strictures are essentially in place, but Bulgaria has to make them deliver reserves more efficiently. Lack of reserves in the fight against corruption is one of the key aspects raised throughout the ongoing process. Perception surveys show a very low level of public trust in the anti-corruption institutions. It is important to show that there is political will to fight corruption in a credible manner.  As to media privilege, the legal framework is in place, but safeguards are often not effectively implemented in practice. In addition, lack of transparency of media ownership is considered a source of concern. Finally, the issues concerning checks and balances include concerns about the limited use of public consultations and impact assessments in the legislative process. Furthermore, the already narrow civic space in Bulgaria could be further affected in view of a new draft law on foreign funding for NGOs.  To conclude, let me reiterate once more that the Commission is determined to continue to use all the instruments at its disposal to address the concerns identified in the country. I am convinced that it is important to look at all the Member States in a fully objective and comparable manner. This is what we are now doing with the new rule of law report, and the Commission appreciates the continued support of the European Parliament in this respect. Of course, we have been working for some years about the CVM, but we continue, also, to work with the annual report of the rule of law with a broader scope on all the Member States, including Bulgaria.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 107, "date": "2020-10-05.json", "name": "Manfred Weber", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his work on the work he has Yes, Bulgaria is a country that is on its way, and there is still a long way to go to implement the standards that we have all set ourselves in Europe. Yes, it must also be said that not everything is perfect in Bulgaria. That is why I think it is good that young people are taking to the streets, that they are demonstrating that they represent their positions, that they are putting their ideas on the way. Young people in particular do not understand that it takes a long time; they want to make rapid progress. That is good to see. The facts that characterise Bulgaria were described last week by the Commission's report, which is fair, balanced, fact-based, and should be the basis for further work. As I said, the Bulgarians, however, can also be proud of what has been achieved, despite all the tasks that are ahead of them. That, too, must be noted first. Today, however, we are not talking about the general situation, but about Rule of Law. Rule of Law, for example, indicates that democracy works. We have a government of the European People's Party in Bulgaria, and we have a socialist President who has come into office democratically. Balance of Power – two different parties are responsible there. We have the principle that freedom of the media, of opinion, must be guaranteed: since the summer, every weekend and permanent demonstrations have been held there, young people take to the streets, can show what positions they have. After all, no one can say that we do not have freedom of the media and the press and freedom of expression there. Boyko Borisov has always explicitly protected this will of young people. He always protected the demonstrators, and he said, \"Go out on the streets and show your opinion!\" We must also state in Rule of Law that we have respect for an election result. The current government has a majority in Parliament, is elected by the citizens. That is why there is absolutely no reason to resign now and to temporarily bring an unelected government into office, especially in the coronating times. It should also be noted that, of course, some progress has been made in the area of the rule of law. Especially in the area of smuggling activities, the numbers have been significantly reduced. I would also like to say explicitly that Boyko Borisov is leading a pro-European government. He helped to launch the introduction of the euro and, as far as the issue is today, he has always supported the Rule of Law mechanism in the Council, which we in the European Parliament are calling for here. Boyko Borisov wants this Rule of Law mechanism. So, it remains to be said that not everything is perfect, that many tasks are still ahead of the Bulgarian Government, but that Bulgaria is essentially on the right track. To the demonstrators only a request and a clarification: a change in the government is not achieved by demonstrations, but by means of elections, and these will take place next year in March, and everyone should participate. Then the citizens of Bulgaria will decide how to proceed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 108, "date": "2020-10-05.json", "name": "Juan Fernando López Aguilar", "mepid": "96812", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Mr President, again a debate on the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights. Is it fun, is it nice to bring to this European Parliament a resolution expressing concern about the rule of law in a Member State? It certainly isn't. But it may be painfully necessary: in this case, Bulgaria, a recently accession state, which was incorporated with a mechanism for cooperation and verification of its progress in judicial reform and anti-corruption, but what we have seen in recent times is not progress, but worrying setbacks.  'Rule of law' means respect for the judgments of the courts, and forty-five convictions of the European Court of Human Rights are accumulated pending compliance in accordance with the report of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe.  \"Rule of Law\" means separation of powers, and we see continuing allegations and accusations of judicial corruption and political intervention by the Public Prosecutor's Office in pursuit of political adversaries.  \"Rule of law\" also means respect for freedoms, and we see concentration of media by the Government and also clientelism in those media that remain in private hands.  And \"rule of law\" also means respecting public freedoms, the right to demonstration, and we have attended exercises of police brutality, as well as persecution of minorities.  We therefore express (inaudible words) Bulgaria and say that this does not in any case mean a charge against Bulgaria. It means that this European Parliament, as with Hungary, ten million Hungarian citizens, and Poland, for forty million Polish citizens, expresses concern for seven million Bulgarian citizens who, as they may be, are Europeans.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 109, "date": "2020-10-05.json", "name": "Ramona Strugariu", "mepid": "134605", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew Group. – Mr President, when we Romanians took to the streets in that really cold winter of 2017, I remember we felt quite lonely out there, because I was out there, and then one day, President Juncker and Vice-President Timmermans stood up and they spoke up about it, very clear and very loud. Then other voices joined them, including the one of this Parliament through a very powerful resolution, and I am grateful for that. You know why? Because it didn’t feel cold anymore and we were no longer lonely. I am here today to ask for this voice of the Commission and of the Council, and of this House, because the Bulgarian people need it. Because it matters to them, it is really important to them and we owe this to the people. It mattered fundamentally for Romania back then and for every single victory of the people and of democracy in Romania since then. I have seen powerful names in some of our political families endorsing Mr Borissov and his team and I just want to ask, do you know who you are endorsing? Because you are endorsing a carefully knitted network of people facing serious allegations of corruption, money laundering and fraud with European money and a system which is stepping on the rule of law, democracy and European values as we speak. I have seen women dragged outside by the police and pictures of children sprayed with teargas. Is this protection? Are you sure that this is what you endorse? I am calling for your voice because it does matter to the people and because this voice can make the difference between a captured state and a truly healing democracy.

I had the opportunity to speak to a lot of people on the ground. I heard that they are fed up with the corruption in Bulgaria. I heard that the justice system is captured, and I heard that media freedom is being eroded at an alarming pace. So I can understand that Bulgarians are fed up with the speed of reform. I can understand that they say EU money, in a lot of cases, is actually making things worse, because systematically the EU funds that we give are being stolen by a corrupt elite. They are being used to cement their power or to buy up the remaining independent media.  So what are we doing as the European Union? Well, what Bulgarians see is that we are publishing another report on the rule of law. They see that Donald Tusk is fist-bumping Borisov, and a Prime Minister that has recently called protestors ‘gamblers and smugglers’. But what Bulgarians unfortunately so far are not seeing is decisive action from the European Union. The Commission is contemplating stopping the CVM; the European Council is dismantling the rule-of-law mechanism. So when I asked the Bulgarians on the ground what we should do as the European Union, the reply was unanimous: everyone I met was telling me, ‘Please stop the EU funds, because that money is not feeding hungry children. If you stop the money, you are basically taking away the caviar from corrupt oligarchs.’ So I think that is right, that is what we should do.

From my microphone – we are part of the government – we gave the floor to our greatest political opponents. This says a lot about our intention and our attitude to freedom of speech, honorable President, and to different opinions. Dear, I will put out a position that will not appeal to the vast majority of you, to this left-wing majority who have gathered for a political consensus in which to make this resolution, which, by the way, is entirely and far left – both political and ideological.  We talked about the right to peaceful protests. Dear, in Bulgaria people protest, they have the right to do so, we are part of the government, but we respect their right to expression and to peaceful protest. But when we talk about the rule of law, let's give the definition of the rule of law. That means independent, quick, just justice. However, this is contrary to the draft resolution. Here I see green, extreme left, and people who deny the right of the Bulgarian Constitutional Court to make decisions. They deny any wrongdoing. This is directly contrary to the idea of the rule of law. I see texts in the draft resolution that protect the behavior of a group of people from one ethnic group who break the law. This also contradicts the idea of the rule of law – we are talking here about the case in Vojvodinovo. We're talking about the judiciary's comment at all. Politicians should not comment on the judiciary, this goes against the idea of the rule of law.  Now we go to the other topic – the topic of corruption. Well, there's something very important missing in this draft resolution. When there is talk of corruption in Bulgaria – let me not be angry with my colleagues from the Movement for Rights and Freedoms – honest, they work like this in defense of the national interest, but always in Bulgaria people think of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, part of the Renew group. The biggest corruption scandals were related to this political group that makes the resolution. We, honorable, brought the topic of abuse into Rosenets, but we, not the Istanbul coalition, we, and these people do not dare to say the names. When you talk about corruption in Bulgaria, people always think of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms – part of Renew. These colleagues who speak out of their address should be ashamed. Corruption, but no names. Corruption has its names, and this is the Movement for Rights and Freedoms.  And now the weird stuff. Strange texts – we are supposedly talking about corruption, istanbul convention, same-sex marriage, separatism, in a second official language during the elections. Honorable, this replaces the protest. The protest is not about the Istanbul Convention, or at least I think so, that's how I see it. There are clear requests. How come it suddenly comes to you and what is actually the value of setting the topic of same-sex marriage, about the Istanbul conventions. It's something completely, completely, completely different. What I want to say to you with all due respect, knowing that you won't agree, will allow me a little respect, because I gave my word and you took my word for it. I wanted to tell you the whole thing. The Commissioner mentioned non-governmental organisations and funding. Well, yes, we want in a European country like Bulgaria to have no burden on erodogan NGOs that impose Islamism, and not to burden fake Kremlin NGOs. We are fighting against this – not for anything else and I believe that everyone will support us –no one wants green men and no one wants radical Islamism in Europe. I'm not mistaken, am I? I don't think I'm wrong. Wait, one more second.

Playing the Commission, telling you what you want to hear, pretending to comply and then doing whatever they like and laughing all the way to the bank. And why is it happening?

I find it astounding that people come in here and they support elections in every country outside the EU and you don’t think that Bulgarian citizens deserve the same.  This motion encapsulates the demands of the protesters. It calls for the general prosecutor in the personage of Ivan Geshev, which has been described as neither politically nor legally binding, to be dealt with, it condemns the abuse of EU funds, the staggering revelations of the Prime Minister conniving with former prosecutors to tell judges what to do, the bullying of judges, the suppression of the media, and on and on it goes!  But, do you know what? The Bulgarian citizens will deal with their government. I’m very confident of that. They’re not asking us to do that. But they do need us to stop feeding the vampires who are sucking the life blood out of the wonderful people and country. Pauperising your people, driving your young people away!

Systemic problems in the judiciary, which have been identified by the European Court of Human Rights and the Venice Commission, have still not been resolved.

The question of the rule of law is: can Bulgarian citizens demonstrate freely? The answer is yes, colleagues, you were at these events. Does the media ignore criticism of the government? The answer is no, we all know that. Is there political pluralism in Bulgaria? Of course, yes, the President is even from a different camp than the Prime Minister, and he plays a significant role in the ongoing protests. The Commission itself has just highlighted the undeniable progress that has been made by Bulgaria. Of course, much remains to be done, but if the Bulgarians are not satisfied with their government, they can, they must, they will say it themselves in the elections that will come and if they are satisfied then they will choose to renew it.

So thank you very much, this was a very good debate again about a very serious and important topic relating to the rule of law, in this case the rule of law relating to one concrete country which is Bulgaria.  As I said at the beginning, we will continue working on the cooperation and verification mechanism because simply there is still unfinished business, there are still things to be done, and CVM was never just ticking the boxes, because, at the Commission which followed very closely the progress of the reforms, we wanted to see tangible results and a sustainable, positive effect on the Bulgarian judiciary and on the Bulgarian system for fighting corruption and organised crime. And I have to add one thing, we continue the CVM also while seeing that there was quite strong interest from the Bulgarian people that there is this work continuing, that due to the fact that there is still very low trust in the Bulgarian judiciary and fight against corruption, many Bulgarian people, according to many surveys, gave us the message, ‘Continue and accomplish the work properly. We want to see the job done’. And this is what we are doing now. And next to that we started to work on the rule of law mechanism which Didier Reynders spoke about before and I think that it is important that now we work in those two tracks. We believe that we can achieve those tangible results, but it requires very good cooperation with the Bulgarian authorities.  I want to mention one more thing, soon we will see the European Public Prosecutor’s Office starting to function and Bulgaria is one of the countries which joined the EPPO, which was very active over the process of negotiations and which is now working towards the full functioning of the EPPO, the good representation of Bulgaria in the structures of the EPPO, and the EPPO will be one of the very serious and I believe useful contributions of the EU in helping the Member States to fight against corruption and crime relating to EU money.  So I’m ready to continue working with the Bulgarian authorities both on CVM and the continuation of the work following the rule of law report. Bulgaria will be among the first five countries which will be debated at the Council, and I believe that together we can achieve results, which will also increase the trust of Bulgarian people, because all the reforms, all the efforts have to be done in Bulgaria not because Brussels wants it, but because the Bulgarian people deserve it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 127, "date": "2020-10-05.json", "name": "Didier Reynders", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I don’t want to add so much after what was said by Vice-President Jourová, but just to insist on the fact that of course we have the opportunity to take actions.

We have the CVM, of course, but we also have the rule of law report, and in the rule of law report I have said we have positive developments but also we have real concern. I don’t want to repeat what I’ve said on the different chapters also about Bulgaria, like all the Member States. I just want to insist on one point. As Michael Roth said on behalf of the German Presidency, we will have a discussion in November about five Member States, including Bulgaria, because it’s very important to analyse the situation not in general, but country by country, Member State by Member State. And I repeat what I have said in the discussions in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs: we are open to come and discuss with Parliament the situation in all the different Member States, including Bulgaria.

But it’s not true to say there are words and papers but no action. Again, it will be very important in the fight against corruption to start with the EPPO next year, but we will use all the tools at our disposal in Bulgaria, like in all the Member States, but please, maybe it will be fine to organise a debate on the basis of the rule of law report on each and every Member State, including Bulgaria.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 128, "date": "2020-10-05.json", "name": "Michael Roth", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council.

People who peacefully demonstrate for our European values deserve our respect, sympathy and solidarity – in Bulgaria and in all other parts of Europe. I would like to single out a point that one Member made here by saying that this debate here would tarnish him, his country would be tarnished. I believe that this argument touches on the heart of the problem. These debates may be painful, they may be problematic for some reasons for political reasons, but they are necessary. I say this as a citizen of a country where yesterday there was an attack on a man of Jewish faith – in a liberal and cosmopolitan city. We have a massive increase in anti-Semitic violence in my own country, and I cannot regard it as a stain on Germany when we face up to this painful discussion. Minorities, be they religious, sexual, ethnic, cultural, deserve their place throughout the European Union. If there are problems – exclusion, discrimination, oppression – then this must be addressed without it being seen as interfering in the internal circumstances of another country and without it being seen as a disadvantage for the country in which it is concerned. That is why it is so important – and therefore also 'thank you' to all of you for this debate – that we impose a review of the rule of law on all the Member States of the European Union. I recognise that the partners in Bulgaria have very quickly also declared their willingness to actively participate in the Rule of Law Check in the first round. The debates and arguments that you have also provided, honourable Members – sometimes more positive and more benevolent, sometimes a little more critical – will certainly also be included in the Council's very open debate, scheduled for November. The Council, honourable Members, is not silent. The Council, like the Commission, as well as the European Parliament, assumes its responsibility to strengthen the rule of law.

After the collapse of communism, a corrupt, oligarchic elite took power in Bulgaria. Accession to the EU has only led to more corruption. Much of the EU's money from the various Structural Funds has gone into the pockets of corrupt officials among the political and economic elite from the outset. All the warnings on the eve of accession have not been heard. As a result, tens of thousands of Bulgarians have left their country to flee corruption and poverty.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Mr John, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioner for his excellent work and for the work she has done. I am pleased to present to you today the Council's position on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2021. I would like to begin by highlighting a number of points, in particular the challenge that the COVID-19 pandemic is all facing us. This pandemic has a significant impact on the procedure for establishing the EU budget for 2021. We must reach an agreement on the 2021 budget together within the shortest possible time and with limited opportunities for physical meetings. In addition, our three institutions are discussing the Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2021-2027 in a different context, and the outcome of this consultation is a crucial factor in drawing up a budget for 2021. I would like to stress that, in these turbulent times, we are fully aware of our responsibilities as the arm of the budgetary authority. We are ready to meet the expectations of EU citizens and to establish a balanced and forward-looking budget for 2021. Against this background, we must carefully consider what taxpayers' contributions are spent on in the EU. As always, the Council will call for prudence and budgetary discipline. As the current pandemic shows, this approach is now more important than ever, because we need to have sufficient room for manoeuvre to deal with the as yet unknown challenges and risks that we may expect next year. The German Presidency will do its utmost to reach agreement for next year on an EU budget that will take the EU forward, focusing on the Union's budgetary objectives and the benefits for our citizens. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen! Let me now go into more detail about the Council's position. We started our work immediately after the Presentation of the Commission's proposal on 24 June. In the absence of agreement on the medium-term financial framework 2021-2027, the Commission's draft budget was based on its own proposal for the 2021-2027 MFF, which was last updated on 27 May. The July European Council reached agreement on the medium-term financial framework for the next seven years, but this differs from the basis on which the Commission based the draft budget for 2021. As the Commission has not presented a revised draft budget for 2021, the Council has drawn up its position as follows. Firstly, operational expenditure. The Council accepted in principle the contributions proposed by the Commission in the draft budget for 2021, but in an adapted form to take account of the guidelines of the European Council. The Council is aware that this method may ignore the specific expenditure profiles of some programmes and will therefore also reassess its position as soon as the Commission presents relevant information in connection with the letter of amendment. Incidentally, the Council expects the letter of amendment before 31 October, hoped to have sufficient time to examine it before our joint conciliation period.  As far as administrative expenditure is concerned, a two-pronged approach has been adopted. Firstly, the Council has consolidated the staffing levels of all the institutions except those of the European Parliament, of course, at the current level. Secondly, the Council has reduced contributions for missions and meeting costs in line with the changes in the working methods of all the institutions caused by COVID-19, but the European Parliament is also excluded from this measure. Let me explain in more detail some of the key points of the Council's position. Firstly, the Council has made an arithmetic correction of the amounts proposed by the Commission for 2021 in terms of commitments and payment appropriations. This applies to all programmes for which a different contribution is now foreseen compared to the Commission's MFF proposal of 27 May. The Council's second measure is an increase of EUR 3.6 billion in payment appropriations. The aim is to offset the budgetary impact of an increase in the pre-financing rate of certain programmes from 1% to 2% from 1 January 2021. Thirdly, the Council adjusted the payment for REACT-EU and cancelled it for the Solvency Assistance Instrument after it was decided not to amend the current MFF 2014-2020. Finally, a budget line for the new Brexit reserve. This approach gives rise to a Council position, which provides for AN amount of EUR 162.9 billion in commitments and EUR 164.8 billion in appropriations for payments. These amounts ensure a very good development of expenditure. Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, Commissioner, Mr John, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to conclude by saying that I believe that today's debate will usher in a series of constructive and open discussions. These talks will enable us to reach a balanced and forward-looking compromise. We must not deviate from our common objectives and we must demonstrate our strong commitment to Europe. I am convinced that we can agree on a budget for 2021 within the jointly agreed period. Thank you for your attention.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 135, "date": "2020-10-05.json", "name": "Johannes Hahn", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate the German Presidency on reaching an agreement with the Member States on the draft budget 2021 position. We understand that this is a provisional position, which more or less mechanically translates the European Council’s July MFF agreement into the annual budget.  I cannot stress enough how vital it is to reach a political agreement on the MFF as soon as possible. Based on this, I understand the Council will re-evaluate its position once an agreement has been reached with Parliament and once the Commission has updated the draft budget proposal in accordance with the amending letter. Let me assure you that we will deliver the proposal for the amending letter as soon as possible after the MFF agreement, but there needs to be an agreement first. Prolonging the current framework is absolutely no substitute. Contingency arrangements would prolong uncertainty and entail further difficulties.  The Commission will of course continue to act as an honest broker to facilitate a compromise. We will work day and night if necessary to bring these negotiations to a successful outcome.  As regards Parliament’s reading of the budget, we take good note of the positions expressed in Parliament’s guidelines and proposals for amendments. The Commission will respond to Parliament’s and the Council’s proposals for amendments in detail in its executability letter, which will be presented ahead of the conciliation procedure. On our timeline for the draft budget 2021 negotiations, let me emphasise that this year we have virtually no room for manoeuvre in our calendar and, of course, the prerequisite is the MFF agreement. Due to the delay in the MFF procedure, the Conciliation Committee cannot be convened until 17 November and, as usual, we have 21 days (which means until 7 December) to reach an agreement. I trust we all understand that this leaves no margin for failure. The agreement on the draft budget 2021 has to be found within these 21 days if we want to start 2021 with a budget in place. There will be simply no time to present a second proposal for a draft budget.  We will need to work together more actively and constructively. Both Parliament and the Council have already expressed the sincere wish to cooperate and find an agreement. I am thus confident that this is possible and I see no reason why we should fail. Our citizens rely on us to find effective solutions in this time of crisis. The 2021 budget will make a vital contribution to supporting our people and our pandemic relief activities, as well as the many other sectors that the Union budget supports. The recent rise in COVID-19 infections across Europe proves more than anything else the need to find an agreement on the MFF and ensure a functioning budget as of 1 January 2021.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 136, "date": "2020-10-05.json", "name": "Pierre Larrouturou", "mepid": "197698", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, Madam Secretary of State, Commissioner, you know, we cannot accept the budget you are proposing for Europe. We cannot accept the cuts that the Council has decided to make in health, employment, research or climate. So how to unlock the negotiation, how to reach a win-win agreement, how to find the means to finance the 15 priorities set by Parliament on 23 July. The solution is to move forward in a very concrete and very fast way on own resources. The Council has already accepted the plastic contribution. That is a very good thing, but it will bring in $7 billion a year, and that money should go down if people use less plastic. That is why we must also move very quickly and very concretely on the other five own resources that the European Parliament is asking for and in particular on the financial transaction tax. It was the Barroso Commission in 2011 that proposed the tax directive and did the impact assessment. Everything is ready for it to be put in place. Of all the own resources requested by Parliament, it is the most technically and politically mature, and the Barroso Commission said it could bring in 81 billion euros in 2020. Brexit is losing 30% of the base, but the financial markets are doing very well. Despite Brexit, despite the economic crisis, the financial transaction tax can bring in 50 billion euros a year.  Fifty billion each year is 50 times more than a digital tax, even if it is also a very good idea. With Next Generation EU, Germany will have to repay just over 100 billion euros. If all the common debt were repaid by the FTT, Germany could keep its $100 billion and turn to it for health and pensions. If Parliament insists so much that the FTT will arrive in 2024, (this date is still one of the sticking points of the trilogue) it is to avoid falling back into recession. For by 2024, after a three-year influx of money thanks to Next Generation EU, the Member States will have somewhat forgotten the constraints. And if every country has to respect the traditional deficit rules, and if the Union returns to a very small MFF, we will fall back into recession. That is why Parliament wants the FTT for 2024, not 2026, because if we have two years of budgetary hole, we are very, very likely to fall back into recession, which would be dramatic for the recovery.  On the other hand, if we come to an agreement on the FTT in the next few weeks and if we can count on it for four years, it will give us an additional $200 billion for the entire MFF. And with this $200 billion, we will be able to raise the ceilings for 2021 and find funding as early as 2021 for Parliament's fifteen priorities.  So we can unlock the MFF negotiation and the negotiation in 2021 at the same time. Everything is ready and the German Presidency has said that this is one of its priorities. So what are we waiting for? You say that you are ready to work day and night, Commissioner, Michael Roth has also reiterated this earlier, so we have to move forward, everything is ready.  I am the budget rapporteur. I have already said this and I will say it again: in conscience: I will not be able to vote on the next budget if we do not get an agreement on the 50 billion more each year for climate, health and employment thanks to the FTT. We have to move forward, we have to unblock the negotiation, that's why I wrote to you to propose a specific meeting on the issue of the FTT to unlock the negotiation in 2021 and the CFP negotiation. A meeting whose purpose would be to make real progress on this request from Parliament: to tax speculation in order to have more money for our fifteen priorities. I would like to finish talking about our ambition. If we have a great ambition for Europe, a great ambition for our children, we must have a large budget. That is why I suggest that we really get back to work without delay, starting this week. Let's review this week to move forward and unblock the negotiation.

Mr President, Madam Secretary of State, Commissioner, as we know this 2021 budget is particularly important because it is, by definition, the first of the next multi-year financial framework. The decision deadlines, Pierre Larrouturou has just mentioned, are extremely tight and the European Parliament does not have to take responsibility for this. We decided our position almost two years ago, in November 2018. However, it was not until 21 July this year that the Council took a position in favour of European solidarity. It is now a question of realising this solidarity for 2021 by allocating a sufficient budget to ensure the functioning of structural reforms and the effectiveness of the Union's policies. We cannot disappoint our citizens, who have been hit by an unprecedented double health and economic crisis, with European programmes at a discount. We need an ambitious 2021 budget, which is able to support sustainable and resilient [missing passage] and which charts the way to European sovereignty in terms of health, digital, industrial and security.  The Council has chosen an arithmetic approach to the amounts proposed by the Commission for 2021 for several programmes based on the position of the European Council and without identifying any real priorities. Cuts to the European Union's flagship programmes, such as climate, digital, health or research, are already undermining the very foundations of this recovery. Citizens are waiting for the European Union to offer them an exit from the crisis with collective and solidarity projects and only political will would lead to a fair and balanced ambitious agreement on the next multi-year financial framework. We very much hope that such an agreement will be reached before the end of October, so that the Commission can send us its amending letter as soon as possible, which will update its position on the 2021 budget. Parliament has not chosen to work under the pressure of the time imposed on us by the Council. We urge him to review his position as soon as possible so that we can adjust ours before the start of the conciliation which opens on 17 November and for 21 days of conciliation in a constructive, open spirit, with frank and honest exchanges so that we can meet the legitimate expectations of European citizens. We must be able to obtain as soon as possible stabilised financial amounts that enable us to identify European decisions that bring about sustainable investment and human cooperation at the service of European citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 138, "date": "2020-10-05.json", "name": "Bettina Hagedorn", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. I thank you for this start in an interesting and, I am convinced, fruitful exchange of ideas. Today's debate shows that, despite differences of opinion on individual points, we share a common objective, which is to establish a sound budget for 2021.  Let me respond to the concerns expressed by you as follows: many of the objections that reach us on the Council's position relate to the Council's approach to drawing up its Position on the 2021 draft budget. This arithmetic approach by the Council is linear and does not yet take into account the possibly faster implementation plans of certain programmes, such as the Neighbourhood, Development Cooperation and International Cooperation Instrument. The Council is ready, as I said at the beginning of today's debate, to clarify these technical details in the context of conciliation on the basis of the Commission's pending letter of amendment. We have reduced staff expenditure in line with our approach to stabilising staffing levels; we believe that the increases proposed by various institutions can be achieved by redeployment. I would like to stress that these savings would have no effect on individual salaries, for example. With a provisional reduction of 140 posts at the Commission, we are open to the Commission's proposals. On the question of how to meet the additional needs of the decentralised agencies, taking into account our position on stabilising the overall staffing, we believe that the reduction of 10% in travel and mission costs is justified in itself by the fact that there will be fewer meetings, conferences and other events requiring a physical presence, not only in 2020, but also in 2021. Because we will certainly stick to what we are doing in videoconferencing for a while. Parliament has asked us to adapt the nomenclature of the budget, particularly in heading 6. It may be a very technical issue, but the budgetary structure does indeed touch on the core of the role that we, the European Parliament and the Council, have as budgetary authority. We will examine all the official proposals of the European Parliament as we prepare the Council's mandate for our final conciliation. Let me now also briefly address the questions raised about the multiannual financial framework and the own resources system. As I said at the beginning, our three institutions are discussing these issues in a different context. The Council will shortly adopt a new own resources decision, which will include a new own resources category based on plastic packaging waste. The European Council also invited the Commission to submit proposals for a CO2 boundary equalisation system and a digital levy in the first half of 2021. Finally, in the course of the next multiannual financial framework, the Union will work towards the introduction of other own resources, including a financial transaction tax. The Council's position does not address the impact of the Next Generation EU instrument on Union programmes, as the amounts to be used for expenditure are external, dedicated revenue. However, we share the European Parliament's view that the budgetary authority should have a greater role to play in terms of external, dedicated revenue in order to ensure adequate control and participation in the use of this revenue. As you know, we are currently working together on this. Let me conclude by saying that I look forward to the European Parliament's position on the 2021 budget. Many of these points are certainly taken up and thus the subject of conciliation. We can count on the Commission – John – to act as an honest broker to bridge possible differences between our positions and propose balanced compromise solutions. Europe as a whole needs a budget that meets the needs of its citizens and strengthens confidence in a better future, especially in these difficult times. I am confident that, with full commitment on the part of the European Parliament, the Commission and our stake, we can reach an agreement in good time.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent report, which is a very I am grateful to you for being able to take part in this debate too, because gender equality and gender equality are one of the priorities of the German EU Presidency. We have decided to focus on two main priorities in the short presidency. This is the still massive injustice in the labour market with regard to the gender pay gap, which averages 14.8% in the European Union – well over 20% in my own country. This is incompatible with our notions of equal pay for equal work in the same place. Another point is the still dramatically high level of violence against women. Here, too, we want to support initiatives in this way. And that leads me to the issue that has been in the Council since 2017, without any substantial progress. In 2017, under the Maltese Presidency of the Council of Commissioner Dalli, the last attempt was made to reach an agreement on Women on Board. We all share a common interest here: the glass ceiling must be broken. We have made considerable progress here in the political sphere, but here too we are still a long way from gender parity in parliaments. We have 38% of women here in the European Parliament. That is not enough, because half of our society is women who have a natural share of representativeness. We are dealing with two dangerous forms of segregation. One is horizontal segregation and the other is vertical segregation. There are still industries in our society where men are in charge. The proportion of women in management positions is significantly under-represented, particularly in the fields of technology and the economy, but also in science and the media sector. And then we have another segregation in such a way that men are not prepared to take responsibility in certain areas, which, incidentally, are generally paid significantly less. This is family care, it is the health and care sector, where men still play little role in fact. That is why the gender pay gap is so important, because it is usually also occupations that are paid significantly less. And men often say: No, we don't want to get involved. You know the position of my government. However, I am not standing here as a representative of the Federal Government, but I am representing the Council here. That is why I assure you all once again that, despite the controversial discussions in my own government, we see ourselves as an honest broker, especially as I can tell you that legal requirements make a positive difference. After all, we have introduced a quota in the area of business leaders, which has at least led to a third of the positions on supervisory boards being filled by women. This is a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, the proportion of boards where there is no legal regulation is still well below 10%.  In this respect, I hope that we can now once again take a major step forward by means of intensive consultation and also by supporting Commissioner Dalli's commitment, so that the European Union can make it clear here too that it can set benchmarks at international level on issues of gender equality and gender equality. And we, as the German Presidency of the Council, will fulfil our responsibilities here as brokers and as bridge builders in the Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 143, "date": "2020-10-05.json", "name": "Helena Dalli", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Thank you, honourable Members of Parliament, for putting this important topic of women in corporate decision-making on the agenda today. I am grateful for your continued strong support to our fight for gender equality, non-discrimination and inclusion for all EU citizens. I’m equally grateful for the support you are showing these days on moving the Commission’s proposal for the directive on gender balance on corporate boards of listed companies forward. We urgently need progress on this file, now more than ever. Progress regarding female representation on corporate boards and business leadership positions remains very slow and uneven across the EU. The figures from the Gender Equality Index of the European Institute for Gender Equality are of concern. They clearly show that we need urgent action. On average, only around 28% of board members of the largest publicly-listed companies registered in the EU are women, and women still only account for 8% of CEOs. These are not the numbers of a gender-equal Europe, nor does it reflect the talent available. Beyond being a matter of equality or lack thereof, this is a clear waste of human capital. Evidence shows that a broad range of talents and skills in the boardroom contributes to better decisions, better corporate governance, and public trust in business. This is what drives economic growth. Despite their capabilities and educational achievements, women continue to struggle against long-held and systemic entry barriers into corporate boards and leadership positions. We need to ask why. One major obstacle is the lack of transparency in the selection process and qualification criteria, and this is what the Commission’s proposal aims to address. I must be clear again on this point. The Commission is not imposing binding gender quotas. What the proposal does instead is to require the establishment of transparent procedures for the selection of board positions in the largest EU-listed companies to address the gender imbalance. Such an approach places qualification and merit of candidates as the main criterion for board membership. With this approach, which places qualification and merit upfront, it is hard to understand why we are not managing to adopt this directive. I regret to say that, after 8 years, we still are waiting for a general approach in Council. At the same time, this Commission has put equality high on the political agenda. The Commission is striving to lead by example. For the first time in its history we are closest to a gender-balanced college. The Commission has also just adopted new measures to reinforce gender equality at all levels of management within the Commission. The objective to unblock the negotiations is one of my core tasks. It is also a priority. It is also a priority action in the gender equality strategy for 2020-25, which we adopted earlier this year. The Commission has been engaged in discussions with opponents and supporters of the initiative. Our message is clear: the adoption of the directive would represent a major step forward in our fight for gender equality in Europe. It would send a strong, clear message to the EU citizens and beyond: the European economy makes the best use of all its talent. Some voices try to depict this proposal as a burden on companies. Experience shows that it is not. On the contrary, it is a tool bringing concrete benefits to European and national economies.

I think it is good that this question has been addressed to the Council today. I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mrs Regner, who has also taken this initiative. Gender equality, gender equality, this is one of the most important issues we have here in the European Union. Egalitarianism is one of our central principles in the European Union. And when I see how the situation of women in the Member States has developed, I can only say that there is a great deal to be done.  The directive is highly symbolic. Of course, the directive alone is not enough, and I believe that the minimum set must also change. But the directive also has its significance. I do not believe that the situation of women has improved, especially in the times of Corona, but on the contrary, it has rather deteriorated. When I see that in my own country, the occupations of women – the professions in which many women are – have been classified as systemically important. Without all our women in the clinics, in the nursing homes, in schools, in the daycare centres, in the supermarkets and and, ladies and gentlemen, we would not have been able to get through the crisis so far. Appreciation was there, but that was it. But that is not enough, of course. There must be a jolt through society that women also have equal opportunities here and are equal. I have a question for the Commission, because it has been taken up that this directive has been on hold in the Council for many years. I know from the debates that we had in the Committee on Legal Affairs for months that the issue of the legal basis was one of the issues – in addition to the political debate – that many people – including Germany – have said that this is a violation of subsidiarity. I would therefore ask again: what has been done, including on the part of the Commission, to clear up the legal basis here again?

We need binding quotas – they are key. Only then will women have a fair chance. We have the newest European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) data from June 2020. Countries with a binding quota have about 10% more women on boards than in countries with only voluntary measures – and that’s what we see.

Mr President, the glass ceiling exists, or perhaps we are now saying better: the concrete ceiling exists. For years, the Women on Board directive has not worked because it is stuck in the Council. Member States, including my own, the Netherlands, continue to refuse to vote in favour of this directive. Fear of the principle of subsidiarity – always an easy excuse – while giving The Member States and businesses a lot of leeway to make this directive a success as they come into being.  The 40% criterion in the Women on Board directive is not much to ask. What is wrong with a proportional distribution of responsibilities between men and women? Where it is a given for men, we have to quantify it in numbers for women. We say to women: you are good, but no more than 33%. We want equal opportunities, including at the tables on the boards of directors. And for those Member States that do not want to cooperate, it really does: figures do not lie, and you are not there yet. The corona crisis shows how indispensable the leadership and commitment of women on the front line but also in top positions is. More than ever, it has become clear that we are needed at the table, but not on the chair at that table. Young women who are now growing up in Europe need role models, role models who show them that they can also reach the top. But they also need to trust that there are enough female leaders to secure their future. The systematic exclusion of women in top positions within companies that affect our future on a daily basis is downright stupid.  In the European Union, we are making it an important spearhead: equality between men and women.

Indeed, studies have shown that where quotas have been applied on company boards, it is always the same women who get more assignments, not more women who are given assignments. On the other hand, in companies that achieve gender equality on a voluntary basis, where the company is more prosperous, has higher returns and has more women at the top.

It is also set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union; the United Nations has encouraged, in order to strike a balance in decision-making, to take initiatives and to take temporary measures to speed up this process. There is also the Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025. And the Securities and Exchange Commission also revised the code of good conduct in order to accelerate that balance in decision-making positions. Not having women on the non-executive board of directors of publicly traded companies is losing economic growth, losing prosperity and losing competitiveness. Having them strengthens democracy, strengthens the rule of law, strengthens the proper functioning of this democracy, and also significantly reduces the pay gap and the labour gap. There is no doubt that all diversity, all talents and abilities of all men and women must be harnessed in that world. We need inclusive leadership for new challenges, not just demographics. New challenges need inclusiveness, innovation, sustainability.

Do we want equality for all at the European level or don’t we? This is what Council has to decide. If we believe we are a Union of equality, then the answer is natural: we need an EU directive. And yes, you are right: yes, we do need more men to support this, and this is not something about women only. It’s about better decision—making, because there is more diversity and there is strength in that diversity. We’ve been hearing how companies which have a diversified management, or at board level, make more profit, and this is data which we have. This is not a hunch that we have, this is scientific data which we have. So having qualified men and women at the decision—making levels means that there is the perspective of both halves of the population, and we are not wasting a lot of talent which is available. This is human capital we are talking about here, but we are wasting so much. There’s so much research: ILO, OECD, and they all point in the same direction. But this will not happen on its own. That is why I say we need the directive. We have waited and waited, and it didn’t happen. It will not happen naturally, unless we want to wait another hundred years – and I don’t think that is what we want, and so that is why we need to introduce mechanisms to make it happen. And when it happens, we won’t need the mechanism any more. This is not something forever. This is for some years, until we get that gender balance, and then we will not need the mechanism any more. I reiterate: diversity is a strength, and we are wasting that strength by not using the full potential of the many qualified women which we have. It’s really a shame, and I really can’t understand. I’ve tried to understand. I’ve listened to all the arguments here, and it’s not about wanting to be in the boardroom. It’s about making use of all this potential and working together, and making use of this strength in diversity. So really, I think that people who want to understand this can understand it.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Thank you again for pointing out that I am speaking for the Council and not for my government alone. I am extremely grateful to the honourable Member for mentioning once again an important point. If we regard gender equality and equality only as an exclusive matter for women, then we will all fail. It must be about men and women fulfilling their responsibilities. That is why, like you, I am just as pleased with every man who is taking part in this debate here today. I also have the impression that there is a broad consensus – at least in large parts of the European Parliament, but also for the Council and, of course, for the Commission – to really develop the European Union into a Union of Equality. Admittedly, there is still a controversial debate in the Council on legal requirements. I have the impression that this has been expressed again here in the European Parliament, but at the same time I have also highlighted positive examples. And I would like to remind you once again that last year we also took a major step forward with the directive on work-life balance. Because we all know – not just women – how difficult it is still in everyday life to combine work and family life. This is also evident at this very moment in this serious crisis.  When asked what concrete steps the Presidency intends to take in the coming weeks, I would like to remind you, on the one hand, that on 13 October – unfortunately in a video conference – there will be a debate between The Ministers for Labour and Social Affairs on gender equality in the labour market, and an informal Council meeting in November will once again be about gender equality with the relevant ministers. We really want to take this issue forward in our Presidency – and that is why I understand this debate as a tailwind for the Council's commitment. I would also like to draw attention once again to another project which is very close to my heart, because the initiative was also developed from within the centre of the Council. This is something that we do not know in my country and in most other countries, namely gender mainstreaming. We have introduced this for the multiannual financial framework. This is at least part of our negotiating mandate that all European Union expenditure should be checked to see whether it benefits men and women equally. This is a major paradigm shift, which also makes one thing clear: we must not underestimate the value of Europe, namely the value of learning from each other and with each other, of moving forward without prejudice and of making the strengths that others have become each other's strengths at some point.

On 1 July this year, the Commission put forward a proposal for a Council recommendation on reinforcing the Youth Guarantee. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment and inactivity rates in the EU are rising and millions of people are at risk of losing their jobs. As past experience shows, young people are likely to be hardest hit by the negative consequences of this crisis. However, the 15% allocation of the four targeted actions for young people not in employment contained in the amended Commission proposal on the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) has been reduced to 10% in the European Council’s conclusion, which runs wholly counter to the Union’s ambitions to invest in young people. On behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL), my questions to the Council are: does the Council consider that this significant reduction supports the Union’s ambitions to invest in young people? How can it be justified if the fight against youth unemployment is one of the Union’s top priorities? How can this significant reduction address the need to develop skills and contribute to tackling the social and employment challenges of the post COVID-19 era? How does the Council intend to encourage Member States to enhance the efficiency of this instrument? Does the Council support Parliament’s view that the quality of jobs and traineeships offered to young people is key to ensuring their sustainable integration into the labour market? Does the Council plan to introduce binding quality criteria for the offers? What concrete measures does the Council intend to take in order to improve the outreach strategies and the inclusiveness of the Youth Guarantee?  Now my questions to the Commission: what is the Commission’s assessment of the reduction that I previously mentioned? How does the Commission intend to improve the monitoring of the implementation of the Youth Guarantee and encourage Member States to enhance its efficiency? Does the Commission support Parliament’s call to strengthen the quality of offers of employment under this instrument, for example, by reviewing the recommendation on a quality framework for traineeships and by supporting the introduction of a binding principle of remuneration? How does the Commission plan to encourage the Member States to implement this and to help them define binding criteria for quality offers?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done on this report. This is an important issue at a late hour. I hope that I can sort my thoughts a little bit. I am not used to sitting in Parliament for so long. But I am, of course, fully at your service. The situation is dramatic. We launched the Youth Guarantee in 2013 in response to a terrible economic and social crisis, perhaps a little too late. We also tried to learn from the mistakes, in a situation that was not easy at the time.  I would advise all of us to draw the right and necessary conclusions very quickly now that youth unemployment is rising dramatically – in far too many Member States – because it must be clear to all of us that we must never allow an entire generation of young people to be lost. They expect something from us: that we help them to have a perspective and stay in employment or to get into employment with the necessary qualifications.  On the second day of the German Presidency, we were presented with the Commission's proposals, and I can tell you all – as many of them are no longer – that we have made very much progress and will soon be able to take a decision on this in the Council. We want the Youth Guarantee to be strengthened by raising the age limit to a maximum of 29 years; we want more inclusivity.  Let me highlight a few other points here. We expect and recommend that Member States improve their offer under the Youth Guarantee, for example by assessing the digital skills of all those who are unable to take up a job, education or training. States are also invited to provide training and requalification. The offer should be geared to the needs of individuals who do not have a job or training, and in doing so we need comprehensible and high standards of quality and justice. Particular attention must be paid to young women and to disadvantaged groups, including people with disabilities. They are usually the first victims of a tense situation in our labour markets. Finally, we stress once again that all Member States are strongly recommended to make the necessary financial resources available. However, if I look at the list of countries that are currently facing a dramatic increase in youth unemployment, it will also be crucial for 'Next Generation EU' and the new multiannual financial framework that we can quickly, flexibly and precisely provide the funds where they are urgently needed: young people. You have our full support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 176, "date": "2020-10-05.json", "name": "Nicolas Schmit", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I first want to thank the Members of the Parliament for this question which underlines the importance of youth employment and especially the threat of massive youth unemployment. I share your analysis; I share your description, and I share also your concerns and what the President of the Council has just said about our concern: we have to prevent a new lost generation. I think this is a common duty of all of us in the Member States and at the level of the Union. Indeed, youth unemployment is rising very rapidly in certain Member States, and therefore, when we compare it to last year August, it has increased by 2.8 percentage points already, reaching 17.6% in the EU in August 2020, and it is significantly higher than the general unemployment rate, which stands at 7.4 in the EU, which shows that the young are much more sensitive to the recession and that they are the first victims of this crisis. Tackling youth unemployment is a pressing priority, given the hard impact also of the COVID-19 crisis on young generations. It is only with resolute, as the President of the Council has said, bold and swift action that we can turn things around before the situation aggravates further. Our youth employment support – YES, as we call it – package adopted in July provides a first step for such a resolute action. But the Commission cannot do it alone; we have to rely on Member States, but we also have to rely on the European Parliament. This is why I welcome Parliament’s resolution on the Youth Guarantee. I share your view that the fight against youth unemployment is a common political priority for Parliament. It is certainly a common priority for the Commission, and I’m sure also, as I heard now, it is a priority for the Member States, as it contributes to achieving the Union’s objective of sustainable and inclusive growth and social and economic resilience. Therefore I welcome what the President has just said, that the German Presidency is about to adopt the proposal of our strengthened Youth Guarantee. The European Parliament and its Members have a crucial role to play in the next chapter of our reinforced Youth Guarantee. You can fuel the national debates like no other institution. You can raise the bar in terms of our joint ambition for implementing the reinforced Youth Guarantee and improving it further in the years to come. First and foremost, the Commission counts on the European Parliament for ensuring adequate levels of EU funding, supporting the success story that is the Youth Guarantee. But as a response to your first question, certainly the Commission is never happy if the funding is reduced. But we need to maximize synergies between the Youth Guarantee, the European Social Fund Plus, REACT-EU and the Recovery and Resilience Facility, as well as the many other relevant EU funds and instruments now available to the Member States. And I think we can pool a lot of funding, a lot of resources for the fight against youth employment and especially by creating jobs, and I think this is also one of your major concerns. Our ambition must be – and that has been clearly expressed by the Commission – that we invest at least 22 billion on youth employment, and I also call on the Member States to support this ambition. We need to create and save jobs – and, I insist, quality jobs – which also answers your question, and the recovery has to be focused on the creation of quality jobs, and that’s the meaning of the Next Generation EU. And when I say quality jobs, I mean not these precarious jobs that do not allow young people to plan their lives, to found a family and to afford decent housing. Too many young people, precisely those in precarious jobs, were the first to be fired, to lose their jobs, to lose their income, and I think that we have to draw the right lessons from that. I know the call to review the quality framework for traineeships concerning the obligation for remuneration of traineeships. I have some doubt if this is legally possible, but I’m sure that in the years to come we can further develop a joint understanding, and also a civil society and social partners would be able to contribute to such an understanding too. And paying young people who are at work, even in the context of a traineeship, should be part of the social responsibility of companies. And by the way, I think a lot of companies have this social responsibility. Finally, let me be clear about the monitoring. Supporting the quantitative monitoring of Youth Guarantee schemes based on the established indicative framework is crucial and remains a priority. We are looking into strengthening this process, and the Parliament’s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs will be our partner in this endeavour. Before I close, allow me one word on vocational education and training. Vocational education, be it at the very start of a career or along the career, is not only the best transition between education and the labour market but it is also a truly effective way for re- and upskilling. The Commission has renewed the European Alliance for Apprenticeships to ensure a sustained offer of apprenticeships and to align it with the twin digital and green transitions. Moreover we propose the Council recommendation on vocational education and training to modernise and reform those systems, and under the German Presidency we had a very fruitful meeting in Osnabrück really to promote vocational training. In closing, let me reiterate our appreciation for the work of the European Parliament and its continued efforts to contribute to our common efforts to make the recovery just and fair for all, including also the young.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 177, "date": "2020-10-05.json", "name": "President. –", "mepid": "197546", "text": "  The debate is closed.

Despite that, too many young people are still in precarious work, and too many have to leave their region or country to find a decent job. The situation has become even more complicated in the context of the pandemic. I welcome the creation of a reinforced Youth Guarantee covering a wider age bracket to include young people aged 15-29 and applying a more individualised and targeted approach. I recall the need to make the Youth Guarantee more inclusive and to avoid any form of discrimination. I therefore insist for the strengthening of the financing of the Youth Guarantee. I join my colleagues in deploring the fact that that the European Council significantly reduced the amounts, which is wholly contradictory to the Union’s ambitions. I reiterated our request that Member States should invest at least 3 % of their ESF+ resources under shared management in tackling youth unemployment. I finally call upon the Commission to explore the idea of an EU web portal specifically dedicated to traineeships and apprenticeships in the EU.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}]
