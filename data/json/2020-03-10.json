We celebrate International Women’s Rights Day in very difficult times. So please allow me to send our support and to thank all women that are facing the sanitary emergency of the Coronavirus in the European Union and throughout the world. They are researchers, doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, journalists, political leaders at all levels, mothers and sisters. These are difficult times and the emergency shows clearly the great importance of this work. We are proud of their engagement and we want them to be considered equal, not just in these emergency times but at all times.  40% of the Members that of this Parliament are women, and since Parliamentarians are decision-makers at the heart of change for people, there is no just and fair society without gender equality and women’s participation in all walks of life, and of course in politics.  On the occasion of the International Women’s Rights Day, we must remember that only one quarter of all parliamentarians worldwide are women and that millions of women and girls are still discriminated against and prevented from fully developing their skills and playing their role in society, and this is also the case within our European Union. Realising women’s rights is not an option – it is a duty, and it is possible where there is political will. It’s important that the Commission has presented an ambitious EU Gender Equality Strategy to achieve significant concrete progress by 2025, and Parliament stands ready to work on the legislative proposals, in particular on binding measures for pay transparency measures to be introduced by the end of 2020. We will give our full support and contribution, since equal pay is essential to strengthen our social model.  Let me continue on the same subject. This year marks the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action, a comprehensive global policy framework with measurable outcomes in several areas. 25 years after these commitments and objectives, we see that progress is still lagging behind in many areas. Gender pay and pension gap and the unequal distribution of unpaid work remain big challenges. Investing in girls’ education is essential and this is much more than just access to schooling. It is about support and freedom.  Also, gender-based violence continues to have devastating consequences and it is urgent that all Member States and the European Union ratify the Istanbul Convention. The European Union must remain a model in enhancing women’s rights. Recently, the European Parliament called on the six Member States that have not yet ratified the Convention do so without delay, and we repeat that call today. But women’s rights face new challenges as well, related to digitalisation, migration and climate change. It is our common responsibility to act, for us all and for future generations. To mark this day, we fully support the No Woman No Panel campaign, and indeed I try not to participate in any European Parliament panels or public events where women are not adequately represented.  Our European Parliament will maintain a clear and firm political commitment to strengthening gender equality and women’s rights in the European Union and around the world. I sincerely hope that, in forthcoming International Women’s Rights Days, we will be together celebrating new achievements for gender equality for the sake of our entire society.

My thoughts this morning are of course with Italy and all Italian citizens, particularly the patients, the families and the healthcare workers, and those across Europe facing the Corona virus. These are indeed difficult times for families. On Sunday, we marked a very special International Women’s Day – 25 years since the Beijing Platform for Action. We in Europe and around the world have made considerable progress in advancing women’s rights and it is important to celebrate the progress, but of course we also have to say it is not enough. We have to accelerate action. We have to harness the power and the potential of women across this continent and around the world. On Thursday, I was glad to welcome the European Gender Equality Strategy through which we can reach further and go higher, but without action a strategy is just words. We need implementation across all of the institutions. We need strong political leadership in order to implement that Gender Equality Strategy and we do have much work to do. I only have a moment to mention some of the issues: women in Europe, 84 cents pay for every euro a man earns, and an extraordinary pension gap of 40%. Think of the implications of that for families, for children, for women, for old age. We do not have a critical mass in our parliaments, in our businesses, in our boards. That is important. Critical mass matters, as does, of course, the very serious statistic in relation to violence. One in three women in the EU has been a victim of physical or sexual violence since the age of 15. It is as simple as that. We need all Member States and the EU to ratify the Istanbul Convention. Just think about the level of violence we are seeing around the world against women, think about FGM, think about what’s happening in Europe, and the recent UN report that says gender equality is on the slide. We must do more. We must not just aim to break the glass ceiling. We must shatter it now.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2020-03-10.json", "name": "Iratxe García Pérez", "mepid": "28298", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Madam President, despite the difficulties and the exception situation we are experiencing these days, on 8 March many streets in Europe and outside Europe were also dyed purple. Many streets were filled with a voice that said we want to be free, we want to be safe, we want to have rights. And it is a message that we must hear today in this House, in this Parliament.    Because I'm sure we've all heard many times that behind a man there's always a great woman. Well, we're tired of being in the back. We want to be making decisions. We want to be in the spaces where we decide on our lives: in the field of economics, in the field of social and labour, in the field of politics. It's women's time. It is time to build a more egalitarian society, where we put urgent measures on the table to combat stereotypes. Against these stereotypes that have always placed us women in the space of the private, so we have not had the opportunity to be part of decision-making in those spaces that are fundamental to our lives. And when women are in those spaces, decisions are made in a fairer and more egalitarian way.  That is why we would like to welcome the Strategy for Gender Equality recently adopted by the Commission and we hope that this will be a step forward and firm in defending a fairer Europe, in the defence of a more equal Europe and also of a europe of solidarity, which will look at women from other areas of the world who are also beginning to fight for our rights.

Madam President, on 18 February, at the first meeting of the European Parliament's Gender Equality Network, our President, President Sassoli, really touched me with his words when he said that equality must become an instrument for measuring our policies. We completely agree. Women's rights, equality for women, is a human rights issue. Today, we are faced with emergencies that we understand. However, I would like to assure you of your support on the appropriateness of rescheduling an exchange time once the emergency is over. It is essential that this House can speak on the new strategy for gender equality which was published last Thursday. I welcome the adoption of this long-awaited strategy, which is the best way to celebrate International Women's Rights Day. And I underline Commissioner Dalli's commitment to protecting and promoting women's rights. I will not go back to what my colleagues have already said. This strategy is very comprehensive. It includes important advances that must enable all women to live their lives free and equal, free from violence, free from stereotypes, free from professional freedom, with the career they want throughout the European Union. These women are our mothers, our daughters, our cousins, our sisters, our neighbors. This is our society. Women's equality is a social project. A woman is the head of the European Commission. A European Commissioner is dedicated exclusively to promoting equality and the European Parliament has a large majority on the subject. All the stars seem aligned. However, we regret the fact that by 2020 the Council still does not have any training dedicated to equality. Ministers of agriculture, fisheries and employment meet periodically while equality ministers do not have a specific forum to meet.

Unable to exist on their own, women would therefore need the support of international bodies, as if they were a minority. The woman is not just rights or victim status, she is much more than that. Nor is she a man like any other. To the undifferentiated egalitarianism to which we tend, we oppose equal rights and freedom of choice. The European tradition has always given a central role to women and no civilization has celebrated femininity as much as ours. But this place of women that we took for granted in our way of life is doubly threatened. On the one hand, under the influence of immigration and the Islamization of our societies. On the other hand, by the individualism of our liberal societies. Unfortunately, these dangers are never denounced by selectively outraged feminist movements. Better yet, they are encouraged. These community lobbies claim to defend women when feminism is above all a liberalism that pushes the individual to emancipate himself from collective structures and values at the expense of ethics. One isolates, the other is regressive, as evidenced by the countless violence against European women. Let's talk about change. What has changed for women in the election of a woman to head the Commission? Are promises better kept? Do the quotas or parity imposed improve things?

Women’s Day is not so much a day of celebration; it is a day to remind us of the struggle that has been done in the past, and on the struggle that still lies ahead of us. So much still needs to be done. Since we’re in a Parliament, I indeed want to remind us of the big lack of women in decision-making. Just because we might see one woman somewhere in a leading position, that just reminds us of the stark contrast of everyone else in the room usually being a man. That needs to change, but we can also all do something about that. All of our parties, all of our list elections, everyone can do something about it. It is not a natural phenomenon that women are under-represented. Everyone can, but also everyone has to contribute to this struggle. While it takes forever, as we have seen, to break old problems, to break all old inequalities, new ones are rising by the day. For example, if we look at the online hate that people – women – are facing; the hate that we have received is an old problem but to see it so much multiplied in the online space is a new phenomenon. Also the bias of algorithms now coming up and soon having a very big influence – already having a very big, bad influence on our lives – is something that is a new phenomenon. So let’s never ever for one day even think the fight is over. It is not over.

International Women's Day is about one message for me. And it concerns not only women in the European Union, but women all over the world. We're not just Adam's aesthetic rib. We are self-thinking beings who have the right to free choice, who have the right to free choice. However, this is not a reality in all the Member States of the European Union. There are countries where women do not have access to reproductive health services. In particular, women from the socially weakest sections of the population do not have access to contraception, as do women from Roma settlements, for example. In some Member States there are women who are not only free to take their lives, but also with their uterus. A particular category is single mothers with children, who face not only stereotypes of society, but also poverty, and are among the most vulnerable groups in the labour market. Women constantly face pressure from the public telling them how to behave. Because when a female politician slams into a table, she's hysterical, when a man does it, she's a hero. They tell women that they have to be mothers, and then they are told how to be good mothers, because in several Member States there is a constant stereotype that a good mother is just a mother who stays at home with a child. Our task is to make policies so that women in all the Member States of the European Union have the possibility of a real free choice, that they are equal to men, both in rights and in their duties for the family, for raising children and for domestic work.

Madam President, for this intervention on women's rights, let me address you dressed as Rosie the riveteuse, icon of the feminist struggle and symbol in France of the current mobilization of women. This work blue, this red scarf and these yellow household gloves, we are thousands of women who wore them last Sunday, for International Women's Rights Day. We wore them to deny the 16% wage inequality between women and men in Europe. We have been wearing them for months now, to denounce pension reform in France, where women will be the big losers. We wore them to support sub-treated and invisibilized maids of luxury hotels. We wore them to point out the double day of women, who spend almost twice as many hours on domestic work as men. We wore them to protect our right to dispose of our bodies, which are severely threatened in some European countries, including Poland. We wore them to denounce sexual violence and impunity for perpetrators protected by power circles. We wore them to get up and break, like Adèle Haenel in the face of the Caesar of shame, attributed to Polanski. We wore them to scream our anger at the unbearable and morbid count of femicide, including 149 in France in 2019 alone. We carried them out despite the police crackdown that fell violently on the nightly feminist marches held last Saturday in Paris. We have worn them too, even if we are treated as little jerks by a French Member of Parliament on the benches of the National Assembly. We carried them with pride, solidarity and combativeness. This weekend, hundreds of thousands of us poured out against patriarchy across Europe. Then be warned, we will no longer be silent and we will no longer wait for the equality due to us.

Many important and inspiring events have been organised around International Women’s Day, on which we celebrate the strength, the achievements and the huge potential of women in Europe and all over the world. I would like to use and celebrate the acts of courage and determination of ordinary women and women like you and me, juggling the many roles that they play, and as we speak, throughout their everyday life – professionals, colleagues, wives, friends, managers, mothers, doctors, engaged citizens, daughters, teachers and grandmothers.  I would like us also to celebrate the acts of courage and the determination of ordinary women who have played an extraordinary role in the history of countries and our communities, women like Marie Curie, Jane Goodall, Maria Montessori, Frida Kahlo, Coco Chanel, Rosa Parks and many more.  I welcome the emphasis you had placed on the debate, which was foreseen on women’s role as agents of change. Women’s influence, their agency, is vital at this particular moment in time as we begin a new decade, as the European Union picks up a moment in the new institutional cycle and as the United Nations marks the 25th anniversary of this Gender Equality Agenda. Last week, the Commission adopted its Gender Equality Strategy for the next five years, a road map for advancing the discourse for the benefit of citizens, businesses and societies, and I want to sincerely thank the Commission, and particularly President von der Leyen and Commissioner Dalli, for this step which honours the wishes of the Council and the European Parliament. With this Strategy for the next five years gender equality has a firm anchor hold in the Commission’s agenda.  In the meantime, let me say that Parliament has always been energetic in keeping gender equality on the agenda and for this we sincerely thank you.  As a university professor, politician and a mother of two sons, I’m aware of how much women do every day at work and in their homes. I firmly believe that through their involvement, women are capable of advancing different aspects of society, academia, businesses and politics alike.

The current situation proves that like all viruses, coronavirus has the ability to cross borders and continents. It is important to stress that only together, and in a coordinated, coherent manner, can we address this global outbreak in the most effective way. Before I continue, allow me to pay tribute to the victims in Europe and elsewhere, and express my sympathies to their relatives and loved ones.  Over the last five weeks the Presidency has taken a number of steps to coordinated the EU’s response to the Covid-19 outbreak. The current scale of the outbreak, however, demonstrates that we need to further enhance the coordination of our actions in close cooperation between Member States, EU institutions, bodies and agencies such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the European Medicines Agency, and with the international organisations such as the World Health Organization.  We have had numerous meetings, including at Council level, where we have intensively discussed various consequences of the Covid-19 spread in the European Union, and exchanged information on the level of preparedness of Member States in terms of the implementation of relevant protective measures.  The Health Security Committee established to coordinate risk and crisis communication and the responses of the Member States to serious cross-border threats to health has already met 10 times to exchange information on this outbreak.  The first action taken by the Presidency at the EU level was the activation of the first level of the integrated policy crisis response on 28 January, which we then escalated to full mode last Monday due to the worsening epidemiological situation. I’m sure that you are already aware of the large-scale efforts within the Union Civil Protection Mechanism to repatriate EU citizens first from Wuhan in China and now from other countries such as Japan and Iran. In this context, it should be noted that consular affairs fall under Member States’ competences, but of course also here we are stronger if we cooperate. As to the current situation, the Presidency, together with the European External Action Service, conducted local consular cooperation meetings with the Member States to update on changing needs to consular assistance in different third countries. The capitals are also in very close contact to coordinate and support each other on consular assistance to EU citizens.  Through the constant monitoring of the situation, I believe that we currently have a good overview of the spread of Covid-19 and I need to underline at this stage that the swift exchange of up-to-date information among us, and further coordination of measures taken, are crucial elements for an effective response to reduce the impact of the outbreak. To that end, we will convene an IPCR round-table meeting at ambassador level for detailed discussions on concrete measures necessary for an effective and coordinated response.  I will now give you more details about the coordinated response at Council level to the health, economic and social impact of the Covid-19 outbreak. On 7 February, the Presidency organised an informal, high-level video-conference with Member States’ delegations. Together with representatives of the Commission and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, they had an opportunity to exchange information on the implementation of protective measures taken and to compare experience concerning the activation of national systems for handling public health emergencies.  On 13 February, the EPSCO Council held intensive discussions in which Member States, the Commission, the WHO and the ECDC explored ways to further enhance communication and cooperation at EU level to efficiently tackle this public health emergency. They also focused on possible solutions to safeguard the sustainable supply of medicines and equipment on the EU internal market. We adopted conclusions that strengthened the coordinated approach and included a number of actions to be taken to protect public health in the European Union.  In light of the recent rapid increase of Covid-19 cases in the EU – where now all Member States have cases, with some counting hundreds, and, in the case of Italy, thousands of cases – the Presidency held another meeting of the EPSCO Council last Friday. The Member States had an opportunity to exchange views on the consequences of this rapid increase, to assess the effectiveness of measures in place and discuss ways to strengthen the response. That exchange of views suggested that at present our operational emergency mechanism and protective measures are functioning in a satisfactory and coordinated manner.  The key message expressed by the Council, which I would like to share with you, is above all we need to strengthen solidarity between the Member States, cooperation and exchange of information. Member States stand ready to further raise collective and individual awareness of the threat from Covid—19 and to establish coherent containment measures while maintaining the principle of freedom of movement in the European Union. We will further develop a coordinated approach to prevention and good practices for all people affected, including vulnerable groups such as the elderly.  Last but not least, Member States have identified a need for European monitoring of the supply of medicines and medical equipment. They share the same aim to secure production, stocking, availability and rational use of protective equipment in the European Union. As regards the economic and social impact of this health crisis, we all realise that it is imperative to act quickly in order to prevent huge further costs. For that reason, finance ministers held an informal discussion last week to discuss appropriate countermeasures. They discussed the specific actions to adequately provide financial support to national civil protection systems in order to cope with this crisis. Next week, finance ministers will meet again to take stock of the situation and propose additional targeted measures if necessary. Specific sectors and regions of Europe are suffering disproportionately from this crisis and they will need all our support and solidarity to address the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on society and the economy.  Furthermore, on Thursday, on the Presidency’s initiative, the EU education ministers will hold a conference call to discuss an effective national response to ensure continuity of education in the light of the Covid-19 outbreak. As you probably know, President Michel convened a video-conference with leaders this afternoon to discuss how to coordinate EU efforts to respond to the outbreak in order to protect the health of our citizens. The meeting will be an opportunity for the leaders to exchange information, facilitate the coordination of efforts and to prepare the next steps.  I know that we can count on our robust European social model, ensuring adequate social protection and that citizens are not left behind in these precarious circumstances. Solidarity and a coordinated approach are the key in this situation. We welcome the support mobilised by the Commission so far, provided in a number of sectors such as public health, research and civil protection, and we will continue to work closely with the Commission to ensure that comprehensive support is delivered to the Member States. We remain convinced that the coordinated measures taken will help sustainably diminish the impact of Covid-19 in Europe and will minimise disruption to the continuity of social, economic and democratic life.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 13, "date": "2020-03-10.json", "name": "Stella Kyriakides", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, Covid—19 has developed into a fast-moving and increasingly severe public health emergency that is affecting our citizens, our societies, and our economies. We have since yesterday confirmed cases in all Member States. Whilst the numbers vary from a few cases only to over 9 000, we know that the picture is changing exponentially and by the hour. Needless to say, the days and weeks ahead are critical. I want here to take the opportunity to praise the European Parliament’s decision to take effective measures. I know it was not an easy decision, but it was necessary. They are critical, the next few days and months will be critical for our response. Member States must still focus on efforts to aggressively contain the virus, particularly where there are few cases. Slowing down the virus must be our greatest priority in order to gain time for our health systems to function effectively, and for research and development to advance. The measures we are seeing are impacting on our citizens, on their everyday lives, on the economy, on businesses. It is not an easy situation to live in, and the decisions taken by government are not taken lightly. But when necessary and justified, although tough these decisions need to be followed to the letter. It is a time of critical communication with our citizens and here Parliament can be of great help in two ways. You need to be the voices that speak to citizens for them to take responsibility for their personal protection measures: washing hands, avoiding physical contact; but you also need to be the voices against false news and misinformation, because this is equally damaging to the efforts made and the impact of the virus itself. This is a critical time for cooperation and solidarity. Without solidarity and Europe-wide solutions, we are not going to be able to deal with this public health emergency. We need solidarity between citizens, between countries, and within countries, and this was ensured in the outcome of the extraordinary Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) last week.  We need to see solidarity in action. We need to share resources, share information, share expertise, share equipment. We need to share equipment protocols and testing protocols. Let me be absolutely clear, this cannot be business as usual. We are facing an exceptional situation, and under such circumstances everybody needs to stand up to their responsibilities. Whilst the realities on the ground between Member States vary considerably, and whilst they are not all at the same scenarios, I have called on all of them to activate their preparedness plans and to share them with us. I have called on all of them to plan ahead, to be ready for the possible next scenario. From our side, we will continue to do our utmost to ensure that medical workers and those on the front line have the best means possible in order to face the outbreak. Complacency is not an option. We have launched a joint procurement for personal protective equipment, and this morning we will know what response to this offer we have received. We are already looking at joint procurements for medical equipment, such as respirators and testing kits, which have been requested by Member States. With Commissioner Breton we are discussing how industry can scale up production to meet increased demands.  Yesterday I spoke with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Medicines Agency. We have established a video conference three times a week with myself, as Health Commissioner, and the Agencies, to be updated and coordinated in every way possible so that we can be proactive if possible. We are strengthening the operational support and advice of ECDC on the ground. An expert mission has already taken place in Italy and a second one is underway in Greece. We have increased funding for research and vaccine development, and we are also coordinating our border, visa and security measures. In ending, I want to say that from day one, our priority has been to protect citizens from this virus and to support Member States in stopping the spread. We need to show a Europe that cares, a Europe of solidarity, and a Europe that protects, a Europe that offers added value to its Member States in their response to that challenge. I know that when under this kind of pressure everyone reacts in different ways, but this is not a time for fragmentation; this is a time for all of us – wherever we are positioned – to join our voices, because this is the only way we’re going to be able to come out of this crisis – and that we will.

Last week, this was bolstered by the setting-up of a specific coronavirus response team of five Commissioners, including Commissioner Kyriakides and myself. But also other Commissioners – all Commissioners – are heavily involved in this effort. For the past six weeks, we have been coordinating the work of all Commission services to identify what needs to be done, by whom and when, and get it done. Let me give you a quick overview of this effort.  Through the Union Civil Protection Mechanism, we have coordinated the repatriation of hundreds of European Union citizens from China and Japan. We have coordinated the provision of assistance to China during the initial stage of the outbreak there. Since then, we have been working with the EU Member States to coordinate assistance between them via this mechanism. We have mobilised funding to the tune of almost EUR 270 million to boost global preparedness, prevention and containment of the virus with a combination of development, humanitarian and research funding. In the area of border controls, we have issued guidance to Member States and organised weekly meetings of the Covid-19 information group on borders, which brings together the Member States, Schengen associated countries, the Council Secretariat and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, so as to exchange information and best practices on measures taken by the Member States in view of the coordinated approach. For transport-related measures, we have requested the development of specific advice for ship and aircraft operators, as well as the land transport sector, regarding preparedness and the response to the Covid-19 outbreak. This advice was recently published by the expert group.  In addition, we are working every day on contingency planning and preparedness measures for the EU on all aspects of this emergency, from health and research to civil protection and consular assistance, from transport and home affairs to the economy. We are assessing the impact on supply chains and working with Member States to ensure that they use the benefits offered by the single market rather than close it off to each other. Commissioner Breton is speaking directly to European manufacturers of personal protective equipment. Our aim is to make sure that the public health needs of all Member States are met and that adequate supplies get to where they are needed most.  There is no way around the fact that the economic cost of the coronavirus will be significant. We are working closely with Member States to assess the situation and coordinate the necessary economic measures. By coordinating them, we will maximise their impact. It is important that affected workers and businesses get the necessary support to weather this storm. On the fiscal front, European countries have powerful automatic stabilisers, which can cushion a good part of the shock. They can also intervene in terms of providing liquidity to small and medium enterprises, which are the most affected by this impact. In addition, our Stability and Growth Pact provides for flexibility to cater for unusual events such as this. Our letter to Italy is very clear on that. We are well aware that exceptional times require exceptional measures, and this is such a time. We are committed to coordinating with Member States and using all appropriate policy tools to safeguard against the downside risks that are now materialising.  Finally, we have ramped up our public communication efforts with the launch of a dedicated Covid-19 webpage with daily updates. There should be no doubt that this situation calls for a coherent response, and solidarity and cooperation are essential. Member States recognise this and the Commission has already been supporting them for weeks. In particular, the Emergency Response Coordination Centre, which is working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, remains available to them.

On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would also like to say thank you: president Sassoli, our Secretary-General Klaus Welle for the prudent measures that we have taken as a Parliament, and also the group chairmen, that we have dealt with the situation in the Conference of Presidents in a very proportionate way. I would like to say thank you to Ursula von der Leyen, Stella and Commissioner Lenarsic for their activities. We would all have liked to see a different start to the Commission's work, that we do not wake up immediately in times of crisis. But now we need to tackle these times of crisis. And I would also like to express my thanks to those who now bear responsibility for the patients. We have many people who are in direct contact with the infected; On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the nurses, nurses and doctors, and to those who do this courageous work. Corona forces us to take steps that go against our European way of life: that we shake hands, that we kiss each other, that we travel, that we meet friends. This is the real challenge ahead of us: to put our lives to the test. Anyone can help, everyone can contribute to stopping or slowing down the virus. Decisive action is needed and, on the other hand, it is also necessary to avoid panic. What is the task that we need to tackle at European level? First of all, it is important to make it clear that the main responsibility is anchored at national level. It is the national health ministers who are responsible. But Europe can, of course, make a contribution that we want to tackle ambitiously. The first is a common risk assessment. As the European People's Party, we in the last Strasbourg part-session proposed that all travellers entering the European Union should be given a common risk assessment at all airports in the Schengen border area, with common notes distributed where citizens entering indicate where they come from, whether they have been in contact with infected people. Unfortunately, this has taken a very long time for this to be adopted by the individual Member States; today it is being made better. As the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we believe that, in the measures that are now being taken at national level, we are still too uncoordinated with the proposals made by the Commission, which our experts make, at national level. For example, football matches are held in individual countries with spectators, in other Member States they are held without spectators. For many people, this means confusion. That is why one of the results of these developments in recent days speaks to us that we must strengthen our agencies, our expertise, in the coming years. What Europe must do is – and both Commissioners have made it clear that we need solidarity. Following the decision by Germany and France to ban exports, for example for protective masks, there was a domino effect at European level, where all the Member States have imposed this export ban. That is not the understanding of solidarity that we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have. If Italy is now in a special situation and needs these protective masks, then other Member States of the European Union should be prepared to help, not nationally selfishly only to look at their own challenges. If we think further, we believe that the issue of research is of central importance. The European Commission has now allocated EUR 47 million to improve research into coronavirus. I believe that these funds will not be sufficient to make rapid progress in vaccination and treatment, which is expected of our citizens. And we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will also have to talk about competition law. Medicines – that we are now dependent on Chinese and Indian subcontractors for medicines, that the citizens of Europe do not understand. In other discussions on competition law, we will have to define which products we need to supply independently. Finally, we need a package of measures for the economy. The ECB will meet this week. The state aid rules must be reviewed. Flexibility must be used to support our groups; especially for the small We need cash for small and medium-sized enterprises, we need loans, and the Stability Pact must be applied flexibly. We are opposed to any change to the Stability Pact, but we want the Stability Pact to be applied flexibly. These are the tasks before us. The situation we are now facing is not a situation that requires party politics, but responsibility. It is not a situation that requires panic, but decisive action. Above all, it is not a situation in which national selfishness is at stake, but of the awareness that it is a community of destiny in Europe in which we find ourselves.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 16, "date": "2020-03-10.json", "name": "Iratxe García Pérez", "mepid": "28298", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Madam President, we are undoubtedly experiencing an extraordinary situation these days which is causing uncertainty and concern in the public and that is why I think it is important that today we are able to send from here a message of calm and prudence and act tensely. The decisions we make in the coming days must have a scientific basis and be in conformity with the provisions of the recommendations of the health authorities.  We must be aware that some Member States are being hit more severely by this crisis than others and are making decisions that are difficult and harsh. And right now we have to be constructive to overcome this situation in the best possible way. As public representatives we are we must act firmly and encourage reasonable actions that avoid unnecessary havoc. In the face of any crisis we need to provide ourselves with the necessary tools to address it and be aware of its scale. Since we are not in a position today to vote on the resolution on which our groups had been working, I do want to move what are the essential issues for my political group.  Member States should act in solidarity and ensure a common and coordinated response, proportionate and effective in response to the virus. The Commission and the Member States should establish containment measures and emergency plans, so we welcome the European Commission's commitment to invest in vaccine development research. At the same time, we must establish measures to alleviate the economic impact of this crisis and also encourage the European economy.  Member States should therefore be allowed to implement additional tax measures, including fiscal flexibility measures. We call for the establishment of countercyclical policies and concrete measures aimed at protecting employment.  The European Investment Bank should use credit lines to provide small and medium-sized enterprises with liquidity funds in financial emergencies. We must ensure that speculation about parallel prices and markets does not benefit from this crisis.  We cannot ignore the social impact that the COVID-19 virus is having. But this does not mean that we do not have to guarantee labour rights: we must be able to guarantee the rights of workers. And we must look beyond this figure.  We must prioritise the strengthening of social security and public health systems, which are currently demonstrating a great responsibility and ability to address these issues. The defence of public health systems is an essential issue, systems that are currently setting an example. Finally, I would like to express my strongest revulsion at acts of racism, discrimination and prejudice against people of Chinese origin or of Asian descent.

Madam President, Commissioner, Commissioner, above all, I too, on behalf of the Renew Group, would like to have an emotional and warm thought for the victims, for the families and for the caregivers of those who are personally affected by this coronavirus. Our debate this morning is, of course, essential because we have a duty to exemplify. Parliament is doing what everyone else is doing, adapting to the spread of the virus and taking the necessary vigilance measures with this plenary repatriated to Brussels and limited to its simplest expression: today's debates. On the other hand, there is no question of deserting as is not the case for the hundreds of thousands of workers who, throughout Europe, remain in their posts and continue to ensure the proper functioning of whole sectors of our economy. Six weeks now that this virus is in the news of all the media, so what is the added value of our debate this morning, within the limits, let us say very narrow, that the treaty grants to Europe of health. First, between minimization and psychosis, you have to place the cursor in the right place. Yes, the situation is worrying, as 10,000 Europeans have been infected and 500 deaths have been recorded (in only five countries fortunately). Yes, unfailing vigilance is required. But it should also be remembered that only 5% of those affected need to be treated in hospital. It must also be said that Europe reacted quickly. In particular, on 28 January, it activated the Civil Protection Mechanism to repatriate Europeans from China, Iran and Japan. It has also provided funding of EUR 100 million for research, future treatments and vaccines, prevention actions and health monitoring. This is proof of the know-how of Europe and the Commission. But who knows? This is not a criticism but a small suggestion to the Commission: you should also activate your 'let's know' skills, which is essential. And it is also a weapon, Mrs Kyriakides, against misinformation. But still, in the face of the globalization of threats, this is the fourth epidemic in less than twenty years. Europe needs to better anticipate and coordinate. Renew offers a whole action plan that I invite you to discover elsewhere.

I am ashamed of a Europe that is disunited and certainly lagging behind. I am ashamed of an ineffective and absent Europe: what is this institution doing in front of the many doctors and nurses in the trenches today in hospitals? I am ashamed of a Europe that has no single protocols to deal with this epidemic: there are countries that have made so many tampons, some none. There are countries that use total transparency and others that hide data or minimize to avoid economic consequences. I am ashamed of a Europe that abandons entire countries, such as Italy, businesses, traders and citizens. I am very ashamed of the many countries that have stopped the export of intensive care machinery; I am ashamed of those countries that have required masks and medical materials for Italy. I am ashamed that there is no solidarity approach to the emergency. I am ashamed of speculators and I am also ashamed of the distribution chains that have demanded the \"coronavirus free\" stamp on Italian food products. Someone is evidently using the virus to wage a trade war on Italian products. I am ashamed that, at a time of such an emergency, there are Eurobureaucrats demanding the approval of the ESFA, instead of putting the coronavirus issue first. I am ashamed of a Europe which, in the face of Italy's cry for help, responds only with the proposal of a one-off deficit deficit.  That is not enough! What is needed here is a colossal plan for infrastructure investment and overcoming the parameters that are too rigid to deal with a dramatic recession. I will conclude: I am ashamed of those who care about the repercussions on the tourism sector; I am ashamed of a Europe that is considering making a derisory amount available.

And while we’re following very closely what’s happening with the Covid-19 spread and impact, I think what we also should be looking at is the wider impact and the wider effect it has on health systems. There are also other health problems around that might get worse when hospitals are very busy dealing with the coronavirus infections and health systems are often already at their limit.  And I think that should also encourage us to learn some lessons – I mean, there will be many more lessons to be learned in the future, but already at this point I think we can take and draw some lessons. One of them is to really strengthen the health systems, and not rely on there always being good and sunny days. We also need to have our health systems in shape for emergency situations.  I think another important thing is that we need to have social systems that enable people to indeed take sick leave, to stay at home when they’re not feeling well, or even to stay in quarantine, and that’s not possible if you’re only paid by the hour. That’s not possible when you’re paid badly, if you don’t get sick leave support, for example.  Another lesson, as has also been mentioned by colleagues, is that maybe it’s not so smart to leave the production of vital goods to one country, one region alone – that we should spread production more widely and more economically in that sense and not just be reliant on very specific areas or very specific economies.  And while we need to listen to the medical experts and take note of the measures and emergency measures that Parliament should take – that everyone should take – it is also up to politics to draw those conclusions, to draw lessons and deal with them. And, most importantly, I think I want to reiterate what the Commissioner said. We need to work together. A crisis can only be overcome if we all show solidarity.

I am obviously thinking of the Italian people, who have been violently affected by the epidemic and who must receive urgent support from the European Union. Ladies and gentlemen, crises lay bare reality. They remove the superfluous to reveal the true face of our society, with its strengths and weaknesses. Coronavirus shows us how the dogmas of the past make us fragile, sleeful, vulnerable in the face of crises that the market is unable to deal with. Austerity has brought our public hospitals to their knees. Across Europe, carers are mobilizing against the widespread dilapidation of our health systems. And it is in these hospitals, already asphyxiated, that doctors testify to the atrocious dilemma of having to choose between two patients, in the face of shortages of equipment and personnel. Globalization and free trade have deprived us of our sovereignty. The result, as has been said, is that 80% of the active ingredients of our medicines are now produced outside Europe. Every global crisis puts our backs on the wall. The shortage lurks and our stalls are totally devoid. Deregulation gives free rein to unlimited speculation affecting the most vital assets. The price of hydro-alcoholic gels, for example, has already tripled in a few days. It was not until the coronavirus that the Liberals discovered the ravages of the race for profit and the virtues of market management. Financialization has entrusted the reins of our economy to irrationality and individualism, while the situation calls for cold blood, balance and cooperation. Stock prices are panicking and speculators are scrambling, adding further chaos to the chaos. Of course, lessons must be learned from the inability of this economic system to ensure stability, protection and resilience for our countries.

Of course the doctors, but especially the nurses who are the front line against this virus in all our hospitals, and who often do the impossible – especially in regions where hospitals already have to function above their capacity, and who – this may be said here too, even if it is not European competence – are paid far too little in most countries.

This is not the Europe I stand for. In the Europe I stand for, that kind of information is shared, and in the Europe I stand for, we are also learning long-term lessons from this crisis.

Many thanks for your work!  When society is facing this stressful crisis and its challenges, then we must all pull in the same direction. I am pleased that several of my colleagues in plenary are making the point. Together, we must do everything in our power to reduce the spread of infection, and we must, on the basis of science and with calm, make every effort to control the situation. Providing care to those affected and preventing the spread of infection must be our first, second and third priority. Europe here has a great responsibility to stand together and work together together so that we give the best possible support to those who have been affected.

It is, of course, an extraordinary measure in a very serious situation and our thoughts are, of course, with the Italian people in the tough ordeal that is now going through. The truth is that we do not know with certainty what will continue. In recent days, we have seen a very large increase in the number of cases recorded across Europe. But regardless of how the situation develops in the future, there is no doubt that the coronavirus does not know regional or country borders. We must therefore work in solidarity and take a common approach to this epidemic. This applies, of course, to the countries of Europe, but it also applies outside, that is, globally. We all have a responsibility to do what we can to overcome this crisis.

Indeed, we should not panic. This virus may not be as deadly as we think or as other viruses, but it will have indirect effects on health systems if we do not take the measures that are needed – and that is something that I want to explain in my intervention today. I think you have all seen the curves of how an epidemic usually takes place. Well, we have to take all the measures possible to flatten that curve so that people do not infect other people. Usually people infected with this virus infect two to three other people, as we have learned already from the epidemiology of the virus.  We have to bring these numbers down so that, in total, people in the population do not get infected because, and let’s not forget this, there is no immunity in the population. So let’s not compare this with influenza. This has nothing to do with influenza where there is a high background immunity. This is a really different virus and the real danger is that the health systems, the healthcare systems are being overloaded.  I think we’ve all read the newspapers. Today we’ve seen what is happening in the northern part of Italy. Hospitals where people do not get beds, where intensive care beds are lacking because they can’t put the patients where they need to be. Indeed, we really have to do everything possible to contain that virus. I want to reinforce the call of the Commissioner that maybe we have to step up our measures to make sure that this virus is contained.

We must do everything we can to avoid dramatic situations in all Member States. To do this, we need more Europe, a stronger European response. The German Minister of Health said at the weekend that the ECDC, our European Centre, should be greatly expanded and given more powers. We must support and implement this demand very quickly. Legally, this takes a bit; but I call on the Commission and the Member States to make more staff available quickly on a voluntary basis and to draw up uniform recommendations, with the help of the ECDC. Most of the recommendations are well known. However, I would like to raise one point and also ask the Commission to include this in its communications: we know that people who smoke are much more affected by the coronavirus and that there are also many more deaths in this group as a result. Anyone who has not yet found a reason to quit smoking now has one, and we should support people in this. My final point is that, of course, vaccination is important, but it can take time. Some patients are already being treated experimentally in hospitals. Treating viruses with medication is difficult, but there are approaches.

We can even see at the European level that we have a lot of contamination and we also have a significant mortality rate.  This coronavirus is unknown and does not have treatments and vaccines. A lot of people talk to me about the vaccine, but the vaccine can be used after a year after clinical trials. Coronavirus affects at least 15% of people more or less severely, 5% of whom require resuscitation and respiratory assistance, and when you see mortality rates, they vary between 0.6 and 3.4%. But what we don't say is that more than 80% of people develop a mild illness. That is important to say.  So, are we ready? That is where we still need the Commission to challenge the states. Because when we see the situation in Italy and even in France, we see that our systems are quickly saturated. In Milan, the systems are currently saturated. Resuscitation systems must really be encouraged to deal with these new waves of patients. At the same time, all medical personnel must be called upon. It is called the white plan in France, where reservists are called in because there is a real urgency. And I think it took a little while for the states to react. There is also a need to develop outpatient medicine for home-confined cases.  So I have a question for the President of Parliament: what are we doing for Parliament? Because we are a real liner, with thousands of passengers. And we're still super-propagators.

We see quite significant consequences here. We need strong European action. We really need more Europe. The epidemic knows no bounds, and we are now a continent united. What's necessary? Of course, sanitary and health coordinated measures, as well as safety measures. We need to update production capacities and get them moving in terms of the production of personal protective equipment. Also, of course, drugs. We have found out how vulnerable we are again because production capacities in Europe are insufficient. I am not in favour of closing borders, but it is important that the European Union, in addition to these health-specific measures, also implements concrete economic stimulus measures. And it is important to adopt a multiannual financial framework. This is indeed an urgent stimulus.

The Commission must respond to these pressing needs and prepare for future threats, and to do so we need a cross-sectoral plan to respond to public health threats that gives a concerted and homogeneous response throughout Europe and involves all sectors.

In thirty years, we have grown to 80%, and these products today come mainly from China or India. As we see today, we cannot leave it to a simple doctrine of competition that pushes us to outsource the production of these goods that are necessary for our mere survival in a crisis like this.

A place in intensive care costs 2,600 euros per day. In Italy the cost is this: it is many billions of euros. Responding to this emergency means making huge resources available. Secondly, the answer that is needed is economic – as was said – but before we even think about the problem of the deficit, we need to think about the liquidity problem: companies need cash in order not to close today, not to lay off people. But asking for cash resources today costs a lot! We must therefore derogate from the Basle principles which block banks in this respect.

I will try to summarise and answer as many as I can and pick up as many points as I can.  Several of you mentioned the need to strengthen the European Centre of Disease Prevention and Control. We are, at the moment, already working with them on this and they are maximising their outreach in terms of being able to respond to Member States with a specific response team. When called, they go on the ground to Member States to offer advice. This has already happened in at least two Member States and I trust that they will be able to respond to more as more requests come in.  The second point I want to pick up is that it was mentioned that the Commission should not be reading about measures in the newspapers or be waiting to hear what they need to do. Well I can assure you we do not read about daily events in the newspapers. We are briefed by the Health Security Committee and there is an early response warning and response system which is precisely there to exchange information and coordinate. We are in very close coordination with all the European health ministers. There was an emergency Health Council last Friday and I speak with health ministers at least on a weekly basis, trying to address here their needs and different problems.  I want to be absolutely clear – this is not a situation where any of us have the luxury of saying we’re going to be reading about it in the press or as it comes along. This is an evolving situation and we are literally holding meetings at least two or three times a day to see how the situation is changing, and this is the only way we’re going to be able to address the many challenges. But, there is no one-size-fits-all for this situation. Not all Member States are facing the same challenges so we need to be constantly on board with ministers and readdress the way that we are advising and helping them move along. Today there is a European Council with the Heads of State and it’ll be held via teleconference.  Several of you mentioned the need and the problems that we have with possible medicine shortages. I want to assure you that what we have heard so far – and yesterday I had a video call with the European Medicines Agency – is that we have had no reports of medicine shortages, but it is something that is of concern to us and we are monitoring the situation very closely. We will be re-examining it several times a week with the European Medicines Agency. It is true that dependency on third countries is an issue and it’s an issue that has been highlighted. This was already in my mission letter to come forward with a pharma strategy by the end of 2020 and we will be looking at that, but in terms of the day-to-day situation we’re working very closely with the EMA on this. Research. Significant funding has been put towards research for vaccine development, with a potential to reach almost EUR 140 million through Horizon 2020 and the Innovative Medicines Initiative. Last week funding of (EUR) 47.5 million was awarded to 17 projects with 136 research teams working across Europe. Since there was also mention of the international dimension, (EUR) 232 million has been allocated to different sectors to boost global preparedness, with EUR 114 million going to the WHO, EUR 15 million to Africa, EUR 100 million to urgently needed research and diagnostics, and over EUR 3 million to the Union’s Civil Protection Mechanism. Fake news. (This is a) huge area. I think that we can all agree in this plenary, in this Chamber, that fake news and disinformation is extremely dangerous. Last week the Commission convened a meeting with all the big social media outlets – they were all there – and Commissioner Jourová to address this problem. We’re taking it extremely seriously and everyone – everyone – has a part to play in this, so we can all be sure that what is out there for citizens is scientifically-based responsible information. Finally, containment. I agree with you, I agree with what many of you said – that containment is key at this point. There are very many unpleasant measures that have had to be taken, but these measures are important in order to be able to slow down the spread and to save lives. And as I said before, we need to make sure that – and this is the coordination that we are doing, almost on a daily basis – Member States are taking these measures, but, again, I repeat there is no one-size-fits-all approach for Member States.  And finally, I want to reiterate what has been said many times here today already. This is not a time for panic and we need to stress that. It is also not a time for complacency. It is a time for solidarity.

But we need to stay calm. We need to stay solid. We need to stay focused. And we need Members of the European Parliament to spread these messages to their governments as well.

Obviously, as the virus continues to spread, what is needed is that we collectively – Member States and EU institutions – step up our actions and the Commission intends to do so. Not everybody is affected in the same way at the moment. There are some who are hit harder and that’s why we stress the need for solidarity among EU Member States in particular because, without solidarity, the mechanisms that we have simply do not work. The Civil Protection Mechanism is a wonderful mechanism, but it is based on the contribution by Member States. If those contributions are not there, the mechanism doesn’t work. Solidarity also has an impact on joint procurement, and so on. So, without solidarity, we are not going to get far. Why? Simply because the Commission doesn’t possess its own stocks of protective equipment – masks and that kind of stuff. If we did have those things, Italy would be the first to get them from us, but we don’t. We rely on Member States and their solidarity. So it’s not an empty word: solidarity really matters. Without solidarity things aren’t going to work.  The next point I want to make is that obviously we need to continue to work on preparedness and contingency. Obviously the capacities, in particular in the health sector but also elsewhere, are not sufficient in case of further propagation of the virus. We keep saying this, we have kept saying this for weeks and we will continue to say this.  Certain other aspects were highlighted. Let me say that we are working not only on vaccines, but also on diagnostics, tests, treatment and so on, and we added an additional EUR 37 million to this research area just last Friday. We are also looking into aviation, because aviation is obviously one of the sectors that are hardest hit. We are looking into that, and my colleague Commissioner Vălean is looking into that very closely, including with regard to the rules governing the usage of slots. I will not go into further details, but I would like to assure you all that the Commission will not hesitate to propose additional measures as we face this challenge in the coming days and weeks. We will also not hesitate to find any additional funding that is available. But on this issue I would like to underline what was also said by some of the honourable Members. We are in the last year of the Multiannual Financial Framework. Reserves in the Commission’s budget are meagre. This is one more reason, if ever one was needed, to have an early agreement on the next Multiannual Financial Framework. It’s long overdue. Let me close by thanking you as Members of this House for your interest and engagement. It is important that the message goes out to our citizens that the EU cares, that the EU is doing its part to address the situation, and that we will continue to do so until we win this battle. This is a time for EU solidarity. We need to stick together and support each other in fighting this outbreak at all levels – at local level, national level, European level and global level. I can assure you that the Commission will continue to play its role. We will continue to work on all fronts: on health aspects, civil protection aspects, economic aspects, transport aspects and all others. We’ll do our best and we do count on your continued support.

This is a situation of high concern to all of us – governments, politicians and citizens. We need to address the spread of Covid-19 in Europe in a coordinated and coherent manner. In order to achieve this we need to keep each other well informed about developments, cross-cutting impacts on different sectors and the measures taken. Only through close cooperation can we tackle this global outbreak in the most effective way.  It is a situation of high concern, but we must ensure that reliable information is widely available to our citizens and thereby prevent any undue panic. We need to remain vigilant and to combat misinformation and disinformation as well as discriminatory or xenophobic reactions, which are misleading the public and undermine the work carried out by our national authorities.  We also must exchange up-to-date information on preparedness plans and implementation of all measures, as this is important for our mutual security and for a coherent approach. We need to ensure that authorities and staff from relevant sectors, such as transport, health and social policy have the necessary information procedures and guidance on how to deal with cases. We should all especially thank and support our health workers, who often work round the clock in their selfless efforts to save our citizens’ lives.  It is particularly useful to hear your views and concerns and we fully share your sense of urgency. Needless to say, we take the Covid-19 outbreak very seriously. We will remain focused on a thorough implementation of measures in force in relevant sectors, be proactive in exchanging all of the necessary information on their effectiveness, and mobilise inter-sectoral coordination to develop a constructive approach in tackling various disturbances on the EU market.  As I stressed in my opening intervention, we need to strengthen solidarity, cooperation and exchange of information between all the Member States. This is why the Presidency has included discussions on the trade aspects of the Covid-19 outbreak at the Foreign Affairs Council in the trade format on 12 March, and a coordination of the Member States’ efforts will be further discussed at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 13 March, as well as the Ecofin Council on 17 March.

That is why the EU's response must be the same as then, a consistent and well-targeted one. We need a European economic stimulus plan based on the EU budget. In 2008, the European Economic Recovery Plan mobilised EUR 200 billion, or 1.5% of EU GDP, plus tens of billions of euros made available nationally by most Member States. By making the Stability and Growth Pact more flexible, this European plan must be funded to help European economies overcome the effects of the coronavirus epidemic, thereby protecting European companies, jobs and citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 123, "date": "2020-03-10.json", "name": "Carlos Zorrinho (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "124739", "text": "  in writing. – The global coronavirus epidemic is a strong challenge to the responsiveness of the European Union and the Member States in a context of great uncertainty, given the disruptive character of the threat.

Madam President, first of all I would like to thank you for giving me this opportunity to take the floor again and to have this opportunity to exchange with the European Parliament. Thank you also for your understanding, because this afternoon we will have an important video-conference with the 27 Member States about coronavirus, and we need to prepare for that meeting. That is why I will be unable to stay more than 30 minutes with you in the European Parliament, but of course I will follow the different points of view expressed by the Members of the European Parliament. One word if I may, first of all, about coronavirus. First, a word about coronavirus. To begin with, on behalf of the European Council, I would like to express our full support for those directly or indirectly affected by this situation, to tell you that the European Council takes very seriously the situation facing the European Union, the Member States and the world today. I would also like to tell you that, in the context of the video conference which will take place earlier, we will discuss with the Member States what I believe is a necessity, namely that of considerably strengthening the European capacity for coordination and cooperation.  To meet this challenge, we need more Europe present and mobilised alongside the Member States and all the players, whether to try to coordinate action in order to contain and reverse this virus. We must try to be more supportive, to help each other with regard to the medical equipment and products needed to reduce this threat. We must mobilize to advance research and innovation and to discover the vaccine that will enable us to win this battle. We must also mention the economic consequences, but also the measures that can be taken today, to minimise the economic and therefore social impact of this crisis on our citizens. The Council intends to be extremely mobilised with all the partners: Parliament, of course, but also the Commission, the ECB and the EIB, because when the European Union faces a challenge of this magnitude, the only option is to mobilise and stick together. That is the message I want to send to begin this afternoon. One word about the next European budget. As you know, I made a promise to the European Parliament to try as much as possible to cooperate with them in this difficult political process and whether it would be possible to reach an agreement as soon as possible on the next European budget. We had a meeting - a summit - a few weeks ago in February, and unfortunately it was not possible to reach an agreement, because between the Member States I had to recognize and observe that there are different opinions at the moment. On the one hand, for some Member States, it's important to stick with the idea that we have to maintain 1% of the GNI over a level for the next European budget, for other Member States it's not enough, while for other Member States it's important to have a guarantee that it will be possible in the future to continue support significant for the convergence policy , like cohesion and agriculture.  The modelization of the budget is also an important topic. I think it's very important not to oppose - or to avoid - the traditional policies, more economic and, as a result, social convergence at the European level and, at the same time, to be able to face the new challenges we need to face, like climate change, like the digital agenda, like migration, like security, like defense. It means that we need to continue all the political efforts, and I will continue the consultations with the different Member States in order to appreciate, to assess, when it is possible to come back to a new summit with the goal of trying to reach an agreement.  Some other points. Conditionality rule of law - an important signal for the European Parliament, although not only for the European Parliament but for many Member States. In my negotiating box that I put on the table I have proposed organising a link between the rule of law and conditionality, between the rule of law governance and the next European budget, but we need to continue this situation, for example about which kind of majority we need to take a country decision. Looking at resources, this is also on the table, and I know that in the European Parliament you had many decisions on this topic. In my negotiating box I have made some concrete proposals regarding the possibility of taking a decision regarding plastic waste distribution or looking at the possibility of enlarge at European level the ETS system. Also in my proposal I gave other examples of possible measures we can take and we can discuss with the different actors and especially with the European Parliament. For the many Member States plastic waste contribution is possible, for some Member States the ETS system remains something very complex, very difficult, and we will continue decisions on these different topics.  One last piece of information - one last important point in my opinion: I've also put on the table a proposal to increase the capital of the European Investment Bank. I am very clear. In my opinion, it doesn't replace the role of the next European budget, but it's something more in order to give the possibility in the future for the Digital Agenda, for example, or for climate change to use the European Investment Bank more. In my negotiating box you have probably seen that I've proposed strengthening the possibility for the European Parliament to cooperate, to be more involved, in order to be an important player, in order to identify what the possible priorities would be if the Member States would agree to increase sooner or later the capital of the European Investment Bank. Here are a few things. With regard to this draft European budget, I have had, on several occasions, the opportunity to debate very directly, in particular with the parliamentarians responsible for the Contact Group for the Multi-Year Financial Framework (MFF). I have indicated to them that I will present them with the negotiating framework, which was done before the European summit. I then had the opportunity to debate at the Conference of Presidents and my intention is to maintain the link with the European Parliament. You know that it takes unanimity in the European Council to make a decision. But I do not forget that Parliament must speak on this subject, both on the figures of this negotiating framework but also on the legislative processes associated with it, not just on the question of own resources for that matter. Finally, a very last word, Madam President. We have to deal with a number of issues at the same time. In recent days, we have also been mobilised with the President of Parliament and the President of the Commission to try to take action on the issue of migration. You have seen that tensions have increased about ten days ago on the border between Greece and Turkey, which is why we went there. We felt it was important to look at the situation on the ground and take action. This means that we have expressed our support for the Greek authorities which protect the Greek borders, which are also those of the European Union, and we must do so in accordance with international law, human dignity and human rights. This is a very clear message that I had the opportunity to express at the border between Greece and Turkey. I also had the opportunity last week to travel very quickly to Turkey to meet with President Erdogan to discuss with him the return to implementation of the agreement between Turkey and the European Union, which dates back to 2016. Following this meeting, we tried to encourage a reduction in tensions on the borders with Greece, with Cyprus also, with Bulgaria. And last night we had a meeting in Brussels, the President of the Commission and myself, as well as our teams with the Turkish delegation, led by President Erdogan. It was decided to continue the dialogue in the coming days to ensure that we were mobilized to implement this 2016 agreement. That is the priority, before we look at how we can continue to cooperate on migration with this country in the future, as probably with others. These, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, are the few messages I wanted to give you. I regret not being here any longer this afternoon with you. But, of course, my advisers will not fail to report to me the messages that are addressed and, in accordance with the responsibilities allocated on the basis of the treaties to the institutions, I renew my political wish to cooperate loyally with your institution which represents European citizens through your election by universal suffrage.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 126, "date": "2020-03-10.json", "name": "Maroš Šefčovič", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice—President of the Commission. – Madam President, it’s my honour to deliver these remarks on behalf of the President of the Commission, Ms Ursula von der Leyen, who is in urgent contact with the Heads of State and Government to coordinate their response to the current coronavirus crisis. As President Michel has just mentioned, I would also like to assure you that the Commission is working flat out to find the best solution to tackle not only the health aspects, but also the economic and financial aspects of the current crisis. It would of course be excellent, and in the interest of European citizens, if today we could discuss the achievement of the European Council in reaching agreement on the long-term budget, to allow you to scrutinise the results and move forward. We all know that this was not to be, and this is of course disappointing. The failure to agree will now, in any event, mean that many programmes can at best only be implemented very partially next year. However, looking at the history of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), it has always needed at least two European summits to find an agreement. It will therefore be crucial to make the second summit a success and to do it quickly. We, the European Commission, call on leaders to draw lessons, not just from their deliberations but also from your contribution and, most of all, from the challenges in the real world that have been intensifying in recent days and have been on stark display on the borders of the European Union. It is time for realism, reason and responsibility. Realism first. I have seen how difficult the discussions are. It is therefore now high time that all deepen their sense of some of the realities that should govern our work. That requires recognising the following things. First, we are facing a financial gap caused by Brexit of EUR 75 billion euros. This means that we all need to face up to this reality. Member States’ contributions to the budget will have to rise, while expenditure will have to be constrained. Secondly, like the European Parliament, the Commission is also convinced that we need a budget tailored to achieving our common goals with a sufficient overall size. Follow this logic and we will fail to deliver on what citizens expect, while national budgets will simply end up having to pay these costs. We know that this is the road that leads nowhere. Crucially, we cannot close our eyes to the challenges in the real world that we need to address together. The challenges for migration and borders, for treating people in wretched circumstances with a minimum of human dignity, need no further illustrations after last week’s events. Leaders from right across the Union have pleaded for the European approach. Yet, in the negotiations on the MFF, these very same leaders are limiting funds available for borders, migration and external action. This is simply not acceptable. The MFF is not an accounting exercise or a simple numbers game. This is about equipping the Union with the resources needed to solve real-life problems and, may I add, save real lives. That reality will need to sink in much deeper as we approach the next round, and we in the Commission will not accept an outcome that does not reflect this. Having our common priorities in mind, we have no time to lose. It is truly time for reason and cool-headedness. At this moment we have three options: the better, the suboptimal and the worst. The better option is reaching a balanced agreement very soon. This is still possible, but we are already very late. Last time we achieved a deal in the Council in early February and the final agreement only in December. Therefore, 2014 meant a lost year for some programmes, something we need to avoid this time. But that also implies that, even in our best case scenario, we are already under massive time pressure. Many of our policies will at best restart at the end of 2021. The better scenario therefore is already one that will come with serious challenges. The suboptimal option would be a contingency plan, rolling forward existing budget programmes for another year. I know that many of you have been asking for this since it would buy more time. But let me be very clear about the consequences. It would mean additional ‘mini’ MFF negotiations running in parallel with all the contentious issues on the table, the very same things that are blocking progress on the MFF. Attempting to find a solution along these lines would therefore absorb everyone’s time, energy and focus, while we need all efforts to find a good agreement on the actual long-term budget soon. It might well fail, in which case we end up with no result. Even if it didn’t fail, what type of answer to structural challenges such as climate change, digitisation and external policies could we give with a one-year budget? What would this do for the credibility of the European Union? Worst of all, it would result in a budget without response to the new challenges: no Just Transition Fund, no InvestEU, no defence and digital agenda, and a lower climate ambition. The third option is the worst—case scenario. No agreement would have severe consequences for all Europeans since it would leave us with a budget on life support, only allowing a limited number of policies to be funded. How could we explain to students that there is no Erasmus? How could we tell the regions that there is no cohesion money? How would we explain to the citizens that Europe is unable to act when it comes to climate and digital challenges, or that it lacks the means to protect our common borders effectively? No agreement in time would damage us all. Now is therefore the time for responsibility, to do everything to reach a good agreement as soon as possible. To achieve this we need to work together. As the Commission, we engaged with you from the beginning and we encouraged the Member States to listen to the European Parliament. We also agree with you that we need new resources to fund our ambitions. They are the win—win solution which might help to find a compromise. When President von der Leyen presented the agenda for a Europe that strives for more, you, as well as the Member States, promised the necessary support. Now is the time to give Europe the means to strive for more and to equip ourselves with sufficient shared resources. It is the time for everybody to recognise this and to stand up for realism, reason and responsibility. We need an agreement on the next long—term EU budget to secure the necessary funds to be able to act together, and we need this agreement fast. We in the European Commission know that we can count on you. Let us work together with the European Council to make this long—term budget a success for Europe and all Europeans.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 127, "date": "2020-03-10.json", "name": "José Manuel Fernandes", "mepid": "96899", "text": "  on behalf of the Ppe Group. – Madam President, the European Parliament would reject the proposal on the table, and from that point of view it is even a good thing that the Council has not reached an agreement. The European Parliament cannot betray the citizens of the European Union, it cannot accept a proposal that is against them. Mr. Charles Michel, I ask you: also ask European leaders to tell the citizens the truth. Our leaders make many proclamations, set many goals, but then do not give the financial means to achieve these goals.  Everyone advocates cohesion, research, safe and healthy eating, strengthening borders, supporting young people. Then they cut into Cohesion Policy, cut into the Common Agricultural Policy, cut into Erasmus+, cut into Frontex, cut into research. How is it possible to have a competitive European Union in this way? Where is the geopolitical Union we stand for?  With your proposal, the European Union would be irrelevant and the coronavirus proves that there is no coordination, that we are not even able to have enough medicines. What is happening at the level of migration is a shame: we do not have a proposal, a common solution and sufficient means. How much does it cost not to have the investigation we should have? Moreover, there are Commission figures: a reduction of EUR 10 billion in the research programme means a decrease of EUR 110 billion in gross national income. The leaders know this. So why do they want to cut back in the European Union? The European Council cannot be the sum of the 27 national selfishness and so prepare for one thing: if the proposal is not positive, if it is to make the European Parliament and the European Union irrelevant, we will collapse. And we're always the solution. We want a contingency plan to be predictable, we want our own resources so we can have a sufficient level and we have been waiting for the Council since November 2018. We will continue to wait, but the urgency that the European Commission is talking about, and I will end, we are waiting, but we cannot have a budget other than a capable budget, a sufficient budget.

We know of the special circumstances of today's agenda and hope that this meeting, which will take place shortly at Council level with the other heads of government, will be fruitful.  We had a debate here in Parliament this morning on the situation of the coronavirus and I would simply like to reiterate two messages very quickly. On the one hand, the need for coordination at European level on measures, but respecting the different measures to be taken at Member State level because of the intensity of the situation in each of them. On the other hand, a message about trying to mitigate the economic effects is that decisions will have to be taken from the European institutions in order to establish greater flexibility in the Stability Pact, in order to enable this situation to be addressed and to mitigate the economic and social effect that may exist in this regard.  With regard to the financial framework, you obviously know perfectly well what our group thinks and what the majority of this Parliament thinks. It is disappointing that we have not reached an agreement, because I believe that we are all aware that this debate goes far beyond the figures. This debate is about what Europe we want to build. And it cannot be that we are at the beginning of a legislature talking about how we lead the fight against climate change, how we strengthen the European social pillar, how we maintain policies that are aimed at our territory, such as the common agricultural policy or cohesion policy, and how we adapt to new policies that have to be put in place , for example, migrations... Today we have a clear case on the table. Well, what's impossible is to do more with fewer resources. And that's what some people are raising. And so I think we should all be aware that we need enough time to form an agreement and consensus. I know it's hard, but I also think haste can't condition our work.  Clearly, what is desirable, as Mr . But I think many of us here think that a non-agreement is preferable before a bad deal. We cannot afford a bad deal in the budgetary framework. We need a strong and strong budget to tackle Europe's political project. We cannot afford a non-agreement because a non-agreement will mean dealing with challenges and challenges that are already waiting for these institutions today.

Madam President, I would like to welcome first of all the determination of Charles Michel and his presence here in Parliament today, which proves to us his interest in working with Parliament - I know that this message has also been conveyed to the Heads of State and Government - and his determination to reach agreement on the budgetary outlook.  But a credible final decision requires taking seriously the expectations expressed here in Parliament. And I want to make it very clear that there will be an annual European budget only when it lives up to our political ambitions expressed many times by the Member States in the Council around European priorities. We cannot have ambitions on the green deal, on the digital transition if this ambition is not accompanied by a real vision of budget and investment. Moreover, the common agricultural policy and cohesion policy must break out of this intergovernmental haggling and enter an era of modernization. And both should be seen as solutions and not budget problems.  Our debate on the budget outlook today takes on a new political dimension in the context of this coronavirus crisis. Because the question is not whether this epidemic will have an impact on our economy, but rather how big it will be. This coronavirus crisis will pass sooner or later and I hope with as few victims as possible. But the key question is how the European economy will cope and to what extent, in the wake of this crisis, the European budget will play its full role as a lever for investment and economic recovery.  To help our companies and our employees to pass this difficult milestone, we must have predictability, that is a key word in this crisis situation. It is for this reason that a quick decision on the budget, geared towards investment, towards job creation, is one of the essential elements of visibility for the future at European level, since the European budget is an element of direction and predictability.  What is happening at the Greek-Turkish border shows us once again that our policy of border security, but also of solidarity, implies a Frontex with resources, but also with a budget to make solidarity a reality on the ground. The coming weeks and months are crucial in proving that post-Brexit Europe is capable of providing stability and predictability and vision.

The lack of agreement means that the beneficiaries of the programmes, European citizens, are at risk on 1 January 2021. Because let us be clear: since May 2018 citizens have been familiar with the European Commission's proposal. Since October 2019, citizens have known the position and ambition of this Parliament. But no one knows what the Council wants, and our response to climate, demographic, digital and international challenges must be more Europe. More Europe to solve the border crisis, more Europe to work out a European solution for Covid-19. And in the next seven years we must be aware that more unexpected challenges will arise and Europe cannot say, as I said in the 2007-2008 crises, that we are not prepared.  We must provide the Union budget with the capacity to respond collectively to challenges that do not know nationality, borders or languages, which are European challenges and which need a European solution, and that is why this Parliament continues and will continue to fight for an ambitious and coherent budget capable of responding to predictable and unpredictable objectives. It is urgent, as it was on 20 February, that the Council should take its position on the Multiannual Financial Framework and begin to negotiate it with this Parliament. Until this agreement arrives, Parliament will use all the tools at its disposal to ensure that European citizens and European economies can benefit from the programmes and their funding in the Union budget on 1 January 2021.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 137, "date": "2020-03-10.json", "name": "Moritz Körner (Renew).", "mepid": "197445", "text": "   Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her Why is it so difficult to agree on this multiannual financial framework?

These are not just the thrifty four who are selfish, but all of them. Everyone just looks at what is being paid in, what you get out of it.

If everyone is now talking about strengthening border protection and support for migration, then it is not acceptable for the last time to discuss cuts of EUR 14 billion compared to the Commission proposal.

If the Union reduces them, it will deliberately take responsibility for sacrificing many small and medium-sized farms that will no longer be able to withstand international competition from sacrosanct free trade. Secondly, this will have to be achieved by saving in other areas and not by increasing the union's overall budget. Migrant reception and European defence are two areas in which we could make substantial savings. Helping our agriculture means preserving the food sovereignty of our states.

Or do we not prefer a strong Europe that, with a strong budget, promotes climate protection and social justice, which finances the digital agenda and the Digital Europe programme? That is what we want. A strong Europe with cutting-edge technology, and it is not for nothing. But an ambitious budget also includes a rule of law mechanism that is not a toothless tiger. European citizens must be able to trust that corrupt oligarchs will not be financed with EU funding, and we expect more from the Council.

I would like to take this opportunity to make two specific points. President Michel's proposal, on top of what was already in the Finnish proposals, there are a lot of savings and some of them, and some of them are very drastic. I am thinking, for example, of the European Defence Fund, minus 39%, the military mobility facility, minus 74%. I think we have to ask ourselves whether, if you are going to make that kind of savings, what else of such programmes will make sense, whether or not you fall below a certain threshold under which the efficiency of such programmes will be eliminated. Second point. It also includes savings on innovation spending. Now, if there is one type of European Union expenditure that has proven its worth, which also focus on the common future, and which also belong in the European field because of the economies of scale, it is those innovation expenditures. I do not think it is appropriate to save on this in these times of very strong technological evolution, and I think that we should certainly take those two elements into account in the forthcoming discussions on the MFF.

We have seen it with the economic crisis, we have seen it with the refugee crisis. We need flexibility in the budget to adapt. Second, contingency plan. It is no longer an option, but it is a necessity, because we are going with an obvious delay and, of course, it will not be because of this Parliament, which has been waiting two years to negotiate. So, now, they're not in a hurry, they're not worth the urges, and they're certainly not worth pressure. Let's take our time and have a good deal. And it is clear that, moreover, the circumstances we are experiencing now make flexibility and a contingency plan even more necessary, because we will have to continue to adapt.

It was underlined in the interventions by Madame García Pérez that we need a budget of a sufficient overall size, and that – as Mr Fernandes and Mr Lins underlined – we need a budget which would enable us to respond to the challenges ahead because, as Ms McGuinness has said, if we don’t have proper funding, how are we going to convince our farmers that we need to invest more in a Farm—to—Fork Strategy? How are we going to create that huge investment fund which we want to use to modernise Europe, to invest in the Green Deal project and to prepare the industry for this important twin transition – digital and green – that we are going through? We also need to be much better prepared for contingencies. I think it was underlined in the interventions by Ms Marques and Mr Cioloş that we need to have some flexibility in the budget to respond adequately to all the challenges and unexpected emergencies we have to face. Almost all of you referred to the situation at the Turkish—Greek borders and to the coronavirus. These are exactly the situations where European citizens expect us to act and act fast. I think that on both occasions we did our utmost and my dear colleague Ylva Johansson is here to debrief you on the details of the visit of the three Presidents to the Greek borders and on all the contingency planning we are doing in the Commission.  I think that what is very important right now is to focus on the deal – to focus on the agreement – because I believe none of us want to disappoint our young generation and tell them that next year there is simply no Erasmus. Nobody wants to disappoint the citizens who came out to vote in such large numbers and who sent us a clear message to prepare Europe for the important Green Deal transition because, put simply, we need to lead by example and we are in the best position to do so. So all these are tasks which we have to deal with. We therefore hope that, together with you, in the spirit of the close cooperation we have had, we will be able to push for an ambitious budget – a budget which responds to the expectations of our citizens. We agree with you that there is no time to lose. So thank you very much for your support. Let’s cooperate very closely on this until we get the ambitious budget that Europe needs.

Since the start of our Presidency, this is the third time that we are discussing in the plenary the situation at our external borders. This shows the importance this Parliament gives to this issue, and we fully endorse it.  Let us start with the situation on the Greek borders, which is indeed the most pressing one. Greece has been under considerable pressure since 27 February 2020, following the announcement of Turkish authorities on opening borders towards the EU. According to some reports, there were some 20 000 persons inside the border area on the Turkish side trying to move towards the Greek sea and land borders. However, due to the timely reaction, both on operational and political levels, massive illegal border crossings did not take place. Despite certain incidents, we can say that the current situation is stable, both on land and sea borders.  Last week, Home Affairs Ministers met for an extraordinary Council meeting to discuss the situation at the EU’s external borders with Turkey. In line with the strong statements made by the Presidents of the EU institutions the day before their visits to the Greek-Turkish border, the Ministers expressed strong solidarity with Greece, but also with other Member States which might be similarly affected in other efforts to manage the EU’s external borders. The Ministers sent a clear message that, while we acknowledge the increased migratory burden and risk that Turkey is facing on its territory, and the substantial efforts it has made in hosting 3.7 million migrants and refugees, we strongly reject Turkey’s use of migratory pressure for political purposes. The EU and its Member States remain determined to effectively protect the EU’s external borders, and illegal crossings will not be tolerated. In this regard, the EU and its Member States will take all necessary measures in accordance with EU and international law.  The current situation at our external borders is not acceptable. We express clearly our expectations that Turkey will continue with the full implementation of the 2016 Joint Statement. The Joint Statement produces tangible results in both the EU and Turkey, and we are therefore in favour of the continuation of this cooperation and commitment. The EU wants to continue supporting refugee communities in Turkey, as it has been doing for the past years.  Migrants should not be encouraged to endanger their lives by attempting illegal crossings by land or sea. The Council called upon the Turkish Government and all actors and organisations on the ground to relay this message and counter the dissemination of false information. Linked to this is the thriving business of organised crime networks and opportunistic migrant smugglers, which we will continue to fight actively. These messages were again clearly stated by our Foreign Ministers following the Foreign Affairs Council on 6 March, which took place in Zagreb.  As you know, yesterday, President Michel and President von der Leyen met President Erdoğan. The leaders discussed bilateral relations, the implementation of the EU-Turkey statement as well as the crisis in Syria. President Michel said, after the meeting, that it had been a step in the right direction, as both Turkey and the EU need to work on the full implementation of the EU-Turkey statement on migration in order to de-escalate the situation. The leaders decided to task High Representative Borrell and the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs with working over the next few days on clarifying the implementation of the deal between Turkey and the European Union. President Michel noted that the meeting had clarified a number of aspects relating to the implementation of the statement, and, in particular, had provided an opportunity to show how the EU has implemented its financial commitments, including the pledge to mobilise a total of EUR 6 billion to support refugees in Turkey.  Coming back to the situation in Greece, our response has so far been the following: last week, Frontex launched two calls for rapid intervention upon Greece’s request – one for the sea border and one for the land border. Deployments of additional staff under the rapid reaction pool, and technical assets under the rapid reaction equipment pool, are taking place. Greece also activated the Union Civil protection mechanism for equipment that will help them provide arriving migrants with basic non-food items such as medical equipment, shelters, tents, blankets and other necessary supplies. Member States have been very responsive and quick in their reaction, and the Commission has been efficient in coordinating efforts. The Commission has offered immediate assistance of EUR 350 million to Greece, which is available to support border and immigration management. The Commission also announced an additional EUR 350 million to further support the Greek authorities. The European Asylum Support Office will issue the call for 160 experts to be deployed in Greece, as soon as discussions with Greek authorities have been finalised.  In addition, it is important to further strengthen regional and operational cooperation with our partners. The Commission has proposed to further develop its coordination mechanism with the Western Balkan countries, the pending status agreement between the Western Balkan partners and Frontex should be completed as a matter of priority and quickly implemented. All these actions are a strong expression of our solidarity with Greece. They show we are firm, united in our commitment to protect the external borders. We will continue to closely monitor the situation at the EU external borders and ensure coordination between all those involved through the relevant channels. In a similar vein, the Presidency will continue the cooperation with the Western Balkan partners in addressing migratory challenges. The Justice and Home Affairs Council will meet on 13 March to follow up on the EU’s response to the migratory situation. The Council and the Commission will continue to monitor the situation and coordinate EU action.  On the border between Bulgaria and Turkey, we were informed the situation is stable. There is no increase in the number of illegal border crossings. However, the situation has to be closely monitored and we should increase our level of preparedness.  Concerning the western and central Mediterranean routes, we have not observed deterioration in the overall migratory situation, but we remain vigilant on all routes. I will let the Commission elaborate on the specific points of this action plan, presented last week, for the comprehensive assistance that the EU provides to improve the situation at the Greek-Turkish border. ", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 168, "date": "2020-03-10.json", "name": "Ylva Johansson", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, we are faced with an urgent and serious situation at our external borders. I am worried about the situation and I know that I share these concerns with you. It is absolutely necessary that we, the European Union, protect our external borders, but it’s also absolutely necessary that we defend our fundamental rights and values, including the right to asylum. It’s our legal and moral duty to do both and I can hear sometimes in the debate that there should be a contradiction between the these two, and that’s not true. It’s absolutely possible both to defend our external borders – of course it’s not Turkey that decides about the EU’s external borders – but it is also possible to combine this with the right to asylum and to stand up for fundamental human rights and for our values.  I think that our most urgent concern is people, human beings. We need to support and protect people who are, right now, living under unacceptable conditions. In this situation, there are three things that we need to deliver at a European level. First, as I mentioned, support for people. We have a lot of people who are already in a difficult situation, who have been brought to the border under false pretences and are now in a very difficult situation. Even worse, I should say, is the situation for people on the islands, on the Greek islands, people in [inaudible] hotspots, living in unacceptable conditions and who have been doing so for quite a long time, vulnerable people. Also families with children; unaccompanied minors; people with sickness and disabilities. But let me also mention the islanders themselves, Greek citizens that are also under high pressure living on the islands. Second, support for Greece of course. Greece manages entry at our common EU border, and we are now facing politically-motivated pressure at the European external border. It’s necessary that we support Greece, and we are supporting Greece, and we are now taking urgent measures in all these areas. And third, of course we must share responsibilities for supporting Syrian refugees, also in Turkey.  As you all know, last week the Presidents of the European Parliament, the European Council, the Council and the Commission visited the Greek-Turkish and Bulgarian-Turkish borders, stressing our unity, commitment and solidarity. Last week also, the Commission presented an action plan on measures to be taken by the Union and the Member States together to provide critical support to Greece. As a result, together with the Member States and our agencies, we agreed on a number of concrete steps.  First, we agreed to support Greece and other countries to handle this situation, to protect our external borders and support people. Greece is obliged to protect its borders and the EU external borders, but it also has to do this with proportionate measures. With the launch of two rapid border intervention operations by the European Border and Coast Guard at the land and sea borders between Greece and Turkey, an additional 100 border guards will be deployed as well as assets like helicopters and boats. Frontex stands ready to coordinate a new programme for the quick return of irregular migrants from Greece to countries of origin.  The European Asylum Support Office is also ready to accelerate the deployment of experts to support in Greece. At the request of Greece, the Civil Protection Mechanism has been activated; 16 Member States have so far pledged support to Greece. That, I think, is European solidarity in action and in action quite quickly. Member States are assisting Greece by sending medical equipment, medical teams, shelters, tents, blankets, and a lot of other items that are needed.  We also need to give financial support. The Commission will immediately make available EUR 350 million with a possibility to increase this by another 350 million through an amending budget, and this will be used to increase the reception capacity and the living conditions for the migrants on the islands and on the mainland. It will be used to support the provision of services such as healthcare, food provision and transportation, to support the Greek asylum service, and to strengthen the ongoing voluntary return programme.  Tomorrow evening I will go to Greece and on Thursday I will meet with the Greek Minister and the authorities to discuss how we should implement this action plan, and of course I will also ask the Greek Government how they will act now to make sure that they comply with EU law and the right to asylum, and also with the principle of non-refoulement.  Second, our relationship with Turkey. The EU-Turkish statement remains valid. We must continue our dialogue, we must de-escalate the rhetoric and decrease the tension. That involves finding a path forward with Turkey.  The lines of communication with Turkey remain open and active. With Turkey, we share a joint responsibility for refugees and a joint commitment to the statement. That is why we’re continuing a constructive engagement. As you all know, yesterday evening President von der Leyen and President Michel had a constructive dialogue with President Erdoğan. The two Presidents expressed very clearly to President Erdoğan their commitment to move forward with a perspective for migrants and stability in the region. On our side we are delivering on our commitments in the EU—Turkey statement by having provided safe and legal pathways to Europe for over 26 500 Syrian refugees, and by supporting schools, healthcare and basic services for Syrian refugees in Turkey.  We must relieve the pressure that has been brought on the border, and the main way to do that is, of course, a dialogue together with Turkey, but we also must ensure that the right to asylum is respected.  To conclude, let me say that the situation at the European external border towards Turkey is worrying, but I also must say that this is not 2015. We are much better prepared now to manage the situation because we know better what to expect. We have reinforced our agencies, we have strengthened, we now have Frontex, we have the European Asylum Support Office. We have more willingness to cooperate between Member States and we have stronger structures between the Member States. That’s why it is possible for the European Union to react so quickly in support to Greece and to the external borders of the European Union.  But let me also say that, even if we are much better prepared in 2015, we are not well prepared enough, and what we are lacking is a common European migration and asylum system. This is really a problem for us and this has been my task since I took office. I have had constructive dialogues with all the 27 Member States and a lot of dialogues here in this Parliament on this topic to find a compromise forward for a common approach so that we together will be better prepared to face migration and asylum together in the European Union.  And I must say that these dialogues have been constructive. We all know it’s a difficult task, of course, but at least I’m more optimistic now than before I started the dialogues and I’m preparing now the proposals and you can expect them to be presented after Easter.  Let me conclude with one aspect; I think I share it with many of you. It is the situation for children and maybe especially those that are without their parents – unaccompanied children, minors, teenagers. One third of all children arrive in Greece without parents or family, around 5 500 children and teenagers in total according to Europol; 10% are younger than 14 years old. They face violence, abuse and exploitation.  Many of them just disappear from their asylum reception centres and we don’t know where they are. I’m afraid that many of them fall into the hands of criminals. Sometimes the same criminals who traffic migrants also traffic people for sexual exploitation. Just imagine being a 15-year-old, fleeing, searching for a better life. Imagine how afraid you would be alone under these circumstances and at risk of being a victim for abuse and trafficking.  My mission, together with the Greek Government, is to put in place a process to protect and care for these vulnerable children and teenagers. I want to find solutions that will help unaccompanied migrant minors, in particular on the Greek islands, with relocation to other Member States, with medical aid, with housing, with safety, protecting them from being victims of trafficking.  On Thursday, I will be in Greece together with President von der Leyen. This is the aim of our purpose: to continue or to develop new ways to protect these unaccompanied minors. I call on all Member States to help these children and these youngsters and to welcome them. That’s the spirit of solidarity we need that will see us through these difficult times.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 169, "date": "2020-03-10.json", "name": "Der Präsident. –", "mepid": "2323", "text": "  Thank you, Commissioner Johansson.

I would like to thank both the Council and the Commission for drawing a clear picture here: Erdogan is using the suffering of the people for his political interests. That is the reality at this border. And the other reality is that Kyriakos Mitsotakis and his Greek government are implementing European law on this border. 2015 must not be repeated, Europe must not be blackmailed! That is the reality at this border; that is why, first of all, the Greek Government deserves full support. And if we compare it again with 2015, it is fair to say that we have a different situation on the border today, because today in Athens we have a government that is able to secure the border. That was not the case with Tsipras in 2015. That is the reality, and that is why it is right that we underline this. I would like to say thank you to the three Presidents who went to Greece and supported the Greek Government. The European Union stands by Greece's side. And we, as the PPE-DE, also have full confidence in the officials acting. Those who work there and do their job do not want to use violence. And all Greek officials who work there will also respect European law. What is to be done now? Firstly, before we start a dialogue with Turkey, which is necessary, Erdogan must de-escalate, that is, to ensure that we return to orderly conditions on the Greek-Turkish border. Secondly, Greece needs our support – with money, with Frontex, with tents, as is already going on. Thirdly, we are ready for a renewed agreement with Turkey. But the payments should continue to go directly to the aid agencies. We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are not prepared to finance the Turkish state budget, but we are prepared to support the refugees in Turkey. Nor should we forget that Lebanon and Jordan also continue to have a high need for support. It should not just focus on Turkey. Fourthly, we need a solution for the people of Lesbos. Commissioner, you referred to the unspeakable situation, especially for unaccompanied children. That is why we welcome the fact that there is now finally the will for a coalition of the willing at European level, who are prepared to take in people in need. There is an urgent need to tackle this. Fifthly, development is a wake-up call for the European Union to finally be honest with the medium-term financial perspective that we discussed earlier. Two weeks ago, the Heads of State or Government decided to cut Frontex. They have decided to give less money to border guards. This is indisputable! The Member States must finally make it absolutely clear: do we want a common external border protection? Then the Member States must also be prepared to provide the necessary funds. And we need a breakthrough in the legislative proposal. Commissioner, we are waiting for your proposals, which will come after Easter. And we will accompany you constructively. We need a new surcharge to move forward. The real cause of the developments, of course, is Syria, where Erdogan is right to say that Europe should finally take action and not just comment.

But, despite this immoral conduct, we have an obligation to act with responsibility.  We must give full support to Greece. Greece deserves our responsibility. Because Greece is falling victim to the Council's lack of responsibility for blocking Dublin's reform. And allow me, Mr Weber: I think it is very irresponsible of you that you have made this reference to the change of government in Greece, because the same difficulties that the Government encounters today in order to be able to act in the face of this situation were had by the previous Government. It is very irresponsible to make a very political use of this issue. Let's agree on what we need to do and not use this misfortune of many people to attack a national government.  Being aware of this, the Social Democrats cannot fail to regret that the debate has only revolved around the protection of our borders, while we forget the thousands of people, in refugee camps or in no man's land, who are suffering the consequences. The images we have seen on Greece's border with Turkey are shocking. Yes, Member States have the right to exercise effective control of their borders, but such control must be carried out in strict compliance with international law.  I do not know if President Von der Leyen thinks so, because when she visited Greece and had a meeting with her Government, she proudly argued that that government, that the Government of Greece should act as the coat of arms of Europe. Shield of what? Shields are used to protect us from weapons, and we are talking about the lives of people, of human beings, of vulnerable beings. Not shields, protection.  We would like to hear what the Commission thinks of the Greek Government's unilateral decision to suspend all asylum applications for one month. Does this mean that the European Commission ignores the Geneva Convention? I would like to recall your role as guardian of the Treaties, because Article 78(3) TFEU provides that any measure to that effect requires a Council decision on a proposal from the Commission and after consultation of the European Parliament.  If we want to end this drama, we must work on all fronts. Because there will be no solution to this humanitarian crisis if the civil strife in Syria is not ended. The Commission and the Council have a crucial responsibility. Mrs Johansson today announced to us the presentation of this package, which we are waiting for, because it is urgent and necessary.

Today we are facing the consequences of four years of inertia: the government leaders who’ve been sitting on their hands since 2015 are now crying big crocodile tears because they’ve been cornered by Mr Erdoğan, which cannot come as a surprise. Europe has abandoned its citizens and Europe has betrayed its values. So now let’s try and use this crisis to do better. I think that our adjusted work schedules should not be a reason for not doing our parliamentary job as a co-legislator and a budget authority.  Firstly, we urgently need to relocate people from the islands, with priority for unaccompanied minors and families with children. I find the refusal of most Member States – fortunately not all – to relocate people from the islands an absolute disgrace. I would like to praise the local authorities. who have been a lot more generous and welcoming – and very often wiser – than their own national governments. Yes, Europe also has to renegotiate with Mr Erdoğan.

It is a shame that, because of the policies of the European Union, such representatives are now flooding the Greek islands and the Greek hinterland and are being supported by a number of NGOs whose main sponsor is Soros. That is why we call on the Greek government to stop following the instructions of this European Union and to follow the three main proposals of the Greek Solution on illegal immigration, which are sealing the Greek border, transferring all illegal immigrants to uninhabited islands and deporting them and closing all NGOs.

We are, for sure, in a difficult and worrying situation and I’m sorry to say there are no simple solutions. But there are concrete and possible ways forward, and the EU and the Member States have acted quite quickly in solidarity with Greece and in support of those people in need in Greece, and I’m quite proud that we have been able to do that.  I will not repeat what I said in my introductory speech because many of you have asked the same questions that are actually addressed there, but let me just say these things. We need secure external borders. They must be staffed well and managed well. Therefore, Frontex has an important role to play, and it’s important that the standing corps become a reality.  With Member States supporting Greece, the European Union can stand strong because we stand together, but the reason that we can stand strong is because of our values. We must show that the EU holds fast the fundamental rights even in difficult times. The circumstances that the Greek border is under are serious and exceptional, but the right to asylum is a fundamental right and enshrined in the EU Treaty and international law. I expect Greece to comply with fundamental rights and with the right to access the asylum process.  As already mentioned, I’m going to Greece to hold discussions with the Greek Government on Thursday, and the following day the Justice and Home Affairs Council will meet to discuss further initiatives to be taken together. I was asked here about the extra money that we would like to allocate if needed to the Greece Action Plan, and this is of course something that we need to discuss together with Parliament. If necessary, it would be aimed at providing even more money than the first EUR 350 million. Hopefully we can achieve a more stable situation, but we have to be prepared, because what we need is de-escalation, dialogue and concrete actions.  I hear many of you argue for a new deal on migration and asylum to be presented soon – arguing for the importance of getting out of the impasse that we have been in for many years in Council – and for agreement to be reached on a sustainable common European migration and asylum policy with the right balance between solidarity and responsibility. I fully agree with this. Since the von der Leyen Commission took office on 1 December, I have worked very, very hard to find a fresh start for this new agreement that I hope to present after Easter. I have been in dialogue with all 27 Member States – this has involved a lot of travelling but was before the coronavirus, so it was easier – and I have lots of dialogues with Parliament, and I hope for more good dialogue to find a solution that is sustainable for a common European approach, because this is what we really need. To conclude, I would like to say this. Many of you have stressed the importance of relocation of vulnerable (people), especially from the overcrowded camps on the Greek islands. I do share this view. It’s of fundamental importance. Member States have shown strong solidarity (with) and support for Greece that is now under pressure to protect its external borders with Turkey, which are also EU external borders and therefore very important. I now call on the Member States – on all Member States – to show the same solidarity and support towards the vulnerable, the minors, in refugee camps that need to be relocated and welcomed in other Member States.

Firstly, it is necessary for the relevant EU agencies to support the efforts of Member States currently under migratory pressure, in order to strengthen border security and combat people smuggling groups.
