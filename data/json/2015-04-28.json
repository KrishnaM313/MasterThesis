There is a very interesting group dynamic. We come from different parties and have different opinions, we come from different countries and have different priorities but, despite all these differences, we build something. We band together in the process and actually we end up being fairly good friends, despite all the differences.  Even though the Presidency is not here at the moment, I would also like to express my gratitude for the way in which the Presidency has worked, because they made a substantial contribution. I knew that they had had a very bad start in the Council but they did the best they could and, after going left and right, up and down, we eventually succeeded in bringing this very technical, technological and ideological report to the goal.  But there are two things which disturb me. We set out to reduce greenhouse gases and to open up Europe for technological progress. After all the votes in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) we have to ask ourselves whether we actually achieved what we set out to achieve. The honest answer is that actually we did not. We had much higher goals. We had set higher goals to be able to reduce greenhouse gases, to get Europe into a position where we could meet our goals for 2020, 2030 and even for 2050. I am very worried – and I think my fellow shadows are also worried in the same way  – about our ability to reach these goals.  We also set out to open up Europe for technological progress. We found that this was probably a very important goal because, if Europe does not move forward in technological means, it will end up being left on the back burner and being relegated to second, third or fourth place in the world. In this respect we have a systemic shortcoming. We have a blocking minority in the Council and this blocking minority sometimes develops into a dictatorship of the minority where we have Member States that are afraid of the future. When they are afraid of the future, they do not dare to make the right decisions and they therefore put on the handbrake and try to run Europe on the handbrake.  I think this systemic shortcoming in the way in which the Council works is one of the biggest challenges we have. If the Council is not able to see the future and if they are not able to see the light on the horizon then we will not reach our goals. I will be glad to come back after hearing the shadows.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Miguel Arias Cañete", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a satisfaction for me to take part in this debate on the indirect change in land use, or ILUC, as it is known by its acronym. We are faced with a possible agreement that mitigates ILUC while protecting existing industry. In addition, it also shows a clear path for advanced biofuels. This is a significant achievement, and I am aware that it has not been easy. I hope that you will support this agreement and that we will be able to conclude the negotiations. I would like to express my sincere thanks to all members, including those who worked on this dossier with such conviction during the last term, and I am particularly grateful to Mr Torvalds and his negotiating team and Mr La Via for their efforts to get the dossier forward at this final stage. The compromise package is the result of very close negotiations. Thank you also for the excellent cooperation and for giving the Commission many opportunities to share and explain your views.  The compromise package before us today is much stronger than the Council's position at first reading thanks to the determination of this Parliament.  Let me say a few words about the key elements of the engagement package. I shall begin by limiting the contribution that biofuels produced from certain crops can make to the objectives of the Renewable Energy Sources Directive. This is known as the 'roof of biofuels obtained from food crops'. The Commission had initially proposed that this ceiling should be 5%, or half of the target for renewable energy in transport. This level was chosen to protect existing production levels and would mitigate the impact of ILUC while protecting existing industry. The level in the commitment package is set at 7%. It is higher than the European Parliament initially proposed, but it could still mitigate the ILUC. In addition, other elements have been added to strengthen this ceiling. The compromise package seeks to encourage the transition to advanced biofuels, which is very important for our future, as set out in the Communication on an Energy Union. Member States shall set a target for advanced biofuels with a reference value of 0.5 %.  It is true that it is not a binding objective, but it is also true that Member States have a tight deadline to be explicit and to define their level of political ambition in relation to advanced biofuels, and this provides industry with a clear signal, while still being realistic to the Member States. I hope that, together with existing initiatives such as the NER300 and Horizon 2020 Programme, it will help to continue the development of this industry in the European Union. In addition, the commitment package will improve the greenhouse gas performance of biofuels by raising the greenhouse gas savings threshold for new facilities, which must operate with 60% savings compared to fossil fuels. The commitment package also requires fuel suppliers and the Commission to report on estimated ILUC emissions, indicators based on the best available scientific information, which will improve greenhouse gas reporting and increase transparency. And the compromise package also removes one element of the Council's position to which the Commission and Parliament opposed it. I am referring to the extension of multiple accounting for advanced biofuels to the overall objectives of the Renewable Energy Products Directive. This would have weakened the 2020 package, and its elimination is a significant achievement. As a whole, all of these elements contribute to the package being effective in mitigating ILUC, while preparing for a transition to advanced biofuels. Today's biofuels industry is protected, while the advanced biofuels industry in development receives encouraging signals for its future. I know that not everything in the European Parliament's first reading position is reflected in this proposal for a final agreement, but, given the difficulties of this complex dossier, I believe that Parliament has achieved very important achievements.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Christofer Fjellner", "mepid": "28126", "text": "  On the other: Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Torvalds for his excellent work on this report.  I remember when I was new here in the European Parliament almost 11 years ago. At the time, many people said that the targets for renewable energy were too low. There was talk of the EU doing too little and too slowly to promote ethanol. At that time, ethanol was described as the way to heaven, and in Sweden the Green Party/Social Democrats decided that each gas station would have to have a special petrol pump that you could refuel ethanol with. But that was then, because now there's another sound in the bark.  Today, ethanol is described rather as the way to hell, and when we have worked on this report, it is clear that green Members in particular, but also the Socialist Group, have done everything possible to water down the EU's renewable fuel targets. The ethanol, it's going to go away, and the faster the better. Back home, those gas pumps are about to rust.  But biofuels are neither heaven nor hell, and we do not have to choose between food or fuel. You can do both. Biofuels are a necessary part, I would say, of a successful climate policy, especially in all the countries, such as The Hague. sweden, where we have great need for transport.  But one thing is certain, that is that we need stable and long-term rules of the game for renewable fuels, and that is what was at risk if this legislative report had gone wrong. I am therefore pleased that we managed to stop the demands that came from large parts of this house, especially from colleagues on the left and in the Green Group, to phase out this goal and create strict restrictions on the possibility of creating new advanced biofuels. This would have made it very difficult to make biofuels from the forest, but I think that if we succeed in this, we have created a stable playing field. I therefore hope that all Members, especially those who dare to call themselves greens, will vote in favour of the new rules, because if you do not do that, you really only support fossil fuels.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Seb Dance", "mepid": "124952", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, I would also like to extend my thanks to the rapporteur Mr Torvalds for his work in what has often been quite difficult circumstances. We got here in the end, we got a compromise, and I am very grateful to him for all his work.  I think it is very important that we take a moment to consider why we are having this debate and why this issue has been such an area of contention, because we have for many years now seen the effects of particularly bad policy from the European Union when it comes to biofuels. I have seen some of these effects for myself in my previous role working for an NGO in areas of the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where communities have been suffering from some pretty bad effects of the policies that we have been adopting here. In particular: the proliferation of crops for biofuel production for fuel consumption there on land that could and should be used for food production; the betrayal of some local communities whose livelihoods have depended on that land; and of course the unintended consequences of indirect land use change that have resulted from the replacement of ecosystems that would actually have contributed to solving the problem of climate change.  The package that we have now is imperfect and I make no bones about the fact that we have serious reservations, certainly about the target for first-generation production which, as we know, we wanted to be much lower. I think this package certainly reflects the intransigence of Member States, and that has been particularly apparent in the position adopted by the Council when it came to the negotiation process – and also reflects a lack of ambition, if I may say so, from the Commission. However, this is a step forward and we should acknowledge the significance of this, because the impasse that we have had for so long now has not been beneficial for the communities that I have mentioned. It has not been beneficial for the industries that have, with the very best of intentions, set us down this path on the investments that they made so many years ago.  I think that in this package we are choosing, at last, to recognise the existence of indirect land use change and we are giving the Commission the platform to enable itself to apply the science that the blockers have for so long denied.  There are some in this Chamber who would deny some of the bad impacts of biofuels that I have mentioned, and there are others that might choose to play politics and score points on this deal. I think this deal represents a step forward, imperfect as it is, and that is why I shall be supporting it.

Let me also begin by thanking our rapporteur, Nils Torvalds, for his excellent work, especially in view of the stalemate he found here in this House, and given the stalemate with the Council he inherited from his colleague Corinne Lepage, who had done the first reading. Let us be honest: this stalemate with the Member States does not bode well for the future, because we are only talking about the climate targets for 2020. If we can already create a stalemate over that 20%, and if you consider that we will have to go to 80 to 95% CO2 reduction in 30 years' time, that promises very little for the future. The steps we are taking now are really small steps and yet every millimetre is already being fought over. That promises something if we have to take the real big steps. With the current attitude of the Member States in particular, I am convinced that we will not get very far with our climate policy. We are telling ourselves in Europe that we are going to meet the 2020 targets. If I just look at my own country, the Netherlands, I see that now that economic growth is picking up a bit, co2 emissions are suddenly increasing again rather than falling. I therefore think that we need to take a very good look at our policy. Let us now be the subject we are talking about: this small adaptation of the directive on the quality of petrol and diesel fuel and the directive on energy from renewable sources. Making good policy requires courage, especially in today's changing world and especially if it turns out that the existing policy is being overtaken by science, because that means that we have to adapt our policies. We must realise that biofuels are not the holy grail that we held them to a few years ago. These may be advanced biofuels, but we must link sustainability criteria to them and not make the same mistake as in recent years. Because that's what we're threatening to do now.

We all know today that the promotion of first generation biofuels has been extremely difficult, that the European Union has made a nasty mistake and overlooked several fundamental factors in the design of the original directive, which has been reflected in considerable damage to the landscape and the environment, a reduction in food self-sufficiency and an increase in food prices. As shadow rapporteur, I approached the forthcoming change with hope and great anticipation, but the opposite has happened. The first alarming indication that something was not quite right was the constant pressure that was exerted on us on a daily basis by European lobbying, which was more interested than the environment in what raw material or fuel would be supported and where it would count. Nevertheless, thanks to the excellent work of the rapporteur and the work of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we have entered into final negotiations with the Council and the Commission with a very strong document. But what ultimately emerged from it is nothing more than a major defeat for both the European Parliament and, above all, the environment. We have yielded to pressure from the Council and, above all, the Member States, and have resigned to everything essential that the new regulation was supposed to represent. We lost the 6% threshold for first generation biofuels, which was the maximum at the beginning. We have failed to ensure sufficient support for second- and third-generation biofuels by admitting that their share will not be binding. The European Parliament has simply failed to push through almost anything that was originally voted on in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. The resulting text is then basically only a slightly improved version of the original design from 2009. It can be said in good conscience that after almost five years of negotiations, we have achieved nothing substantial. For this reason, I would like to say here that the GUE/NGL Group does not mean to participate in any way in this charade, which at its core means the preserve of the status quo, which is very much disguised as a huge change.  Ladies and gentlemen, the plundering of our landscapes will continue, the current producers will still benefit greatly from this, and we have not been able to prevent this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 9, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Bas Eickhout", "mepid": "96725", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Nils Torvalds, for his work on this file which indeed, as has been stated before, was not an easy file at all. Certainly it was not easy to build up a majority in this House and then undertake negotiations with the Council, and I think we have to thank the rapporteur for all his work in that.  Having said that, I am disappointed with the result but I am more disappointed that the Council is not even present at this discussion. It somewhat shows the problem we are having here, that within the Council the Member States do not really see the problem at hand. That is, I think, a very bad signal they are giving here: that again they are just not showing interest. That was also very clear during the negotiations and I think that is a problem. Why are we discussing this? We set a target of 10% for biofuels in the transport sector, but we all know that, if you look at how it has been developing, it mainly concerns the development of agri-fuels, of first-generation biofuels, which are not delivering the climate benefits that they are supposed to do. That is why we had to do something about it.  The Commission came forward with a proposal trying to cap the first generation at 5%. In Parliament we managed at least to get a deal for a cap at around 6%, but the Member States wanted this to be at 7%. Unfortunately, in the negotiations, we lost this. In the end, we as a parliament, agreed also with the 7% cap which is, from my perspective, way too high, because this is just filling up the target with the bad biofuels which are not the ones that we want to stimulate; we want to stimulate the more advanced ones. That was the second demand of Parliament, that we want advanced biofuels in order to really have innovation in Europe.  Unfortunately, here also the Council did not want anything. In the end, we have a non-binding target for advanced fuels, so that means that there is a very weak signal for stimulating innovation within the European Union. And if you look at the definitions, this term is also poorly defined and now we will probably have a debate where everyone will call his own product ‘advanced biofuel’. Suddenly everyone will be part of that new hype but not really delivering innovation.  The third problem relates to indirect land use change. We wanted clear accounting of indirect land use change and we lost that too; we only have reporting, not accounting. In that sense, from my perspective, we lost too much. We just lost too much as a parliament, and therefore I cannot support this deal.  But the Commissioner is here and I would like to ask what are we going to do after 2020? Are we going to learn from this problem and not set a very inflexible new target but to put the Fuel Quality Directive at centre stage: setting a target on reduction, and not specifically targeting a technology when we do not know exactly how it will develop? Therefore the question: will we continue after 2020 with the Fuel Quality Directive?  If we continue with the directive, we will have a new debate and then I hope that the Council will be present because this is a very important topic. If we do it right we can really have decarbonisation in the transport sector, but if we do it wrong we are stimulating bad technologies and that is what we would like to prevent.

So you have to set your central objective, your decarbonisation, and then have different options for how to play this game. In that sense, what we have been doing now is really focusing on one bad technology that does not deliver; does that mean that we are fixating ourselves on fossil fuels? No, the problem is that now some of these alternatives are even worse for the climate than the fossil fuels, and then we are really stimulating the wrong one.

This can be done without competition with food production, because for example we can develop good raw materials from northern forests and waste and food residues. The European Parliament itself recorded in the residencies that the EU should seek to make use of biofuels made from waste, which can achieve high emission reductions.  Unfortunately, the form under discussion does not give industry a very convincing picture of what needs to be done now. I regret that there was no binding objective for the future. I would therefore like to ask how national implementations can play such a big role? In Finland, ten per cent of that 20 per cent target has already been achieved and in Sweden 17 per cent.

Now it's time to look forward and let me remind you of the general context. The energy union strategy reflects President Juncker's ambition for the European Union to become the world leader in renewable energy, and this strategy undoubtedly outlines a transition for the European energy system, leaving behind the fossil fuel-driven economic model, where energy has a centralized supply-side approach and is based on outdated technologies and business models. For me, renewable fuels that are not based on food crops and have a low carbon footprint, including ILUC, are part of this strategy. The energy union roadmap states that the Commission will present a renewable energy package setting out a comprehensive policy that includes biofuels for the post-2020 period.

We did not fix everything that should be fixed on the earth, and I think Commissioner Arias Cañete will be back with this issue in, let us say, three years’ time, not just because of the Energy Union, but because of the fact that the technological progress we see out there in reality is for the moment very fast and we do not know where it is going to end and what possibilities we will have after two or three years.

Mr President! It is a great day today because we have to adopt this proposal. We are challenged by a truly massive environmental problem: 100 billion of these lightweight plastic carrier bags are spent every year in the EU, and 8 billion of them end up directly in the wild as litter, if not more. We have the figures from the Commission, and this is something that is really harmful to nature and to the seas: to humans, to animals, to fish and to birds. There is only one thing to do about it, and that is to reduce the number. We have now succeeded in achieving something that is actually No 1 in the EU waste hierarchy, namely prevention. This is the first time we have passed a law containing prevention!  According to the Commission's 70% survey, citizens support us taking action. It was therefore really a pity when the Commission's proposal finally came. It was the previous Commission, but on this point it was not much better than the one we have now. It was a lousy proposal we were given that simply contained pious wishes. Fortunately, Parliament took action. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues for their excellent cooperation, first of all Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy, who was with us all the way, and in the second round La Via. In fact, we adopted a very good proposal. Then it was the Council's turn, and here I would like to thank the Italian Presidency. They managed, through excellent efforts, to keep the Council together, so that we now have a joint proposal.  It is short on reducing consumption, either by what I would recommend that countries decide to put a price on these bags. If you do that in 2018, the reduction will be achieved quickly. Ireland is a shining example of a price being put on plastic bags and within five months they achieved a 90% reduction. I have just heard that Portugal is doing something similar. If you do not choose that solution, you can go for the reduction targets. This means going down to 90 bags per capita in 2019 and as much as 40 per head by 2025 - which is a good result.  In this process, the Commission has been a nuisance! (Sorry to a good friend of mine from the Commission who is sitting here). It's worked us out all along. It has come up with all sorts of irrelevant objections so as not to do anything! In fact, it believes that it is up to the countries themselves to do something - but they do not. That is why we have received such good support for it. Despite the effectiveness of these proposals, despite the great economic gain - EUR 740 million a year, we are saving - again according to the Commission's own calculations. In addition to what nature saves, what the oceans save, we also save a lot of money! Nevertheless, right up to the finish line, we had problems with the Commission. I will belatedly forget the face timmermans was wearing when he had to go out and announce that the Commission had decided not to withdraw the proposal.  Finally, let me say that just during the time I have been talking here and talking, just in the four minutes, 750 000 plastic bags have been used in Europe. If you can see nothing more than that, then you can at least see that something has to be done. We are now addressing that. Thank you again to all the good forces in this House and in the Member States that have helped, and I hope that the Commission will also think it will be good to get something done about it.

These bags, as was already mentioned, easily escape waste management streams and accumulate in our environment, often in the form of marine litter. Once discarded, they can last for hundreds of years, often as harmful microscopic particles that threaten the environment worldwide, especially the marine environment in terms of marine litter. The very high and ever-increasing consumption rates of plastic bags – currently some 100 billion bags per year in the EU alone, and up to 200 bags per person per year – also imply a squandering of resources and have become a symbol of a throw-away society and a symbol of unsustainable lifestyles. Lightweight plastic carrier bags that are used once only and then discarded are the example of a ‘linear’ model of dealing with resources. Action is needed. We need to tackle the problem of marine pollution, which is to a great extent caused by plastic waste, and we need to save resources and move to a circular economy. Clearly, this is a global problem, requiring action beyond the EU, but it is important that we do our part. An early second reading agreement on amending the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive to reduce the use of lightweight plastic carrier bags can be formalised today. Looking at the different positions of the co-legislators at the start of the legislative process, it is clear that this has not been an easy task, but thanks to the efforts undertaken by all parties, we now have a compromise on the table. Let me particularly express my gratitude to the rapporteur, Margarete Auken, for her dedicated and thorough work on the Commission’s proposal, as well as to the shadow rapporteurs in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. The Commission welcomes the agreement reached by the co-legislators, even though it includes some elements that would, in the Commission’s view, have been better addressed in a different, and in a much broader context. Nevertheless, this agreement has been possible because we all share the same objective: limiting the consumption and littering of plastic carrier bags.

Let me also start by thanking Mrs Auken and Commission President La Via first. I think we have taken a very serious step to get rid of a very bad habit in Europe. From the consumer habit that Commissioner Vella mentioned. We need to get rid of it, because we throw away 90% of these plastic bags and practically 8 billion plastic bags a year – and we have not yet drawn attention to this – become rubbish in nature, we do not know where it goes. It's just a scandal, it's our scandal. This proposal is trying to rid us of that. It is obviously a compromise, but we can show that it is really possible to deal with something that everyone in Europe is interested in in a citizen-friendly way.  And, as the reporting woman has said, there have obviously been solutions in several countries, and in fact I would like to highlight one thing: there is a choice. A choice can be made between the fact that, indeed, as in my country, a product fee will be introduced in Hungary in 2011, thereby reducing plastic bags radically or otherwise starting to fill and reduce the quota. It is very important that no one is left out of this, and it is still a compromise, because we know that we have not yet found a solution under a certain number, under 15 microns, we need to continue working and we have seen what interests are still there against it, but I certainly think that is very important. This alone is not enough, we need a cleaner, liveable European environment, and in fact we, too, have given the decision not only to governments, but also to European consumers.

What we are bringing home today, after a negotiation that has been going on for some time and which has been unblocked under the Italian Presidency, as has been mentioned, is a very important measure that goes beyond its specific merit, which is, as we mentioned, to force the Member States to reduce the use of light plastic bags, which are considered to be one of the factors of pollution in general and the first factor in the pollution of the sea.  But it takes on an aspect, let me say, symbolic in my opinion. Because? If European waste legislation has been set at '4 R', which is the basis for proper and effective sustainable management, the first 'R', the reduction of waste production, has not always worked. On the contrary, we have data in Europe which, after the crisis, show us that the quantities of waste have increased in recent years, not least because of the inability to implement serious prevention policies. This measure starts from there, that is, for the first time we are going to act on the first level of the waste hierarchy, we are going to tell the States that they must reduce waste production with a mandatory target with the introduction of a price.  I now move on to the other key point of the measure. With this directive, the European Union is equips itself with an important instrument to advance the circular economy, the new frontier of the sustainable economy. The new rules, through the reduction of waste, in this case light potato bags, go at the same time to promote a more effective and efficient use of resources with a positive impact on the entire economy. In fact, we move from products of simple use, disposable, typical of a linear economy, to the need instead of finding alternative solutions, less impactful for resources and the environment and that also stimulate new green technologies, for example the green chemistry supply chain, to the production and research on organic bags, one of the virtuous challenges of the green economy.  I will end by saying that this is an important process that must go ahead, as we undertake to do as soon as possible with the new, more ambitious proposal that the Commission will present on the waste cycle.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 73, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Julie Girling", "mepid": "96956", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur. I welcomed the Commission proposal when it was first launched, as I believe absolutely that we need to tackle the issue of plastic waste, particularly plastic bags, in the environment. The Commission proposal, when it came, was relatively flexible and it set out a variety of options for Member States to pursue, but as a result of amendments here, the final agreement lacks flexibility and contains a number of overly prescriptive and, in my view, potentially unworkable requirements. I cannot support the requirement for the adoption of a label for biodegradable and home-compostable bags without an impact assessment, given the possible additional administrative burden for the Member States and economic operators. There are certain provisions which I believe would have been better addressed in the context of the follow-up to the Commission Green Paper on plastic waste, such as the report on the use of oxo-biodegradable bags. I have concerns that the possibility to vary the measures taken towards plastic bags, based on their environmental impact or other properties, could be problematic as regards the principle of non-discrimination and proportionality, as well as the possible impact on the smooth functioning of the single market. Should Member States opt to achieve the reduction target in the ‘either/or’ scenario, they would need to meet the levels predetermined by the directive. I cannot support this approach, as these levels were set in the absence of statistical consumption data for all Member States. Lastly, Mrs Auken has said that we need to do something because countries are not doing it themselves. This is patently not the case because, whilst all of this was going on, my own Member State was objecting to the lack of flexibility but, at the same time, putting forward its own measures for reducing plastic bags, which are in fact now statute. So it simply is not the case that if Europe does not do it, Member States will not: they do, and they do it at their own pace, and that is the best way to do legislation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 74, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy", "mepid": "96940", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, even in the most remote places of this planet, hardly any seabird is being found without plastic in its stomach.

We all know that plastic bags are one of the major causes of this huge plastic pollution, and many of these birds, fish, turtles and other marine animals have fragments of the 100 billion European plastic bags that we use annually in their stomachs.  But despite these devastating figures there is good news. Actually, there are two parts this. First of all, this huge environmental problem is relatively easy to solve and, secondly, there is huge public support for the measures to solve this problem. Therefore, the result that we are discussing today is, I think, an example of very good European policy-making. We have seen a strongly united European Parliament, thanks to a very good rapporteur, Ms Auken – whom I thank – but also because we had a Presidency, Italy, that was not just focusing on avoiding problems between Member States but that actually wanted to solve a problem, which is, unfortunately, something rather unique from the Council side.

For this result, we would like to thank the rapporteur, Margrete Auken, very much for this result.   Reducing the overconsumpation of plastic bags is a contribution to changing the way we buy and consume in Europe, in short, we are countering disposable Europe. In recent years, we have actually pushed gue for even stricter legislation than an agreement that has been reached here, aimed at eliminating 50% of the consumption of plastic bags within three years in order to reach 100% within five years.  Furthermore, there is no ban on oxo-biodegradable additives in the text, the danger of which we continue to denounce. In short, as is often the case with urgent environmental issues, we are still responding too long. At the same time, the compromise reached contains one fundamental element for us: the obligation for Member States to monitor the state of implementation of the legislation on the basis of a common methodology and controls entrusted to the European Commission.

Today we will vote on the new European strategy to reduce plastic bags for the next adoption by our Assembly. It is true that these bags can take up to four centuries before they begin to degrade, and the oceans are asphyxiated by their particles. Composed, in particular, of petroleum-based polyethylenes, plastic bags are a wound to the environment, as has been said, a real poison, and major measures had to be taken to curb this massive pollution. It is now done. There will, indeed, be a reduction: today, 200 plastic bags are consumed per capita; this figure will rise to 90 by 2019 and 40 in ten years. Then we will end the free plastic bags for food by 2018. The task has not been easy, as too often when it comes to protecting our health and our ecosystem, water being at the heart of the problem we are addressing today. But we could have gone further, because, as they say in French, the devil hides in the details. I am talking about the so-called oxobiodegradable bags, as my colleague mentioned. In reality, they are not biodegradable: they fragment into millions of microparticles and they increase the risk at the level of ecosystems. This means, Commissioner, that tomorrow, when you eat oysters, you will find microparticles in these oysters and in the water they contain. The Commission could have gone much further by banning, precisely, these so-called oxobiodegradable bags.

Given the disparity in situations in the different Member States, I believe that the possibility given to them to decide between reducing this consumption to 40 bags per person per year by 2025, or paying for the consumption of these bags, which must come into force by the end of 2018 is important.

First of all, we consider this report to be a step in the right direction, but unfortunately it is not enough. Especially on the issue of so-called 'self-breaking plastic bags', I think the measures we want to take are inadequate. Some were treasured for promoting the material as supposedly environmentally friendly, at the same time as causing terrible ecological damage. I therefore believe that we should propose a total ban on their use. My view is that we need to move towards banning thin and very thin plastic bags, keeping only those that are thick enough to be reusable. In fact, I believe that the consumer should pay a price for their acquisition, a practice that is already in place in some countries of the Union. As far as their replacement is concerned, we must return to the use of paper bags, and exclusively recyclable.

In fact, I'll even say that in the 1980s I worked in an industry like that.

Plastic bags are, of course, a great habitat for consumers and, on the other hand, an exceptional advertising space for traders. Therefore, of course, these measures, which are provided for in the directives, may probably be a little more difficult to achieve in the directives and targets than we think. Above all, there's something to know. If people and consumers knew what the consequences of dumped plastic were, they would certainly have acted differently. Therefore, of course, people need to be told the truth about plastic, and not therefore the plastic truth. I think the numbers are horrific. If 90 per cent of bags are used only once, it means that the waste is only accumulating and is actually bathed in plastic. And each country can do the most by raising awareness by persuading plastics to be harmful to the environment.

A number of examples already mentioned, outlining the measures some Member States have taken to curb the use of lightweight plastic carrier bags, do prove that action is effective. As an example, Ms Auken mentioned Ireland. Another example is Scotland where early figures from retailers show that single-use carrier bag usage has fallen by more than 80% since a charge was introduced last October. These are just a few, and not the only Member States that have actually taken action.  Once this amendment to the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive is adopted and has entered into force, Member States will have the tools available for effective action. They are responsible for the crucial task of implementation. The first step they have to take is to choose from among the instruments available to them to reduce the use of plastic carrier bags.  I would also like to add that this directive addresses a major problem at source from a preventive perspective, and I have to say that the more preventive action we take today the less remedial action we will need tomorrow – especially in terms of marine litter, as was mentioned several times by a number of the Members of this Parliament. As many also mentioned, marine litter is a huge environmental problem threatening mainly, but not only, our marine biodiversity. I would say that this is a global problem needing a global solution. Today we are only talking about the EU consumption of plastic bags but the problem is much bigger than that. I can assure everyone here that we will continue to take this problem very seriously and monitor it accordingly. The new directive also entrusts the Commission with a number of tasks, such as the development of a methodology for calculating the annual per capita consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags, the development of labels or marks to ensure Union-wide recognition of biodegradable and compostable plastic carrier bags, and assessing the impact of the use of oxo-degradable plastic carrier bags on the environment. We will tackle these tasks without delay with a view to meeting the – frankly more than challenging – deadlines agreed in the compromise. The compromise reached is an important step forward in addressing the issue of plastic waste, endorsed by overwhelming public support.

I hope it will not be the last, although we might fear that, but this here should be our first.  It is a historic day as we managed to get so much support from this Parliament and the Member States in order to bring about a clear reduction. Flexibility is still built into it, although it is not as flexible as originally proposed by the Commission, which was the kind of flexibility where they did nothing but just hoped.

I am so happy that you promise to live up to the expectations in our proposal in order to achieve good figures. For instance, I think the figures from Denmark are far too optimistic. Just two days ago I had to decline five of these lightweight plastic bags which were just handed out to me. So I think the actual figures are much more than four annually per inhabitant, but they are still good figures and there is flexibility.  Again let me repeat here that we are not talking about a ban, because plastic bags can be reusable. We are talking about a reduction and if you put a price – not a tax, but a price – on each bag we know that the consumers will ask themselves whether they really need to pay 50 cents or whatever it might be and they might remember that they have pockets or bring their own bag with them. They might have a reusable plastic bag or a cotton bag. They are not that idiotic. It is good if they get into new habits. We have seen it.  I would like to thank everybody. This is historic.

Action to reduce the usage of plastic bags in Scotland by the SNP Government has already proven to be enormously successful, with figures at the end of 2014 showing a massive 90% reduction in plastic bag usage. Under these new rules, which I trust will be approved by MEPs, Member States would be able to choose between two policy options: to either take measures to ensure that average yearly consumption of these bags does not exceed 90 lightweight bags per citizen by 2019 and 40 by 2025, or alternatively, to ensure that, by 2018, they are not handed to shoppers free of charge. Plastic bags are not biodegradable and are especially harmful to marine animals. That is why targeted action is essential to making a difference, as Scotland’s experience proves. These measures will make many consumers get into the habit of reusing bags, which should reduce the amount of litter that blights our communities and natural environment, and costs a fortune to clean up.

The transport sector accounts for around a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union, just after the energy sector. In 2012, greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector were allocated between road transport with a majority of 72 % of the total against 12.8 % for civil aviation, less than 1 % for rail transport and 13.9 % for the total of the navigation sector.  Between 1990 and 2007, CO2 emissions in sectors other than transport decreased, while in this sector their increase was around 36 %. Although the economic crisis has contributed to the slowdown in greenhouse gas emissions, we have already seen the first signs that these emissions are increasing again.  Contrary to what has happened in other forms of transport, the maritime transport sector has remained the only one not subject to any measure to reduce CO2 emissions. In view of this, the 2020 energy and climate framework provides for a review clause for the inclusion of maritime transport in the Union's reduction targets in the event that an international agreement is not reached in the meantime.  In this plenary session we will pass legislation which represents a first step towards reducing such emissions, which represent around 4 % of CO2 emissions at European Union level. Contrary to those that are the objectives of decarbonising the European economy in the medium and long term, if nothing is done, greenhouse gas emissions by ships will increase by more than 50 % by 2050.  The adoption at second reading of this regulation will, in my view, meet three important policy objectives: firstly, this European legislative initiative applies to all vessels climbing European ports and will provide an opportunity to influence negotiations at the level of the International Maritime Organisation regulating this sector. Regardless of the progress made in this forum, in setting emission reduction targets is somewhat disappointing, the truth is that cooperation with our international partners is essential in terms of climate policy and the European Union once again takes the leading position in this area. We will continue our efforts and this is one of those steps towards achieving an ambitious agreement of an international nature. Secondly, this legislation will combine the monitoring of CO2 emissions with energy efficiency data from ships and the transparency of these data. On an annual basis, the European Commission will now provide the market with reliable information on the energy consumption and efficiency of ships.  In this way, we can remove barriers for the sector to adopt technical and operational measures that will reduce CO2 emissions into lower net costs, i.e. around EUR 1.2 billion/year, as well as greater competitiveness of European maritime transport, which will benefit international trade. Finally, this legislation will have the potential to create around 10,000 jobs in green technology areas linked to the maritime sector, as well as public health benefits related to lower emissions of other pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and suspended fine particles. I therefore believe, ladies and gentlemen, that a robust system of monitoring, information and verification of emissions is a precondition and a cornerstone for any other emission reduction measure that will be determined for this sector in the near future. Finally, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs who have worked with me on this dossier, Colleagues Cristopher Fjellner, Jytte Guteland, Julie Girling, Bas Eickout, Josu Juaristi Abaunz and Marco Affronte, as well as President Giovanni La Via and Vice-President Benedek Jávor, for their excellent cooperation.

I am also grateful for the work of the previous rapporteur, Mr Skylakakis, and that of the other rapporteurs in the shadow of this dossier. The Regulation on the monitoring, reporting and verification of CO2 emissions from maritime transport is consistent with the policy framework adopted for 2030 on energy and climate. Maritime transport should not be the only unregulated economic sector in this area and should contribute to the fight against climate change. The introduction of transparency, based on reliable and robust data, will help mobilize the industry's exceptional remaining potential to reduce its emissions at very low cost or even without costs. And this means that the additional costs arising from monitoring, reporting and verification will undoubtedly be covered by subsequent savings in terms of fuel expenditure. I must stress that the European Union's primary interest is to find global solutions to maritime emissions and that the European Union will therefore continue to drive progress in discussions within the International Maritime Organization. In this regard, the Monitoring, Notification and Verification Regulation signals an important political signal for the next session of the IMO Committee, which will discuss global data collection and be held in London next May, and also with a view to the United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in Paris in December 2015. The Commission welcomes the text presented by the Council, which reflects the agreement reached in the three-way dialogues; this text strikes a delicate balance between collecting the most relevant data for the sector and imposing the least administrative burden possible. On the one hand, rationality in the approach is maintained by covering only CO2 emissions, but, on the other hand, in line with what is discussed at international level, the monitoring covers energy efficiency parameters in which significant improvements agreed by the Council and the European Parliament have been incorporated. Increasing transparency on energy efficiency in the sector should enable the adoption of emission mitigation measures by the sector and, moreover, this Regulation ensures that, where agreement is reached on a legal framework for a future measure applicable at the global level, we can adapt our monitoring system. Finally, the proposed agreement, as I pointed out above, is a very important signal of the European Union with a view to the preparation of the Paris Conference, indicating that we are committed to actions to combat climate change and that, at the same time, we promote greater international progress in the case of maritime emissions, mainly within the International Maritime Organization.

More than ninety per cent of world trade is transported by sea.  Not only is shipping cost-effective, it is above all also environmentally efficient, because although it accounts for such a large proportion of transport, it accounts for just under 3% of global CO2 emissions. Nevertheless, shipping must be involved in taking climate responsibility, and that is why I am glad that we are now taking the first step in bringing shipping into european climate policy.  I hope that this will enable us to speed up the process that is going on in the International Maritime Organisation in order to get the rest of the world to follow our example. Shipping needs global rules to work because it is a global industry. For me who has negotiated this on behalf of my group, it has been particularly important to ensure that the new rules on shipping are cost-effective and do not impair the competitiveness of shipping. After all, any new burden that we are imposing on shipping risks using less eras, moving things to, for example, trucks, and it will be particularly serious if we believe that the rest of the world should follow our example. Therefore, I am a little extra proud of two victories that I understand that I have pushed for and received a hearing in this work.  The first is that we should focus on CO2 – and the proposal that we are adopting today focuses on CO2 – which is the most important and most serious climate gas in this context. The second is that we are focusing on the larger ships, and that we exclude smaller ships that account for forty per cent of our fleet but only emit 10%. It is crucial to make this cost-effective, and we have heard of that.  It is now a matter of Sweden and other countries pushing in the IMO so that we also get the rest of the world with us, because all the world's ships must of course take the same responsibility for the climate as the European ships do after this decision.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 132, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Matthias Groote", "mepid": "34728", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group.

Of course, at the moment we are only discussing the monitoring of international shipping, and we all know that international shipping is one of the few sectors which is not regulated for CO2 at all. In that sense, a first step of monitoring and reporting on the CO2 impact is of course a good start, but it is only a start. I am also very happy that, in the deal we have, there is an obligation for the Commission to have biannual reporting on the full climate impact: shipping is more than just CO2, and it is good that the Commission will also report on that biannually.

Maritime transport is a vital sector for the world economy, given that more than 80% of goods are transported by ships. Sea transport is also the most environmentally efficient and environmentally sustainable mode of transport of goods, given that the CO2 emissions required to transport one tonne of goods per kiloser at sea are lower than transport by both road and air. However, over the last ten years, we have seen a 48% increase caused by maritime transport of greenhouse gas emissions, which has contributed significantly to the pollution of our planet.  Today's vote, following an agreement reached in December, following important negotiations with the Italian Presidency, shows once again how the European Parliament is showing great attention to sustainability issues by setting an EU system for monitoring, communicating and verifying CO2 emissions from maritime transport, as a basis for facilitating the setting of reduction targets at a later stage and for the application of a market-based measure , which could take the form of a contributory or objective-based compensation fund, or an emissions trading scheme that will be able to ensure a reduction in CO2 emissions in maritime transport.

Maritime transport, as has been said here today, is not part of the EU's commitment to reducing CO2 emissions, despite the fact that shipping and its emissions have actually increased a great deal. It is incredibly important, I think, to ensure that shipping as an industry also contributes to our climate policy. It is important that we make an effort to get shipping companies to want to invest in energy-efficient ships also for the sake of climate policy. That is why what we are going to vote on today is a good thing, because with the new EU system for monitoring and reporting and verifying CO2 emissions from ships calling at European ports, we will have a system that will be able to provide us with good data. With this data, we will be able to get a better overview of how much the sector is emitting in the long term, and so hopefully we can also hopefully tighten the rules on how much we allow them to emit. It is important for me also to say that it is gratifying that in this work we have not only looked at the size of the ships, but that we have also taken into account how much goods they transport. Of course, it also has an impact on CO2 emissions. However, this is only one step. This is a step in the right direction, but it is still only one step.

This sector accounts for 4% of the EU's total greenhouse gas emissions. This share is increasing and will increase further in the coming years, not only in the EU but also globally. There is therefore an objective reason to make the necessary efforts in this mode of transport. Reliable and comparable data must always form the basis of a well-thought-out policy.

I am a great advocate of integrated maritime policy – many people know this – and it is the case that the sea will be used much more economically in the future. It is particularly important to protect not only biodiversity, but also the climate. Ship traffic will increase. That is what everyone is saying – globally – and it is the big ships that are causing emissions. We want to record them now, and then we will report on them.

I certainly see it that way. Ship owners will have to report. It is good that the ALDE has succeeded in simplifying this reporting procedure in comparison with the Commission proposal, that there is transparency in it and that it is also possible to take out very sensitive economic data. In general, I have to say that I very much welcome the fact that we, as Europe, are now once again going ahead and trying to influence the IMO. We absolutely need that!

I could talk at length about the specific characteristics of the Baltic Sea, but it is particularly important here in Parliament's legislative work to remember the fact that the Baltic Sea is dominated by an ice cap that lasts for months in winter. Safe shipping is always conditional on the ice resistance of ships in winter conditions, which in practice means more steel, while at the same time reducing the energy efficiency of ships.

That is why this Regulation is important, as it casts an unequivocal signal of what we want in the framework of the next session of the International Maritime Organization, to be held next May in London, and also for the Paris Climate Change Conference at the end of the year. The implementation of a regional data monitoring, reporting and verification system in the European Union, in addition to direct positive effects, is also a useful experience and provides a technical vision for international negotiations. When discussing these issues on a global scale, our experience will identify solutions that have already been implemented.

In my opinion, we should not use a single system for first generation biofuels, we must take into account the natural conditions and potential of some Member States. For example, in most of the new Member States, it remains possible not to use the land used for the production of food for the production of biofuels, but on the one hand to produce falllagen and, on the other hand, to increase yields. According to a study published in January 2015 by the University of Utrecht, huge amounts of biofuel can be produced without increasing the risk of indirect land use change (ILUC). In the 3 Member States examined (Hungary, Romania, Poland), 1.3% of the total energy use of the EU transport sector in 2020 could be extracted with low ILUC biofuels, while the area under consideration accounts for only 6% of the total EU production area. According to the same study, some 1.2-5.2 billion litres of bioetanol could be produced from maize in Hungary, which would have no negative impact on the use of farmland.  In these countries, large quantities of biofuel can be produced without compromising food production, increasing yields and mapping areas.

According to (not entirely reliable) scientific data, the indirect land-use change (ILUC) effect is expected to result in a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions achieved through the use of biofuels.

Statistics are very important for understanding and interpreting reality, particularly when we consider the role they have played in economic and monetary policy decisions in recent years. The calculation of the unemployment, poverty and inflation rates are just some of the most significant examples of their important contribution to European and national economic policies.  There were three guidelines around which this relationship was built. The first is to increase the quality of unemployment and the transparency of European statistics. The second concerns the appointment of the head of Eurostat, which is highly controversial and which has managed to be resolved by involving Parliament during the decision-making process. Together with this important issue, it has also been ensured that the selection process for heads of national statistical institutes is standardised at European level, thus ensuring an increase in quality and transparency.

By the end of the century, this had led to over-exploitation of herds, as can be seen from more than 400,000 tonnes caught each year in the early 1980s to around 40,000 tonnes ten years later. In recent decades, studies have shown that overfishing concerns dozens of fish species living in the Baltic Sea, which threatens their extinction and biodiversity imbalance. Therefore, the common fisheries policy (established in the 1970s as part of the common agricultural policy and formally in place since 1983) is intended to manage EU fish stocks and to ensure a fair income and a level playing field for fishermen from the Member States. As herring, cod and sprat are the main fish species caught in the Baltic Sea, the proposed multiannual plan for these stocks has become multi-species.

Student mobility, for example, is even seen as a positive thing in EU-sceptical circles.  Both in the structure of new education and at work, education is seen as key to improving the employment situation in Europe. This is very understandable and worth supporting. However, it is important that the role of the Bologna Process as a measure aimed at quality assurance and better recognition of qualifications at European level remains clear. Bologna, or other elements and objectives of education policy, must not be subjudalise to employment policy or its instruments. It is particularly positive that, according to the report, the objectives of the process must be achieved before new ones are defined. It is also important to recognise that the effects of the Bologna Process have been positive.

This is confirmed by the fact that we have more and more highly educated young people who cannot find their place in the labour market.

The first step is to harmonize national systems by generalising a division into three cycles and, since 2007, to implement quality assurance in both institutions and training. The goals of lifelong learning and mobility are constantly being reminded. The Bologna process aims at a commodification of higher education, a reduction in social justice, a loss of intellectual autonomy of institutions and a possible shortening of certain studies.

Therefore, in the upcoming period it is necessary to upgrade the Bologna system through the objectives of this resolution.

This is voluntary cooperation between states, so reforms are implemented at different paces and to varying degrees. In relation to Slovakia, it is important to note that the two-tier system of education – the division of study into bachelor's and master's degrees – has not yet fulfilled its purpose. Bachelor's degree does not prepare graduates for the labour market, most of them continue with master's degrees.  We also have gaps in student mobility. We are the country from which most students go to study abroad, but we are failing to attract foreign students to our universities. Studying at a foreign university is still not a reality for many students whose families are unable to finance costs not covered by student grants. The recognition of credits also remains problematic.  When studying in higher education, there is still a strong social filter.

Moreover, the competitiveness of the European film sector must now be based on the development of innovative services, such as legal video-on-demand services, as they improve the cross-border availability and distribution of European films, but also effectively combat piracy.  Finally, in order to perpetuate the diversity of European cinema, it is necessary to encourage the large-scale digitisation of European films, as well as their increasing availability in original subtitled versions. By making all of these points political priorities in his report, Mr Wenta lays the foundations for better exploitation of the potential of the European film industry.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1845, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Aymeric Chauprade (NI)", "mepid": "124752", "text": "  In writing.

Therefore, to continue along the lines of what is being committed to the European Film Forum, to provide for an increase in incentives for the market and marketing of the European audiovisual sector in the world, to allow access to the financial guarantee instrument for filmmakers and to launch and promote by all means festivals and events that widen the links of the visibility of our cinema , as well as supporting legal offers on the net (streaming or video on demand) are therefore all operations that I feel I fully support so that our culture can increase the great works of cinema and above all can spread and reach beyond our borders, talking about Europe and investing in it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1879, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Arne Gericke (ECR)", "mepid": "124815", "text": "  Writing.

The European Commission's position placed a strong emphasis on promoting a model favourable to the big industry and focused on the co-financing of film production. This Resolution dodges the most controversial points when it comes to the business model.

Secondly, because of the need to safeguard the ecosystem. The presence of \"healthy\" forests is able to avoid natural disasters such as avalanches, landslides and floods. And finally, because even though more than 50% of forests are privately owned, the presence of forests benefits all citizens.  Forests therefore have an ecological, economic and social function, even if they are less and less well known. The European Union should therefore implement the strategy soon, not to impose new bureaucracy and new obligations, but rather to promote knowledge of forests and to shorten the distance between cities and rural areas.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2058, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Sylvie Goddyn (NI)", "mepid": "21331", "text": "  In writing.

Forests cannot change as rapidly as the climate is changing now, so in many areas of Europe, different types of trees are starting to disappear. There are more favorable conditions for the spread of diseases and pests, and extreme weather phenomena make forests even more vulnerable. Measures to adapt forestry to climate change should be included in each forest management plan. We should develop European forests that are ready to withstand the challenges of climate change by achieving the widest possible naturalness of forests (diverse and heterogeneous forests).", "language": "en", "original_language": "lt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2132, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Fernando Ruas (PPE)", "mepid": "124730", "text": "  in writing.

Sustainable forest management also enables the economic exploitation of forests, even more extensively than at present. Sustainably managed forests are the source of renewable energy, the creator of growth and jobs, and the engine of rural development. It is important to invest in research and product development in the field. For example, we should increase wood construction in Europe. Although the member states have the power to take decisions on forestry policy, as they should be, the national forest databases of the various Member States should be merged at European level.

The recent terrorist attacks in Brussels, Paris and Copenhagen shocked us all. Europeans were united in the response to terror. We will fight terrorism jointly and we will stand firm in defending European values, freedoms and the rule of law.  Instability in Europe’s neighbourhood and radicalisation in our societies at home mean that the terrorist threat is real and present. Organised crime groups continue their illicit activities and will find ways to exploit evolving technologies, changes in the economy and societal developments to make money by robbing law-abiding communities, by the trafficking of people, drugs and firearms, or by facilitating illegal migration or any number of cross-border criminal activities.  The internet and e-commerce offer huge advantages for Europeans as individuals and for our companies, but it is also a new playground for cyber- criminals. These criminal activities increasingly feed each other: a terrorist cyber-attack on critical infrastructure, firearms trafficking that provides weapons for criminals, and drugs money that ends up financing terrorism. Dirty money is the fuel that keeps all these criminal activities going.  These criminal and terrorist networks also operate very effectively across borders, so whilst national security remains primarily a matter for Member States, there is clear added value in European cooperation to address the nexus between these criminal activities. Today, we present a European security agenda which updates and renews the former internal security strategy, and I call on this House and on Member States to sign up to it and share it as our agenda for working better together on security. Because in this area, no single European country is able to effectively tackle the challenges on its own.  Over the past decade the EU, with great help from this House, has put in place a European security framework for information exchange, for operational cooperation, for pooling of knowledge and expertise, for better coordination, including via European agencies such as Europol and Eurojust. It is a framework that complements and enhances the essential work that national authorities do every day and helps them to be more effective in fighting cross-border crime and terrorism.  There have been numerous success stories. In 2014, Operation Archimedes brought thousands of police officers from several Member States together in a joint one-week exercise which delivered impressive results: 1 150 criminals arrested, out of them 90 human traffickers and 170 facilitators to illegal immigration; one million euros in cash seized and tonnes of various types of drugs seized. This is just one example of what can be achieved when law enforcement follows a multidisciplinary and multinational approach.  But our analysis suggests that Member States are still under-using this framework for coordination, information exchange and cooperation. There is still mistrust and reticence to cooperate even more closely by using the tools in place to the full. We need to change the culture and modus operandi of our law enforcement community. So the most important message of the agenda is that, together, we need to make an effort to be more effective in providing security to our citizens. The Lisbon Treaty has given us the right basis by bringing this area into the normal Treaty structure, and giving this House the responsibility which you are effectively seizing, to co-decide legislation and exercise democratic scrutiny in this area. Working better together means also in full compliance with fundamental rights and respecting the principles of necessity and proportionality. Our agenda is very concrete and detailed on what needs to be done. As this House has suggested in its resolution on the future internal security strategy, the focus is on the better use or sharpening of the existing instruments before proposing new ones.  Firstly, we have a number of ongoing legislative proposals that need to be agreed by the co-legislators as soon as possible – the reform of Europol, Eurojust, and CEPOL, as well as data protection reform, without forgetting EU PNR and PNR sharing agreements with third countries.  Secondly, we have identified a number of legislative instruments that need to be reviewed – our 2008 terrorism framework decision, which currently does not cover foreign fighters, and our Firearms Directive which the ongoing evaluation shows is clearly not stringent enough. It is unacceptable that a Kalashnikov can be bought easily on the internet. We also need to update our main legal tool in fighting fraud and counterfeiting non-cash means of payment, which dates back to 2001, to today’s reality in financial payments, virtual money included. If we want to be ahead of fast-evolving environmental crimes, we will need to have a fresh look at the legislative framework on sanctions. The exploratory work, as requested by co-legislators, on the non-conviction-based confiscation of criminally acquired property, will also continue. The existing criminal record sharing database needs to be improved, because we need to share these data better so that we can also cover third-country nationals who have committed crime in Europe.  As you see, there is quite a lot of work on the table, also for the European Parliament, so anybody who complains that Timmermans is not giving you enough work, please look at this agenda. Thirdly, the agenda will require extra effort from the full national and European law enforcement community to transform it into operational reality. We need more sharing of data, effective operational cooperation and additional trust—building measures. In particular we should develop judicial cooperation to complement law enforcement cooperation. The existing European agencies need to be sufficiently equipped and work together more closely. The Commission will align the available financial resources to the priorities of the agenda.  Whilst this framework is of course suited to tackling all sorts of threats to internal security, given today’s challenges we need to focus our attention on the three challenges I have mentioned – terrorism, organised crime and cybercrime. The challenges are not new but they have become more varied and complex. We need to do better. Our existing law enforcement tools and cooperation methods are not sufficient. We need to do better.  Both the European Parliament and the national parliaments will be part of the monitoring process of the implementation of the agenda. We are proposing a twice-yearly discussion with this House on the implementation of the agenda. Such a regular joint stocktaking will allow us to be more forward-looking and easily adaptable to evolving situations. I think it is now important, if you permit, Mr President, that I hand over to Dimitris Avramopoulos who is primarily responsible for this file as Commissioner.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2178, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members I am particularly happy to present to you here in the European Parliament the Agenda, as adopted by the Commission just three minutes ago. It could not be fresher!  The European citizens expect from all of us that we work together, in a coordinated way, in order to ensure their security and protect their rights and freedom. They expect from us that we trust each other, share information and effectively work together to coordinate concrete actions and operations. Because new and complex security threats have emerged, that are increasingly cross-border and cross-sectorial in nature, we cannot but face them together. This is the meaning of the shared Agenda that we put to your and to Member States’ consideration. It is a common Agenda based on principles and priorities, on which we should all – Parliament, Member States, the Commission and its Agencies – play our role in ensuring our citizens’ security. That is why we are asking you to evaluate and endorse this agenda. We will have the opportunity of debating and working together on each specific element of this Agenda in the next five years, but today I think it is important to agree on a common European Agenda on Security in order to meet citizens’ expectations. The Agenda sets out five key principles that should guide EU action on security. Firstly, full compliance with fundamental rights. Secondly, transparency, accountability and democratic control for citizens’ confidence. The European Parliament plays a key role in this. Thirdly, better application and implementation of existing instruments, as this House has as well requested many times, before assessing whether additional EU tools are necessary, in full compliance with the principles of necessity and proportionality. Fourthly, full use of EU agencies and all EU policies that contribute – directly or indirectly – to security. Fifthly, to bring together all internal and external dimensions of security with a targeted coordination of our internal and foreign policies. For instance, we will present a consistent EU approach for all future PNR requests from third countries. The Agenda sets out concrete actions to turn these key principles into a political reality. For example, in December 2014, this House adopted a resolution on what it considered the necessary elements of an EU strategy on internal security and you made clear that the utmost priority was to use better the existing instruments, both at legislative and operational level. We have listened very carefully and put this principle into action in this Agenda. Look for example to our proposal for enhancing the existing capacities of Europol. It is not a question of creating new information networks, but to make sure that all information already available in the Member States is also put at the disposal of Europol, under its strict framework for data protection. The Centre would therefore assemble in one single structure the functions already existing in the Agency on terrorist financing, illicit trafficking of firearms and foreign terrorist fighters, as well as on detection of violent extremist content online. Eurojust will also be associated with the Centre. This new capacity will support more effectively the action of Member States in their investigations and prosecutions of terrorist cases. This is our main goal: to make sure that the Agency is able to fully implement its mandate. Let me now present the three main priorities we will address in the next five years. Firstly, tackling terrorism. As you will see, we will not only work on repressive measures but we will also focus on prevention. Social cohesion policy, education, employment, justice, but also the cooperation with key third countries, are crucial for the EU response to address the root causes of extremism and radicalisation. The Commission will set up a Centre of Excellence to collect and disseminate expertise on anti-radicalisation, building upon the Radicalisation Awareness Network. This will strengthen the exchange of experience among practitioners directly engaged in preventing radicalisation and violent extremism at local level. We plan to update the Framework Decision on Terrorism: to provide a more coherent legal framework to deal with the foreign fighters phenomenon. This will allow for intensified cooperation with third countries on this issue. We will also launch an EU Forum with major IT companies to counter terrorist propaganda on the Internet and in social media. Secondly, disrupting organised crime: we go through various forms of organised crime linked by one principle: cutting the financing of criminals. The cooperation between competent authorities in Europe, in particular national Financial Intelligence Units, which will be connected to Europol, will be strengthened while we will assess the necessity of new legislation to counter terrorist financing and improve confiscation of property derived from criminal activities. We plan to strength the legal framework on firearms to address the illegal trafficking and reactivation of weapons, to establish common standards, share more information and boost cooperation with third countries. And I cannot today refrain from mentioning our priority to fight the organised criminals exploiting the need of some people for protection and better life perspectives, in other words, smugglers and traffickers. Thirdly, fighting cybercrime: one of our priorities is to assess whether the current tools for the law-enforcement authorities are sufficient to address online investigations notably on issues of competent jurisdiction and rules on access to internet-based evidence and information. These three areas are interlinked and have a strong relevance to cross-border crime. It is exactly here where the European Union and its actions can make a real difference for ensuring security. The Agenda also proposes steps to strengthen the pillars of EU action on internal security: better information exchange; increased operational cooperation; more targeted support through training, funding, research and innovation. It is through these actions that the European Union gives added value to the work of Member States.  These three pillars are the ones based on which this Agenda can evolve in the course of five years to adapt to new threats and challenges. This was just a brief presentation of the European Agenda on Security adopted, as I said at the beginning, by the Commission today. I want to stress, to underscore again: this Agenda is not just the response to the recent tragic events. This Agenda has been a priority for President Juncker and this Commission and defines the Union’s approach to internal security that is based on our common values, including the rule of law and fundamental rights. It also has to be seen in conjunction with the future Agenda on Migration which will further develop issues of border management and smuggling of migrants. I look forward to a deep and, as always, sincere cooperation with you in order very soon to be in a position to deliver what we have assumed as a responsibility in the eyes of European public opinion, European citizens, to guarantee their safety and security.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2179, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "President. –", "mepid": "2187", "text": "   Thank you, Commissioner, and also for the news coming from the College on better inter-institutional regulation.

I was the first to take on board the fact that the Commission wants to make the issue of security a priority. Secondly, I have welcomed the fact that existing instruments should be strengthened and optimised and that they should be used in an improved way. There are certainly opportunities in the area of Prüm, as well as in other areas of data exchange, for optimisation, improvement and a strong stringency in terms of data exchange, which this House has called for across party lines. I also think it is very positive that you want to review and address the European crime record EPRIS with cross-border access to information from national criminal records, as well as to see a common information space for the maritime sector increasingly optimised. However, I have one more question in this regard – or I am keen to make it very clear: I sometimes have the impression that the Commission is very cautious about the staff for the organisations that are supposed to make this true, such as Europol. We have an EC3, now we want to add a counter-terrorism centre or a platform, whatever, but they also need the staff to be able to deal with the relevant processes in the first place. Europol is already unable to handle almost 50% of Member States' requests due to a lack of staff. And these are not innocuous requests. Hence the specific request to consider the necessary staff for the steps for which we need it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2181, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Birgit Sippel", "mepid": "96932", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group. Mr President, I would like to thank the Mr Avramopoulos has started his speech by saying that, of course, fundamental rights must be respected and that we need democratic control. I strongly agree with that. At the same time, however, I have the impression that it is extremely dramatic that we have to mention such self-evident things over and over again. Mr Timmermans said: \"Everyone wants to live safely.\" I would add that this certainly applies to at least 99% of all people who are legally resident in our Member States. Living together safely and peacefully – I think everyone agrees with me – is a very bad guide to fear, intolerance and ignorance. I therefore welcome the fact that the Commission also wants to take a step forward in the area of integration and social inclusion, because radicalisation is directed in both directions: some become Islamists and plan attacks, and on the other hand, the other people in our states are also radicalising themselves by rejecting everything foreign. That is why inclusion is a task that is addressed to many groups in our population. I therefore also welcome the issue of centres of excellence, because I believe that it is right to put our finger in the wound and make it clear where there is still some catching up to do in our Member States, but we must also promote with the best examples of how things can be brought forward. First of all, the Commissioners have made it clear that the full implementation of existing measures should be concentrated. I agree with that. And I hope that this Commission will actually have the strength to raise its fist on the table with the Council, too, so that this actually takes place. I have a group of visitors and, unfortunately, I cannot follow the debate to the end. But I find it highly dramatic that our Member States, together with us, are passing legislation here and then forgetting the whole thing on the way to the capitals and not implementing it. We need clear mechanisms for this. It is true that we must combat trafficking in human beings. We have adopted a directive on this here at European level.

The threats we face are evolving, growing and diversifying. We need a strategy that places both the protection of people’s lives and their liberties at its heart. My priorities are clear: the adoption of the EU PNR Directive before the end of the year, as committed to by this Parliament.  In order for us to address the root causes of radicalisation, our fight against terrorism needs to be dynamic and diverse. We need to look at combating radicalisation in prisons, recruitment online, in schools and in communities, as well as equipping ourselves with essential law-enforcement tools to prevent and prosecute terrorist offences across borders. Child exploitation online is on the increase and we need to make sure that Europol has the resources to ensure that it can do the incredibly important work that it is charged with. Member States need to start sharing information better, and they need to do it more quickly and more effectively.  The Commission needs to ensure that the legislation we already have is being implemented consistently across all countries and that we do not have weak links in our fight against criminality.

But then they do not have to be here because they probably already read about the document, that was adopted 30 minutes ago, last weekend in the German newspaper Die Welt where the Commission was extensively quoted. My Group thinks that there are very positive elements in the paper – such as the focus on better information sharing and the importance of fundamental rights and data protection – but unfortunately the paper is short on concrete proposals. One glaring omission in this paper is the evaluation of existing measures. Commissioner Timmermans referred to it, but where is the evaluation? Maybe this will also be in Die Welt next weekend – I can't wait. So rather than proposing a whole raft of new measures, we should start with evaluating the existing toolkit, because you are the champion of better lawmaking, and I think evaluation is a part of better lawmaking. Proposals to expand the role of Europol are certainly interesting, but setting up this whole new structure must be done in a proper parliamentary process in the context of the current revision of the Europol statute, and not sneakily via the back door of a mere Commission communication. The revision of the Transparency Regulation is long overdue, but the Commission and the absent Member States stubbornly defend the old culture of secrecy, deliberately keeping citizens at a distance and refusing accountability. So I hope you are going to include this in your paper as well. My Group is also worried about the increasingly blurred lines between policing and intelligence and security tasks, and the inflationary use of the term ‘national security’, without any proper legal definition. The proposals in the package also create a strange hybrid of national and European powers that leave citizens in the dark as to the applicable law.

Mr President, who says security also speaks of respect for freedoms and justice, three axes which are inextricably linked. In your program, beyond words, the security prism largely predominates. There can be no security and security without respect for fundamental rights. In the European Union, we are regressing in this area. We all know why, as has already been said. The Member States are keeping our hands, we are increasingly favouring repression over prevention and terrorism is becoming an obsession, to the detriment, whatever you say, of the fight against organised crime. However, the two, as we all know, are inextricably linked.  Priority has been given to the fight against radicalisation and thus jihadist networks, and the link is being made to migration issues. These attacks mark public opinion: they are violent, the deadliest, but they represent only 5% of terrorist attacks in the European Union. Are the priorities really tailored to the need for citizens' security, or are they a short-term response to media pressure that also overestimates Islamic terrorism? The key is police cooperation. However, beyond the rhetoric we know that it is not working well, including because budgetary and human resources are being reduced. However, the Commission has new powers. In the event of non-compliance with fundamental rights, particularly by Member States, how does it really intend to combat the questioning of these rights by security policies? This is the European Patriot Act. Yet when we look at what is happening in the United States, we see that that is not the key. It is time to return to the fundamentals of the rule of law and respect for citizens' rights.

In fact, I think that is dangerous because it diverts attention from following individuals who are suspected. To then return to PNR (storing passenger data), while the European Parliament has been asking for years for papers to show that this helps, does not seem to me to be the right way forward. Then judicial cooperation. Yes, of course there will have to be more cooperation between Member States in detecting terrorists and criminals. But this includes a solution to the problem of 'trusting each other', because until now European Member States do not trust each other. We've also seen what happens to suspects falling between shore and ship. My question to the Commission is: do you have any plans to improve that? Cybersecurity. What is the European Commission's position on the individual's right to protect himself from government-run? After the Snowden revelations and the NSA affair, it seems necessary to protect yourself better. But that means that Member States may be less able to monitor their own citizens. I have the impression that it is not appreciated if citizens are going to protect themselves better. Finally, Mr President, more European internal security means more cooperation. But that calls for more democratic control at European level. Does the European Commission also have a proposal on how we can increase the democratic content of our security policy?", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2186, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "David Borrelli", "mepid": "124796", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the vulnerability of advanced democratic societies, based on respect for rights and freedoms, is clear to everyone.  The threats are multiple and often unsuspected: think of the use of drones for civilian use, or the common and widespread use of so-called \"dual use\" chemicals. There are inconsistencies in our security systems that cannot yet be overcome. One of the biggest problems is undoubtedly the illegal arms trade, which is strictly prohibited in respect of states considered to be at the origin of terrorist activities, and it reappears in legitimised forms in the trade in arms components. Great efforts have been made at European level to harmonise and strengthen the rules on arms control, but when we move towards the effectiveness of the implementation and control mechanisms, we see that harmful differences persist. Effective cooperation at European level is still an unfinished objective.  The dynamics of the events in Paris are clear: the threat of this new 'domestic terrorism', which is often intertwined with organised crime, makes use of structures, contacts and armaments from other countries. These terrorists use our fundamental freedoms to hide, move and strike. This is happening both within Europe and in neighbouring countries, both in the East and in the Middle East.  I am referring here to another disturbing aspect of this affair: foreign fighters. As is well known, the 'negative added value' of these is the ability to travel and move easily within and outside Europe's borders. It is clear, therefore, that without active police and intelligence cooperation – I am thinking, for example, of strengthening the automatic fingerprint identification system – we will not be able to monitor these criminals effectively. The obstacles preventing or slowing down this cooperation must therefore be identified and removed decisively.  But beware of the \"Trojan horses\". Fear must not be an alibi for compressing our fundamental freedoms. Terrorism is not combated by preventing our citizens from travelling, nor by systematically violating our privacy.

I am pleased to see that cybercrime is one of the top three priorities in the European Agenda on Security. Very often now, cyberspace creates the framework for organised crime and terrorism. We need to set the rules, use modern technologies to find appropriate tools and build public-private cooperation. There are new technological possibilities which allow for processing the data – not personal data: frequencies of data set transfers, photos by spectrum of colour analysis – and preventing crimes. Research and innovation can be a successful source for new forms of security. This is the new concept of data-driven security. The fight against organised crime remains high on the agenda, but we need to make the anti-terrorism policy more effective by adoption of the PNR Directive, by more resources dedicated to fighting radicalisation, and by better use of algorithms supporting the early warning system.

However, I believe that European security policy-making power will depend on two factors: firstly, on efficiency – civil and military – but also on the political will, which we should also use to shape it together.

According to a new study, many European companies are also affected. Do we not want to think about military matters from time to time, about solutions, how a civilian cyber defence system can also work? I believe that this must go beyond the current situation.

My very first conclusion is that finally we agree on the basic lines. I am, of course, looking forward to discussing this agenda thoroughly with you in the coming weeks. This House is a crucial partner in the implementation of this shared agenda. Let me answer some of your remarks. First, on Europol, Mrs Hohlmeier asked me a question. I agree that in certain areas it is necessary to reinforce human resources. We have more to do and, as I said at the beginning in my initial remarks, we are moving in that direction. Ms Sippel also made a point. I really understand what you say, but let me reassure you that the Europol Centre will operate within the existing mandate. The ongoing revision of the Europol regulation will reinforce both the data protection framework and the oversight powers of Parliament. This will also apply to the Centre. As I said, this House has made clear that the utmost priority was to use the existing tools better – the existing instruments – both at legislative and operational level. This is exactly what we are doing with the Europol Centre. You also said something about the evaluation and better regulation of current instruments. The First Vice-President, Mr Frans Timmermans, sitting next to me, is the most appropriate person to further elaborate on this. Evaluation has become a major element of all the Commission’s policies. I assure you that the Commission’s Better Regulation Agenda now obliges us to make evaluations every time before we come forward with new proposals.  I would also like to answer Ms Vergiat’s point. I want to assure you that we are working according to the work programme. Actually we have accelerated it. This agenda is our agenda for the next five years. I am looking forward to working with you on this basis. Mr Devedjian, as I said, the issues of migration and border management will be further developed in the agenda on migration. As far as Ms Fajon’s points are concerned, social division and poverty – the root causes of extremism – are addressed and will be developed in cooperation with the competent colleagues. As I said, we will not only work on repressive measures – we will also focus on prevention. Social cohesion policy, education, employment, justice – but also cooperation with key third countries – are crucial for the EU response to address the root causes of radicalisation and extremism.  Mr Fleckenstein, you are right. I agree with you. We do need to bring together, in an effective manner, all internal and external dimensions of security. You know that we are already doing this. We work closely with Federica Mogherini, and you will see many targeted actions in this agenda. I mentioned some: legalisation and firearms are two examples. Then there is the Western Balkans, Turkey and the arc of countries which are facing instability right now. We travel around, and of course we exchange views and work together.  Let me conclude by telling you that European citizens expect us – as I said at the beginning – to trust each other, to share information effectively and to work together to coordinate concrete actions. So we must face all these threats together. When I say together, I mean among all institutions and all Member States – with everybody. Nowadays security matters, and what the citizens of Europe demand and expect from us is to assure them that they can live in a well-protected Europe.

A security policy that did not respect them would be a policy that makes terrorists victorious.  Secondly, member states share information.

Firstly, facilitating the exchange of information between law enforcement authorities and Union agencies, such as information on stolen documents or vehicles. Secondly, the rules for the transmission of criminal records information need to be amended.

I want to say that terrorism is financed by fraud, organised crime, corruption and, yes, terrorism is also financed by fraud from European funds. We are talking in the European Union about fraud of our citizens' money of EUR 3 to 5 billion per year. It's an enormous amount, so far in numbers on paper. It's probably a lot bigger.  They steal money for jobs, for young people, for research, for innovation. They're stealing our money. It steals from our lives. Poverty is growing. All these are consequences of the fact that today, unfortunately, at European Union level, we do not have an effective mechanism to fight fraud with European money. The investigation of fraud with European money today is carried out by every Member State, not at Union level. Some Member States do it effectively for fraud with funds allocated to their country, but other Member States do not do it at all or do it very little effectively – very badly, to say the least. This distinction between the way european fund fraud is investigated in the Member States makes it absolutely necessary for a single european-wide office to investigate fraud with European funds. That is why the European Prosecutor's Office is needed. The result will be that fraud with European funds will be investigated more quickly, better, faster and to a much greater extent, and the recovery of money, obviously, will mean much more. Much more money will be returned to the pockets of our citizens.  Let us not forget that all of us here and in the European institutions are the guardians of our citizens' money. That's what the European Prosecutor wants to be. Through the investigation he is doing from start to finish and bringing to trial those who are guilty or suspected of having stolen European money, the European Prosecutor can guard public money, European money. We need the European Prosecutor's Office, which is made up of independent people, prosecutors specialising in the fight against fraud. Some will be in the central office, some will be at home in the Member States, but all will be part of the European Prosecutor's Office and will work together.  Let us make a comparison and see that the only answer is a European anti-fraud office. If we are struggling with an organised group of people who are defrauding European funds and they are doing it from several Member States, how can we respond differently than we do through a group of prosecutors from all the Member States, working together, efficiently, flexibly, quickly and annihilating these fraud groups against European funds.

An investigation will always be carried out in any Member State, with the authorisation and in accordance with the law of that country and, of course, with respect for the individual rights of the suspects.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2225, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, let me start by expressing my gratitude to Ms Macovei and to all the shadow rapporteurs for their intensive work on this file. This interim report sets out the position of Parliament in the clearest possible way. And I am pleased that it is supportive of the Commission’s overall objective: to create a European Public Prosecutor’s Office which will be able to make a decisive difference in combating fraud on the EU budget. I am committed to put it in place by 2016. Creating this Office will lead to a real change in how crimes against the financial interests of the Union are tackled. However, we are not there yet. Negotiations are still ongoing in the Council and they are very complex. We try hard to fully secure the independence and efficiency of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO). In that regard, I would like to thank you for supporting an open, objective and transparent appointment procedure for members of the EPPO. In addition, I agree that we need clear rules on national competences as well as strong competences for the EPPO. The EPPO’s workload attribution should be organised based on objective criteria, and its working procedures need to be in accordance with the Treaties, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. I plead that we all keep an open mind: there is no template or precedent for the EPPO; there are no ready-made solutions which we could just replicate. In this context, the Commission has doubts whether the cross-border investigation regime applicable to the EPPO should follow the regime established by the European Investigation Order Directive. This is an instrument with great added value for the judicial cooperation between the Member States. But it seems less suitable for an EPPO working as an indivisible, European body – as a single Office. In our view, the transfer of the competence to investigate and prosecute EU fraud requires a simple and efficient sui generis regime for the EPPO’s cross-border investigations which operates in full respect of procedural rights and the Charter. It should reflect its operational needs and thus depart from the traditional intergovernmental cooperation instruments, in particular with regard to the grounds for refusal and the regime of judicial authorisation. In the area of justice, where the EPPO will act as an indivisible and single European body, there is no need for a duplication of judicial authorisations for investigative measures. A similar question applies to the proposal that it should be up to the European Court of Justice to ensure the judicial review of all EPPO acts. This would certainly overburden the Court. We are not talking about a dozen cases a year: we are talking about hundreds, if not thousands of cases! The Treaty allows and calls on us to create a specific system which is adapted to the EPPO’s specific nature.

It is one of the few opportunities to have this debate. I would like to tell you that what is on the table so far with the European Public Prosecutor is not enough in the Council's consideration and debate. We are doomed to success in this matter, and we are there to remind the Council that we need an efficient authority, that we do not need an authority that decides cumbersomely and cannot do exactly what it is supposed to do, which is to combat cross-border crime.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has done It is not known how much annual damage is to the EU budget, and thus also to the detriment of European taxpayers from fraud in the Member States. EUR 500 million, or even EUR 2 to 3 billion, is estimated. What we do know, however, is that the prosecution of crimes such as fraud of EU funding by national authorities leaves something to be desired. Against this background, it is time for the creation of the European Public Prosecutor's Office – yes, as provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon, and Mrs von Storch can read this again – and for this Public Prosecutor's Office to be able to start its work. Crimes against the EU's financial interests, which often take place across borders, must be vigorously combated. They are not cavalier offences. Europe must act in its own interests and that of its citizens. In principle, our group is in favour of the creation of a European Public Prosecutor's Office. It would be an important step towards effective protection of the EU's financial interests, and it would be equally important for strengthening the common European judicial area. The Member States are currently negotiating the design of the European Public Prosecutor's Office, and in the end the Council must decide unanimously. Unfortunately, Parliament is not involved in this issue through the ordinary legislative procedure, but the Council must know – even if it is not present, I hope the message will be sent to it: it needs the assent of this House. That is why Parliament's second interim report, which we are debating today, comes at just the right time, because it sends clear messages to the Member States and their negotiators. I would like to make it quite clear on our group that we are not giving the Member States a blank cheque for our assent. Firstly, we want a European Public Prosecutor's Office that is independent, regardless of any influence by the Member States. This requires not only a transparent procedure for the appointment of European Public Prosecutors, but also the involvement of Parliament in the selection of persons – the Prosecutor General and the European Prosecutors. Secondly, we want a clear delimitation of competences between the European Public Prosecutor's Office and the competent national authorities. Thirdly, the European Public Prosecutor's Office must be able to operate efficiently. But it is at least as important that the procedural rights for accused persons must not be allowed to get under the wheels. And, of course, a high level of data protection must be ensured. Moreover, contrary to what seems to be the view in many capitals, we do not believe that the job of a European Public Prosecutor can be a part-time part-time job.

Indeed, we say yes to the European Public Prosecutor's Office but no to an expensive, inefficient and dependent bureaucratic structure of the Member States, which too often take refuge behind the principle of sovereignty, Mr Kirkhope, to do nothing.  The fight against fraud is above all an ethical issue, which aims to strengthen the rule of law and to put an end to situations of impunity, which are still far too numerous. It is up to Europe to defend its financial interests without having to depend on the goodwill of the Member States. The European Public Prosecutor's Office will give the Union the means to set out its ambitions. Many states play a double game: they praise European justice in public, but in the backyard they empty it of its substance by maintaining almost total control over its exercise. Only the independence of the European Public Prosecutor's Office will bring real added value. I am pleased that the European Parliament is proposing, in this report, a series of concrete measures that go in this direction.  Independence is mainly reflected, as Mrs Kaufmann said, in the process of appointing prosecutors, in the division of powers giving priority to the European Public Prosecutor's Office and in its structure, where chambers composed of several prosecutors hold real power.  I just want to remind the Council that the European Parliament will have the final say on this issue. It would be appropriate for him to take into account the views of this House.

Out of fear, because some member state governments may be inconvenienced by such an institution, for governments that are themselves implicated in corruption. For this reason, the watering down of the proposal has also started. There have been suggestions for the creation of a network-type public prosecutor's office or organisation. This must be strongly rejected. This would create the institution of the public prosecutor's office in name, but it would not work in practice. Similarly, the exception of VAT fraud from the competences has been raised, although these are precisely the cases where action by the EPPO is most decisively needed.

I would like to assure you that the fight against corruption and fraud is the highest political priority of the Commission and of myself. I am truly convinced that we need an independent EPPO which will bring harmonised procedures and ensure the fair investigation of criminal offences infringing the financial interests of the EU; I believe it will bring tangible results. I am convinced that the taxpayers of the EU deserve to have such an institution which will safeguard their money. Taking a very conservative estimate, I would say that some EUR 1 to 2 billion a year could be secured and brought back to European treasuries and the European budget, or be refunded to the Member States, by which I mean used in honest projects in the context of EU structural funds. When we are speaking about such a large amount of money to be secured versus the costs of the European Prosecutor’s Office, I think we can say there is a good cost-benefit balance in this case. We need the EPPO as a specialised institution functioning alongside OLAF and Eurojust, and Mr Voss was right when he spoke about the need for a very precise description and plan of the procedures and the cooperation between the EPPO, Eurojust and OLAF because this must operate in a very efficient way. There is still a lot of work to do. We must secure a clear division of competences at the central and national levels, and ensure the transparent selection of people for the positions. We have already introduced the conditions and criteria of integrity, independence and professionalism of the people to be selected. Those of you who said that the procedural rights of the criminal procedure of the Member States must not be sacrificed, are right. They must also be secured in the EPPO procedure. A last comment regarding the yellow cards which the EPPO received from several Member State parliaments. I do not consider the question of these yellow cards to have been concluded, so I have been addressing all these parliaments, in some cases making a personal visit. I have tried to explain how we can go forward with the proposal, that there are safeguards to ensure that the principle of subsidiarity is not infringed, that a decentralised structure is foreseen and that the jurisdiction of the national courts will be maintained… among many other things. I must say that I have had some quite positive reactions from the members of the national parliaments and I hope that through this enhanced communication we will be able to conclude that there is in fact no breach of subsidiarity.

I will try to answer some of the issues raised.  Firstly, I ask rhetorically, because I already have this information, those in the Member States or in certain political groups who oppose the European Prosecutor's Office: how much money have they recovered through their own investigations in their countries from fraud with European funds? Have they recovered a lot? Did they recover a little? Maybe they don't really want anyone to interfere, they don't want anyone to see if they worked well or not.  This has to do with the second thing I want to say, and that is very important: European money, our citizens' money, is in a common basket. As long as they are together in one basket, they must be protected from all of us. If in one country things are going very well and investigations are being concluded in other countries, no, know that the citizens of countries where things are doing well are also being stolen. I would like to give this answer mainly to the colleagues in the Netherlands who have invoked this, namely that they are doing good investigations at home. Sure! Only in other countries it is not made, and the money is in this common basket. Further a third point: the independence of prosecutors from politics. I think it was so, just a word from Mr Negrescu, to show that he cares about this independence, while at home, now in Romania, on the contrary, they vote the other way around in Parliament. I want to put it this way: the independence of European prosecutors, both those in the Member States and those in the central office, is clearly ensured from the outset in this report on the European Prosecutor's Office.  Very briefly: four – yes, we want to include VAT offences and also fraud with European funds in the candidate countries and in other countries to which we give money.

This is a particularly big problem in Hungary, where since 2010 EU funds have landed in the pockets of pro-government businessmen with the active involvement of the government. This is evidenced by the recent suspension by the European Commission of HUF 700 billion in EU funds, as after 2010 fraud or pricing practices and irregularities were detected in one third of EU projects. It is no surprise, therefore, that the Hungarian Government, which has sunk to the level of corruption, is opposed to the Commission's proposal to set up an independent European Public Prosecutor's Office. Only with the independent European Public Prosecutor's Office can we put an end to institutional corruption orchestrated by the current ruling parties.

According to the print media, many facts remain unclear, for instance the extent to which the German intelligence service, the BND, was involved, intentionally or not, in the US National Security Agency’s spying on companies in Western Europe, in violation of German law. The activities of intelligence services aim to ensure national security. The area is within the sole competence of the Member States and thus exempt from the applicability of EU law, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union as the Charter only applies to Member States where they implement EU law. Having said this, the concept of national security needs to be interpreted restrictively when used by a Member State in order to claim the non-applicability of EU law. The case law of the Court of Justice also clarifies that, in such a case, the Member State needs to substantiate such a claim. It is not sufficient to simply invoke it. Any problems of cooperation between the intelligence services of the Member States or between a Member State and the intelligence service of a third country is a matter to be resolved firstly by the Member State or Member States.

So far, we do not have any facts about this. So what are we actually talking about here? That intelligence services are doing what they are doing, that perhaps a European service is supporting a friend of another service in this? It is generally good that we keep reassuring ourselves that we are positioning ourselves against mass surveillance and that we do not accept spying on citizens, politicians and even companies. That is also unacceptable. But we have already established all this. That is why I do not think the timing of this debate is the right one, it is wrong, too early, and I also think that the place is wrong. The Commissioner had already said that we are not the place responsible for this. We should therefore not somehow pretend to the European public that we can really change the intelligence services here in the European Parliament or make a difference in this matter. We do not have these powers for intelligence, let alone competence for a national intelligence service. So far, we really do not have any confirmed findings.

Dear Mr Voss, there have been not only newspaper reports, but the members of the German NSA Committee – including the chairman who comes from your party – have confirmed that there has been misconduct. But for the reason, the turmoil following the Snowden revelations has left no trace in the Member States, as we can see once again. The spying continues. In its final report, this Parliament not only criticised the United States, but also called on the Member States to stop mass storage without cause and to create stronger supervisory bodies for intelligence services. Even then, for example, we named British and German intelligence services, because there were suspicions that not everything was going well. Yes, not all the facts are on the table yet. However, as has been shown, it is also a serious matter for the members of the committee. Anyone who, without the knowledge of the Chancellery and Members of Parliament, passes on news, not for the fight against terrorism, but for completely different purposes, is acting wrongly, exceeds his powers, and if no one supposedly knew this, it is very frightening, because control – including parliamentary control – has obviously not worked. The only correct response now is a comprehensive investigation of all allegations by the German NSA Investigation Committee. As all members have called for, the Chancellor's Office must also provide appropriate support and ensure that the investigation can take place as quickly as possible. A special role is played by the much-discussed selectors, according to which our secret service has sought out information that the NSA wanted for different purposes. However, it also shows – and I will end here – that the European Parliament must continue to deal with this issue.

I have to say, Commissioner Jourová, that now is the time to really do some work on investigating whether the term of ‘national security’ in the Treaty of the European Union is being overstepped by the Member States.

Any interference with fundamental rights must be justified on a case-by-case basis and must not go beyond what is necessary, and above all it must not be systematic. So what do we need? We need parliamentary control – that is good what we are doing here. We need intensive investigations throughout Europe, in all the Member States where this is happening. Secondly, we finally need the completion of the data protection reform – that is overdue. Thirdly, in order to achieve more network and IT security in Europe, we finally need a European infrastructure and a legal framework for a European cloud. Fourthly, we need protection for whistleblowers, for people like Edward Snowden, who have uncovered all these things. Fifthly, we need an anti-espionage agreement. Bilateral agreements obviously have no value. All EU Member States must make a binding commitment not to engage in economic espionage against each other. Sixthly, we finally need the courage to review the international agreements that we have entered into. SWIFT and Safe Harbour agreements must be put to the test. We have taken clear decisions here.

It really made sense and it is good that we have raised this issue here. My opening speech was rather dry and modest because I only said that we do not have enough evidence on the table. We do not have enough facts – only news from the media. For me, as for lawyers, this is quite a decisive condition for making conclusions or not making conclusions. I also spoke about the lack of European competence, referring instead to the competences of the Member States.  However, I must tell you that since I heard this information about the alleged new scandal involving the abuse of data by the American NSA, my vigilance has really been raised. You all know that we are now in a hot phase of negotiations with the American authorities on the Safe Harbour system in which we are negotiating the exceptions under which the American intelligence service can use the data of the European citizens or legal persons flowing to the United States. This will not make the negotiations easier – quite the opposite. If we have achieved some sort of fragile trust, hearing this news puts us back in a very different situation. However, we are tough in the negotiations. We want to see the rules and the competences, which are varied on the American side, but we also want to obtain very concrete guarantees from the American authorities that the rules are going to be obeyed and fulfilled. The written rules are one thing and the execution of these rules is another. These negotiations are very tough, and this will mark the future weeks. We wanted to finalise the negotiations by the end of May and to achieve the concrete written set of rules which will be maintained in dealing with the data under Safe Harbour. These negotiations are continuing, as is the parallel procedure of the finalisation of the Data Protection Regulation.

This is a EUR 1 trillion industry too big to be ignored. The financial crisis has made it abundantly clear that these funds pose systemic risks and can lead to financial instability and recourse to the public purse. During the crisis, the key vulnerability was when investors wanted to liquidate funds quickly. These so-called runs meant that the asset managers had to close them down and the investors lost their money.  The previous Parliament failed to find an agreement on this file. From the beginning, when I took over, it was clear to me that this was an issue that strongly divided this House. Between the supporters of the CNAV MFF and the VNAV MFF, each camp has about 50% of the market, and is supported by at least one Member State and opposed sometimes by another – a bit like when you have two strong football teams in one city. The divisions experienced in this House are also mirrored in the Council. Therefore, I would like to remind colleagues that it is not our role as legislators to decide which team we should be supporting. Both have their value to different investors. Our role is to ensure that any type of MMF is transparent, liquid and stable so that we do not face the burdens of the 2008 financial crisis again, while recognising that MFFs are of value to many types of businesses, local authorities and non-profits that support our economy and use MFFs as a cash management tool. Salaries and other funds are placed in MFFs as these offer an easy return both in terms of interest and of liquidity. They can, and do, make a positive contribution to the real economy. However, it would be an understatement if I said that achieving a degree of understanding of each other’s point of view was straightforward when we looked at this report. But I am pleased that we did manage to find a compromise between the S&amp;D, the EPP and ALDE in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. What we have achieved, apart from strengthening the viability of the MFF sector, is to introduce three new categories of funds – LVNAV, Retail CNAV and Public Debt CNAV. These solutions would not have been possible had it not been for the cooperation and flexibility demonstrated by many colleagues and especially the shadow rapporteurs. However, I have to say that I am disappointed that, despite taking many concerns of the GUE/NGL, the Greens and the ECR on board, that they did not support the proposal in committee. I do find it ironic that their preferred positions, for whatever reasons, would result in a totally unregulated MFF sector being allowed to continue, which would put our fragile economic recovery at risk. I do find this baffling. For me it is important to get this on the statute books sooner rather than later. Therefore, I would urge them to reconsider their positions and support this report so we can move to a trilogue stage from a greater position of strength. On that, I would also say to the Council Presidency – which is absent – that it is being made an offer that it cannot refuse in terms of achievements for the Latvian Presidency. I would thus ask Commissioner Hill to take this up with the Presidency to ensure that it does move forward quickly. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the earlier Italian Presidency, which made considerable progress on this dossier and was instrumental in introducing me to the concept of LVNAV.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2289, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Jonathan Hill", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I am very glad to be here today because it means that we have got to the point of a plenary vote and that is an amazing achievement. A huge amount of hard work has been needed to get this far and I am very keen to congratulate publicly Ms Gill on the part she has played in getting us here. Money market funds are important as a source of short-term financing in our economy, but they also have systemic implications and that is why we need to make money market funds in Europe safer. The Commission proposal stressed the role of safeguards for MMFs, covering authorisation, supervision, transparency and limits on what MMFs can invest in, and most of that is not contentious. It will reduce risks, but also allow MMFs to continue their essential role for Europe’s companies. I know that there are some outstanding issues that still need to be resolved, but I believe that the ECON compromise has helped provide a new impetus and Member States have signalled a fresh willingness to resume negotiations. In her proposal, Ms Gill has wisely concluded that MMF reform does not have to take a one-size-fits-all approach. MMFs serve many purposes, so to acknowledge that fact we need a variety of types, and that seems to me to be a good principle for us to uphold. I believe that Parliament’s proposal for a low-volatility MMF to replace the current stable redemption MMF is a good basis for discussion with the Council. And as the LVNAV MMF is a direct successor to the CNAV, we will of course monitor how it develops and ensure it both provides a useful service to the economy and deals with risks in an appropriate way. The Commission is examining whether the proposed 20 basis point spread is appropriate to avoid investor runs. Ms Gill has also proposed two alternative fund models – government and small investor CNAV MMFs – and these two types of MMF will continue operating under the classic CNAV model. I think it is right that we should have a broader range of choices available, including government CNAV MMFs, small investor CNAV MMFs, LVNAV MMFs and VNAV MMFs (try saying that after you have had a drink!) in line with our diverse marketplace and national traditions. The Commission wants to ensure that MMFs continue to provide a stable, secure tool for our companies to manage their cash without posing a threat to our financial system. We will continue to provide all the technical support that may be needed to both Parliament and the Council. I hope that we can maintain our current momentum. I will certainly work with the Presidency to make as rapid progress as possible, and conclude this important file in the near future by adopting what I believe is a credible MMF reform.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2290, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Brian Hayes", "mepid": "118658", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, firstly can I congratulate Neena Gill for her work as rapporteur on this very important file, and I would also thank other shadow rapporteurs who worked with me on what has been a difficult and contentious file – not just during this mandate but also under the previous mandate. I think we have a workable compromise that we can now bring forward to the Council in intense trilogue negotiations. I also think it was very important that in the compromise on this file, two distinct parts of this industry are reflected – the CNAV and the VNAV industries. It is crucially important for Europe that we keep the EUR 1 trillion MMF investment in Europe at a time when we are trying to make sure that we have long-term investment in our companies and businesses, big and small, here within the European Union. So that was crucial. It is also crucially important that we are behind the curve by comparison to the United States which has already regulated in this area. So we do need to get our act together, we do need to regulate, but we need to do it in a proportionate and a reasonable way to ensure that these funds remain within the euro system. In the LVNAV proposal I think we have many new features, additional safeguards, daily and weekly liquidity requirements, regular reporting transparency, fees and gates. A totally new system, a transparent system is now put in place to deal with the systemic shock issues that Commissioner Hill spoke of. There is one outstanding issue and it concerns the review/sunset clause which I know has been the cause of some contention. In conclusion, I would be interested in hearing the views of Commissioner Hill as he responds to this debate as to the viability of a sunset clause for the new LVNAV product. If we want the LVNAV product to work, to sustain itself, to move forward, we do need to ensure that there is a review after a few years.

Finally, I welcome Commissioner Hill's positions on the need to proceed after our vote with progress and as far as possible in order to start a trialogue.

At a global level, the FSB has recommended measures to improve the safety of money market funds (MMFs) and to avoid runs through improved rules on transparency and diversification for MMFs, as well as limits on sponsored support.  The initial proposals from the Commission would have seen an end to the CNAV industry, whilst failing to convince anyone that VNAVs offer a wholly better or equivalent option. The ECR has argued consistently for both CNAV and VNAV MMFs to be able to continue, as they offer necessary and different services to our businesses and public bodies. They are not mutually exclusive, and we do not believe that one model is better than another. However, national bias has played an irresponsible role here. The alternative, low-volatility NAV proposed by the rapporteur seems to be a workable compromise, and I thank her for her work on it. However, it is undermined by the review clause calling for an end for this authorisation within five years. That makes such vehicles unviable for providers and investors.

It was thus of crucial importance to allow the European economy and its investors to continue benefiting from both CNAV and VNAV funds. I am happy to say that this text answers our initial objectives by offering a balanced approach. These new rules will make sure money market funds do not threaten financial stability nor mislead investors by continued financing of the real economy in Europe. The newly-created category of low volatility NAVs will be able to use the same valuation method as CNAVs as long as the value of the fund does not deviate too much from the market value. This means more transparency for investors and will prevent run risk in the case of adverse market conditions. The task was not easy at all. Those who followed the files during the previous and current mandate can confirm that. The negotiating team and the European Parliament can be proud of having managed broad agreement on such a polemical and critical file. It is high time that the EU fulfilled its international commitment in this field and provided some answers that are up to the challenge in order to address the possible systemic risk posed by MMFs while offering the industry a workable solution.

Our main commitment is to limit the systemic risk of VLC funds and their false promise of a constant value repayment.  I am sorry to say that the text voted in the ECON committee does not meet our international commitments. The FSB and IOSCO recommended the conversion of constant-value funds to variable value funds or, where this was too difficult, to apply the same rules to these funds as to conventional banks. The removal of the capital buffer proposed by the European Commission led to the rejection of the second option. However, the conversion of the VLCs was not carried out to the end. By creating three new categories of VLC, only one of which would be subject to a transition clause, it was the choice to preserve a certain risky sector that was made.  That is why, if the text remains unchanged, the ecological group would have to vote against it. That is why we have tabled a new set of amendments, one of which proposes to extend the transition clause to the three newly created categories of VLC.

In the end, the taxpayer had to step in with money market funds and banks with gigantic sums or guarantees. MmFs are therefore shadow banks in the narrower sense: in dangers similar to banks, but much less regulated.

This is an issue that needs to be addressed. And who stands for the fact that even in the event of a run on a bank or in this case an MMF, it is possible to pay out here? We have taken an approach here to resolve this somewhat. I am not happy with that, I say quite frankly. I tabled amendments in committee which went much further. I do not yet know whether we have a balanced approach to the negotiations with the Council. We need to see two sides. Not only those who offer these funds, but also those who invest their money in these funds. That is why the flexible funds are certainly the more manageable ones. That is why the question of capital buffers still needs to be answered. I hope that the Council will make appropriate proposals here. That is why, as far as the review of capital-linked funds is concerned, we should have a review of the time as a whole.

In my opinion, we, as legislators, have one main task: it is to ensure the rules of the game in business so that there are as many investments and more jobs as possible in the European Union as a whole. We need to ensure Europe's competitiveness in virtually all areas of the world market in the best possible areas , which means digital, energy, industry, the services sector, including the financial sector.  In this directive, we are talking about money market funds. One composition of the financial market. That is to say, we are talking about variable and constant asset value funds. This proposal and the idea that one such fund in Europe should be restricted is, in my view, the opposite of our goal for Europe to maintain and develop its competitiveness. Why? If we limit Europe, this market, this activity will leave, leave the European Union, go to Asia and the United States.

So, while we here in the European Parliament are discussing mutual funds and short-term financing of businesses and governments, Draghi continues to apply credit suffocation against Greece. In early February, Draghi illegally excluded Greek government bonds from Eurosystem operations, where Greek banks used them as collateral to finance them from the ECB. The ECB subsequently banned Greek banks from increasing purchases of Greek government T-Bills. In Riga, Draghi announced that he would tighten the noose even further around Greek banks.

My admiration for Neena Gill has been increased through listening to the divergence of views that we have heard here, articulated very clearly and with equal passion. It confirms in my mind the importance of trying to make progress on the compromise that has been agreed so far. It is also a reflection of the broader challenges we face in looking at financial regulation as to how we can best balance growth and risk mitigation. I am confirmed in my support and admiration for the work that Neena Gill has done. I will certainly underline to the Latvian Presidency the importance of making progress with this proposal. We have an opportunity now to get some momentum going, and if we do not take it, I fear that we will find it hard to get it back again. As far as the specific question I was asked about a sunset clause is concerned, it is the case, obviously, that the phasing out of CNAV funds was not something that the Commission included in its original proposal. The most important issue for us – our bottom line, if you like – is that we get a sufficiently robust regime in place to deal with credit and interest rate risks for all money market funds, including CNAVs. If we can get the risk management regime right overall, that would deal with the question of the sunset clause. That is something we will be monitoring closely in the Council process, and obviously during the trilogue process that will follow. We need to get a deal on money market funds.

Madam President, Madam Vice-President, President of the Court of Auditors, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her work on Welcome, we are glad that you are here and appreciate that! I am campaigning today for the Commission to grant discharge for the 2013 financial year in the Commission's discharge. I can make this request with a clear conscience. I am also seeking support for the resolution. At the heart of my motion for a resolution and that of the Committee on Budgetary Control is the shared management of funds and the weaknesses in the management systems of the Member States, which have existed for many years. These weaknesses are disclosed in my report and a remedy is proposed. I would ask the political groups and all my fellow Members not to water down the text in tomorrow's vote and to stand behind it, especially those on the margins of this House who claim to be acting for the taxpayer. We must strengthen the Commission's supervisory role, and That is what I have tried to do. The Commission has begun to look closely at the figures from the Member States that report them to Brussels. Directorate-General AGRI is a pioneer, but regional policy must follow. Because there is no value in glossing over the mis-spending. I would ask you, Commissioner, Madam Vice-President, to step up your efforts to ensure that DG AGRI, but above all DG Regional Policy, receives truthful and reliable figures for management and control systems. DG REGIO must do more on the ground and not just control the audit authorities. These are long-standing demands of the European Court of Auditors. If the motion for a resolution is adopted, the Commission will have a strong position with regard to the Member States when it pushes for better results and better controls. That is why I am again asking for urgent reasons. My great disappointment was and is once again the S&amp;D Group. It is good that the majority of the committee rejected their amendments. I would ask that this be done in plenary tomorrow too, because these amendments are watering down the text, thereby weakening the influence of the European Parliament and the Commission in the Council. The importance of the report, the resolution, clearly lies in shared management. But there were only two paragraphs of foreign aid, and here the camp in Tindouf first. It is horrible to spend 40 years in the desert, and it is unacceptable to have to pay money as a refugee for aid. I thought fraud remains scam, even for supposedly good purposes. There is a motion from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the S&amp;D Group, which wants more money for Tindouf and puts additional pressure on the budget. I would like to tell you that aid for newborn Syrian babies had to be halved. At least that is what the German Minister for Development said. There is now an ECHO mission on the ground in Tindouf, which is now under way. That is why I propose that we stick to the compromise text that is now in the resolution and let ECHO report further in our committee. I don't want a position on the matter, I'm neutral. I am neither on one side nor on the other. But I think it is important to keep going on things on the ground, precisely for the sake of refugees and their fate in the desert. So please don't argue ideologies, but argue on the substance. The same applies to IMG, the International Management Group, which has only been recognised as international in the sense of international law by only two Directorates-General. There is no decision by the College on this, although the Financial Regulation provides for such a route. However, there is extensive disinformation here in the house by IMG itself, extensive links between high and former high-ranking Commission staff and the IMG. This conflict of interest must not be left unrefurbishing. But today I ask you not to follow this false information. Today we are going through the first discharge debate by the new Parliament. My first thanks go to you, Mr Court of Auditors, to you, Madam Vice-President, and to all the Commission services, who have tried very credibly to answer our questions during the procedure. My third point is to thank the CONT secretariat, Mrs Castillo and Mr Ehlers and Mr Godts, who have been very supportive of me, and, of course, all the shadow rapporteurs and the advisers to the political groups.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2322, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Martina Dlabajová", "mepid": "124709", "text": "   Rapporteur. – Madam President, President of the Court of Auditors, before approving the report on the discharge to the European Development Fund that I am presenting, is this perhaps the right time to reflect on what we actually expect from this development fund? Its importance and importance could have been inadvertently recalled quite recently in another tragedy off the coast of the Italian island of Lampedusa. In the hot debate on the European Union's migration, asylum and development policy, it may not have been clear enough that the European Development Fund is exactly the instrument that should help prevent this from happening again.  Yes, we mainly expect the Fund to use its limited resources to overcome the causes of huge poverty in countries with unsustainable economic developments and failing public institutions, in countries hit by political and social crises. The European Development Fund cannot completely eliminate this pmalving situation, but it can systematically help prevent some undesirable events, such as the rising and life-threatening emigration of desperate people to European countries. As regards the discharge of the European Development Fund, I consider them to be relevant for at least three reasons: the first is an evaluation of its functioning to date. Let's learn from our mistakes and insuspill ourselves with what's been done. The second reason is the need to prioritise the Fund in the light of the changing needs of the developing world in relation to the European Union. Finally, the third reason is our recommendations for the further functioning of the Fund in the longer term. Of course, on the basis of efficiency and transparency. We have a lot of experience and insights about how the support system has worked so far. In my opinion, it is time to abandon some stereotypes. For example, as regards risks in the countries of the beneficiaries. The risk was simply considered a given fact and this corresponded to a relatively high error rate of the projects being dealt with, which, moreover, did not have the desired effect. Likewise, the monitoring and control system did not always lead to the elimination of the identified deficiencies. Despite the overall great contribution of the aid, this was certainly not an optimal situation in some cases. I therefore consider it necessary to take the following steps: let us assess the strategic priorities of the European Development Fund set together and focus on the really important areas in which we will implement further projects to promote entrepreneurship, infrastructure development or address pressing social issues. To do this, it is necessary to significantly reduce the error rate, to focus on content priorities and to choose the financial instrument and project management that best leads to the goal. In implementing aid, we must perceive the difference in conditions between developing and European countries. We cannot rely solely on local intermediaries, but the solution is not a complete takeover of European practice. We should really sensitively and objectively balance economic and political motives and motives for assistance, because it is also our duty to monitor the effectiveness of financial instruments. European Development Fund funds must be seen as a meaningful returnable investment, not just a gift from a \"rich European uncle.\" Our report agrees that we need a precise, transparent and strategic definition of priorities that meet real and current needs. The use of modern financial instruments can lead to increased efficiency and transparency. We recommend the adoption of a functional system of management, monitoring and control. Last but not least, we recommend that the European Development Fund become an integral part of the European Union budget. Then we will be able to use the means immediately and quickly to help where it is urgently needed. I thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their exemplary and creative cooperation and thank you for the amazing cooperation of both the Commission and the European Court of Auditors.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2323, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Gilles Pargneaux", "mepid": "96948", "text": "   Rapporteur. Madam President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, Madam Vice-President, Mr President-in-Office, as rapporteur for parliament's discharge for 2013, my primary objective is to ensure that public taxpayers' money is used as best as possible in the European Parliament. I have been fully supported in my approach by the shadow rapporteurs, whom I would particularly like to welcome this afternoon.  In these times of crisis, we must give our support to European citizens by showing them that we are capable of improving, at all possible levels, the efficiency of Parliament's day-to-day work. The European Parliament must continue its efforts in areas where the quality and efficiency of public finance management can still be improved. That is why, in my report, I call for further efforts in certain areas, such as, firstly, the strengthening of controls on the recruitment of local assistants - the number of local assistants per Member of the European Parliament varied from 0 to 43 in 2013 - and then the payment of subsidies to visitor groups, which are mostly cash- 73% in cash and only 27% by bank transfer in 2013.  The third improvement I would like is to pay for the mission costs of staff at the Information Offices of the European Parliament, which increased by 7% in 2013. Video conferencing should be preferred over expensive travel.  I also note the need to go further in parity. I note a lack of parity in senior positions in the administration of Parliament: women represent only 29% of unit heads, 33% of directors general and 34% of directors.  It is also worth stressing the need to reach an agreement on the joint management of the Houses of Europe, between Parliament and the European Commission, in order to share the costs of these houses between the two institutions.  Let us also improve the transmission to the CONT committee of the results of the assessment of the status of accredited parliamentary assistants.  We must also recognize the successes of our administration and, for this reason, I would like to welcome the effective implementation of the ban on Members of Parliament from recruiting family members or their spouses. We must also welcome the 5% reduction in MEMBERS' travel expenses, which resulted in savings of EUR 4 million in 2013. We welcome the savings of 25 million euros in 2013 made by the Directorates General of Interpretation and Translation, as well as the reduction in the budget of the EuroparlTV channel, 8 million euros in 2013 compared to 5 million euros in 2014, in parallel with the increase in the number of videos viewed: between 2012 and 2014, the number of videos viewed rose from 53,000 to 400,000. We must welcome the good preparation for the end of the contracts of the 1,700 accredited parliamentary assistants. I also think we must highlight the effectiveness of the programme to reduce the impressions of documents in Parliament, Paperless, which is a significant improvement which I would like to welcome.  In the plenary vote tomorrow, I will support the amendments calling for more transparency in the management of the overhead envelope by Members. It is an amendment co-signed by the EPP Group and the S-D Group and supported by other groups here, including the ALDE and ECR groups.  Finally, I would like to say that tomorrow I will be defending tighter controls on Members' declarations of interest. On the other hand, as rapporteur, I will oppose the amendments in favour of a single seat for the European Parliament and the abolition of the LUX prize. That, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is what I wanted to say in this report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2324, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Ryszard Czarnecki", "mepid": "28372", "text": "   Rapporteur. – Mr President of Parliament, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Madam Vice-President of the European Commission, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, Mr President of the Court, I would like to begin by thanking I have to say six minutes, this will be my longest speech in the European Parliament, and I am in it for the eleventh year. But there is something to talk about, because we will assess how the main institutions of the European Union, including its agencies, control their finances. This is of particular interest to the European taxpayer, the European voter. As far as the European Council is about, unfortunately, we are once again not ready to cooperate with the European Parliament. The Council must participate fully in good faith in the annual discharge procedure, as must other institutions. It cannot be \"equal and equal\" as in Georges Orwell's novel \"Animal Farm\", where all animals are equal, but some are more equal. And, by translating Orwell into the European institutions, the Council is such a more equal animal. That cannot be the case. The previous President of the Council came from Belgium, now he is Polish. I don't see any major changes. There is also a Secretary-General from Germany who is leaving and will take up the post of new Secretary-General from Denmark in July. Will it be a new quality? You have to hope so, but it's really not good in that respect. We are still waiting for our questions to be answered, nothing is changing here and many documents are still missing, particularly relating to council building policy.  European Court of Justice – excessive length of proceedings, need for better synergies in translation and interpretation. Note: the need for a real, real geographical balance. Because there is still a problem that the so-called 'new Union', the countries that joined the Union in 2004, are such a poor cousin. Not only in the ECJ, but also – perhaps especially – in the European External Action Service, our EU diplomacy. It must not be the case that, as it is said, the countries of the 'new Union', including my country, Poland, are as if they are from a stepmother, that is, they are immediately in a worse situation, their representatives are less and they occupy worse positions than the representatives of the 'old Union'. This is a real problem that I am once again signalling. With regard to the European Court of Auditors in question, there is certainly a need to improve the quality of audits on the state of implementation of the budget, flexibility is needed in applying audits to certain problems that suddenly arise. The average time taken to create special reports should, of course, be reduced.  As far as I am concerned, here I am returning to this subject, the European External Action Service: the problem is the so-called heavy administration, a large number of high-level posts that should be reviewed in order to simplify decision-making; competences, the responsibilities of the so-called Special Representatives of the Union are still unclear. I would like to stress once again, Ceterum censeo Carthaginem delendam esse, the need for geographical balance, that is to say, the opening of the door to representatives of the 'new Union', including my country, Polish. As regards the agencies, there are 32 agencies that are subject to the discharge procedure. The European Institute of Innovation and Technology is facing the same problems as it did a year ago, and somehow there is no qualitative improvement. In this context, the Court of Auditors assessed the quality of audit certificates issued by independent audit firms as insufficient, despite the fact that the European Institute of Innovation and Technology had previously given appropriate guidance to the companies concerned. The fact that these ex ante checks are not effective is obviously a problem and that must finally be said. As a result, the European Institute of Innovation and Technology has had to cancel some of the agreements already concluded and this money must go back to the budget. Next, the issue of joint ventures, i.e. ECSEL. We can say that, in general, these joint ventures – of course we are also talking about ARTEMIS and ENIAC – which, it can be said, 'gave birth' to ECSEL, because the merger of the two projects took place last year – mainly had problems relating to the reliability of the accounts, the legality and regularity of transactions, internal controls and the implementation of the budget.  When it comes to IMI – a medical area of great interest to our taxpayers and voters – for the second year in a row, errors are above the material threshold of 2%. I hope that tomorrow's vote will send a signal to our voters that we want more transparency when it comes to monitoring the EU institutions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2325, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Anders Primdahl Vistisen", "mepid": "124875", "text": "   Rapporteur. Mr President! Thank you to the Court of Auditors, which is why we are all working overtime this evening with 52 reports. I have the pleasure of being shadow rapporteur for some of them for the ECR, and then I have two reports myself. So I have to get through a lot, and I hope you forgive me.  Firstly, in relation to the report on the Commission, I would like to thank you for the hard work done by the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur. I think it heralds a new and more objective way of assessing where there are problems in the Commission's accounting. We in the ECR Group are very pleased that the line taken by the rapporteur in the report also became the line that went through the Committee on Budgetary Control. We hope that this will also be the line that goes through Parliament when we vote tomorrow. With regard to the European Parliament's own accounts, I would like to thank you for the constructive dialogue that has taken place around the areas that could be attacked or considered problematic. We in the ECR Group are pleased that many of the inputs we provided have been included in the report we are voting on tomorrow. Here, too, we hope that the problematic places will survive tomorrow's vote, so that we can show that budgetary control is something we take seriously, even when it is within our own house.  In relation to my two own rapporteurs, I would like to thank everyone who has been involved. As for one, SESAR, there are not any major comments or problems. I personally fully agree with the group in this House who believe that they should be granted discharge. With regard to the other, ITER, I would have liked a slightly better negotiation with the way the process has been handled. I welcome the support that the S&amp;D Group and the ALDE Group chose to give to my recommendation in the report, and I still hope that tomorrow the PPE Group will choose to look at the guarantees and explanations given in relation to ITER.  In addition, I would just like to say, by way of aside, that I think that some in this House have judged a great deal politically in relation to the fact that we are actually talking about budgetary control, for example as far as ITER is concerned. I think there has been a certain inconsistency in how you assess the things you may not like much about politically compared to the things you are politically in favour of. That cannot and cannot be the point of a committee on budgetary control! Our primary task should be to ensure that citizens' money is spent properly, correctly and in accordance with the political decisions that are available. It must be in the context of the adoption of the policies that the fight over how the money should be distributed should be taken - not subsequently in the context of the discharge procedure. But beyond that, I think overall it has been a positive course of action. I think that the Committee on Budgetary Control has exercised its mandate in a very sensible way. I hope that this will also be evident when the final reports are available tomorrow. Unfortunately, it is still the case that the Commission is above the important point of no more than about 2% of waste, fraud and fraud in the overall budget. As long as it does, neither I nor the ECR Group can vote to grant discharge, but we very much hope and would like to support the rapporteur in the fact that the report on the Commission remains as it stands. We think it's a very reasonable result. We might have wished for a little more, but in the sacred name of compromise it is a much better result than we are used to on that front.

Honourable Members of the European Parliament, i would like to thank the Rapporteur for his excellent work. Mr Caldeira, President of the Court of Auditors, i would like to thank mr Caldeira for his excellent work. Ladies and Gentlemen! On 23 February, I had the honour to submit to the Committee on Budgetary Control the Council recommendations on unloading to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the 2013 budget. On 23 March the Committee on Budgetary Control also decided to propose that the Commission be discharged for the implementation of the budget. This plenary vote will take place tomorrow, and I trust that it will approve the committee's vote. I am pleased to note that the European Parliament and the Council agree on this important issue. The European Parliament included a number of reservations in its motion for a resolution on the quality of the European Union's financial management. The Council also pointed out in its recommendations that many shortcomings still need to be addressed. The Council is concerned that a large part of payments remains at a high level of error, accounting for 4.7% in 2013. The materiality threshold of 2% is breached in all areas except the administration. The Council regretted that supervisory and control systems were still only partially effective in ensuring the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions and that in a large number of member states of the transactions, the authorities had sufficient information to detect and correct these errors. At the same time, the Council notes that the Error Rate estimated by the Court of Auditors as such does not indicate fraud, wasted or wasted European Union funds. In addition, the Council welcomes all the efforts and actions taken by the Commission and the Member States to implement the Recommendations of the Court of Auditors in recent years. It is all the more appreciated that this was done in the context of a significant increase in the level of duties made. In conditions of limited resources, it is clear that budgetary discipline and the efficient and efficient use of European Union funds should be given greater attention. Sound financial management is important not only from the point of view of public opinion. We have a legal obligation to implement the European Union budget in accordance with the approved rules. All actors involved in the management of European Union funds, including the Member States, must fully assume their share of responsibility. The Council calls on the Commission and the Member States to further improve the effectiveness of management and control systems, while ensuring that the benefits of controls and their costs are in balance. In order to ensure full protection of the Union's financial interests, it is also particularly important to implement corrective measures in a timely way. Finally, I would like to address the issues relating to budgetary management. In this context, the Council considers that clear, comprehensive and timely information on the needs of annual payment appropriations is necessary. It calls on the Commission to provide a reliable forecast of future payment needs, both in the short and long term. Ladies and Gentlemen! The new multiannual financial framework has just begun, and I am pleased that, in the discussions on the new programming period, particular attention has been paid to the creation of a result-based legal framework, both from the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament. This is an excellent opportunity for all of us to achieve a more efficient and qualitative use of EU funds. Of course, the Council is aware that a positive immediate effect of the new elements incorporated is not possible. However, in its recommendations, we call on the Commission to report on progress on the progress to be achieved in a good time and regularly in order to use this information in the negotiations on the next eu multiannual budget. The Council stands ready to engage constructively in all discussions on how to further improve the EU budget implementation framework. Ladies and Gentlemen!

It started in November with the Court of Auditors report and it has gone through very thorough discussions. From the Commission side, I want to state very clearly that we take this responsibility very seriously. We take it seriously when we build our control systems, we take it seriously when we communicate to this House when questions are addressed to us, we take it seriously at political level, with my fellow Commissioners engaging this year in an exchange of views with the Committee on Budgetary Control as well as at technical level. We take the vote of the Council and the vote in the Committee on Budgetary Control to grant discharge to the Commission for the year 2013 as an encouragement. It is an encouragement to us as the Commission and an encouragement to our staff. I want to thank Members for that and I hope tomorrow’s vote will confirm their recommendation. For the Commission, budget implementation is built on multiple blocks – setting—up of control systems, selection of projects, publication of tenders, signature of contracts, verification of payment claims and the transfer of many thousands of payments. It is part of a multi-year process and it will not finish tomorrow, even if, as I hope, the accounts for 2013 will be closed. Mrs Gräßle’s report, and before that the report of the Court of Auditors, gave us a nuanced picture. There are positive elements. The accounts of the European Union were signed off for the seventh year in a row. The Court concluded that EU revenue, all commitments and expenditure, were free from material error and that the previous year’s trend of an increase in the error rate had been arrested: 4.7% in 2013 versus 4.8% in 2012. But we do not take this to be the focus of our attention. The focus of our attention is where we have to do more and where we have to do better.  We need to do more and better in compliance with the rules in the areas of shared management, agriculture and cohesion – we heard that from the rapporteurs – in the controls operated by national authorities in Member States to detect errors early so that they can be addressed early, and we do not get to the point of interrupting payments. We, on the side of the Commission, first and foremost take as our goal to protect the budget against fraud. We have discussed today Mrs Macovei’s report on the European Public Prosecutor’s Office. I am co-responsible for it. It is part of a system we want to build that helps us to stop fraud and deter wrongdoing in respect of our budget. There are also a lot of things we can do to improve the way we protect our taxpayer’s money. I want to stress that in the Juncker Commission we are concentrated on four critical points.  First, simplify the rules. Make them more understandable, easy to apply and easy to control, with fewer errors. The Court is very clear – simple rules mean fewer errors. This year we will pursue work that we have already started. I will present an updated administrative simplification scoreboard to show what has been achieved and what else we have to do.  Simplification is important for our second objective – to improve the cost effectiveness of management and control systems. We now spend between 2% and 7% of the total costs on controls. Obviously, we want effective controls and we want to think of the best way to use taxpayer’s money.  For this, the third element is to further improve the reliability of information, especially that which we collect from Member States, to make sure that we actually apply the most important recommendation of the Court which is a single audit chain: do not do multiple audits when we can actually have one. For that we have to have credible information. National declarations are important. We hope we will see more of them. Fourth and last, it is of utmost importance to take into account the multiannual nature of our problems and to improve our corrective capacity. We are using this seriously. Over the last five years the amount of financial corrections was on average 2.2% of all payments.  In 2013 we opened 265 new interruption cases with a value of almost EUR 5 billion. We are now in the new multi-year perspective, a new financial period. Obviously, as the Minister said, we have to focus on compliance, but equally or even more on what we get for our taxpayers’ money. In this sense, the use of the performance reserve, the leverage of our budget, how we can get more from it, the use of macroeconomic conditionality, are all building blocks of our commitment to a budget that delivers the highest possible value to our citizens. We have committed to an EU budget focused on results as part of our work programme. I look forward to the interinstitutional working group on performance budgeting that would help us all to go in this direction. I apologise for overstepping my time. I want to finish by making a sincere commitment to work with the institutions – with Parliament, the Council and the Court of Auditors – for the sake of making our citizens proud of the work we do for them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2328, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Vítor Manuel da Silva Caldeira", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the European Court of Auditors. – Mr President, I would like to thank this Parliament for this opportunity to say a few words on this particular occasion when we are starting an important debate that will close the discharge procedure for the financial year 2013. I would also like to congratulate all the rapporteurs for their reports and, in particular, the Committee on Budgetary Control. It is very gratifying for us in the European Court of Auditors, and all those who work there, to see such an extensive and thorough use of the work we have done in this particular field. As the final year of the last spending period, 2013 followed the same pattern as previous years. The accounts of the European Union for that year are reliable – and Vice-President Georgieva has underlined this clearly. However, too many payments – although correctly recorded and accounted for – should not have been made because they did not meet the conditions for payment. This is an area where we need to work, because there is room for improvement along the European Union accountability chain from those that are responsible at the first level for ensuring that there are indeed cost-effective systems in place.  More could be done by the Member State authorities that are responsible for this primary management and controls, mainly because there is information already available to make sure that payments fully comply with the rules. The European Commission can also further improve its reporting at the EU level on the estimated errors, financial corrections and recoveries. These are two elements where we think we can do better. But, as has been emphasised previously, the pressing need is to improve the information on the results we achieve. This is a symptomatic, underlying problem of the European Union budgetary system. We need to pay more attention to the results achieved with the funds available from the European Union. That is the single key message I would like to emphasise again today from our annual report. This is particularly important as we are now starting a new financial framework period. We have new systems in place for the 2014 to 2020 period. This is again an opportunity to put these things right from the beginning and to strengthen the EU accountability chain. In this context, we should welcome the plans already disclosed by the European Commission to foster a performance culture in the EU’s financial management. That culture needs to be based, in our view, on a genuine commitment by the financial management at all levels to achieve results. It also requires there to be clear targets and effective incentives for achieving them. Finally, we note that this House has taken heed, in the report on the discharge, of all our warnings and recommendations on a number of issues, not least regarding the need for adequate transparency and accountability arrangements for financial instruments, namely those designed to fund investment. This is also an issue we have raised in our recent opinion on the ‘Juncker plan’. The EU cannot afford for the achievement of results to be an afterthought. It should be the focus of EU spending. As a Court, we look forward to continuing to work closely with your institution, this Parliament, to help ensure that best use is made of European Union funds to deliver results for citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2329, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Anneli Jäätteenmäki", "mepid": "28314", "text": "   draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. – Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.

Furthermore, for the sake of transparency we strongly feel that the Commission should publish an annual list of transport projects co-financed by the Union with the exact funding amounts for each project. It is also of major importance to ensure strong synergy and cooperation between different sources of EU funding in order to avoid duplication and to guarantee their most effective and efficient use. The draft resolution on the Commission's discharge is marked by frequent extreme criticism based on unilateral selection of examples and biased assessments, an approach that is proving welcome for Eurosceptics. This approach is underlined with regard to Bulgaria and other countries of Eastern and Southern Europe. The data presented for these countries suggest that they only make mistakes and failures in the absorption of European funds. Their good results and positions on a number of indicators, as well as progress in problem areas, have been deliberately ignored.

Three brief comments. Firstly, I still call for a uniform system for determining the error rate between the Commission and the Court of Auditors, as the error rates identified vary considerably and cause political confusion overall. Secondly, an increased error rate, which I also fear with the new common agricultural policy, often reflects too bureaucratic a policy. We now have two types of errors.

Reservations and corrections have been applied to make better use of the funds, since 80% of the EU budget is used by the Member States. We encourage the Commission to continue along this path, because the error rate remains too high in some areas, such as regional and structural policy and also in agricultural policy. The Court of Auditors' reports show that there is a need for action here, above all in the Member States. I shall therefore address the representatives of the Council on this point. There are Court of Auditors reports which show that the procurement procedure in particular is too complicated. And that is what the proposers are telling us, the Members, are telling us. Making applications is very difficult for many, especially non-governmental voluntary organisations. We in the ALDE Group are therefore calling for efforts to make the budget simpler, so that the bureaucratic burden can be reduced. Better use of funds must be the top priority in the EU agenda.

In any case, the error rates reported by the Court of Auditors are far too high in most areas. If we are spending money in the poorest regions of the world to give people a better life, local governments must also play along and meet certain performance indicators. If this does not happen, the payments must also be suspended. It is unacceptable for payments to be made where it is not possible to understand what is then being done within the framework of the national budgets with the funds. Equally problematic are the multi-year payment obligations, for which it can then only be settled after the entire period. Clear criteria for interim accounting and success criteria must be defined, complied with and monitored. In addition, the European Development Fund clearly needs more flexibility in order to be able to respond quickly and sustainably to humanitarian disasters.

Based on this and the recent migration issue, I would like to draw your attention to the case of the Frontex Agency. The agency’s mission is to promote, coordinate and develop European border management in line with the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights. In this regard I would like at the end of each financial year to know to what extent the agency has been effective and has contributed to the coordination and implementation of joint operation at external borders, and analysed intelligence on the situation at the external borders, providing rapid response capabilities and assisting Member States in joint return operations. These issues have become more important in recent years in connection with the change in the overall EU strategy on resources and the worsened security environment and problems concerning migrants to the EU.  For me, as a representative of Bulgaria, one of the countries with external borders upon which there is a dramatically increased migration pressure, two main aspects are essential – growth in the agency’s budget and an improved strategy that fits distribution management.

MP for Heraklion in 2012 and 2013, I witnessed the efforts of various circles to get ENISA out of Crete and Greece. We then all fought together with the local authorities of Heraklion to stop these methods, methodologies that initiate the division of ENISA into two sections, an administrative service in Heraklion with 8-10 people, special specifications, in a building of 4,500 square meters, with the operational department in Athens without serious infrastructure and with branches in Brussels and other cities.

My first point would be to send thanks to those in the Court who have contributed to your scrutiny on the European Union budget, its agencies and institutions. Critically, improvement on the European Union budget is a challenge that we have had, but it is a challenge that has to be put forward by the Commission and by the Member State authorities that are responsible. But all the institutions have to work together in that sense. For our part, in the Court of Auditors we believe that we also need to put more emphasis on performance issues in our annual report. We also plan to devote relatively more of our resources to giving this House high-quality, timely and relevant special reports on those performance methods that matter the most for the European Union and its citizens. Finally, while taking care of the recommendations addressed to the Court of Auditors in its own discharge, let me assure you that we will continue to work closely with you to make the excellent cooperation between our institutions a driver to achieve the results that we are all calling for this afternoon. I think this is what matters the most for the European Union’s citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2378, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Kristalina Georgieva", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, many thanks to the Members of the Parliament who have taken part in this debate but also to many who have contributed in the work leading to the debate tonight. We are grateful for your contributions and, as we have done with the report of the Court of Auditors, we will study very carefully the recommendations in this report once it is voted tomorrow and make every effort to implement them. Because in the end, what matters is to turn the debate into actions of the Commission, of Member States, that lead to improvements in the way we spend our taxpayers’ money. I would like to close with three points. First: learning from experience. This has been mentioned by many and it is an obligation of the Commission and, of course, in the shared management programmes of our partners in the Member States. Learning from good experience and learning from bad experience. We would very much like to continue in that spirit: to identify what works and cherish it. Success breeds success. Learn from what does not work and then correct it – fix it. My second point is on the question of methodology. We are now at a crucial moment of time when we are making a leap into balancing measures taken on compliance with measures taken on performance – the culture of results that we have discussed. It is not a trivial matter and it is not easy. Measuring performance in some areas – for example, school attendance – is easy. Measuring the impact of investment in SMEs on jobs, then growth of the economy, is not difficult. Measuring how rural roads contribute to inclusion of rural populations in the economy – the national and European economy – is more difficult. There is always a risk that when we shift to performance, we focus our money on what is easy to measure rather than on what matters the most for our people and our economies. This is why I would very warmly welcome an engagement with the Court of Auditors, Parliament, the Member States and the Council on working on performance. I am stressing this because, if we do right, it would enormously benefit our economies. If we do not do it right – shame on us. So let us work together on making sure we have the right methodologies and make this learning experience a shared journey. My third and last point concerns those who have spoken on the benefits European money brings. They are enormous. I was in Latvia a couple of days ago and there, the chair of the parliamentary committee for European affairs told me how in Latvia you would no longer recognise the schools they inherited from the previous era. They are modern schools, they are energy efficient, they are a pleasure for kids to go to – 800 of them with European money. Latvia is much better connected because now it has a modern airport that allows much more traffic. In the city she grew up in you would not recognise the streets and rural areas because agricultural investments have made farms much more modern and made the city a much better place to live. I have the same experience in my own country. When we talk about the European budget: yes 4.7% is subject to errors and a fraction of this is subject to fraud. But 95.3% has delivered, and it is our job to make the delivery of our budget as strong as we can make it. What you have done is very clear and professional, as has been the work of the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs. We are grateful for the effort you have made. I am taking this back to my colleagues in the Commission with this very simple, straightforward commitment: make better use of our taxpayers’ money.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2379, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Jānis Reirs", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President in office. – Dear bystanders! Thanks again for giving me the floor. This debate has shown that many of the issues concern us equally. Moreover, I can conclude that our common objective is to aim for the Court's unqualified opinion. And unqualified, much remains to be done to improve this performance. Let me emphasise once again that, in this context, all financial actors must take full responsibility for the performance of their duties.  In response to the comments on the unloading of the Council and the roles of the Council and Parliament in the process of unloading, I would like to stress that the Council fully respects and fulfils the tasks set out in Article 319 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Council is aware that the Committee on Budgetary Control voted to postpone the council's discharge for 2013, but it is still ready to discuss the relevant working mechanism between the European Parliament and the Council. The Council made a concrete proposal for a Memorandum of Understanding in 2011 and noted with interest the European Parliament's call for modus vivendi in its resolution of 23 October 2014.  On the other hand, as regards the errors, as expressed in the opening of the committee meeting on 23 February, Mr Grässle pointed out (and I represent the country with one of the lowest levels of error – Latvia has 1% error), I also fully share the concerns of Members who believe that the error rate is high, and I would also remind you that the Council regrets this fact. That is why the Council, in its recommendations, places particular highlights the role of preventive and corrective measures and the need to further strengthen them. I would like to add here, as many speakers also note, that this is about the previous programming period. The Governing Council expects that the new control requirements and reinforced procedures enshrined in the 2014-2020 programming period will lead to a significant reduction in the error rate. To conclude, I would like to reiterate that the European Union budget is an important tool for achieving the policy objectives that we have agreed on. We need results, namely those in terms of growth, employment and investment, stronger business and a more competitive Europe.  We also agree that, in a situation where our total resources are limited, we cannot afford to spend any euro inappropriately. We must convey a clear message to European citizens and taxpayers that the European Union's spending is constantly being monitored and that the quality of them is being improved so that all the results we expect are achieved.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to thank the President-in- Thank you for the clear and clear words at the end. We will take you at your word. I would like to say to you that we are very grateful to you for coming. Not every Presidency of the Council has taken up this task, and you have also made it clear where we can count on you. We will count on you and also on your successor. This is a very strong signal that the Latvian Presidency is sending here. I would like to say to Mrs Kadenbach and to all those who have spoken on the subject of Tindouf that no one under the paragraph is asking for aid for Tindouf to be cut. We demand that there should finally be a census there, a census of heads. If you look at the UNHCR reports, it is precisely there that the absence of this census is criticised. We demand that we give the help to people who actually exist, and we would like to know exactly how many of them are there. Nobody thinks – and this is a malicious distortion of what is stated in the report – that no one is thinking of cutting aid. But we are not thinking of developing aid until we know. Nor is it possible for refugees who are there in sad circumstances to have to pay for EU aid, because aid has been misappropriated there in the past. It is precisely this \"in the past\" that is being reprimanded. We had an exchange with Commissioner Georgieva about what it is like today. That is why, incidentally, there is also an ECHO mission there. We want to make sure that it is no longer the case today. I believe that this is the greatest service we are doing to the refugees. And I really want to ask that Amendment No 27 be rejected. This amendment is not helpful in substance. It is not helpful! That is why, I believe, we are not doing ourselves any favours if we simply discuss these matters in a very frivolous and twisting way. I would like to tell you that we are returning to our main problem of shared management. We really need credible management and control systems and credible data.

Our cross-party report prioritises the precise, transparent and strategic definition of the priorities of the future European Development Fund. I would like to emphasise the three main points that have also been raised by my colleagues. Firstly, the adoption of financial instruments comparable to those used in the 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework, in particular in its modernised form, are a way to enhance efficiency and transparency. Secondly, we must take into account the increased risk in the recipient countries and adapt the system of governance, monitoring and control to this. Thirdly, I would like to consider, and I propose this in my report, that the European Development Fund should become an integral part of the European Union budget, including because of its capacity to action. We need flexibility to use resources immediately and quickly and to help where it is currently needed.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, first of all a few words, perhaps, to answer or accompany a number of interventions on the 2013 discharge concerning the European Parliament.  First, I would like to address the LUX award. Yes, we must defend it! This is a strong demonstration of the European Parliament, which often allows, in particular through its documentaries that we reward, to highlight the turpitudes of our societies. We must therefore defend the LUX prize, because it is, I say, part of our cultural identity.  Secondly, I would also like to defend the project of the House of European History and not, as some have called for, its abandonment. Let us refer to this beautiful sentence: \"A people without memory is a people without a future\". That is why we must defend this beautiful project that is the House of European History.  Thirdly, a remark about Mr Valli, which tells us that we must reduce or even cancel our funding for the foundations of European political parties. This is democracy that we defend, Mr Valli. We not only have a local political expression, like perhaps your 5-Star Movement in Italy, but we are internationalists, all as much as we are. In this way, we must ensure that our debate goes beyond our local concerns. By funding foundations, we are helping to sustain and develop democracy, including European democracy. I would like to go back to a controversy. We heard earlier from Mr. Dartmouth attacking the Speaker's office. That has been said, hate speech discredits the author of this populist protrusion that we have heard. I think the representative of the ECR, Mr Kirkhope, said what needed to be said about the hypocrisy of the UKIP representatives here in this Chamber. Through this report, we have shown our willingness to create more transparency, as I said at the beginning of my speech. Now, after this photograph we took as part of this 2013 landfill report, there is still a way to go.

The aim is to reduce future interest payments. This situation is repeated year after year and the surplus increases every year. Proper budgeting should set out the instalments in relation to buildings as part of the budgetary strategy and properly include it in budgeting rather than as a covertly planned procedure.

More specifically, this means that we need to work in particular to reduce the administrative error rate, which is 4-5%. This is mainly in the areas of agriculture, regional and employment policy. In that regard, it should be noted that it is the Member States for which the level of error is highest. I believe that we are able to achieve better results in the future. However, these will be conditional on better information, the introduction of effective preventive measures and, in particular, the realization that European funds must be spent effectively and not at all costs.

There has been a real will between the Commission, the Council - I regret the Council's departure - and Parliament to succeed very quickly in order to be effective. It is this political efficiency that has set our strategy. Commissioner, I think I can say a big thank you, because we started our work on 4 February and tomorrow we will be on 29 April. I believe that there are few European decisions that are being completed so efficiently and so quickly. My thanks will also go to all the shadow rapporteurs, whom I would like to quote here: Brando Benifei, for the group S and D, Jana 'it'ansk', for the ECR group, Martina Dlabajov, for the ALDE group, Terry Reintke, for the Greens/ALE group, and Patrick Le Hyaric, for the GUE/NGL group. Colleagues, we were able to silence our differences and unite our wills because we knew which way we wanted to work. What was the meaning of our work? We wanted Europe to be effective for youth employment. In the end, the Youth Employment Initiative is the most difficult part of successful youth employment. What for? Because it concerns the most troubled regions - where at least 25% of young people between the age of 15 and 25 are unemployed - and the most difficult audiences. It targets both young people who have left education without qualifications and audiences of young graduates who are unable to enter the world of work because there is no correspondence between their training and the needs of employers. So we were tackling the hardest part of the rock with this youth employment initiative. It took a lot of will, all together, together, to succeed in record time. I think that validates our work strategy. As rapporteur, I wanted us to share as much information as possible among all political groups. That is why, together with the Commission, with the Council, we have come together as much as we need to bring our political will in line with this unique goal of success for young people. Tonight, yes, I am proud of Europe because not only do we succeed unanimously in our will, but also in record time, to meet a real need for the ground. Because that is Europe. It also shows in this Chamber that it knows the needs of the land. Operational programs took some time to be signed. What do project owners on the ground need? They do need significant pre-financing. So when you propose, Commissioner, that this pre-financing be increased from 1% to 30%, it means that, yes, Europe knows the needs of the ground. Project owners cannot advance the much-needed funds, especially in the most troubled regions. It's a very effective boost. We are indeed in a race against time and, quite frankly, I hope that we will win it together. Tonight we must be proud of our work and I hope that tomorrow we will have a very significant vote which will be a message so that in the Member States we can roll up our sleeves and help with these projects of the Youth Employment Initiative. It is indeed these projects that we need.

I would like to congratulate Parliament on the record time in which the agreement was reached, both internally within the line committees and also with the Council on this crucial assistance to Youth Employment in the European Union. Let me also, in parallel, congratulate the Latvian Presidency for its engagement in this dossier that has been processed very efficiently as well, demonstrating that the priority to tackle youth unemployment in the Union is one that is shared by all European institutions. We have indeed no more time to lose as regards the swift implementation of the Youth Employment Initiative. Time is of the essence to provide the jobs and practical experience that would help bring young people into the labour market. We all need to live up to our commitment to Europe’s citizens, and that is what we all collectively have done by proposing, negotiating and adopting this regulation so quickly. The proposal under discussion today is to address an obstacle we identified with Member States which is hindering the speedy launch of the Youth Employment Initiative on the ground: this is the need for cash. We propose to increase the pre-financing in 2015 by close to EUR 1 billion. This will help accelerate the initiative and reach as many as 650 000 young people while remaining within the overall budget. We are convinced that this proposal – which you will adopt, I am sure, with a large majority – provides a strong incentive for Member States to speedily roll out the actions on the ground and thus support jobs, apprenticeships, traineeships and continued education. Implementation of the Youth Guarantee is now under way in all Member States with tangible results from some countries, as shown by the examples published in the European Semester country reports. The Youth Guarantee has provided impetus to both structural reforms of employment and education systems. It has also been a catalyst for supporting young people in school-to-work transitions. The present amendment of the ESF Regulation would also facilitate the timely implementation of the initiative which, given the urgency of the issue, has been designed to have a narrow timeframe. I would like to once again reassure the Members of this House that the Commission will process the payment of the increased initial pre-financing for 2015 immediately upon the entry into force of the amended regulation.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal responds to a situation that we have had many times to deplore. More than a year after the adoption of the text on the Youth Guarantee, the results are not there in the face of the scale of unemployment that affects one in five young people in Europe today and the risks of marginalisation, social exclusion and sustainable poverty.  Difficult implementation, insufficient investment, lack of ambition, all these symptoms affect the youth guarantee as it is currently implemented. We do not want an entire generation to be lost in this way. The text proposed here is therefore an indispensable measure to reduce the widening gap between young people, graduates of higher education, young people without a degree and those who have had an intermediate education. It is also essential to help young people stay in touch with the world of work and training. Essential, above all, to prevent the trap of long-term unemployment and its deleterious spiral.  Young people have been the main victims of the economic crisis since 2008. The most vulnerable among them are those who do not have a sufficient education or qualification. In addition, special attention should be paid to young people from immigrant backgrounds, with disabilities or with health problems, who should not be left out. So we had to react very quickly.

The Commission's surplus of EUR 1 billion, as well as the increase in pre-financing from 1% to 30%, are in fact concrete aid that will give a strong impetus to making this instrument operational, given that the Member States have not identified enough public funds to support these projects.  Europe has shown that it wants to do everything possible to reduce unemployment, i.e. even more so than in the last parliamentary term, but I appeal to the States and regions to take due account of aid for youth unemployment, which must be given top priority on national political agendas, in their planning.

As far as Italy is concerned, we still have a lot of work to do. But I don't do this as a party color because the unemployed for me can be communist, fascist, socialist, I don't care.

This Parliament has shown responsibility by adopting this measure very quickly until we allow a vote in plenary as early as tomorrow. This act will free up some EUR 1 billion of pre-financing for young Europeans who are not working or studying. In my country, for example, Italy, we will increase from just over EUR 5 million to more than EUR 175 million in advance. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Morin-Chartier, for her efforts and Commissioner Thyssen for her work, because she has been able to take on board with this legislative choice a strong request from the Group of the Party of European People's Party (S&amp;D), which has for years now raised the need to increase the pre-financing share of youth employment initiative programmes, in order to avoid liquidity problems in the Member States and regions.  We can say that Europe is now playing its part more. The floor now goes to the Member States, which must be able to make the best use of this incentive, starting first and foremost from a more effective communication of these instruments to the debureaucratisation of the programme towards companies, always making sure that the offers are of quality and always really aimed at the personal and professional growth of young people.  It is necessary to respond effectively to the critical issues that have been presented so far, including in terms of transparency and proper management of the funds, and the European Commission must monitor them together with Parliament. That is why, together with our colleagues in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we are preparing an oral question to the Member States with specific requests to achieve their maximum effort in order to produce tangible results. We will also be asking the European Commission in a letter for a commitment to transfer the additional amount of pre-financing without delay.  Every institution at government level must demonstrate its seriousness and commitment to the fight against youth unemployment, which is why no resources must be wasted. My generation has a right to a future and the European Union and the Member States must do everything in their power to get Europe out of the crisis.

This is certainly great news, but we must see it in a Pan-European context. Because when it comes to youth unemployment, the level here, too, rises to 10.1%. This is still a great result, considering that the West Austrian Epirus has a youth unemployment rate of 69.8%. That is why we must focus at European and national level on regions that need our immediate and effective support. The youth support initiative has a budget of EUR 3.2 billion. Thanks to pre-financing, a billion euro will be available immediately, of which over EUR 4 million for the Czech Republic. But of course we all know that jobs can't be bought. Jobs suitable for young graduates must be created in line with the real needs of the economy. I therefore consider it so important that programmes such as the Youth Employment Initiative be complemented by labour market reforms at national level.  The transition between study and work should be natural and the number of graduates in each field must be based on the real needs of the labour market. Let us pay attention to the levelling of skills and jobs, not only at national level, but also throughout the European Union. Let us simplify the rules for setting up companies and their financing, focus on technical and vocational training, support start-ups, internships, internships.

To be more specific, in Greece the official youth unemployment rate is close to 60%, when, in fact, it is perhaps even higher. What is worse is that this situation is not expected to change any time soon, despite the efforts being made, both at national and Union level. The reason I don't think things are going to change is the wrong approach we have to the problem. Instead of seeking to create permanent and decently paid jobs, we are focusing on a questionable re-education, as well as the creation of temporary and low-paid employment programmes.

A brave increase in the amount of the youth employment initiative is therefore urgently needed. Youth unemployment in Greece stands at 51.7%. Youth unemployment is also at a very high level in Spain and Portugal. At the same time, the inefficient use of the initiative in the countries of the European south is explained by the lack of public resources needed to launch projects offering new jobs, traineeships and training. At the same time, due to the memorandum cuts, Greece faces the greatest difficulties in finding co-financing, all the more so now that Draghi and his ECB team have imposed credit suffocation on Greece.

Since the launch of the initiative, there has been a lack of adequate implementation and measurable progress. We are all aware that time in times of unemployment plays an extremely important role, as long-term unemployment has much greater difficulties in returning to work. Moreover, in many cases, through a lack of work and income, young people are approaching the poverty threshold overnight, the overshooing of which further exacerbates their situation and their opportunities for reinsuche.

By the end of this year, we will then receive the progress reports from the Member States. Of course, as promised, we will provide you with summaries of this. I look forward to the debate that we can then have in this Chamber. At the beginning of 2016, we will give Parliament a global assessment of the effectiveness and impact of the joint support we provide with the European Social Fund and the specific Youth Employment Initiative, to indicate what all this has achieved to make member states' commitment to the Youth Guarantee a better place. In the meantime, we will continue to guide the Member States, the regions and the local authorities that want to do so, as far as we can, of course, within our competences. Many people have asked the question: is this enough? Is the budget of the Youth Employment Initiative in itself enough to create all these jobs and help young people to work? Is the youth employment policy we have in Europe sufficient? No, of course that's not enough. Only with the Youth Employment Initiative will we not get there. That is why we have other funds at our disposal. However, in many countries and regions there was a financial barrier to getting projects off the ground. The increase in pre-financing removes this financial obstacle and allows them to really start. So this should help. But beyond that, we still have ESF resources, European Regional Fund resources, resources to invest in people – including young people – in the Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) programme and resources in Erasmus+ and a number of other programmes. The policy itself is not enough either. Employment is a question of supply and demand. We have to work in both areas. That is why this Commission is using its entire policy to create sustainable growth and job creation. That is also why we will be working on initiatives to help the long-term unemployed get back to work, to make skills more suited to the needs, to ensure greater respect for vocational training, to make better vocational training available to young people, to have a good labour market policy in the Member States and to increase the number of issues. Our investment package must also be seen in this light. If everyone on their field takes responsibility, then we can do something and then we can give those young people perspective again.

The most tragic aspect of unemployment is the unemployment of young people who, while they are in the most productive years of their lives, with enormous potential and qualifications, with dreams and hopes and with a great appetite for work and supply, unfortunately end up in the endless queue of the Unemployment Fund. Youth unemployment rates exceed 25% in many European Union countries.

However, this seems to be a wishful thinking: as we have seen in France, with measures such as young jobs or jobs of the future, these programmes are often a failure. Indeed, the transition to employment will only be possible if jobs exist and these measures will not create jobs ex nihilo. The provision of all funds as early as 2015, as the Commission promises, is certainly commendable but will not be enough: youth unemployment is not due to the weakness of this pre-financing but to the disappearance and lack of jobs.

We need to revert to models where the requirements of the departments are linked to public education resources. Active business activities, microfinance should also be promoted for small and medium-sized employers.

Since the onset of the economic crisis, i.e. since 2008, youth unemployment has become an urgent challenge not only for the Institutions of the European Union, but also for Member States such as Lithuania, where the level of labour emigration has risen dramatically. This phenomenon is unfavourable from the point of view of the national economy. This requires immediate action, as the unemployment rate among young people has reached a dramatic level, which is steadily increasing. The European Union must share financial instruments with the Member States as soon as possible in order to improve this situation. The Youth Employment Initiative is one such measure as it provides an additional opportunity for europe's regions most affected by unemployment. Ensuring greater funding from the European Commission for job creation will undoubtedly become an important support for operational programmes in 2015. It is therefore the European Parliament's duty to enable the implementation of the rules in discussion as soon as possible. There is no doubt that an additional request from the European Commission to encourage Member States to benefit from new, increased funding for funding for allocating projects in the regions most demanding should receive parliament's unconditional approval.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in terms of estimating Parliament's revenues and expenditure for 2016, the Committee on Budgets wanted to stress from the outset the need to be part of the general context of budgetary rigour in all our countries and therefore to propose a realistic draft budget 2016, certainly, but very tight in terms of increasing appropriations.  Thus, from the outset, we agreed, firstly, that the European Parliament's budget for 2016 should be below 20% of the Union's total administrative expenditure and, secondly, that the increase in current operating appropriations, compared to 2015, should not exceed 1.6%.  It should be added, however, that the deadly terrorist attacks of recent months and, more generally, the persistence, if not the aggravation of these threats, have led us to reserve a very special place for the security issue. Thus, in addition to the 1.6% increase in the current budget, we have decided to create an exceptional endowment of EUR 15 million to strengthen, in particular in Brussels, the security of the European Parliament's buildings and also to allocate a significant proportion of the funds to the strengthening of cyber security, which all experts agree is that in the European Parliament it is both necessary and urgent.  Once this general framework was established, we focused on the operational priorities to be implemented for 2016 and, in fact, agreed on the need to strengthen a single priority, namely the strengthening of the financial resources to enable us to do our work better as parliamentarians. Since the Lisbon Treaty, as you all know, we have considerably strengthened powers in the area of legislation. A major effort has already been made to strengthen the staff of parliamentary committees in this area, but we remain too unarmed to exert real control over the delegated acts and acts of enforcement that flow directly from our legislative activity. We have therefore proposed a number of measures, on which we have agreed with the Council.  The first step is the strengthening, up to twenty new positions, of the secretariat of parliamentary committees, which must exercise control over a large number of delegated acts, acts of execution or multi-declination programmes. The second step is a request to the Office, which accepted it, to develop and implement new regulations to ensure a better balance between accredited and local assistants. It is clear, in the eyes of all people in good faith, that accredited assistants are essential to enable a Member of the European Parliament to carry out his work effectively as a co-legislator and in the control of the executive.  Third, in parallel with the one I have just mentioned, it was also decided, at the request of certain political groups and, later, the Office, to increase the so-called secretariat allowance. This measure, unlike the previous one, was not widely agreed. Some political groups and individual colleagues did not see it as timely or necessary. Others, on the contrary, are in favour of this, pointing out that this allowance has not been adapted since 2011, when the treatment of the most qualified employees deserves to be valued and the number of accredited assistants should also be increased. The agreement that has finally been reached between the Office and the Committee on Budgets on this subject is explicitly based on a very clear premise: the funds necessary to finance this implementation will only be released after the Bureau has developed a satisfactory new regulation with a view to strengthening the number of accredited assistants and better controlling local assistants by limiting their number.  Fourth, the assessment of a parliamentarian's performance is not only, or first of all, a question of quantity, but of quality, i.e. content. The current systems of classification of parliamentarians have the unfortunate effect of causing certain excesses, which must be stopped. For example, the Office and the Committee on Budgets agreed to ask the Conference of Presidents to ensure the implementation of new written question-and-answer regulations that put an end to their incredible inflation, which is of little or no interest, in too many cases. Taking into account the general framework and the priorities I have just pointed out, the Office and the Committee on Budgets have finally agreed to reduce 11,822,000 euros the Bureau's initial estimates. We have postponed the review of real estate policy and the financing arrangements for the KAD until the fall.

We have the government's target that the european Union's overall budget will be cut by 4% over the next seven years and that 1% of posts will be saved each year. It is therefore quite clear that 6% of the total budget of the European Union is available for administration. Of this 6%, Parliament takes up to a maximum of 20%. This year we have even fallen below this sum. I would like to thank the rapporteur because, in view of the general situation, extreme austerity is appropriate. With respect to the adjustment of the various resources, and in particular the secretarial resources – the ceilings, which are discussed time and again – I also welcome the fact that the various groups have different opinions. We believe that Members should decide individually who needs fewer staff, who needs fewer trainees, who needs fewer services. That is good for taxpayers. We very much welcome the fact that we are using a minimum here and that we are using the funds efficiently. On the other hand, there are, of course, a few Members of the House who have an enormous workload and who need very efficient staff in these areas. It is important here that the ceilings can be used accordingly. It is also a question of being able to obtain the services of the house only on request.

Firstly, the budget provides for secretarial aid to certain committees, but I do not see any support for the secretariat of the Committee on Petitions. We must understand that this is a very important committee, which has direct contact and relationship with the citizens of the European Union, accepts their requests, accepts their petitions and is the only way in which the European Parliament maintains direct contact with the citizens themselves. There must therefore be an increase in the secretarial support of the Committee on Petitions. Secondly, I am concerned about the notion that we should limit the number of written questions. The main activity of a parliament is to exercise parliamentary control. If we do not have the opportunity to ask questions, then it is obvious that we are limiting the very powers that we have.

I would like to emphasize the same thing, and part of this discussion, the problem of assistants and the financing of our offices has sparked a great debate in Croatia.

If I am followed tomorrow, they will be limited to five per parliamentarian per month, which means 60 for a parliamentary year. You should know that 80% of parliamentarians ask less than 60 questions a year.

The second inquiry concerned the implementation of the reform aimed at establishing a better balance between accredited assistants and parliamentary assistants.

The European Ombudsman has asked us to change our culture, admit that bad things happen, and while she argues that whistle-blowers are not enough to keep fraud, corruption and mismanagement out of EU institutions, they do have a role to play, in that they sound the alarm. Yet out of nine EU bodies, only two have responded adequately to the European Ombudsman’s insistence that they have internal rules on whistle-blowing. Only the Commission and the European Court of Auditors have in place policies for taking whistle-blowers’ concerns seriously and protecting the individual.  In regard to the protection of the LuxLeaks whistle-blowers, which is the topic we are discussing this evening, I waited to hear what the Commissioner might say, but I heard nothing – except that where there is no appropriate EU law it is up to the Member States. We know that, but I am wondering, has the Commission nothing more to say on this issue? It is because of the LuxLeaks whistle-blowers that we have now set up the Tax Committee (Special Committee on tax rulings and other measures in nature or effect) in this Parliament. At all times, but especially in times of crisis, citizens want to see equity in the tax system and transparency in the tax system and they want to know that their governments and, at an EU level cooperatively, that we are trying to ensure tax justice.

Taxpayers lose more than EUR 1 trillion a year through tax evasion and avoidance, Europe is being reduced to depression, while the decent are the stupid. Tax evasion is not a trade secret. Which citizen in Europe can rely on his trade secrets from the tax office? Whistleblowers must therefore be protected by law if they can expect their disclosures to protect higher public interests.

This means, therefore, that there is no contradiction between the public interest and the journalistic investigation that reveals tax evasion, because that is the public interest.  The prosecution of journalist Edouard Perrin is illegal and unacceptable because this journalist revealed the LuxLeaks scandal, revealed the responsibilities of certain countries, tax havens that give multinationals the opportunity to avoid tax. This prosecution is therefore unacceptable, it is illegal, it is contrary to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights itself.  We therefore denounce what is happening, because it is a gag of the right to free expression.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2467, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Miguel Viegas (GUE/NGL).", "mepid": "125100", "text": "   – Mr President, tax havens, fraud and tax evasion are at the heart of political and media news. They are, in itself, an accusatory libel directed at a capitalist system that is rotten inside and that of rotten will fall pushed by the struggle of the peoples. The fact that we are discussing the need to protect whistleblowers here reveals the complete failure of judicial systems and all the tax control and enforcement apparatus that have long been at the service of large companies. Indeed, political power has long been captured by economic power, serving its interests to the detriment of the people. The fact that Antoine Deltour, among others, risks five years in prison and a fine of more than 1 million euros is another aspect that reveals another complete reversal of the values and rules that determine who should be arrested and who should be at liberty.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2468, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Members for this discussion.  I would not like to give here the impression that the Commission is not doing anything. I mentioned that we have several pieces of legislation where other forms of protection for whistle-blowers is included. It was said here that whistle-blowers must be respected because they fulfil a very important task for society, for democracy and for law and that we should protect them; however, as I said before, this should be done mainly through national legislation.  As for the European level, I have already mentioned that protection has been included in the Market Abuse Directive. Data protection was also mentioned, so I would like to inform you that the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party issued guidance for the Member States on how to protect whistle-blowers within data protection legislation at national level. I would also like to inform you that the Anti-Money-Laundering Directive which was adopted in December 2014 contains a part which includes the protection of those who report suspicious financial transactions; this is also very important.  To go back to the LuxLeaks, which was mentioned several times, I hope you understand that the Commission cannot interfere in the Member States’ jurisdictions as is the case described here. However, we are taking the necessary measures to increase the transparency on tax rulings. This is a preventive measure to fight tax evasion and tax avoidance which would better protect whistle-blowers. On the European level, we want to introduce measures through which the public will get information in a very transparent way on the advantages that are provided by the Member States to companies in the tax sphere. We at the Commission have already approved the first step, which is reporting by the Member States. This reporting will use a central register, so everybody will see where these tax rulings are adopted.  The second step would involve country-by-country reporting, also from the companies themselves. This will be assessed in the course of the next few months to be sure that it will be the most efficient measure to fulfil the purpose, which is transparency and full information provided to European citizens. I believe these preventive steps will also help us fight tax evasion and tax avoidance, and, together with the protection of whistle-blowers at Member State level, this can help solve the problems we spoke about here.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2469, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Der Präsident. –", "mepid": "28242", "text": "   The debate is closed.

We are witnessing a very uneven legal framework between individual EU member states when it comes to effectively providing such protection. That is why we have a number of examples of pressures, insults and serious threats to which journalists and whistleblowers are exposed when they share their knowledge of people in public, i.e. criminals who cheat tax authorities.  Some member states have adequately protected journalists and whistleblowers. Some national legislation imposes sanctions on people who discriminate or are at risk of whistleblowers. It is necessary to preserve the anonymity of the persons who expose criminals. But I warn of the fact that national rules within the EU often lag behind international standards and best practice. In changing this situation, we too, MEPs need to be more active and accountable.  I am also concerned that we only get general assessments from the European Commission on the protection of whistleblowers and journalists, explaining that legislative regulation is in the hands of individual Member States. We need to give journalists and whistleblowers who expose tax evasion scandals firm guarantees and safe protection. That is why I believe that the EC needs to do more in the area of harmonisation of national legislation and standards on the protection of journalists and whistleblowers exposing tax evaders.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2471, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Benedek Jávor (Verts/ALE)", "mepid": "124721", "text": "  in writing. –  It is difficult to imagine corruption without the contribution of players who have the ability to abuse resources – mostly public resources – for the purpose of generating a private; only people with some kind of power in their hands are able to act as such. In order to prevent those powerful people from misusing public money we need people to counter them. Today, we cannot talk about a serious anti-corruption policy without meaningful protection for these brave men and women.  Whistleblowers play an important role in a democracy ensuring vital information in the public interest is brought to light. The level of the extent to which legal means and guarantees that serve to protect whistleblowers as well as the level of specially protected reporting channels are shockingly uneven when it comes to the different Member States. In view of the anomalies of different regulations, the weakness of national institutions, and recent atrocities and lawsuits brought against whistleblowers, it is high time that whistleblowers were guaranteed protection minimum across Europe.   The resolution voted by the EP in March on the report on the fight against fraud has demanded the Commission to propose legislation to this end and stop stalling.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2472, "date": "2015-04-28.json", "name": "Marco Valli (EFDD)", "mepid": "124778", "text": "  in writing. Following the LuxLeaks scandal, which has turned the world's spotlight on unacceptable tax avoidance practices in Europe, the establishment of a special committee of inquiry into tax rulings, a new Commission package on transparency and an intensive institutional debate on the need to put an end to unfair tax competition practices and to carry out a real reform of the tax system followed.  All this thanks to the denunciation of an auditor of PWC, Antoine Deltour, who preferred to act in support of transparency in the a priori defence of the commercial interests of multinationals, revealing information of vital public interest about scandalous facilitated tax agreements between Luxembourg and multinationals. Yet Antoine is now in danger of jail for the crime of violating the obligation of commercial secrecy. A paradoxical situation, which reveals even more deeply the flaws of a system totally dependent on the interests of lobbies and strong powers rather than on the public good.  The law also criminally prosecutes those who help fight tax evasion, while leaving aggressive tax practices unpunished. At the very least, it is essential to adopt a system of protection for whistleblowers as a matter of urgency. It is they who, most of all, in a system of absolute secrecy, can make a real contribution to the fight against tax evasion and avoidance.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}]
