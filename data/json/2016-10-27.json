But allow me also to dedicate it to the populations who were again hit by the earthquake this night in Italy and to the many volunteers who are already there. With the Commission for Culture, in our oral question, we thought it right to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of this initiative, asking the Commission and the Member States to create the most favorable conditions for the experience of volunteering throughout Europe to flourish, as a dimension. fundamental of freedom, responsibility of individuals or associates, but also as a concrete expression of those values ​​that Europe so badly needs, those of free commitment to others, solidarity, friendship, intercultural and interreligious dialogue and citizenship active. We know that today in Europe there are at least 100,000,000 volunteers, of all ages and social and personal conditions, engaged in the humanitarian, educational, scholastic, cultural, environmental and sports fields. We know that in every calamity, humanitarian crisis, emergency, such as those we are experiencing in Europe and on our borders, the precious work of the volunteers of non-profit associations and non-governmental organizations supports and often anticipates that of the institutions. We know that the free provision of voluntary services to the community produces not only inclusion, social cohesion, but also innovation, citizenship skills, creates wealth. It is estimated to contribute to 5% of the Union's GDP. The European Voluntary Service within Erasmus + sees more than 5,000 young people leave every year and now there are also other opportunities with the Europe of citizens, the volunteers of the European Union for humanitarian aid, but we must expand these opportunities also in the structural funds. President Juncker has announced the creation of a European Solidarity Corps, I am sure that Commissioner Navracsics will tell us about it, addressed to young people who follows up on the proposal that we have been making for a long time for a European civil service to finally be born, alongside volunteering, also based on the pilot project already underway between the various countries, including mine. But it must be born with the active involvement of associations and with additional resources. We must however, more than 5 years after the European Year of Volunteering, admit that many of the requests made by European volunteering and in particular by the European Volunteer Center have remained unanswered. There is no coordinated policy, there is still a point of contact, information within the EU. We ask the Commission to compare the national regulatory frameworks, to prepare a European legal framework that defines the status of volunteer, with rights and duties, which facilitates mobility, the recognition of skills acquired also in the context of the Europass, also promoting volunteering in Member States and in academic education systems. We also ask the Commission to address the recommendations of the Political Agenda for Volunteering and the European Charter for Volunteers to those Member States that have not yet legislated on the matter by establishing national voluntary service plans. It is also urgent that in the new financial regulation, the Commission recognizes as co-financing in European projects, the contribution of activities given by volunteers even if made free of charge. But we must create the necessary conditions so that everywhere the volunteering experience can become a shared and accessible experience for everyone, for all ages and personal conditions. Therefore, it must be possible to reconcile professional life and voluntary activities and also be supported, with a adequate legal and financial framework, associations and volunteer service centers for indispensable actions: tutoring, training and organization of volunteers. Just as it is essential that the experience gained abroad by the volunteers can become an opportunity for growth for the local and national community. I attended a meeting in Rome with the volunteers who have had this experience and one of the experiences that struck me most is that of handicapped children who have made \"their\" volunteers and who ask to be increasingly included in the field of the service. Finally, Commissioner Navracsics, I ask you to activate a major information and awareness campaign, in agreement with the European voluntary associations, to highlight its civil and social value. It is very important that for all young people there is this opportunity, that it can become, as in some countries, a part of the school / educational curriculum and that the experiences of comparison also multiply once they return from international, European experiences, because this enriches the communities local, creates bridges and not walls and constitutes a practiced experience of European and world citizenship.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "Tibor Navracsics", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, let me first express my solidarity to those people who are victims, or whose properties have been damaged or ruined during last night’s earthquake in Italy.  I will take this opportunity to highlight the role of the European Voluntary Service (EVS), which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year. I will also share with you my ideas on how to further develop the EVS and volunteering in Europe more broadly.  First of all, the EVS and its scope: over the past 20 years the EVS has offered volunteering placements abroad to over 100 000 people between 17 and 30 years of age, regardless of prior experience or qualifications. Around 40% of participants in the EVS are young people with fewer opportunities. They can volunteer anywhere in the EU, in our partner countries neighbouring the EU, as well as other partner countries in the world.  They can engage in a variety of activities: working with disadvantaged people, on environmental projects, for cultural events, and much more. They can work with NGOs, sport and culture organisations, private companies or regions and municipalities.  So the EVS is already covering a very broad scope, but we want more. We are promoting the EVS to get more and new stakeholders on board, notably through our 20th anniversary campaign. In particular, we want to increase the number of volunteering opportunities by creating partnerships between national volunteering bodies, municipalities, enterprises, NGOs and schools.  We are working on a new type of volunteering project, which will complement the current grassroots approach with larger-scale projects, having a stronger impact on volunteering systems. We also want to work with all those involved to improve the quality of volunteering further, through training models, handbooks and toolkits, as well as to promote innovative practices such as online and workshop volunteering. Crucially, we want to make sure that the skills acquired through volunteering are better recognised. This can play a part in helping young people find jobs.  The Commission is also working on a number of other initiatives to boost volunteering. To give young people more opportunities to engage in society, President Jean-Claude Juncker, in his State of the European Union address last month, announced the creation of the European Solidarity Corps. This initiative will give young people the opportunity to express their solidarity by helping others. It will help strengthen social cohesion and the core values of the EU.  The first phase of the European Solidarity Corps will be launched soon, with the first deployments in 2017. We want to have 100 000 young people signed up to the Corps by 2020. The Corps will build on existing professional and volunteering EU programmes for youth, and mobilise established networks of employment, education and civil society actors across Europe. It will be developed in close partnership with Member States, local authorities and NGOs.  And there is more: the Commission is encouraging universities to combine academic content with civic engagement by awarding study credits for volunteering. The SocialErasmus initiative encourages Erasmus students to engage in social and volunteering activities in their host country while abroad. The EU Aid Volunteers initiative, which focuses on humanitarian aid in countries outside the EU, is currently being prepared. The first volunteers will be deployed very soon. The Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund will support projects promoting the participation of third-country nationals in society and the Commission is supporting the Covenant on Demographic Change, which aims to create opportunities for older people to volunteer.  Regarding your question on the legal status of volunteers, this is a matter to be decided by Member States, whose approaches differ largely in this field. The Treaties do not provide the European Union with the competence to harmonise national laws in this area. However, a Council Recommendation in the field encourages Member States to promote the recognition of learning outcomes of voluntary activities. It also recommends the use of EU instruments that can facilitate cross-border voluntary activities such as Europass and Youthpass.  Third-country nationals can already volunteer in Europe. In 2015, 951 of them participated in the EVS. Furthermore, new rules on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of activities such as voluntary service will make it easier for young people from outside the EU to take part in the EVS. It is now up to Member States to implement the respective directive.  You also asked about the impact of volunteering on society and the economy. More than 70% of EVS volunteers believe that their volunteering experience has increased their chances on the labour market. Studies also reveal that there is a clear match between the competences developed through volunteering and the skills employers are seeking. Three out of four employers agreed that volunteering enhances job prospects. The Commission has also launched a new study on the impact of transnational volunteering on individuals, organisations and local communities. We will have the results in April 2017. Finally, to your question on promoting EU citizenship: the Commission is fostering EU citizenship, notably through the Erasmus+ and the Europe for Citizens programmes. Both of these programmes recognise the importance of volunteering, which is an essential element of active citizenship.  Every country has its very own tradition and culture of volunteering and there is a lot of variety across the European Union. A few Member States have a state-run civic service; in others, volunteering is organised by NGOs, and some have a mix of different forms. No single system can be easily applied to all Member States and I do not think we should try to do this. We should instead find a flexible approach that respects the diversity we have.  The Commission plans to map all existing national volunteering schemes to better exploit synergies between them. We are also currently funding several policy experimentation projects which should provide evidence for possible new transnational volunteering models.

I am very pleased that we are addressing this issue today and that the European Commission will also pay attention to it. As the Commissioner pointed out here, the European Voluntary Service provides activities that have already been used by 100,000 young Europeans, and we are commemorating 20 years of its existence this year. This service is there to enable young people under the age of 30 to take part in voluntary activities abroad, which can last up to 12 months, without the right to a salary, but with the possibility of providing accommodation, transport, insurance and food. It is certainly a great opportunity for young people that should be further developed. Volunteer projects can include many activities in the field of youth work, cultural activities, social care or environmental protection. We are discussing this topic here today because we believe that volunteering is an important and beneficial activity. It enriches young people with skills that are important for life and for their employment. For all, let's mention, for example, creativity, independence, responsibility or the ability to work in a team. Within international volunteer organizations, it is also the development of language skills. For adults and aging citizens, volunteering is an opportunity to pass on their life experiences and to have a meaningful amount of free time as they increase. I know a number of cases where, thanks to volunteering, monuments have been saved and festivals have been organized, but thanks to volunteering, children and young people are also being led to make meaningful use of their free time. Youth organizations run by volunteers were assessed in surveys of employers as those that make a major contribution to the non-formal and informal learning that employers expect from young people. And a separate chapter is the help of volunteers in crisis situations. In many countries, and I can mention just the Czech one Republic, for example, voluntary firefighters who work with young people, lead young people to save lives and property, are a very important leisure activity. Volunteers also help in countries affected by natural disasters and in migratory crises. I can say that I was very touched by how, for example, in a volunteer center in Italy, young people, but also seniors, helped with the teaching of the Italian language, with the processing of residence documents for refugees. And not only in Italy, but also in Germany and a number of other countries, volunteers from the Czech Republic also joined in the wave of migration and helped refugees in a difficult crisis situation. The resolution we are presenting here calls for volunteering to be better recognized as such, including the status of a European volunteer. And also as a source of certain skills, which should be taken into account in the context of mobility and the recognition of qualifications. The oral questions we have asked here must be said by the Commissioner. It is clear that the European Commission will further develop the European Voluntary Service, support it and also within Erasmus + the conditions must be improved, the administration simplified. I think that volunteering should remain a spontaneous activity which, as the Commissioner rightly said, should be regulated at national level. At European level, we can provide a European framework that is supposed to support, motivate, but not bind and obstruct. Thank you and I look forward to further discussion and support in the field of volunteering.

Volunteering is a very noble, but often not fully appreciated activity. Therefore, please allow me to start my speech by thanking all volunteers for their work, time, effort and energy. Volunteering, which is on the one hand a process of self-realization and learning, benefits both the volunteers themselves and society as a whole. It is also a hugely important factor in creating social capital and supporting social and economic cohesion. In the context of international exchanges, volunteering has great potential for integration. And if it takes place on the territory of the European Union, it helps to create a European identity. But this potential of cross-border volunteering is not being fully realized. According to data from 2014, it is estimated that around 92-94 million people were involved in voluntary activities, and only 7,000 - in cross-border activities. The full development of cross-border volunteering is hampered by legal, administrative, social and economic barriers, as well as the lack of proper information. This untapped potential is estimated at around EUR 65 million per year. And therefore it is necessary to develop a legal framework that would define the status of volunteering, but also the rights and obligations of volunteers. Mrs Silvia Costa, rightly mentioned the European Charter of the Rights and Responsibilities of Volunteers. We have to answer the question why, for example, a voluntary stay should not constitute a legal basis for a stay in a given country. For people from poorer and disadvantaged backgrounds, for people with disabilities, for example, incomplete health services, and often the loss of social benefits, including unemployment benefits, are a huge problem. Another issue that needs to be resolved is the appreciation of the skills and competences acquired in the course of business voluntary work - the Commissioner has rightly mentioned it. But it is essential that this recognition is promoted in the labor market, especially in the recruitment process. For this purpose, it is necessary to cooperate with employers so that they appreciate the importance of a voluntary internship. The recognition of volunteer working time as an eligible contribution (co-participation) in the case of EU grants should be implemented and supported as soon as possible, and the Commission itself has spoken about this recently. Question to the Commissioner: at what stage is the work on this at? Finally, the local level of volunteering needs to be strengthened in order to share experiences, but there is a need for high-quality information about the opportunities to participate in the program. In the context of the work on the revision of the Erasmus + program, it should be emphasized - as the Commissioner has already done - the great importance of this program for the European Voluntary Service. Each year, several thousand young people get to know another country through Erasmus volunteering, but voluntary organizations keep talking about the need to simplify the application. I have a question for the Commissioner. You spoke about the European Solidarity Corps. What is the relationship between this corpus, volunteering and Erasmus +?

I believe that everyone should participate at least once in their life in a volunteer initiative, and in young people such participation builds qualities and discipline, which are a basic prerequisite for their future development in society. The European Voluntary Service in this respect is a program that helps young people to volunteer abroad. This year it celebrated 20 years since its establishment. 20 years, during which she has assisted over 100 thousand volunteers. This figure speaks for itself about the potential of young people from European nations and the values ​​that volunteering instills in them and that they profess. Almost 100 million citizens of all ages are involved in volunteering, and their work contributes to generating about five percent of the European Union's gross domestic product. 2011 was declared the European Year of Volunteering and gave impetus to the development of policies and the presence of volunteering in key European programs. The movement of young people within the European Union, whether for training, practice or charity, has proven to have a positive impact and should be encouraged. Gaining experience, adapting to the new environment and exchanging good practices is certainly beneficial for all of us. I am proud to say that in Bulgaria - the country I represent - young people are ready and actively involved in such activities. My organization IMRO and I support and stimulate volunteering and are organizers of many activities related to voluntary work on cleaning parks, forests, assistance for the elderly, participation in public events, extinguishing forest fires and much more. Strengthening this activity in society is our duty. Active citizenship and responsibility are at the heart of any self-respecting society and volunteering is just that.Projects to stimulate young people and their participation are necessary and mandatory.All this must reach the most remote areas, the smallest municipalities and regions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 10, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "María Teresa Giménez Barbat", "mepid": "135491", "text": "on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, volunteering is included in key European Union programs such as Erasmus + and its European Voluntary Service, which this year celebrates its 20th anniversary. With the Resolution being voted on today, we want to underline the value of volunteer work. Being a volunteer means solidarity, freedom and responsibility at the same time. It means contributing personally to the strengthening of an idea of ​​active citizenship and of a more cohesive society. When volunteering takes place at the European level, it contributes directly to reinforcing one's own European citizenship. However, it is urgent to deepen this concept of volunteering, particularly in times of crisis, as a fundamental pillar of the integration process and for the promotion of union and solidarity in Europe. The European Voluntary Service is not yet well known; its communication should improve and its operation should be easier for those concerned. We also intend to highlight the role of volunteering as a factor of social cohesion, of personal growth of the individual, and even of contribution to economic development. Volunteer work in Europe, as one colleague has said, contributes to the production of 5% of GDP. We also recommend that Member States promote the European Voluntary Service in academic education systems. In my country, Spain, as in most European countries, volunteering is carried out mainly through individual initiatives and local communities, but international volunteering programs are not promoted in schools and neither is known the European Voluntary Service opportunities. I believe that greater cooperation between the European Union and the Member States through joint programs and greater internationalization of the offer could also serve to improve this European proposal. When we think of volunteering, we also think of young people.Volunteering is, in fact, one of the eight areas highlighted by the European Union Youth Strategy.But we must not forget the elderly and the fundamental role that volunteering can play in promoting a culture of active aging, especially if we aspire to a society that integrates all generations.We have come a long way since the celebration of the European Year of Volunteering Activities in 2011, and this is certainly a source of public pride, but we still have a long way to go.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 11, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "Curzio Maltese", "mepid": "125192", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic crisis, the sovereign debt crisis, the prevalence of a single neoliberal liberal thought have pushed many European states in recent years on the path of progressive cuts in public services, of extensive privatization. This solution proves to be more unsuccessful with each passing day from an ethical, economic, social, political point of view, creating a poorer, more unjust Europe, and fueling a revolt that today risks overwhelming the Union. If we want to save the European construction, we must return to the founding values ​​and European volunteering embodies these founding values, solidarity, cooperation and direct participation of citizens, in an exemplary way. As a journalist, I have witnessed extraordinary stories of volunteering in my country and in Europe, on the occasion of natural disasters, but also extraordinary difficulties in this sector. We are celebrating 20 years of European volunteering and we do well to celebrate and we do well to be happy with the 100,000 volunteers, but we know that it could be 5 times as much, 10 times as much if we invested more. This report is an excellent step forward, but some things are still missing, there is no shared legislation in Europe, above all there is a lack of adequate funds to develop this phenomenon. There are great difficulties in cross-border volunteering. We need to invest in this. We must remember that every euro invested in volunteering, as various colleagues reminded us, produces an extraordinary economic effect as well as an extraordinary civic and moral effect that is no less important than the economic effect. Help young people develop skills they really need in the world of work. There is a lot of discussion about company intervention programs in the school world that are not as efficient as the voluntary sector. It cannot be said that all investments that pass and are approved in this House have the same extraordinary effect, so I urge the Commissioner to ask for more investment, more communication on this area.(The speaker agrees to answer a \"blue card\" question (Rule 162 (8)))", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 12, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "Krystyna Łybacka (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "124883", "text": "question asked by picking up a blue card.- You very rightly mentioned the ethical values of volunteering.In this context, do you not consider, for example, the position of insurers to refuse insurance for disabled people on a voluntary basis to be extremely unethical and deplorable?Don't you find it unethical for every certificate required from a volunteer to be preceded by a fee?", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 13, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "Curzio Maltese (GUE/NGL)", "mepid": "125192", "text": "Answer to a \"blue card\" question.- I personally fight on the rights of people with disabilities together with other colleagues in this House in every sector, also in other sectors of education, in the new regulations for audiovisuals, as my colleagues in the Culture Commission know, so I am perfectlyagree to guarantee these rights as much as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 14, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "Ernest Maragall", "mepid": "124933", "text": "on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group. - Mr President, I believe that we are all quite agreeing on the assessment and diagnosis of what volunteering in Europe means today and what it may mean, of the obvious powers of the concept and of reality. Twenty years. One hundred thousand volunteers in the European Voluntary Service. Five years from the first European Year of Volunteering Activities. The proposed Resolution speaks of an estimated one hundred million volunteers and 5% of GDP. It is an estimate. I think that one of the issues - the motion for a resolution also says - is that we have to study more and we have to know better about the phenomenon, because it seems clear that we are being aware of the tip of the iceberg, a positive, extraordinary point. , but that surely hides realities and situations. In short, it carries very contradictory messages too. Let me tell you that, to some extent, the success or the appearance of success of the concept of volunteering in Europe - for example, in my own country in a very spectacular way - is also a measure, an indicator of social deficits, of needs not covered, of the situations of personal, individual and collective drama that our societies often continue to carry. Where the State does not reach or where the market produces disasters, there appears, indeed and fortunately, the voluntary service that, to a large extent, not only adds but replaces. In any case, let us be clear that there is this substitution value, that there is this value of occupying the space that perhaps could and should be naturally occupied in another way, and then the volunteering could effectively dedicate itself to simply adding, enriching, cooperating to create Europe, and it would be even better than it is now. I believe that we must also highlight the elements of this need for recognition that volunteering has in the sense of access to professionalism, of recognition of capabilities. And it is in that sense that I believe that Europe, the European Union, can and clearly must do more than it does now. We must assume the responsibility to create a framework, to stimulate mobility, to stimulate cooperation, to stimulate learning, to stimulate the coordination also of national legalities and regulations. Look, volunteering is basically a local phenomenon. It appears, is born and grows very close, in reality itself, in response to evident needs appreciated locally. We must avoid a certain risk - how would I say - of institutional arrogance, that from here we are going to organize everything, that from here we are going to know exactly how things have to be. Everything with the citizens because everything is done by the citizens. Please do not be tempted to regulate without citizens. Any progress in this area must be done with the NGOs, with those who are doing it, with those mainly involved. Finally, a scene from two weeks ago, right here in the European Parliament in Brussels. One day, the Italian Coast Guard comes to explain its magnificent activity in the Mediterranean of salvation, of recovery of refugees at sea and, the next day, the Catalan, Spanish NGO, Proactiva Open Arms, comes, which is not a complement , is that it adds value. It is essential; here there is no complementarity: it is a total necessity. Without that NGO, the deaths in the Mediterranean would be thousands more because the military ships cannot do the work that these volunteers do. Let's tell ourselves: not only do you have to congratulate them, you don't just have to reward them, as we just did; you have to know that they are an essential part of the existence of Europe as a concept and as an identity. And there we are. That is what you have to promote.

I begin by quoting the sentence from the resolution that I probably find most meaningful at the end of paragraph 3: \"stress that volunteers should never be considered and used as substitutes\". This is a fundamental point, especially at a time of continuing economic and social crisis such as the one we are facing in Europe. Forgetting this would involve the risk of depriving an undoubted and high added value of volunteering of meaning, simply making it a politically correct expression, placed as a justification for situations and initiatives lacking the necessary public support. It is then necessary to restore and promote a framework of values ​​where the sacralization of monetary gain at all costs and of non-solidarity individualism is replaced with a renewed sense of service to the community. In other words, activism. Our movement, the Five Star Movement, which was born on the day of St. Francis, in fact places activism at the center of our political action. For us, no one should be left behind. Furthermore, I consider that there are two preconditions for volunteering to be ethically and politically acceptable. First: the preparation of clear public policies and sufficiently equipped with economic resources, second: the existence of material conditions worthy of all citizens, i.e. work, social coverage systems, so that everyone has the necessary material availability to be able to undertake voluntary actions. Starting from these principles, it is clear that our society must open up to volunteering and stimulate it as a noble expression of an essential human need, as well as a form of active citizenship which is the basis of community life. Volunteering therefore appears to be able to open a positive path within European society. However, it is necessary to set a ceiling on voluntary employment if we do not want to fall into a flagrant contradiction with ourselves, since we must never consider volunteers as replacement labor. A similar warning then signals a significant sociological fact: where there is a conspicuous presence of volunteering, it means that there are shortcomings from the point of view of public policies. This must make us reflect, make us work to remedy these shortcomings whose causes must be identified and addressed. Furthermore, propaganda, emphasis and too strict rules do not reconcile with volunteering. Volunteering is a choice that is made in silence.

It seems to me that this truth is particularly relevant with regard to the work carried out in this institution. Indeed, who can deny the positive and enriching nature of volunteering? It is not only a question of putting oneself at the service of society, but also of drawing personal fulfillment through the skills that one acquires, the encounters that one can make and the satisfaction of the gift of oneself. We can therefore congratulate ourselves on the fact that over the past twenty years, more than 100,000 young people have taken part in European voluntary service. Still, I don't know if I should worry or admire your ability to twist every good idea in the service of your political ideology. You want to use volunteering to promote European citizenship. However, you forget that citizenship, no offense, is legally and essentially linked to nationality, this nationality which bothers you, because it prevents you from building a European federal state and because you have rooted, attached citizens. to their land, to their nation and to their traditions, these are all the more frontiers to your globalism. You praise the importance of volunteers in managing the refugee crisis. Is it really up to civil society to manage the doldrums that you politicians have created? By following Jean-Claude Juncker in his idea of ​​creating a European Solidarity Corps, you are showing no confidence in the citizens and you are admitting your total irresponsibility in the management of a disaster that you have encouraged; this is the whole point of the EU Aid Volunteers program, launched by DG ECHO. You want to send European volunteers to humanitarian projects all over the world. It's very charitable, well done. But what about the sans fixed domicile in Europe? Do you have a program to help our underprivileged? I remind you that according to the 2014 report of the European Observatory on Homelessness, in France, the number of homeless people has increased by 44% in eleven years, from 80,000 to 150,000 people. These figures are not more glorious in the rest of the European Union: 44% in the Czech Republic, 29% in Sweden, 21% in Germany, 17% in the Netherlands and 16% in Denmark. So I ask you the question: are you also counting on volunteers to help the needy in Europe? Civic service is a great idea, but know that it already exists in several Member States, where it can be effective and be a game-changer, that is to say closer to the citizens. For example, in France, in 2014 there were nearly 35,000 young people in civic service; 50,000 volunteer firefighters are under 35; or 27,000 young people between 11 and 18 years old are young sappers and are learning first aid. What do these examples show? They show that young people want to get involved, but that they want to get involved close to home, to improve the daily life of their grandparents and to be of service to their neighbors. This ties in with another of my concerns: I fear that, like what you are trying to do with Erasmus +, which was nevertheless your only success, you will pervert this beautiful commitment that is volunteering to make it a study of future posted workers with precarious statutes and wages and at the service of your large market. I hope, dear colleagues, that you will hear my message: yes to the recognition of the wonderful work done by the volunteers; no to its political recovery to save the furniture of a house which you yourselves set on fire.

This is an issue that concerns volunteers and I would like to highlight it. But beyond the informal form of volunteering, that is, the offer on a personal level, the formal form of volunteering has its good and bad side. The good one is more or less known. Formal volunteering has a substantial and long-term goal of the smooth integration of young people into the social system, the acquisition of strong skills and the cultivation of solidarity with fellow human beings. As a Christian and humanist I applaud it. The bad side, however, is the most invisible and unknown to the public. Formal volunteering is mainly related to NGOs. The majority of NGOs, which receive exorbitant amounts of funding, exploit volunteers and treat them as cheap labor. Thus, the voluntary provision of services is an excuse for some fraudsters to get rich by seizing national and community funds. That is why I will disagree with the recognition of volunteering as co-financing. I would rather disagree with promoting access for third-country nationals wishing to volunteer in Europe.

It is an important tool for non-formal learning and training. Volunteers often help those who need help the most, but on the other hand, they have a strong sense of usefulness. Needless to say, volunteering is a nice option even for those who are not integrated into the school system or the labor market. But perhaps they find a new opportunity in this environment. However, volunteering can also serve as a good example of intergenerational integration, so it is good and right for the European Parliament to address this issue. Congratulations to the rapporteur, Mrs Costa, on the initiative. I am sorry, however, that we have not decided on a different parliamentary procedure, which would give us more time to prepare an even better and more coherent text. This year marks five years since the European Year of Volunteering and twenty years since the creation of the European Voluntary Service, as we have heard several times today, in 2014 the European Voluntary Service was included in the umbrella European Erasmus + program for which I am the rapporteur. I can say that we are dealing with a success story in the European Union, one of the few. As the standing rapporteur on the implementation of Erasmus +, I can add that we should be proud of this program, also because it is not limited to the young, but also includes the elderly. I am currently preparing a report on the implementation of Erasmus +. The general conclusion is that despite some shortcomings, all stakeholders are satisfied with the new program. Despite the fact that we have increased its funding by 40% in this financial perspective, in practice we find that the needs for participation in various Erasmus + sub-programs are significantly greater than the financial possibilities. It is already clear that the potential of Erasmus + will need to be increased in the future. European Voluntary Service is an excellent service with clear frameworks operation. For example, the organizations working in it sign a quality charter. Participating volunteers between the ages of 17 and 30 dedicate themselves exclusively to voluntary activities for a period of two weeks to one year. It is known that EVS covers participants' travel and subsistence expenses, insurance and pocket money. Let me list a few more facts in the making of this document. To date, more than 100,000 volunteers have participated in EVS, as has already been mentioned. This figure alone tells us that the European Commission's communication strategy on EVS is not as bad as it seems. A small part of the text in the resolution refers to this service, a disproportionately larger part was devoted by the rapporteur to volunteering at national level and in general. That is why we have extended the initial title \"Resolution on EVS\" to \"Resolution on EVS and the promotion of volunteering in Europe\", which is more in line with the actual content of the resolution. In addition, much of the text is intended for organizations involved in volunteering, it might be a good idea to have even more text for end-users, ie. volunteers themselves. It is known that we have different traditions of volunteering in different countries. In some places the state has a big role, and in some places it is completely in the hands of voluntary organizations or civil society. Or there is something in between. Differences arise from these facts and this should never be overlooked. But we have one common task in front of us: to increase the capacity for international volunteering, so we need to strengthen European volunteering. To sum up: the resolution is good enough, its purpose is good and I hope we will support it.

Whilst the EU does not have competence in academic education and curriculum per se, it can be a formidable platform to recognise and promote the role that volunteering, together with sports and arts, plays in strengthening socialisation processes and for the development and wellbeing of societies and individuals, education for citizenship, and in acquiring lifelong transferable skills. Initiatives such as the EVS are more important than ever in times of economic hardship and high youth unemployment, increasing job prospects for young people. The challenge now is to ensure that they are accessible to the most vulnerable young people as well, and for people of all ages and horizons, including people with special needs, minorities, marginalised communities, migrants and refugees. In fact volunteering is a great opportunity for intergenerational learning and intercultural dialogue, necessary to build strong, open and inclusive societies. It must therefore be part of a long-term strategy to develop successful, functional and welcoming communities proud of their heritage and united in diversity. Indeed, informal and non—formal settings, widely used in the context of community education and work with underrepresented groups, provide opportunities for active promotion of common values of freedom, tolerance and non—discrimination and for learning about human rights, including women’s and children’s rights. Openness, tolerance, enriching experiences and encounters, intercultural dialogue and cultural diversity: those are the fundamental elements on which the EVS is based – and so is the European project. Particular recognition should therefore go to those who volunteer in times of crisis, stepping in when governments fail to act, such as the amazing volunteers who have done so much to help the desperate refugees in the Calais and Dunkirk camps, and also the British Muslim youth groups, who were amongst the first people to help the victims of last year’s terrible floods in Cumbria in my north—west England constituency, bringing together different ethnicities in a spirit of shared humanity. As a young person, I learned my values from my parents, but also from my experiences of volunteering. I am one of the people who was failed by conventional formal education, and I found my confidence, my sense of myself and my place in the world largely through volunteering. As a shy, gauche teenager, I joined a youth theatre, where, alongside our normal activities, we spent one evening a week volunteering at a centre for children with profound disabilities. These children became my friends, and I learned to overcome my fear of difference and to fight prejudice and discrimination for the rest of my life. Later I set up many youth theatres and watched young people in my care, many of them troubled and excluded, learn civic values and transferable skills through volunteer projects in their local community and through pan-European and international volunteering experiences. They were doing as I had done: encountering the other through intercultural dialogue and practical action, thereby learning tolerance and mutual respect. I therefore welcome the Commissioner’s statement, but I want to give a word of warning. Volunteering must never be used as an excuse for national governments to cut public services, such as museums, art centres, theatres, libraries and youth clubs, which is, sadly, happening in my country under the current Conservative government, who are replacing real jobs by exploiting the good nature of public-spirited citizens. Volunteering programmes that go hand in hand with a strong social structure and proper investment in public services, offering young volunteers recognition and career pathways and valuing the life experiences of older volunteers, are what is needed in modern society.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 26, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "Jana Žitňanská (ECR).", "mepid": "124901", "text": "- When we talk about volunteering, about altruistic care for your loved ones, about your community, about the world around you, I agree with what President Obama said: \"The best way not to succumb to despair is to get up and do something. Don't expect good things to happen to you. If you get up and do something good, you will fill the world with hope and you will also fill yourself with hope. ”In addition to altruism, which is virtuous in itself, volunteering deserves recognition and support for a number of other good reasons. It is an ideal way to voluntarily involve people who are worthwhile in useful activities, thus improving the lives of them and those who benefit from volunteering. It is a great way for young people to gain experience and improve their skills, and as we know, youth unemployment is our big common problem. It is an ideal way to use the life experiences of seniors, which will enrich the whole society and can give seniors a sense of application, usefulness, meaning of their future life. By that I mean that volunteering is not just a matter for a specific group - it is a matter for everyone, regardless of age, education or wealth. Volunteering is by definition a voluntary activity of the willing, and if we can find ways to support it, we will support other civic virtues in addition to the mentioned skills and gaining or passing on experience - interest in the world around us, participation in society, active citizenship. And these are the things that every healthy and functioning free society needs. And besides, volunteering creates measurable value, so we should measure and value it.

As a founder member of the Volunteering Interest Group in Parliament, I and many of my colleagues, many of whom are here today, have worked in partnership with voluntary groups in our own Member States and with the Centre for European Volunteering (CEV).  Indeed after 2011, the CEV coordinated the setting up of an alliance which fed into a document called the ‘Policy Agenda for Volunteering’. This document speaks of the partnership approach which will work towards building and enabling volunteering infrastructure in Europe. Indeed, our own resolution calls on the Commission to facilitate the development of a more coordinated volunteering policy with a view to establishing a single contact point in the Commission. One of the things that I have heard again and again, from the CEV in particular, is that volunteering is spread across a number of different DGs. We need to streamline the system.  Other issues that need to be dealt with include the fact that all Member States adopt the system developed by the ILO to measure volunteering. I am pleased to hear that the Commission is going to support volunteering as an essential part of third-level courses; indeed we have some excellent examples of what we call service learning in NUI Galway and St Angela’s in Sligo. I am also pleased to hear the announcement of the European Solidarity Corps.

It must be ensured, firstly, that they promote the values ​​of co-operation and solidarity and, secondly, that they are completely separated from actions aimed at replacing the welfare state and state structures and reinforcing distorted patterns of unpaid work. Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, in my view, in today's Europe, in the Europe of the crisis, in the current context, the concept of volunteering is being used as a euphemism. Most of the time it means what I pointed out above: exemption of the state from its responsibilities and problems that it has to face, false coverage of social needs. Commissioner, the economic crisis, unemployment, social problems are not natural phenomena that have arisen in some countries so suddenly and therefore can be tackled by individual or private action. It is a result, as has been seen, of the neoliberal policies pursued. Therefore, volunteering is a limited undertaking and can not deal effectively with all these consequences. I want to give you, at the end, two facts. In Greece in recent years about 1,200 young people have been involved in volunteering programs, at the same time that these years we have had the migration of 250,000 Greek scientists to other countries, not voluntarily, but compulsorily, in search of work.

My party and nation fully support anybody wishing to volunteer to help wherever the help may be needed. Indeed, our former Prime Minister, Mr Cameron, spent 200 million on his Big Society project after the 2010 election with precisely this in mind. In principle, this was a very good thing. However, because it was political, and not social and local, it failed, and nobody now speaks of the Big Society in any way except ironically.  Which brings me now to the EVS now celebrating, if that is the right word, its 20th anniversary. In reality, what it means is you are celebrating spending 20 years of throwing taxpayers’ money down the drain, and as if this was not enough, the Europe for Citizens programme will cost the taxpayers of our nations a whopping EUR 186 million between 2014 and 2020. Clearly, it is not fulfilling this objective as I see that the Committee on Culture and Education is now developing another citizenship initiative called the European civic service initiative. Just like every other EU project it is a waste of money, it is unnecessary and nobody has heard of it.

While the ostensible goals of these projects are laudable, they are failures under any benchmark and are never really what they say on the tin, so I say ‘stop them now’.

In German we have a nice word for it. We call this “volunteering” - voluntarily, but also without payment. Today, of course, it must also be emphasized and stated that this voluntariness has not only existed in Europe for 20 years, because voluntary organizations have been in existence in Central Europe for 150 years, especially in Germany and in my home country Austria: aid organizations such as the volunteer fire brigade for Examples that have been highly deserving for many, many years, rescue organizations such as mountain rescue, such as water rescue, and of course the charitable aid organizations that have been active for many, many years. I have been a member of the volunteer fire brigade myself since I was 14 and I am proud to be a member there to this day.

At least two weeks and no more than a year: With the support of the European Voluntary Service, 100,000 young Europeans have done a lot of good against racism and xenophobia, for tolerance and for understanding. You have already mentioned the cultural area. I am concerned with social services, for example by caring for the homeless or by giving people with disabilities a chance because young people are committed, or in dealing with older people - who are often lonely - or with the marginalized. Such reports of success of solidarity make one who works in the employment and social affairs area in the European Parliament proud. What has been achieved here is great. I also think it's a wonderful example for young people who often don't even know what to do with themselves. That is exactly the area, a highly motivating department. So far, however, Commissioner, the age limit has been from 17 to 30 years. Question: Shouldn't people who are a little older also take part in voluntary work, in order to discover for themselves that they can find access to existing initiatives? I think a good example is being set in my state of Hesse. There is a state volunteering agency there - a service point for citizens, clubs and associations. That is exactly the quality of information that many colleagues have just asked for. Opening up to the European level - yes, I think it is worth considering. Ms. Costa is absolutely right. This is an international project and cannot be seen in just one Member State. Your answer to the colleague from the National Front was absolutely correct and I support her. The possible extension - i.e. the age limit - could of course be achieved with financial resources. That is clear. Furthermore the EVS supports projects that contribute to personal and professional orientation so that competencies and skills can be acquired. Commissioner, you are right, recognition must come for this time. Voluntary - yes of course. But an acknowledgment for that. A lot of young people don't do it because of the money, but because they say: I would like to get involved. That's why it's a very important project, and above all you learn to develop an understanding of values. I think another focus is important too; this has already been indicated in the case of two colleagues. I am the rapporteur for the EPP Group on the integration of refugees into the labor market. For example, if you can help to say: I want to help with the initial reception facility. You can't always do everything pedagogically, that's clear, but you can help. Or with the unaccompanied refugees. There are people in a similar age range. I think that giving them a chance to be there is the most motivating factor, because integration really takes place. Or when it comes to developing language skills. You can't replace a teacher, but you can say: We are also involved, and we create access to local companies so that internships work.

I believe that the time is more than appropriate to take stock of what has been done on a European scale in support of volunteers and volunteering. We can start with the fact that 2011 has been declared the European Year of Volunteering. This demonstrates the European Union's commitment to supporting and encouraging citizens and organizations working with volunteers. Moreover, the European Union is sounding the alarm about the declining number of active volunteers and calling on the Member States to restore the attractiveness of volunteering. In 2013, in its resolution on volunteering and volunteering in Europe, the European Parliament emphasized the need for a common European approach to volunteering to create more opportunities for the mobility and employment of young people. Since 2014, the new Erasmus + program has enabled young Europeans to travel abroad and participate in volunteer projects. Last but not least, the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker announced the creation of a European Solidarity Corps, which will allow young people in the European Union to volunteer to help in crisis situations. The measures taken at European level have undoubtedly given a positive boost to the volunteering sector. However, there are still a number of challenges that still need to be addressed. First of all, it should be noted that there are still too many bureaucratic obstacles at national level, which significantly limit the opportunities for volunteering. At present, the activities of volunteers are not recognized in the legal systems of all Member States. To my great regret, in the context of the European attention to the topic, my country Bulgaria remains one of the few European countries that does not yet have an active one. law on the organization of volunteers. I have drafted a bill on volunteering, and in this regard I will set up a working group next week to discuss it. I believe that such a law would undoubtedly contribute to creating a favorable environment for the implementation of voluntary activities to improve their quality and to give them due recognition. I believe that it is extremely important to pay attention to issues such as the insurance of the volunteer, the reimbursement of his expenses, his accident insurance, training, qualification, respect for paid leave and length of service during the time of volunteering. With regard to possible action at European level, I share the view that the Commission must proceed with the formal recognition of European Voluntary Service status. Moreover, Member States can validate non-formal non-formal education obtained through volunteering. Last but not least, we must pay attention to youth volunteering, because it provides an opportunity to learn and acquire practical skills based on work experience.

Here my colleague from Austria spoke about voluntary fire brigades - in Poland it is very common. But it is not only about such permanent organizational forms, but also about events depending on certain situations - as it is now called. We recently had World Youth Day in Poland, millions of young people from all continents came and everything turned out great thanks to the work of thousands - mainly young, but not only - volunteers from all over Poland who were very actively involved in it. At this point, I would like to express my sincere thanks to them. However, it is worth saying that this idea should be supported wisely in order to support volunteering that already exists, and not one that, for example, would arise due to EU money, because such situations are bad, unacceptable and certainly not would build the authority of the European Union. It is a pity, in fact, that there are so few of us here today. My colleague from Great Britain said that there are a few people - well, not a few, I counted over thirty - but it is really worth supporting this idea, because in my opinion a certain enthusiasm, enthusiasm of young people in various directions should be given by us - European Parliament , The European Union - supported.

Voluntary work provides direct ways to learn and develop new skills. Volunteers can give and gain professional experience and expand their networks. Another great value of volunteering is that it brings people together, uniting people from diverse backgrounds to work towards a common goal and benefit our community, addressing human, social and environmental needs and concerns. A great example is the integral role that volunteers play in the current refugee crisis, restoring safety, dignity and hope to people whose lives have been uprooted by war and disaster. This year the European Voluntary Service celebrates its 20th anniversary. During this time about 100 000 volunteers have been supported. Acknowledging the tremendous added value of volunteering, more needs to be done in order to promote and foster voluntary activities. Increasing the understanding and transparency of informal and non—formal learning skills acquired during volunteering experience is essential and therefore Member States should implement concrete validation processes to ensure a better understanding and comparability of those skills and experience.  I believe that the scope, participants, areas of work and destinations of the EVS should be expanded.

Volunteering offers help to those who need it, and at the same time I provide meaningful content to people who help, which promotes interpersonal solidarity and cooperation. All too often we speak phrases here and in this building, and I think we should rather listen to the story from practice. This is what a long-term volunteer from the Czech Republic writes about volunteering: “I dedicate my time to people who need it, I played two hours of cards with one lady, I was silent with another for an hour and held her hand firmly. I also listened once for a long time to an interesting talk about flying around the world. It's weird, you've been flying in the clouds all your life, you have everything you want, and then someone who takes a bus to the sea will bring you a smile. But he also has everything he wants to have. ”Volunteering needs to be done with heart, desire and inner strength. This is not about money, prestige and racing, who's more, more and better. We should support such people and offer them a helping hand. I would like to say here that I highly value all European volunteers and their activities.

And all of us in Barcelona passionately appropriate those Games. I was a volunteer in 1992 when I was eighteen years old. Colleague Maragall, who preceded me in the use of the word, was the protagonist in the invention and organization of it. Today we also celebrate this other anniversary: ​​twenty years of the European Voluntary Service. \"Europe will show solidarity or it will not\": this was the message that the President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, gave us during the State of the Union debate last September when he referred to - and I quote - that solidarity is the glue that holds Europe together. ' As we said, twenty years of the European Voluntary Service have been completed, a service that has welcomed more than 100,000 young Europeans and has helped them improve many of their skills and competences, improve their curriculum and, ultimately, provide them with an experience of Incalculable value. When we talk about the European volunteering service, we talk about empowering European citizens who are between seventeen and thirty years old and who, through this service, can get to know other cultures, learn new languages ​​and improve the lives of people close to them thanks to volunteering. This helps us to create and enhance the feeling of European citizenship. Good initiatives such as the train ticket for young Europeans who turn eighteen - which we provided yesterday with a budget line -; the European social pillar, which we are building and which we hope will soon see the light; and the achievement of the social triple A in Europe will also help us to knock down the shadows of the walls that they stalk the Union. Europe - Manfred Weber said yesterday - needs unity, determination and leadership. We must get closer to the European society, to the society of tomorrow and make reach each institute, each school, each classroom, each desk in the European Union, the information necessary for European youth to take a step forward, take pride in the Union's values ​​- peace, solidarity and the common good - and demand their fulfillment from us. And why not, on this twentieth anniversary, start exploring the possibilities of expanding the program to include volunteer service geared toward active aging. It probably doesn't look like it, but it's Europe's time. We must be aware of this and open our focus in order to take advantage of the opportunities we have. We have the European Commission proposal for the establishment of a European Solidarity Corps and we celebrate twenty years of this European volunteer service: let's take advantage of it.

We ask the Commission to promote a more coordinated European policy on volunteering, including through a single point of contact that will improve access to programs and the interaction of initiatives.

It strengthens the participation of citizens in the fight against social exclusion, poverty and injustice. At the same time, volunteers, and especially young people, can gain experience and enhance a sense of self-satisfaction. In the last twenty years, approximately 100,000 young people have participated in international volunteering, through European volunteering programs, contributing to various fields, such as art, health, sports, social welfare, etc. According to a Eurobarometer survey conducted in April 2015, the most popular volunteering programs are in the fields of charity with 44%, education with 40% and art and culture with 15%. Neoliberalism and the memoranda dismantled the social structures of the state, with the result that volunteering, for reasons of social solidarity, was called upon to fill the gaps arising from the reduction of the welfare state. In the Greece of the memoranda, the solidarity structures supported the impoverished Greek people, with the creation of social pharmacies, social clinics, social grocery stores and social tuition centers. Of course, volunteering cannot and should not replace the welfare state, nor can it be an alibi for banking to dismantle state solidarity structures. On the other hand, various experts, taking advantage of the state's inability to respond to the recent pressures due to the refugee crisis, wearing the lion of volunteerism, have created various NGOs and are now partying with European Union funds for refugees, taking advantage of themselves. unfortunate refugees.

It is really impressive to know that 100 million people in Europe are involved in volunteering and that they contribute 5% to their total GDP.

Twenty years of experience. There are indeed as many unique experiences as there are participants. More than 100,000 individuals have thus experienced an enriching adventure both individually and collectively because, basically, this is volunteering: a rewarding experience but, above all, an experience to be valued. The European Union has understood this well by insisting in all its initiatives on informal and non-formal learning, this school of life which has nothing to envy to academic courses. This is why I am convinced that everyone should be encouraged to take part in this type of commitment and program, regardless of age, gender or background. These programs must be opened up to citizens as much as possible, valuing the work carried out by recognizing - an extremely important point - the resulting skills and, also, formalizing the recognition of the status of European volunteer. Volunteering is the European spirit in what is most concrete; it is the expression of solidarity; it is citizenship that does useful work; it is openness to the world and to others. These voluntary activities contribute to mutual and intercultural understanding, an understanding of the other which, too often, is lacking in our societies. Thanks to the European voluntary service, win-win relationships are established and strong human adventures are born. Access to these initiatives must be encouraged and, more generally, the possibilities of European mobility developed, in particular for young people. This new generation asks only that, as demonstrated by various programs, including Erasmus +. All the studies prove it. There is no single model, only one path worth following to find your place in society. Alongside traditional courses, we must in particular stimulate and promote learning through work-study program, which offers a royal route to employment, including with experience abroad. For a few months now, with the European Parliament and with the Commission, which has made a clear commitment, we have been developing this mobility in a pilot project. The European voluntary service is twenty years old, a good age for travel. On the occasion of this anniversary, if there is one wish that can be formulated, it is that this voluntary service be recognized at its true value, a European Union value. European voluntary service, Erasmus + and European work-study programs are all links that will cement the European cohesion of tomorrow. It is a response to those who plead for identities of closure and withdrawal. We must oppose them with open identities with young people, citizens who are well of their village, their region, their country, the European Union, but who are also actors of the world, a generation which does not cultivate egoism but, on the contrary, solidarity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 42, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "Jonás Fernández (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "125046", "text": "- Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank Silvia Costa for this initiative, as well as for this debate and this motion for a resolution that is going to be approved, and also for the initiative of a written statement that some Members have put in place to get forward, to improve the European Voluntary Service and to try, at this time of our twentieth birthday, to give a new impetus to recover many young people and many people who want to collaborate with their communities.

On the one hand, work with the community, social assistance, collaboration with the people who need it most, support in these days when we see refugees arriving in Europe. That solidarity, that closeness with citizens, with people who suffer is the best of the European project. But, in addition, the European Voluntary Service also helps to build the European demos, it helps to build European society; It helps the ideal of European citizens, the ideal of European citizenship, to recover and integrate people and give - as I was saying - a new impetus to the European dream in which we are working. I am grateful to the Commission for the proposals it has made here today to try to improve it. I think there are ideas in this House that can help give a new impetus: not only to focus on young people, but also on all ages; create a statute for the European volunteer; improve collaboration with third countries and see how the European Voluntary Service fits in with the initiative that Mr Juncker presented to us in the Union debate to create a volunteer corps that, in this case, helps refugees.

Commissioner! Volunteering as an initiative that already connects around 100 million Europeans in pursuit of one goal - helping those in need, requires support and good coordination. The willingness to help in the form of volunteering not only increases social commitment, but also activates people of different age and social groups, educates and promotes values ​​such as solidarity, cooperation, leadership and organizational skills, and sensitivity to the needs of other people. Many speakers have already mentioned the anniversary of the European Voluntary Service, which enabled young people to support initiatives in which they believe: helping refugees and immigrants, promoting pro-ecological attitudes, helping children and seniors, or working for non-governmental organizations. Volunteering is not only helping those in need, but also an investment in your own development and competences. It is also an important tool for civic and European education. Thanks to it, young Europeans can have direct contact with other cultures, people and customs in the countries where they help. It is worth adding that for many organizations, the involvement of volunteers in the work of these entities is often an essential element of their functioning. The benefits of this activity are mutual, and not only for the parties directly involved, as they also have a broad economic dimension and contribute to economic development, generating nearly 5% of European GDP. A good example of voluntary activities is volunteering in the dimension of sport. Local sports clubs play an important role in social and cultural life in most Member States, so it is worth disseminating these patterns, also on the pan-European and more broadly international level. Volunteers need a space to learn and gain experience, but they also need to be entitled to appropriate training in a first step to help them better understand the organization they work in and the environment in which they will operate. Scale European Voluntary Service requires simplification of procedures for the involvement of both young and old people.Ease of access, a quick registration process and comprehensive information and insurance are key.It should also be possible for participants to use the acquired skills in other forms of assistance or in regional initiatives.European Voluntary Service is for people who want more from life and therefore it is worth supporting them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 44, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "Doru-Claudian Frunzulică (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124790", "text": "   – Madam President, the European Year of Volunteering 2011 represented a major political opportunity to highlight the added value of volunteering in Europe.

In Croatia, for example, civil society organizations are a driver of volunteering. They are the only ones who educate volunteers and volunteer organizers and organize activities. For every euro received, they withdraw another 4 taxable euros from the state budget from European funds, but their effect on the economy is not valorized nor are they a component of GDP.

It gives us a very good opportunity to discuss all the important aspects of volunteering. There is a growing awareness now of the importance of volunteering. The long list of discontent demonstrates this fact and I think this discussion was a very fruitful and useful discussion for us. When developing the concept and the scheme of the European Voluntary Service we can put all your remarks into the further drafts of the European Voluntary Service schemes.  Let me emphasise one thing. Volunteering is not an ideological issue for me and I think this has been well demonstrated by the fact that we have a lot of supportive remarks from all the political groups in Parliament. This again demonstrates that this is a consensual issue and we have to do more in developing volunteering at local level, regional level, national level, and also at the European level.  What is the fundamental mission of the European Voluntary Service? It is not building up a homogeneous European voluntary scheme. It is about help, it is about solidarity, and it is about charity. The fundamental mission of the European Voluntary Service is to help local initiatives and we do exactly that. We have a lot of projects which help local stakeholders, NGOs, local activists in implementing their own initiatives and we help young people to be mobile. We support mobility schemes to acquire skills and to acquire knowledge in each other’s Member States.  The second, and probably the most important, aspect of volunteering is acquiring skills, and that could be very important in tackling youth unemployment. That is why, when we review the European Qualifications Framework, we will put volunteering skills into the European Qualifications Framework and acknowledge those skills which could be acquired during volunteering.  I think this is quite important because it can help us to promote social cohesion, to give one more chance to those people who have a different social background and probably cannot simply enter the labour market, but by volunteering they can acquire those very important skills which can help them to get better job opportunities.  Last, but not least, we are aware of the fact that the European Voluntary Service concentrates mostly on young people but, as I just mentioned in my introductory remarks, we are working on broadening the scope and giving the opportunity for older people to be included in our schemes and giving them the opportunity to work as volunteers in the framework of the European Voluntary Service.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 57, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "Elnök asszony. –", "mepid": "102886", "text": "Six motions for resolutions have been sent to me.I close the debate.The vote will take place today, 27 October 2016, at 12 noon.Written declarations (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 58, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "Luigi Morgano (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "124788", "text": "in writing. - Today we celebrate 20 years of the European Voluntary Service.

First of all, I would like to thank all my fellow Members, the shadow rapporteurs, the consultants, my colleagues and everyone who contributed to the report. The economic crisis has hit young people hard, with long-term consequences. Youth unemployment has risen, the gap between certain groups of young people has widened, and some of them have been increasingly excluded from social life. The vision of many of them became uncertain and social passivity increased. Young people are one of Europe's greatest resources, the key to its future. The European Union and the Member States must therefore not overlook the potential of the creativity, creativity and knowledge of the ninety million young people in Europe. An analysis of recent statistics shows that education and employment indicators show positive trends, although they still vary widely from one Member State to another. In the light of the results, we must continue to look for better solutions to the new problems of young people, and it is very important that more systematic cooperation is needed in several policy areas, such as employment, education and training, social policy, youth policy, sport, culture and others. Youth unemployment has fallen in most Member States recently, but the current number remains a major concern. For example, that impoverishment threatens nearly 27 million young people. Young people have a higher poverty rate, part-time work and temporary employment, which often lasts longer, compared to the total population, which fixes a low quality of life for this generation. Therefore, job creation and the promotion of youth employment should be an important priority. Young people are not equally affected by the risk of inactivity, poverty and marginalization. For those who already have fewer opportunities in life or live in less developed regions, the disadvantages often only accumulate. They are more likely to become “NEETs” young people, so catch-up programs, social and talent programs to overcome these disadvantages, and a wide range of information about the opportunities available are very important. Support for mother-tongue education for national minorities should also be emphasized in this area, which is an important priority in the report and is in line with the Committee of the Regions' opinion on a similar subject. Europe also urgently needs to activate young people due to its aging population: a conscious family and youth policy, home-building subsidies and family tax breaks can be of great help. Some countries have recognized this and the indicators have started to improve, such as in Hungary, but we still have work to do in this area. The report emphasizes the importance of the role of the family, school, sport and religious communities in the socialization of young people, but also the involvement of local and regional authorities in youth policy. Knowledge and qualifications are still the greatest value. The share of the unemployed is still lower among graduates than among the unskilled. It is therefore important to improve the quality of education and to better and more effectively match it with labor market needs. We need to better align school and education with the world of work in order to give young people a better chance of entering the labor market. There is a need to increase the dominance of digital and applied sciences, and to improve digital and other skills. The recognition of skills acquired through informal, non-formal and lifelong learning, as well as the cross-border mutual recognition of academic degrees and higher qualifications in the European labor market, is very important.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 61, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "Λευτέρης Χριστοφόρου (", "mepid": "26837", "text": "PPE). - Madam President, I believe that the cause of our young people must be the first priority for all Europeans, and especially for the European Union.

At the same time, I believe that our young people must be the ones to take the initiative, and I believe that if Europe wants to invest in its future, it must invest primarily in young people. I believe that many young people are socially excluded and marginalized, and it is very important to create a pan-European fund to support young people in all forms, especially for their studies.

Also, young people with disabilities have additional obstacles in integrating into the labor market due to mentalities, but also the lack of regulations to encourage companies to hire them. Of course, many things are about subsidiarity, but if we are talking about the single market, then we must also have European policies. Much more funding is needed for formal and non-formal education, for vocational and dual education. Personally, I regret that in the 2017 budget the funds proposed by the Parliament for SMEs have been diminished, because many of the SMEs are created by young people and the employees are young.

We can salute the success of Erasmus and many other things, but we have the Youth Guarantee halfway through and we have the Youth Employment Initiative still under review of how it is working in the different States. Perhaps it is time to adopt a policy in the name of the general European common interest; to know that only through authentic mutual relationships between countries, realities, regions, etc., can we obtain results.

On this, Europe must be more courageous, because investing in young people is equivalent to investing in the future of Europe itself. In this sense, I believe it is fundamental, both at European, national and regional level, for the various European programs dealing with youth policies to be communicated, implemented and coordinated more effectively.

I would also like to thank all the participants for their very valuable remarks in that debate. Thanks to the joint report, we defined our new shared priorities in the field of youth, which all contribute to the current top priorities of the EU. I am very pleased that the European Parliament is stressing the importance of the EU Youth Strategy. It is indeed an essential framework that has proved useful for Member States and for young people. The mid—term evaluation of the EU Youth Strategy conducted for the years 2010-2015 shows many positive impacts of European cooperation in the youth field. With the EU Youth Strategy Work Plan for 2016—2018 we have a focused cooperation agenda which deals with important issues: the need for increased social inclusion of all young people, stronger youth participation in democratic and civic life, and an easier transition of young people from youth to adulthood. Your report also stresses the importance of the structured dialogue with young people. I believe that this tool is very useful to engage with young people. For example, more than 67 000 young people participated in the consultation on the evaluation of youth policy cooperation in the EU launched during the summer. However, there is room for improvement. To this end, I want to promote bottom—up mechanisms, such as the one developed with my One Million outreach project and the New Narrative for Europe, where young people from a broader range of backgrounds make their voice heard and participate. Your report focuses on investing in young people through the creation of quality and secure jobs, more mobility, more apprenticeship and a stronger focus on key competences such as digital skills and entrepreneurship. I particularly welcome the emphasis the report places on promoting civic education and a set of soft competences that will contribute to personal development and will ensure young people’s engagement in society, critical thinking and languages, for instance. For this to happen, Europe has to optimise its education assistance and fully exploit all aspects of education, both formal and non-formal. Europe also needs to get better at linking the worlds of education and the job market. Cooperation with education and training providers is also an integral part of the Youth Guarantee. Schools’ central role in supporting its implementations stems from their ability to ensure that pupils make the most of the opportunities at school, signal where there is a risk of early exits, and provide support to students on professional pathways available to them. We need to continue and step up our efforts to address youth unemployment. From the Commission’s side, we want to continue supporting Member States and particularly the hardest hit regions. That is why we have proposed to further boost the Youth Employment Initiative with EUR 1 billion for 2017—2020, which should be matched by at least another EUR 1 billion from the European Social Fund. This will make it possible to support more young people after 2020 in Member States most affected by youth unemployment. National funding to boost youth unemployment also needs to be prioritised in Member States’ budgets, as the European structural and investment funds and the Youth Employment Initiative alone are not sufficient to overcome the problem. Finally, your report rightly stresses the importance of supporting and recognising youth voluntary activities as a form of non-formal learning. The Commission could not agree more. This is why we are strengthening youth volunteering in all its forms, not least by launching the European Solidarity Corps in the very year of the twentieth anniversary of the European Voluntary Service. The Corps will allow even more young people in Europe to get this life experience and to make a valuable contribution to our society. We aim to have 100 000 young people signed up by 2020.

We are in the midst of a paradox: the budget of the common agricultural policy represents almost 40% of the budget of the European Union and employment is at the dawn of our priorities, the first that we have recorded within the bodies of the European Union. For more than 50 years, the common agricultural policy has modeled agriculture by orienting it towards the intensification of its production (s) towards international markets and by developing increasingly concentrated and specialized farms. These choices were marked by a spectacular increase in labor productivity, which had a considerable impact on agricultural employment. In 1957, in a Europe of six, farmers represented 20% of the workforce across the European Union. They are now only 4% in a Union of twenty-eight. Over the past decade, we have lost a quarter of our farms. If we continue with this policy, we will not be able to attract young people in the years to come. Furthermore, over time, the CAP has gradually lost its legitimacy. Today, it no longer meets the needs of farmers and it is contested by all of our European citizens. The elements which have structured the common agricultural policy for a long time are no longer appropriate today, and the liberal choice applied to this policy since the 1990s has led us to a dead end. This model destroys many jobs in production and in the territories, and more particularly in the most fragile. We need to thoroughly rethink the CAP, which must remain a common policy for all European agriculture. Today we are faced with several challenges: the food challenge, the environmental and climatic challenge and the territorial challenge. As for the challenge food, the CAP must ensure, as a priority, the food security of the 500 million European citizens and give everyone access to sufficient food in quantity and quality. The issue of human health and the nutritional aspect must be at the heart of the future reform of the common agricultural policy. One in two Europeans has concerns about being overweight or obese. As for cancer, the new forms of the disease among young European populations, young men and young women, especially in rural areas, cannot leave us indifferent to the policies that we must implement. The environmental and climate challenge and the productivist model show us every day their limits in terms of sustainability. Above all, it is important to produce, but to produce better by managing more efficiently and better protecting natural resources and biodiversity, which can play a positive role for the climate thanks to soils. This presupposes changes in our production methods, which will have to be adapted to each region and each ecosystem. We cannot grasp the territorial challenge with force. We need to re-territorialize agriculture. Agriculture is an essential component of the development of rural and peri-urban territories. In addition, these territories conceal significant resources making it possible to diversify agricultural and forestry activities. We must reinvest in short circuits, circular economies and organic farming. The responses to these challenges lead to three specific responses: a main policy to help young people settle in; a policy of regulating agricultural markets - direct aid must be re-legitimized and targeting small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises at Community level; a developed rural policy that enhances territorial engineering and, in the field of international trade, the market must be reinvested European.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 82, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "Franc Bogovič (PPE).", "mepid": "125004", "text": "- Thank you for the floor, thank you also to my colleague Eric Andrieu for the report, in which he emphasized the very important area of employment and the links between this employment in rural areas and agriculture.We are all following these trends, which are similar all over Europe, that is, the number of farms is declining, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for young people to become interested in agricultural activity.That is why I think that one of the measures we have in agricultural policy, that is the measure for young farmers, is one of the highest quality, which also gives the best results.Because the Slovenian countryside and, of course, the European countryside really need young people, new knowledge, new approaches, because I am afraid that it will be very difficult to resist modern trends only in the old, traditional way.I myself think that digitalisation is also one that, together with rural mobility, should be put in the context of agricultural policy, regional policies, and thus also improve employment in rural areas.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 83, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "Nicola Caputo (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124851", "text": "- Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to implement a comprehensive generational renewal strategy, it is essential that the Member States give young farmers concrete prospects, making full use of the aid from the first and second pillars of the CAP.

I would also like to thank the honourable Members who contributed to this morning's debate on the report. This report is a very useful contribution to the debate about the way in which the agri-food sector can realise its potential to contribute to growth and job creation in the EU over the coming years, particularly in rural areas where employment opportunities are not as plentiful. Just last month, more than 340 stakeholders, representing all shades of opinion and from all 28 Member States, gathered in Ireland and agreed on the Cork 2.0 Declaration entitled ‘A better life in rural areas’. I am particularly pleased to note that the European Parliament was well represented at the conference. The document agreed is a shared blueprint for the development of rural areas and recognises the fundamental importance of agriculture, forestry and their related sectors for the economic and social development of viable rural areas and communities. The associated value chains of the agriculture and forestry sectors are engines of rural growth, providing jobs and livelihoods to tens of millions of Europeans. The EU’s Rural Development Policy plays a very important role in securing and creating jobs and growth in rural areas through investments in farm competitiveness, diversifying farm businesses, promoting innovative approaches, or fostering knowledge transfer. The unemployment rate in rural areas has shown a positive trend in recent years, with 2015 values already at the level of 2009. Nonetheless, we can and must do more. For example, we need to significantly improve access to fast or ultra-fast broadband to allow rural areas to seize the opportunities of the digital society, like e-commerce. Commissioner Hogan is particularly focused on the issue of rural broadband and regards it as a priority for the further development of our rural communities. Commissioner Hogan has also stressed the value of adding value through the achievement of quality recognition for high-quality agricultural products. This recognition will increase the added value for primary producers and is essential for boosting exports and therefore maintaining and creating jobs. It is encouraging to see how interest in achieving such status is increasing. The Cork 2.0 Declaration recognises that bottom-up and locally-led initiatives should be rolled out to mobilise rural potentials. Integrated and participatory local development strategies based on approaches like Leader have proved their value and will be important to ensure dynamic rural areas as well as securing and creating jobs and growth. Having created a vision for the development of rural areas and communities, one must make it happen, and that requires investment. Therefore, facilitating access to finance is crucial to encourage investment and the setting up of new enterprises. We also need to think beyond traditional means of finance and credit, which are often not available to young entrepreneurs. The use of innovative financial instruments has enormous potential in this area as a means of having a positive effect on job creation in rural areas. Indeed, the recent proposal accompanying the review of the MFF specifically includes provision to make access to finance easier for young farmers. Europe is the world’s biggest agri-food trading region, with record export levels achieved in 2015 of EUR 129 billion, confirming the EU’s position as the world’s most important exporter of agri-food products. In the State of the Union address, President Juncker pointed out that trade means jobs. For every one billion euros of additional exports, 14 000 extra jobs are created across the EU, and more than 30 million jobs. One in seven of all jobs in the EU now depend on exports to the rest of the world. The EU is also the world’s biggest importer of agri-food products. It is closely involved in global value chains and needs to rely on stable trade relations and functioning global markets. The agri-food sector is the largest provider of employment in the EU, with 44 million people employed. Many of the challenges quite rightly identified in the report can be addressed with the tools already available in the common agricultural policy, in particular under the rural development policy. But we need to constantly ask ourselves if the policy is fit for purpose and how we can do better. Reflecting these questions, the Commission will now consult widely on the modernisation and simplification of the CAP, as included in the work programme for 2017 presented to this House on Tuesday. I know that Commissioner Hogan welcomes and indeed looks forward to your suggestions. Together with the recent Cork 2.0 Declaration, they could be used to identify consistent ways to boost jobs, growth and investment in rural areas for the benefit, not only of our rural communities, but for the European economy as a whole.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 98, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "Elnök asszony. –", "mepid": "102886", "text": "I close the debate.The vote will take place today, 27 October 2016, at 12 noon.Written declarations (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 99, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "Angélique Delahaye (PPE)", "mepid": "124732", "text": "in writing. –I thank the rapporteurs for the work done.

By refusing to submit the requested documents to Parliament, the Council also undermines the right of EU citizens to information and transparency, which is a cause for concern. Such a situation leads to a serious breach of the obligations arising from the Treaty, which makes it necessary for the Council to join the Union Transparency Register in order to guarantee the institution's accountability. Failure by the European Council and the Council to cooperate with the discharge authority shall send a negative message to the citizens of the Union.

One of the questions we are asking ourselves in the wake of our decision to leave the EU is: what is our place in the world?

In this context, the renewal of the Trident nuclear weapons system is not only in breach of our commitments under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, it is also inappropriate, anachronistic and misguided. It is disappointing that Labour continue to support the renewal of Trident, based partly on the idea that nuclear-weapons manufacture and maintenance creates jobs. In response to what I find an illogical and unethical argument, I have commissioned a report into the Devonport dockyard which makes it clear that, for far less public investment, we could invest in socially productive employment to replace Trident related jobs.

This potential is linked to their knowledge, creativity and skills. European youth face many challenges: 13.7 million young people in Europe are not employed or in education. Almost 27 million young people are at risk of poverty and social exclusion. Long-term casual jobs pose a risk of a low quality of life for this generation. The problem of this group is unemployment on the one hand, and underemployment on the other; some are too highly qualified for the opportunities offered by the labor market. The gap between the two groups of young people is great: some with a favorable outlook for the future, others who have little hope of leading a full life and who are at risk of marginalization. These differences adversely affect the social fabric and sustainable long-term economic growth. Youth policy falls within the competence of the Member States, with the EU's role being coordinating, guiding and supporting it.

Allow me to remind you of the background of the summer- and winter-time arrangements and the reason why these arrangements exist.  Summer time was introduced by most Member States in the 1970s as a response to the energy crisis. Also, governments wanted to provide people with more leisure opportunities by making the most of daylight time. With the emergence of the internal market and as Member States began to apply different summer- time start and end dates, it became clear that a harmonised approach for summer-time arrangements in the EU was essential.  Transport, in particular, would be among the many direct beneficiaries since such a harmonised approach would ensure smooth transport operations and coordinated timetables for cross-border and international transport. Therefore, it was decided to harmonise the dates of the application of summer time in the EU in a Directive in 1980.  The latest Directive adopted in 2001 imposed the application of summer time for an indefinite time. We are aware of different studies from various external sources. So far, there are no conclusive arguments to be gained from them. This concerns any possible effects either way, whether they relate to people’s health, energy savings, agriculture or transport.  In 2014 the Commission carried out a study to look closely at the potential effects of not having harmonised summer time in the EU in the context of the internal market. The study examined the effects of Member States applying different summer-time arrangements. The study includes scenarios of abolishing summer time in one or more Member States. It did not look into the savings or costs that would result from abolishing the harmonised approach to summer time for the European Union as a whole.  Based on the evidence from some of these studies, however, we are convinced that a shift away from a harmonised approach has the potential to inconvenience large numbers of people, most visibly in the transport and communications sectors.  Recently the Commission received a letter from seven of the honourable Members of this Parliament. Those honourable Members asked the Commission to evaluate the functioning of the Summer-time Directive and to consider abolishing it. The Commission replied that it intends to examine the issue more closely and will analyse the impact of current arrangements in Member States based on available evidence.  Work has already started on this analysis. It would be premature to go into further detail at this stage, but it would be interesting to hear specific views and evidence from Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 1582, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "Herbert Reul", "mepid": "28225", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, dear colleagues! I'm sorry: these are now no answers to any of the three questions we asked. I think that's not fair. We have been doing this for months now, for ages. We ask questions, there are never answers. What you said - now you are not the Commissioner responsible and you have to fill a role for which you are not responsible, but the answer is always the same: we want a harmonized procedure. I don't know anyone who doesn't want that. We also all want the same procedure in all European countries. It can't be different. But we would like someone to finally investigate whether the allegations - which we are familiar with and for which there are investigations - whether or not the change in time that is carried out twice a year has disadvantages. There is now a wealth of evidence for this. I also do not understand why the Commission simply does not take note of this or denies it, or, if it thinks that this is wrong, then it should put its own investigations on the table in the House. We have talked to sleep researchers, we have talked to transport companies, we have talked to representatives of the agricultural sector, and we know that this time change twice a year does have an impact on people's health, and indeed a negative one - not all, but on several. I think that if a lot of people - no matter how many - feel negative effects, then there is no reason to do it twice a year, because there is no benefit from it. It was introduced back then because everyone believed that it would save energy. It is now clear: no energy is saved. That's crystal clear. If energy is not saved, why annoy people with such a change twice a year? It means Cost, it means health problems. I expect a commission that takes its task seriously and that otherwise takes action on every little thing, when damage to health is even on the horizon, and takes care that it does the same. We even have investigations in several Member States. In the Federal Republic of Germany there is a detailed report, in the Czech Republic there are reports, in several national parliaments people are starting to look into it, there are endless petitions in high percentages. People expect these concerns to be taken care of. It would be the simplest - if a measure like changing the time twice does not bring any benefit, but only harm, at least for a larger part of people - that the consequence is drawn and people say: Then we just leave it. We do not expect from you that you will accomplish great deeds somewhere, but the normal state should be restored: that one simply refrains from changing the time. Unless you provide evidence that there is no harm, no harm, but that all is well. So far nobody has delivered that. The answers that the Commission provides are always the same: we do not want to jeopardize the internal market, we want harmonized conditions between the Member States. We all agree with that. That is why one state cannot abolish and another introduce it; it must be done the same everywhere. Can you finally take this seriously, please?", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 1583, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "Inés Ayala Sender", "mepid": "28292", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - Mr President, yes, the services of the House have told me - they have just told me - that it is a record. And I hope that my colleagues forgive me because, really, I did not aspire to that much, and I would have perhaps preferred more than, yesterday, when we had the Annual Report of the Court of Auditors, they would have given me a few more minutes, and not these fifteen now. But anyway, I hope I don't bore you and, therefore, I ask your forgiveness in advance. It is true that, in the early morning of next Saturday to Sunday - in the early hours of Sunday - a change will occur while we sleep that apparently we will not notice while we sleep, but that, over the following weeks, we will notice. in a very important way. And it is precisely an accumulation of fatigue, due to that change in social jet lag that is being talked about, via lack of sleep or the change that has occurred in sleep, which, of course, does affect the health of our citizens and citizens. The cost has even been qualified and quantified - between the direct and indirect cost, we speak of 1% - of those health problems that we carry over the following weeks and months. In some cases, moreover, it has had an impact on road accidents that we already studied at the time when Directive 2000/84 / EC was put into effect. And in fact, not even the accidents increased in the following weeks, but the peak of the rise of the victims on the road was noticeable a month after the time change. Why? Because what accumulated was the chronic stress of lack of sleep that was causing it, which was when there was a situation of greater vulnerability in transportation after a month. In the Spanish case we even have an added peculiarity. Spain, in the 1940s, with Franco, adopted the time of Nazi Germany in 1942 and, since then, it has never changed it again. Just as the rest of the countries returned to the Greenwich meridian - which is the one that it would correspond to Spain—, in the Spanish case it was not done. Hence, every time since the adoption of the European Directive, change occurs, there are obviously important debates. And it is true that these days there has been a decision in the Balearic Parliament; There have also been decisions and debates especially in the part of the Valencian Community. These are regions, territories that live essentially from tourism, that is, services; very seasonal and have a lot to do with the hours of sunshine. Hence, even the hotel industry in the Mediterranean, in the Spanish part of the Mediterranean, has come to quantify that, in the week following the change to winter time, up to seven points are lost in hotel occupancy, precisely because of the drastic reduction of the hours of sunshine in the afternoon. In other words, it really does have an important effect and it is perceived in the economic and industrial part, in the part also of health and in the part - as I have also said - of road safety, which is so important. And although it is true that the Commission made us a study in 2014, the study was a bit of leaving it to the status quo. And I think that right now, given the demographics we have in the European Union, with diseases precisely due to that chronic stress of poor work or poor sleep or age, which is also making us increasingly vulnerable, the health aspect it is becoming more and more important. And of course, a change twice a year, that is, a social jet lag twice a year generates important effects on health. And that is what any study tells us, such as the one that was presented at last year's hearing, where precisely the need to add from the European Union - which we are no longer particularly popular - an added stress is taken into account for the purposes of that change. That is why it would be important for the Commission - as we have done in other areas - not only to carry out a study of how it affects in a scattered way, but also included the effect of the opposite, that is, what would happen if precisely there were not that change twice a year and, therefore, people could maintain that relationship with the biological clock but, above all , with the social clock. Added to this is also the need - and there I believe that the Commission has not given us sufficient figures either - to examine cross-border effects. Because it is true - I was present, I was not a Member, but I was in Parliament working with my group when the Directive was launched - that, in addition to the social, safety and health effects, it was proposed that harmonization - which it is a good thing, as Mr Reul said very well - it had to have a significant impact on the cross-border side. In other words, this harmonization should help the transport companies - which at that time were the most interested; now even transnational companies, transport, energy or other types of services—, which is why the “harmonization” aspect should prevail throughout the year over the “change” aspect. Therefore, the Commission should be able to offer us a study precisely on the need not to change, even if the harmonized situation remains. It is true that it is more complex to get all the Member States to agree to accept a single standard time and, thus, to be able not to change twice a year, but to maintain the one that is most positive for health, for safety, in end, for all economic aspects, but especially social and health. And maybe that's the challenge; that is, once we have done the test and have been harmonizing for many years, see how we could avoid an added change that adds only chronic stress to social stress. And there we are too - and then I go back to the Spanish case - because the debate never ends because we never have enough studies but, of course, When we have been able to go to Mars and go even further, the Commission says that it does not yet have the evidence, sufficient proof of that effect on health and in what way we could improve that situation, it is a bit incredible. In other words, right now we have studies of all kinds; Then, somehow, at some point, we will have to have the tests, the evidence in all sectors so that, to those for whom it is most positive, we can help them in some way, and where it is negative and where we see precisely that the health part is the one that prevails, of course being able to make another decision that does not affect the health of European citizens so much. And in that sense, returning home again, returning to Spain again, we have a rather complex situation right now in that debate, because, as if that were not enough, the double time zone we have in Spain - one for the peninsula and one for the Canary Islands—, the third possibility of going to a third time zone also joins the current debate, that is, that Spain would have three time zones: one for the Balearic Islands, one for the peninsula and another for the Canary Islands. We have reached that level precisely because of a debate that does not quite have the proof that we ask the Commission for. Commissioner - even if you are not the point of reference, because we were expecting Mrs Bulc - I think we certainly need the Commission to raise, take on its responsibilities and carry out a study - whatever it is; we agree, we agree with the Council, whatever it may be - to reach an agreement whereby citizens are not jolted twice a year when it comes to adapting their biological clock to the European clock. And above all because, of course, it is not in our interest as the European Union if it is the changes induced or promoted by the European Union and by the institutions that generate the most discomfort among European citizens. So I ask you very strongly, Commissioner, That the Commission adopt, as Mrs. Bulc told us last year, a really more systemic, holistic approach, and instead of giving us a study - which would be the umpteenth - on the different sectors, bits, etc., well, let it be atruly systematic approach where evidence to reconsider opinion is final.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 1584, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "Arne Gericke", "mepid": "124815", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mister President!

Together with some colleagues, I have once again put the question of switching between summer and winter time on the European Parliament's agenda. But not because we would like it or because we need this annual premium. No, we're discussing the time change again today because, despite complaints and input, nothing has changed over the years. We stand there year after year in April and October and ask each other with Paulchen Panther: Who turned the clock? In July last year I asked the European Commission: Can the Commission prove that the time change has added economic value? Are there any data on the desired energy savings through the introduction of the Central European Time? Does the Commission see a possibility of amending national legislation and international agreements between the Member States on the time change in a joint position so that artificial summer time will no longer apply across the EU? Does the EU Commission consider a European citizens' initiative on this subject to be possible in principle? Does the EU Commission have any findings on the negative health effects of summer time? Commissioner Navracsics, do you know what the officials' response was at the time? I want to tell you. I quote: \"In 2014 the Commission commissioned a study on the harmonization of summer time in Europe\" - as you have already mentioned. “The study led to the result that a non-harmonized application of summer time in the European Union was significant Cause inconvenience and disruption for citizens and businesses. In the light of the above, the Commission has no current plans to revise or repeal Directive 2000/84 / EC. ”Do you notice what? I ask about the possibility of a uniform abolition of summer time and you tell me that you want to leave it that way because different regulations are crap. But I hadn't asked about that at all. That is certainly not an option. We need a uniform solution, but it can also mean: no time change. Your officials ignored all other questions anyway: economic value, added value - no answer; Energy savings - no answer; health risks - no answer. These answers have been around for a long time. Countless expert reports confirm that the added value of summer time in terms of energy policy is zero. The economic added value tends to be negative, because the time change produces costs in the company. It gets worse with the health disadvantages. Just ask a mother or a father how the children are doing days after the clock change: sleepless, excited, sleepless! Many have problems at school and and and. All disadvantages, all reasons that speak against the clock change. So I ask again: answer my questions! Let's finally accept realities and get rid of this time change!

Commissioner, you are not to blame for the whole thing, we know that. We / you are not responsible, but you are in the Commission and that is why we naturally expect you to report back to the relevant Commissioners on what we are saying here. I think there is a great deal of unity in the room here - we are not that many; that's because it's Thursday afternoon. But I am sure we all speak in unison for all European citizens. We no longer want the time to be permanently changed. Most people don't want that. In Germany, according to the latest survey, 73% do not want that. I don't know why the others want that - but it doesn't matter. 73%, that's a clear majority. We have also had various initiatives from Parliament on this. There were joint hearings from various committees on which you expressed your views. And my colleague Arne Gericke quoted the 2014 study. However, you have only examined the question of whether the Member States would agree to the fact that the time change was abolished without agreeing on what the same new time is now. But we don't want that at all. We want it to be made uniform across Europe, that everyone really agrees on either winter or summer time - that would have to be agreed upon -; but that of course the time remains the same everywhere. When it was introduced in 1980 there were certain reasons why it was done - on a trial basis. You wanted to see if you could save energy, and you wanted to see if you could e.g. B. can reduce the accident rate. The fact is: energy savings are zero - as has already been said. You can see from 0.9% less to 1% more energy consumption, alternating between summer and winter time, so practically no effect at all. The accident rate is also not decreased - instead of late in the evening, the accidents are now early in the morning. So that also had no effect at all. So the purpose is clearly wrong - actually in all areas. On the contrary: In terms of health, many people - this has already been said -, especially the elderly and children, but also others, complain about difficulties: circulatory disorders, sleep disorders, heart problems, even depression - 12% get depression due to the clock change, which has been proven - 15% more Sick reports up to four weeks after the time change. These are all very serious things, and with the medication you have regularly, you also have problems. In the economy: The German construction industry, for example, lost EUR 30 million in sales last year due to changed lighting conditions in the construction sector - due to the time change, was calculated. There are problems with the timetables in rail transport, the cows give less milk. So there are a lot of areas where this is really the case. Then the Office for Technology Assessment of the German Bundestag, on behalf of the Bundestag, found out just this year: The framework conditions have changed significantly since the introduction of the time change: There are now other employment models; In the meantime there has also been a structural change in the energy sector; there is a different mobility and leisure behavior. In other words, they come to the conclusion that a reassessment is urgently needed - uniform throughout Europe - I will say that again. So my conclusion: I think that the eternal half-yearly back and forth between winter and summer time, we all no longer want that. It absolutely needs to be abolished, it is no longer appropriate, it is superfluous and it is even harmful.

As a curious fact, Roosevelt referred to this change as \"the time of war\", because it was established in the period of the world wars, with the aim of saving on coal. Of course, right now, in the middle of the European legislature, if the grand coalition continues to be reissued —as is happening in Spain—, turning the clock back one hour is going to seem rather little. And I do not say this by chance, but because this time change is made with one objective, which is energy saving or energy efficiency. To all this, we already have an Energy Efficiency Directive that, as you will recall, we recently revised and that, for very little, did not include binding targets for countries. And, in addition to this, the governments of the Member States are not making enough efforts to implement these energy efficiency measures, which is what it is all about, after all. And this should be a primary issue for economic reasons and to curb climate change. Now, we have to think: does this measure really save energy? This argument was based more on the old heavy industry, but the current reality is that the most energy-demanding industrial sectors may be operating 24 hours in a row, so the savings are not so noticeable - I repeat, this Directive is from 1981 -. The reality today is that the scientific community is not entirely in agreement with the savings that are being produced with this, which could be 5% or even as little as 1%. Some studies even say that this saving could occur only in the first days after the change of time, and then return to consumption similar to those before changing the time. The daily reality of citizens is that the energy savings that families make in the morning could be being spent in the afternoon. And this is also important, because we darken the natural light in the leisure and free time of most people, and this must be linked to the need for more dignified and consistent schedules to reconcile and end the working day earlier, enjoying life with light. By the way, there are 50 million people affected by energy poverty in Europe, and this is not discussed in this House. According to the WHO, the fact that households cannot afford heating leads to more illness, death and even fire danger. I believe that this is also an important issue for discussion in this House. We believe that it should be studied whether saving is currently sufficient, but above all, we must not waste time. There are many people who are not guaranteed access to electricity because of its costs and there are many ways to promote energy savings that are not debated or applied in the European Union, nor in the Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 1587, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "Indrek Tarand", "mepid": "97136", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, I hope to be briefer than five minutes. Commissioner, there is actually no need to amend what was said by those colleagues who spoke earlier. They have provided all the scientific evidence and facts, and if it were for this Parliament to decide, even though we are not very large in numbers tonight, we are representing a much bigger group of MEPs. So, if it were for Parliament to take a decision, you would come back in the spring without switching your clock. That is what I say. The problem is that the Commission and the Council seem to live on a different continent, not on the continent which has given mankind great minds like Galileo or Copernicus, even though – ironically – we have European programmes and budget lines which are named after those guys. But we in the Commission and in the Council seem not to have understood their teaching, which is basically that the earth goes around the sun, not vice versa, and man is not God who can create more light, by just tickling their watches. It is impossible to create more light. Commissioner, you said that the EU introduced this measure as a response to the 1970s energy crisis. Yes, indeed, you are right. But actually, the measure was introduced as a part of wartime economics, as was pointed out by the previous speaker – by the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Russian Tsarist Empire and the Ottoman Empire. Where are these empires today? They are not to be found, because they were wrong. Who introduced it again? Ah, two fellows, also famous in European history, Mr Hitler and Mr Stalin, because they also dreamed about how to have war on the continent. The first thing Hitler did in Belgium in 1940 was to tear down the Tricolore, put up the red banner – and switch the clock. The same happened months later in Estonia, but that was done by Stalin. So in my opinion, the European Union is not at war. Yes, indeed we have tremendously important crises which we have to deal with, but internally we are not at war. So it is at last time to stop the wartime economic measure. And you were right, pointing out that harmonised and coordinated management of time zones is very relevant from the internal market point of view and from many other aspects – transport, etc. But this is what we are telling you. We are not against coordination and harmonisation. We are just asking you to stop this toying with the clocks because, as was said by Ms Ayala Sender, it is harmful for children, it is harmful for the elderly, it causes traffic accidents, it is harmful for animals, be they pets or be they farm animals, because then again these guys who want to change the time twice a year destroy the quality of animal life. And as you know, Commissioner, we have many people within this Parliament who are fighting for animal rights. So finally, I think there will always be people who deny the laws of nature, and they believe that if we turn the clock, we get more light, particularly in the evenings. But you know, Galileo was also sentenced to death because he had discovered how the laws of nature work, and I hope – and I wish you good luck, Commissioner – that you will go back to your colleagues, to the responsible Commissioner, and ask them, by spring (because it is six months away), to come up with a meaningful proposal to stop this stupidity. It is that easy. And if you come back with that, we will welcome you. If you do not make a proposal, you had better tell them not to come.

Once we had also invented the railway, we forced time standardisation, and it happened in my constituency. In the 1840s and 1850s, the best railway in the world – the Great Western Railway, engineered by the greatest engineer of his day, Isambard Kingdom Brunel – necessitated that a model of time zones be brought into the age of technology. In 1825, the fastest anyone could go was dictated by the speed of a horse – about 20 mph maximum, in very short bursts. Railways changed everything, and for the better. This is relevant because, as a scientist, I know that we need to be practical. What works best to meet the needs of ordinary people in a changing world? The answer is straightforward. Ordinary people want to maximise daylight and do as much as possible during the daylight hours. I want my country to take the lead again. We are, after all, the lords of time. We must determine rationally how we can absolutely maximise the availability of daylight for ordinary people and then apply it.

However, after the Commissioner's speech, I see that we have not made progress on this matter even after a year. Let us realize that we are not just talking here about simplifying people's lives. We are talking about health, even about human lives saved, about property damage, as experts have already sufficiently demonstrated the link between the change in time and the higher accident rate on the roads, as well as the complications of medical operations. And I am no longer talking about the negative consequences in agriculture and animal husbandry. Moving the hands on the watch twice a year not only does not save money. On the contrary, experts estimate that the European economy will lose 1 to 2 percent of its gross domestic product each year as a result of this change. This represents a loss of almost € 300 billion. I admit, I was a little surprised that Commissioner Bulc, in her letter to us MEPs, defended the Commission's lack of interest in this subject, the importance of Europe-wide harmonization of the changeover to summer and winter time. However, it is not in dispute that each Member State should determine its own date for that transition. None of the Members asked for that, because it is obvious nonsense. I can only believe that the Commissioner did not take this part of her letter quite seriously. Undoubtedly, it was more of an attempt at a joke, which we may appreciate over time. However, I very much welcome, like my fellow predecessors, that the Commission recognizes that the transition from summer to winter and from winter to summer is a problem that bothers our citizens. And I add that perhaps even more than other issues that the Commission is dealing with much more promptly. We can only believe that the European Commission, despite its busyness, will also have the capacity to reconsider the arguments in favor of abolishing the alternation of summer and winter time. That it will deal responsibly with the issues of this Parliament and that the outcome of the examination will be factual and duly substantiated. I hope that when we meet here in a debate on this subject for a year, we will no longer talk about our demands, but we will have a proposal to amend Directive 2000/84 on the table.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 1592, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "Marc Tarabella (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "29579", "text": "- Mr President, I am going to speak here in a dissonant voice compared to all the colleagues I have heard so far. I am an advocate of the time change, and in particular of summer time. Why? Because when I was 13 and in school, at Saint-Roch College in Ferrières, Belgium, after the Easter holidays in 1976, the time change was applied for the first time. . Thanks to summer time, we were able to play football and basketball on the sports fields which were not lit. From this real-life example, I just wanted to tell you that the lighting later at night allows children in particular - and this is good for their health - to stay a little more outside by practicing physical activities, while leisure time. - as we know - have become very sedentary. The second benefit is the terraces and the conviviality. Rather than gulping down drugs for depression, let's go sit on a patio, this is the best antidepressant. It's good for business and for people, who can chat with each other. Therefore, usability is further facilitated by the change to summer time. It is not the traders who will contradict us. Other benefits are linked to the return to winter time. As Ms. Reid just said, winter time is the best way to take advantage of the natural daylight. When the sun decreases, the return to winter time allows for clarity a little earlier in the morning and, therefore, perhaps more safety, especially on the way to school. This is why I think harmonization is obviously useful. We know that the UK has often made different choices. This is normal, the Greenwich meridian passes over its territory. I heard earlier that we were talking about the Canary Islands. Since they are located at 28 degrees west latitude, it makes sense that they have one hour different.However, harmonization across Europe and a change from winter time to summer time and vice versa at the same time are obviously fundamental.Would not change a thing!Tell Mr. Timmermans he can sit down on that as well.Don't change anything!(The speaker accepts to answer a \"blue card\" question (Rule 162 (8) of the Rules of Procedure))", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 1593, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "Inés Ayala Sender (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "28292", "text": "blue card question.- Mr President, I just wanted to remind my colleague Marc that I understand nostalgia for youth, but that, precisely, health studies tell us that change - not the fact of having daylight saving time, which is so much for himNice, that is what we are proposing, that it be maintained - it is also what leads to obesity problems throughout Europe and that has been told us by several universities and scientific institutes that were in Parliament last year.Therefore, I ask you: Wouldn't it be better if we talked rather about keeping the schedule that is better for the health and for the morale of the citizens and thus, perhaps, to be able to make a schedule more familiar, more social, something thatin some Member States for the jobs is not achieved?", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 1594, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "Marc Tarabella (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "29579", "text": "Answer \"blue card\". - Ms. Ayala Sender, we could perhaps fund studies that will show the opposite, we may not have done so.

When you take a plane and go to a country where there is a two hour difference, you change your watch. Now we don't even need to change the mobile phone, it changes by itself. So we adapt. The jetlag exists for those who take trips every day and here in this compound there are quite a few who fly. When we go to winter time, we know we have an extra hour of sleep. When we switch to summer time, we have one less and therefore, we may go to bed earlier. It can be a problem the next day, the next two days, and then it's forgotten.

Having analyzed many of the pros and cons, I will advocate for the abolition of so-called daylight saving time. The reasons why daylight saving time was once introduced are no longer the arguments they once were. One hundred years ago, when a change in timekeeping was first introduced in wartime, the main argument at the time was the saving of a key coal fuel. The way of life, of course, was completely different from today. Today, fortunately, we have more and more renewable energy sources, and our daily lives have of course completely changed. I can mention our habits of space heating and cooling or even more drastic habits of using means of transportation. Thus, it is evident that energy saving is no longer a strong enough argument to change clocks during the year. I think today we need to start with the undoubted fact, the proven harmfulness of the impact on human biorhythm when changing weather. This is especially evident in the elderly. It has also been shown to affect animal welfare. In addition, changing the timing often creates additional chaos in communication. Human life, in addition to animal welfare, should be ahead of economic interests. If we never had knowledge of daylight saving time and its consequences, now we undoubtedly have it. That should be the main argument in this debate and the main argument for abolishing the change of time. An online survey conducted on a sample of 1,500 respondents by our colleague, Mr. Škrlec, shows that as many as 85% of citizens in Croatia are against changing the weather. They claim there are virtually no energy savings.

Agus anois táim ag teacht anseo inniu agus freisin tá breis fianaise againn nach bhfuil aon mhaitheas leis an athrú ama seo agus ba chóir dúinn deireadh a chur leis agus a luaithe is a dhéanfaimid é is fearr. The Commission is right: we need a harmonised approach, and that means that only the Commission can bring about this change; Member States cannot do it individually. All the evidence is there now that this needs to happen. Why do we deny scientific evidence of social jetlag? Many people suffer as a result of the change of time, as if they had jetlag. Also health has been mentioned. Accidents, and this supposedly beneficial aspect from the point of view of climate change. There are no benefits. For me actually it happens next Saturday. Autumn will finish next Saturday; winter will be advanced by a month; it will come in overnight. People will stop going for walks in the afternoon. It is ok for Mr Tarabella to talk about floodlights; they are not available to most people, and, as well as that, the energy consumption will go up, and then next year, spring will be postponed by about a month, which has a huge impact in terms of social activity, games, sport – you name it. I was very interested in what one of our speakers mentioned: that 73% of Germans are against the change. I would say that reflects the feeling right across Europe, and, indeed if they had the evidence which we have got now here today, I think the figures would actually go up. So why won’t the Commission come forward with something that actually matters to citizens; that citizens are in favour of doing; that nobody can do for them, only the Commission, and they will get great praise for it. I think it is a no-brainer, as we say in English. I will give you another example. This Saturday, many of the hotels in my constituency will close for the winter. The season is over. Again, the evidence is there that the hotels and the bookings drop by over 7% or more as soon as we switch over. So if there was no changeover, if we had summertime all year round, everybody would benefit: health wise, socially, young people and the economy. So at least Commission: come forward with a proposal. If it fails, it fails, but I guarantee you it would be a success and you will get some praise for so doing.

It was a German idea during the First World War, and it simply had to do with the savings on coal. The regulation of summer time is now a European competence: we are about that. We introduced it during the oil boycott by the Arab countries to save energy. In the meantime, it has turned out that the whole energy argument is no longer valid. It is outdated. Various studies show that this regulation saves little or no energy, but actually causes many disadvantages, such as - and this concerns people - sleep disorders. This has been scientifically demonstrated by various experts here in this group or in this Parliament. The biological clocks are getting totally disrupted, and we all have to deal with that. A social jet lag. Children should be out of bed an hour earlier in the morning and elderly people in nursing homes should be put to bed an hour later. By shifting time, parents and children often tire earlier and family life suffers. Sleep disorders occur that have all kinds of consequences: unruly children and unruly elderly people in the retirement home, more sickness reports. Furthermore, appointments are missed and old clocks break because of the tinkering with the hands. Businesses also have to adapt machines time and again to new times; I am thinking of the bakers and the signals from the transport sector. What applies to humans, also applies to animals. Then I think of dairy farming, among other things, because not everyone has a milking robot. In addition, changing the clock leads to more social problems: morning traffic jams drive longer in the dark, which is dangerous for traffic. Evening traffic jams drive more in ozone heat, which is harmful to the climate. More and more countries are therefore deciding no longer to change the clock: Russia, Turkey and Japan. She no longer participate.To save energy, we can better insulate houses, install more solar panels or ensure that cars indicate actual use.That is why the time has come for the European Union to set the clock for the last time after a hundred years.Stop this unnecessary hassle.We must listen to the criticism of the citizens and this affects every citizen.That will certainly help to make our Europe a little more loved by the citizens, and that is what our European Commissioner Frans Timmermans, who is responsible for this, wants too, right?Our Health Commissioner always talks about prevention, so shouldn't we tackle this?We do not have to meet for hours about that.Now there is only one question: do we in this Parliament choose summer time or winter time?As far as I'm concerned for daylight saving time.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 1598, "date": "2016-10-27.json", "name": "Heinz K.

Long-distance buses and trains lose an hour during the spring changeover, while they wait an hour at the stations for the autumn reset to adjust to the reset time.
