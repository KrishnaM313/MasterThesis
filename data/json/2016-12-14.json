[{"id": 0, "date": "2016-12-14.json", "name": "Ivan Korčok", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, many thanks for giving me the opportunity to participate in this debate on the upcoming European Council.  Normally, I would start by presenting the usual agenda for the December European Council, which deals mostly with economic and internal affairs, but today, recent events require me to start by addressing the situation in Syria. We are all following with grave concern the dramatic developments in Aleppo. The situation is tragic and unfolding very quickly. Let me stress that, to allow for humanitarian access, an evacuation of those in need is key, as well as the cessation of hostilities and the issue of accountability for violations of international law. Let me assure you that these issues will feature in the discussions among leaders tomorrow. I am sure the situation will also be an important element in our debate this morning and I will be listening very carefully to you.  There are various items on the agenda of the European Council to start tomorrow, but all of these items have one thing in common, namely the shared objective to deliver on concrete issues that matter for our citizens. I would like to recall that in June and October, the European Council set clear and ambitious goals. A very clear picture is emerging today, namely that the EU is delivering. This shows that the European Union has the means to tackle challenges and is capable of finding common solutions. Let me start with migration. This remains a top priority. The leaders are determined never to allow a return to the situation of last year and, of course, to bring down further the number of irregular migrants. Closing the Western Balkan route last February was a first vital step to securing the external borders. Since then, other important steps have been taken. The European Border and Coast Guard became operational last week, and national efforts have been considerably increased. The number of arrivals in Greece remains very low. The European Council remains committed to implementing the EU—Turkey statement. In the central Mediterranean far too many people are still being lured into risking their lives by stepping into a boat. Given the difficult situation in Libya, the European Council agreed to start working upstream with five African countries of origin or transit. Leaders will look at progress and are also expected to call for more support for the Libyan Coast Guard. Apart from that, it is important to address the root causes of migration in partner countries. The new ambitious External Investment Plan and the European Fund for Sustainable Development will be key. I have been confident that talks with the Parliament would start as soon as the Council adopted its negotiation position yesterday. With regard to security, of course citizens need to feel protected and this is true for internal security – just think about external borders or terrorism – and applies very much to defence as well. Here a big responsibility lies with national governments, but the EU can bring added value. On internal security, Parliament and Council negotiators have reached important agreements on counter-terrorism and checks at external borders. I expect the European Council to also encourage us to work diligently on the Entry—Exit System and on ETIAS, the system to systematically screen visa—exempt travellers.  On defence, Europe needs to do more for its own security and defence. On Thursday, leaders will want to signal that the EU is ready to deliver more. I would like to recall that in November, the Council adopted a concrete plan on strengthening the CSDP as part of implementing the EU global strategy. This should also strengthen the European pillar in NATO. Those two aspects have to go hand in hand, as requested by the Warsaw Declaration on the EU—NATO strategic partnership. The presence of NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg is a strong signal in that sense.  Under the heading, economic and social issues and youth, leaders will review investment and EFSI 2.0, as well as the implementation of the single market strategies and initiatives in favour of youth. The Council is now ready for negotiations with the Parliament on EFSI 2.0. Our Maltese friends will take this work forward. On the single market, many proposals are on the table and negotiations are ongoing. For citizens and businesses to reap the benefits of those initiatives, we as co-legislators need to deliver speedily. To keep up the momentum, Heads of State or Government will take stock of progress tomorrow and will come back to this in March. Furthermore, the European Council will look carefully into initiatives to address youth unemployment and to promote skills, development and mobility. In this context, the European Council will call for a continuation of the Youth Guarantee and welcome the increased support for the Youth Employment Initiative. Let me conclude by adding that, under the external relations component of the European Council’s agenda, which I evoked at the outset with Syria, leaders will also look at the ratification planned by the Netherlands of the EU—Ukraine Association Agreement. This was on the European Council’s agenda, but before I finish I would like to switch to German.  Da ich ja dafür einen besonderen Grund habe. Ich möchte sehr gerne diese Gelegenheit, Herr Präsident, nutzen, um mich bei Ihnen für – aber nicht nur – die letzten sechs Monate der Zusammenarbeit zwischen der Ratspräsidentschaft und dem Europäischen Parlament bedanken. Martin Schulz, das wollte ich auch sagen – das ist mir wichtig – hat das Europäische Parlament zu einer selbstbewussten Institution aufgebaut. Ich habe dies bei zahlreichen Treffen und Verhandlungen erlebt. Ich freue mich sehr, dass die Zusammenarbeit zwischen unseren Institutionen, gerade dank des Engagements vom Martin Schulz, viele konkrete Erlebnisse für unsere Union, aber insbesondere für unsere Bürgerinnen und Bürger, gebracht hat. Lieber Herr Präsident, Sie haben unsere bei Union mit all Ihrer Energie, Führung und rhetorischer Begabung verteidigt und geprägt. Ich bin davon überzeugt, dass Sie für dieses Projekt mit der gleichen Kraft und Begeisterung auch von Berlin aus kämpfen werden, wie Sie es seit mehr als zwei Jahrzehnten von Brüssel und Straßburg aus immer getan haben. Dabei wünsche ich Ihnen viel Kraft und Mut, die Sie im nächsten Abschnitt Ihrer politischen Karriere und Ihres Engagements für Europa brauchen werden.

Wenn ich mich in diesem Dezember, kurz vor dem nächsten EU-Gipfel, hier zu Wort melde, dann ist die Lage eine ganz andere als um dieselbe Zeit im vergangenen Jahr. Damals trieb uns die Frage um, wie wir auf die Flüchtlingskrise antworten könnten. Und schon damals war klar, dass es keine schnelle Lösung geben könne, sondern dass es einer umfassenden europäischen Antwort bedürfe. Ich bin froh, heute sagen zu können, dass wir entscheidend vorankommen sind, nicht zuletzt, weil sich zunehmend die richtige Ansicht durchsetzt, dass wir dieser Herausforderung nur gemeinsam begegnen können. Seit vergangenem Dezember haben wir doch einige Fortschritte erzielen können, zum Beispiel indem wir – und dies wurde hier im Hause ja immer wieder gefordert – endlich für unsere gemeinsamen Grenzen auch gemeinsame Verantwortung übernommen haben. So haben wir für europäische Verhältnisse – im Übrigen auch für nationale Verhältnisse – in Rekordzeit, Sie und wir, eine europäische Grenz- und Küstenwache eingerichtet, die in diesen Tagen und Wochen einsatzfähig sein wird.  Lassen Sie mich an dieser Stelle noch einmal klarstellen, dass wir uns dem Abkommen mit der Türkei – Erdoğan hin oder her – verpflichtet fühlen und unseren Teil dazu leisten, es umzusetzen, weil dieses Abkommen funktioniert. Die Zahlen sprechen dabei für sich. Seit März, seit also das Abkommen gilt, sind durchschnittlich 90 Flüchtlinge pro Tag auf den griechischen Inseln angekommen, im Vergleich zu 10 000 an einem einzigen Tag im Oktober das vergangenen Jahres. Auf der östlichen Mittelmeerroute sind seit dem Abkommen mit der Türkei 90 % weniger Menschen gestorben als vorher. Wir haben legale Wege aus der Türkei nach Europa eröffnet. Mehr als 2 700 Menschen – bei weitem nicht genug – wurden von dort in die Europäische Union umgesiedelt. Gleichzeitig unterstützen wir die Türkei dabei, bessere Bedingungen für die Flüchtlinge zu schaffen. Aber wir dürfen dabei die gravierenden Probleme im Mittelmeerraum und ergo in Italien nicht verkennen. Und ich sage noch einmal: Wir dürfen Italien mit den Folgen der Flüchtlingskrise nicht allein lassen.  (Beifall) Ich sage noch einmal: Die Gelder, die Italien aufbringt, um die Folgen der Flüchtlingskrise zu lindern, dürfen nicht in den Anwendungsbereich des Stabilitätspakts fallen. Das, was Italien für Flüchtlinge tut – und Italien tut sehr viel – darf nicht zu haushälterischen Konsequenzen negativer Art in Italien führen. Das Abkommen mit der Türkei zeigt, wie wichtig und richtig es ist, Grenzen zusammen mit unseren Nachbarn zu schützen. Deshalb werden wir uns beim Gipfel sehr genau anschauen, wie die fünf Migrationspartnerschaften umgesetzt werden, die wir mit afrikanischen Ländern in die Wege geleitet haben. Wir werden auch prüfen müssen, welche anderen Herkunfts- und Transitländer in eine engere Zusammenarbeit mit der Europäischen Union gebracht werden müssen. Letztlich geht es darum, einen umfassenden Ansatz zu entwickeln, sodass wir besser bei der Bekämpfung der Fluchtursachen ansetzen können. Diesem Ziel dient auch der externe Investitionsplan, mit dem wir 44 Milliarden an Investitionen in Lebens- und Zukunftschancen in Afrika mobilisieren können. 44 Milliarden europäische Investitionen in Afrika – aus diesen 44 Milliarden können 88 Milliarden werden, wenn die Mitgliedstaaten ihrerseits ihrer Aufgabe gerecht werden. Wenn all dies klappt und wenn wir zügig weiterkommen, wird es uns auch gelingen, zu einem funktionierenden Schengen- und Dublin-System zurückzukehren. Monsieur le Président, les questions de sécurité et de défense seront aussi à l’ordre du jour du Conseil européen de demain. Dans un contexte de menace terroriste toujours élevée et dans un contexte d’instabilité à nos frontières, les questions de la défense et de la sécurité sont, bien évidemment, essentielles pour chacun de nos pays et pour chacun de nos concitoyens. La vocation première de l’Europe reste de protéger ses citoyens contre tous ceux qui s’attaquent à notre façon de vivre ensemble, que nous devons largement à ces sept décennies d’une paix ininterrompue sur le territoire européen. La protection, pour être efficace, doit être crédible, car la crédibilité est un élément essentiel pour lutter contre les facteurs d’insécurité et pour dissuader de potentiels attaques.  Cette crédibilité dépend de nos outils dont nous voulons nous doter pour bâtir une véritable union de la sécurité. Notre crédibilité dépend aussi de notre capacité à ne pas être seulement une puissance douce. C’est important, mais ce n’est pas tout.  Nous devons renforcer la défense européenne et bâtir une véritable Union de la défense, tout d’abord en coopérant plus avec l’OTAN, comme nous le faisons déjà. Par exemple, en Méditerranée, ou encore dans le domaine de la cybersécurité. Nos deux organisations, l’OTAN et l’Union européenne, ne sont pas des organisations rivales, mais des organisations complémentaires qui ont besoin l’une de l’autre. Ensuite, en coopérant mieux entre nous. C’est pourquoi je lance un appel aux chefs d’État et de gouvernement de montrer de l’ambition lors des discussions de jeudi. La Commission, elle, y contribuera. Nous devons dynamiser l’industrie européenne de la défense, renforçant ainsi notre autonomie stratégique. Aujourd’hui, plus de 80 % des investissements en équipements de défense sont encore exclusivement nationaux. La fragmentation de nos efforts en matière de défense nous coûte cher, entre 25 et 100 milliards d’euros par an. Nous dépensons, nous, les Européens, 200 milliards d’euros pour la défense, mais nous n’atteignons que 15 % de l’efficacité des Américains, car nous avons trop de doublons et pas assez d’interopérabilité.  Nous avons donc tout intérêt à mettre en place une véritable base industrielle de défense européenne, raison pour laquelle la Commission a présenté un plan européen de défense pour soutenir la recherche dans le domaine de la sécurité et pour encourager les États membres à mettre en commun des équipements et à s’aligner sur les normes.  Et, comme je vous l’avais annoncé lors de mon discours sur l’état de l’Union, nous avons proposé de créer un Fonds européen de la défense qui permettra à la fois de financer la recherche et de faciliter les achats en commun du matériel.  Je parle de la défense, parce que la défense est un vrai sujet, mais je ne voudrais pas que le débat sur la défense européenne qui va s’engager nous éloigne des préoccupations immédiates des Européens. J’ai parfois l’impression que nous insistons trop sur la défense et insuffisamment sur les autres grands dossiers européens, dont notamment la politique sociale et le pilier des droits sociaux que nous sommes en train de préparer. This week’s European Council will also be a kilometre mark in our drive to stimulate our job market and our economy. It has been only three months since I announced a large—scale expansion of the European fund for strategic investments, and I am delighted at the speed at which we have moved. It is sometimes tempting to focus on the eye-catching numbers like the EUR 154 billion of investment it has triggered in 27 Member States, or the EUR 19.8 billion in financing it has secured for infrastructure projects. But what really counts is not the numbers, but the stories behind the numbers. The stories of how it affects the lives of people right across Europe. Sometimes big stories, sometimes smaller stories, but nevertheless important stories. Like the story of the family-run Indonesian restaurant in the small town of Geleen in the Netherlands that, thanks to the investment plan, has secured the loan it was previously refused to expand its business. Or the story of the farm in Crete that has now secured the EUR 15 million in financing it needs to develop a new product line in cold-cut meats and create more than 100 local jobs in the process. I could pick up many stories from the other 77 000 small and medium-sized enterprises across Europe that are benefiting from the investment plan. Everyone is asking for more support for SMEs. The Juncker plan is doing exactly that. That is the real added value that Europe can have, but we need more stories like that that. That is why I call on the co—legislators to reach an agreement on the extension of the European funding for strategic investments as soon as possible.  But we must also focus on creating the stories of tomorrow by investing in our youth. Despite a 10% drop in the last year alone, youth unemployment is still far too high – especially in those parts of Europe where recovery has taken more time. That is why we call for the Member States’ continued support for the Youth Guarantee, which has seen 9 million young people take up an offer of work, education or training. This is why we have proposed to increase funding for Youth Employment initiatives by a total of EUR 2 billion. That alone will help support 1 million more young people by 2020. But to really create the stories of tomorrow, we need our young people to have access to different experiences and different opportunities.  Last week – exactly one week ago – we launched the European Solidarity Corps to get young people volunteering or working to help the most vulnerable and marginalised in our society. That is 100 000 new stories by 2020 and 100 000 young people equipped with the experience and skills to make them thrive on the job market. That is an investment worth making, and I will call on the European Council to throw its full weight behind it. In less than a week, more than 10 000 young people have registered to be part of the European Solidarity Corps. It shows that it was needed: that young people are Europeans, that they are eager to contribute meaningfully to society, and to show solidarity. I will finish here, as there can be no better or more important note to leave it on. But the European Council will also address two foreign policy issues. First, it must ensure that the EU-Ukraine association agreement is concluded. That is a matter of geo-political responsibility. It is time to finish the work of this Chamber and of Ukraine’s Rada, when they ratify the agreement simultaneously. A great moment, in fact, in the parliamentary history of our continent. I would also like to congratulate the European Parliament for having completed negotiations on the visa liberalisation suspension mechanism. Visa-free status must now be granted to Ukraine and Georgian citizens as quickly as possible. We were promising it, they were doing what they had to do, and now we have to deliver.  The European Council will also discuss the war in Syria. The situation in Aleppo, despite recent events, is grave. There are reports of slaughters and of children trapped under collapsed buildings. I call on the warring parties to see through the fog of war, at least for a moment – at least long enough to recall their humanity and to allow the civilians, the women and the children to leave that great, ruined city in safety.  (Applause)", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2016-12-14.json", "name": "Manfred Weber", "mepid": "28229", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Gentlemen Presidents, my very esteemed colleagues! The world holds its breath. The images we see in the Aleppo newspapers today shock us all. Hundreds of thousands of people and children experience hell on earth there. The deduction options that have now been announced are certainly to be welcomed. But for us, especially for the European Council on Thursday, it means that we must act, that Europe must act now. The first thing that is necessary is humanitarian aid: to try to really get emergency aid to the place, to support people, to provide funds. And the reception of refugees in Europe must be addressed now, after what we experienced yesterday with the Yazidis whom we honored with the Sakharov Prize. The second: we need a strengthening of foreign policy. Europe was absent. The world community has failed. That is why we need more unity, also more unity on the question of defense. The third: the politics of Russia. Aleppo - a view of Moscow is one of them. Yes, dialogue is necessary, including with Moscow. But the fact is that Aleppo could only develop like this because the Russian military helped. Children, families - according to United Nations estimates, one third of the dead are children - that is why it is clear to us as the EPP that the appeasement policy towards Russia cannot be a starting point. Putin has blood on his hands. This must also be made clear by the European Council. We are therefore pleased that François Hollande and Angela Merkel and the other heads of state and government obviously agreed yesterday to extend the sanctions on Russia. This is a good signal that we do not accept this type of Russian policy. The second topic is Turkey. The terrorist attacks shocked us all. Istanbul a colorful open liberal city, and now there are many victims who have been plagued by terrorism. We must first of all express solidarity, including compassion, towards the victims that we stand by their side. But it is also clear that the developments in Turkey make us all worried: the MPs who are losing immunity, the media who are being closed. The facts are known. Hence the request to the European Council not just to say “keep it up” but to be honest, also with our Turkish partners. The outstretched hand to carry out common tasks, for example in the fight against terrorism, is there. But it is clear that Turkey is moving in the wrong direction, and that is why it would be a request to the European Council to freeze the accession talks, as a large majority in this European Parliament had called for. The third thing I want to address today is a look at Europe, because we, as the European Parliament, are now repositioning ourselves. In the last few weeks and months we have often criticized the Council for its national egoisms, the national division and the blockade that we have experienced. I am thinking of the migration issue, I am thinking of trade defense instruments, where unfortunately God is blocked in the Council and we as the European Union are not making any progress. Now I can see and see my group that the European Parliament can also slide into a certain blockade, namely a party-political blockade that may be facing us. I believe that the argument between the parties is necessary - that is out of the question. In 2019, when the next elections come, it will also have to be conducted with great severity. But we as a group believe that now is not the right time. Martin Schulz was previously honored as a President who gave parliament a profile. The two and a half years in This legislative period was shaped by the fact that the pro-European parliamentary groups could deliver together, that we were able to achieve results. I would like to single out an example, namely that we have succeeded in having such low unemployment figures in the European Union today as in the time of crisis in 2009 that the unemployment figure could be reduced significantly, thanks to the Juncker Plan, thanks to many initiatives. One of the successes we achieved together. I believe that we as Parliament can be proud of the two and a half years in which we have achieved results together by consensus - where everyone had to approach the other. I would like to make it clear to my group that we want to continue to practice precisely this approach. We want to deliver to the citizen. We want to achieve results in consensus among pro-Europeans and democrats. We do not want to give what is decided in parliament into the hands of populists and extremists. Let me close with a quote from a left-wing politician, an important European politician, Altero Spinelli - he was even a communist - who said: “The dividing line between progressive and reactionary parties is between those who fall back into nationalism and party struggle, and those who work together for European unity. ”My group is still ready for this!

We have said this on other occasions, we reiterate it with determination and pain: humanitarian aid, ceasefire, stop barbarism, dialogue but very firm condemnation of Russia. I think that the European Council of tomorrow can unfortunately reserve us disappointments and inadequate responses. President Juncker does well to remember the results we have achieved, especially thanks to this Parliament, to the whole Parliament and to the European Commission. I am also grateful for the commitment that President Juncker has reiterated towards Italy, but the knots remain firm in the swamp of the Council. On the European asylum system we risk being faced for the umpteenth time with vague words, without any commitment on the subject of redistribution of refugees. In terms of investments, the Council limits itself to taking note of the Commission proposal, but it does not go ahead and any delay affects people's lives. As President Juncker recalled, there are stories, there are people, if the Council does not decide, those non-decisions have an impact on people's lives, on the life of businesses. Disappointing words about the Youth Guarantee. The Commission has made a proposal, the Socialists have made an even more ambitious proposal, including on the financial level, but nothing, I fear, will come from the Council tomorrow. Also on the civil service we ask that the Council decide. The lack of responses from this Conservative majority Council must lead us to a common conclusion. There is a need for a new phase, I say this very clearly, Europe only with conservative traction no longer works, a new cycle must be opened. In the last six months, Brexit, the American elections, the latest election results have revolutionized the landscape and it is up to us to grasp the demand for change that comes from the citizens. First of all you have to starting from a clarity and a diversity of position, which are the richness of a democratic institution, which does not mean not having and not being able to cooperate on individual dossiers. This is our duty when our positions are reflected but what is certain, after a deep reflection, not at the last hour, of my group, the cooperation in a structured form as there has been in these two and a half years is over. , and it ended for political reasons. We want an open confrontation, not limited to the groups that formed the old coalition. We want a new polarization between center-right and center-left, which must lead to undoing the knots that remain suspended and to which the Council of tomorrow cannot give answers. The economy; a more ambitious investment plan that focuses on the energy transition; a more consistent Youth Guarantee that responds to the real tragedy of today's Europe, which is the unemployment of young people; a real investment plan on Africa and with Africa, as we socialists have been asking for for some time; a more moral economy, which fights tax fraud and evasion; sustainable development; a more ambitious climate-energy package; a 40 percent renewable energy target; great attention to food safety.

But how many times have we discussed the issues on this week’s agenda: migration, security, economy and youth unemployment? How many more times until we actually solve them? Almost every summit seems to produce more of the same: words and declarations to keep the control set to auto-pilot whilst struggling to tackle both the internal and external challenges. The challenges of building the right environment for companies to create jobs. The challenge of keeping our citizens safe and secure. The challenge of sustaining living standards we have come to take for granted. But how? Imagine you are a young person living in Spain or Greece with youth unemployment at over 40%. You want the opportunity to get a job, or at least an apprenticeship. You need the right economic conditions to allow businesses to create jobs for which you can apply. You dream of being able to build a better future for yourself, for your family and for your community. But what do we in this House offer? Yes, we talk about the EU Youth Guarantee scheme that Gianni Pittella just spoke about. But here, in the European Parliament, our proposed solution to all this is a free Interrail Pass. A great opportunity for middle—class kids who could afford it anyway, but not exactly the solution you are desperate for if you are struggling – like many of your neighbours – to find a job. Is it any wonder that people are angry with us, angry at how out of touch we have become? Should we then be surprised when they turn away from the mainstream political parties? The ECR Group, made up of MEPs from 18 countries, wants to show that we understand people’s legitimate concerns. That we can work together, within the EU and with western allies. That we can offer the EU a new direction. It has happened before. The EU has begun to change direction on the migration and refugee crisis. We have finally started to recognise the importance of distinguishing between genuine refugees fleeing war and persecution and economic migrants who are bypassing the legal migration channels. And when the EU eventually moved towards an approach that the ECR and others have been calling for, what did we see? A crisis that is far from over, but which has become more manageable. So why don’t we try a new direction in a few more areas? On security, instead of thinking that we have all the solutions in Brussels or in Strasbourg, how about learning from what works in our local communities? Learning from anti-radicalisation projects in London, Aarhus or Mechelen. Learning from local jobs clubs and projects helping the long-term unemployed into work. Learning from local projects that help refugees to integrate into their new surroundings in many towns and cities. And how about learning from what works in some of our countries? What about asking security agencies how we can improve their confidence in their counterparts in other countries, with whom they may be reluctant to share their hard gathered intelligence? How about creating jobs by cutting bureaucracy and liberalising employment laws? How about learning about integration from countries that have welcomed newcomers for centuries? Inside this building, the talk is of the intrigue of who will be the next President of the European Parliament. But step outside this building, and our voters will not be interested in that. They will be worrying about their jobs, their future and their ability to pay their bills. So in those few hours of the working lunch and the working session at this week’s Leaders’ Summit, let us hope that our leaders finally start to listen to the many alarms that have gone off in 2016. Let us hope that our leaders address the legitimate concerns of our voters, and let us hope that our leaders chart a new course and set sail for a new direction.

I would also say how generous you are because you always apologise to me afterwards outside the Chamber for asking me a question, so that is very polite. Thank you. Your first question is about travel. It’s all very well saying let’s give kids free Interrail passes, but what the people actually want is the ability to have a job. They want a future, they want to think about themselves and their families. People want to work. With this gesture of giving a free Interrail pass, quite often it is the wealthy middle class kids who can afford it anyway. They can afford the food; they can afford to travel; and all you are doing is saving them a few hundred euros on the ticket.

But I want to say welcome to somebody who is new here, Ska Keller as the new leader of the Green Group. We know already each other, she was ‘Spitzenkandidat’, I know she’s a very good debater, so I say welcome to her in this mandate.  We have already heard it a few times this morning: everybody is talking about Aleppo, some I think with good intentions, some with less good intentions. The ENF are asking to put that point on the agenda but that’s in order to say they have liberated Aleppo. That’s the reason they want it on the agenda, not to deplore the thousands of people, men, women and children who were killed by those who you are supporting for the moment: Russian airplanes, the troops of Assad. And so it’s completely cynical from your side to even try to put it on the agenda of the European Parliament, when you are the cause of what is happening for the moment in Aleppo. It’s a shame!  (Applause) What would be far better is to listen a little bit better to the testimony of yesterday, the testimony of Nadia and Lamiya, the Yazidi women, the horrific things that they went through. Because the horrific things that they went through is exactly what is now happening in the streets there, where the Assad people, the army, and also the Shi’ites, Iranian commandos, are going from door to door to kill people, to kill women, to kill children. And so my request to you and to the Council is: What are you going to do about it? Yes, you going to deplore it like we all deplore it here, but you have the power to do something more. What you could do is say, well, we need to do three things: first, ceasefire; second, we need to have free entrance of humanitarian aid to eastern Aleppo; and third, we need to sit around the table to find a political solution and if those who don’t want to do it, don’t do it, we the European Union launch a number of sanctions towards Russia, towards the Assad regime,  towards Iran, because it is their commandos for the moment who are doing these atrocities inside Aleppo. That you can do. So we can deplore, you can deplore but you have the power tomorrow in the European Council, to take that decision. And that’s my request to you. not only to come here and say, yeah, there’s a problem, but to take an initiative, and the initiative can only be that Europe is launching a new package of sanctions against these people if they don’t comply with these three human - I should stress, human - requests that we have today in the case of Aleppo. And that’s also the reason why I hope that on the defence Union we make progress, as has been said by President Juncker, not only by making a fund, I think Jean-Claude, but also by starting to integrate all these multiple forms of defence cooperation we have in the European Union. There’s an inflation of defence cooperation inside the Union. We have the Benelux, we have the Baltics working together, the Scandinavian countries working together, we have Eurocorps, we have the French-Italian cooperation, we have the Dutch-German cooperation. What we need to do is to integrate that into a defence Union and with Eurocorps in one structure, so that we can find a solution to the scandal we have today, that we are in fact spending 42% of the American expenditure on the military and we can only carry out 15% of their operations in reality, that means that we are three to four times less effective than the American army; that’s the reality. So, second thing, on the defence Union: finally take the decision and start first of all, the proposals from the Commission and then further on.  And then the third point, I have seen that in the Council conclusions there is also a point on the format of the Brexit negotiations. I have to ask you: in what time are you living for the moment in the Council? I think you are still in the 20th century, or something like that, before the 1970s, because I have the impression that you have never read the Treaty of Maastricht and the Treaty of Lisbon and the powers of the European Union and the European Parliament. What they are proposing is simply to say, ah, we go forward with the Brexit negotiations, but without the Parliament. We can invite sherpas, maybe, but that’s it. That’s all. You are not aware that we have to approve these arrangements? You are aware of it? OK, that’s already an enormous step forward, but I am going to tell you it’s time that you also involved Parliament from day one. Do you want that we open separate negotiations with the British authorities? Isn’t that what you want? You can get it. If that’s what the Heads of State want, we are going to do it: parallel negotiations. I don’t want it. But apparently the Council wants it. Maybe I can give you, I don’t know who gave it to me a few minutes ago, it’s a famous phrase of Lyndon B. Johnson. Now Lyndon B. Johnson’s not always very accurate, but OK I’m going to use it. He said once: better to have him inside the tent pissing out than outside the tent pissing in. Maybe that’s a good reality that you can recall to the European Council.

A referendum that said \"no\" to a project to amend the Italian Constitution that went in the directions that the J.P. Morgan suggested for the constitutions of Southern Europe. We are very happy that the no has won, that the defense of the Italian Constitution born from the anti-fascist Resistance has won and I think that the Council will also have to take note of the change of government in Italy, due to the failure of Matteo Renzi also in this reform project constitutional. Matteo Renzi is also among the creators of the migration compact, which will be discussed at the next Council. What do you propose? In fact, cooperation is proposed with African States conditional on border control, with five countries of origin and transit, as was just mentioned. Here, the consequences are already beginning to be seen only in the draft of this agreement. In Sudan, Eritreans are beginning to be increasingly massively arrested, numerous NGOs already speak of a shameful agreement, a shameful agreement because it extends that process of externalization of borders that has already been experienced and is still being experienced in the agreement with Turkey. An agreement that is called a success. Here, I wonder how it is possible to define an agreement as a success when the Fundamental Rights Agency talks about sensitive and significant violations of human rights. How can an agreement with an authoritarian regime, such as Erdogan's, be defined as successful, while HDP parliamentarians are in prison, without even receiving medical assistance, while numerous Kurdish mayors and mayors are currently prevented from carrying out their function. What is meant by success? Then we talk about here too standardize the standards on the right to asylum, obviously to standardize means \"lowering\". It is said not to leave Italy alone, of course we agree, but I would like to try to say that it is not enough to leave the funds outside the stability pact. I would like to invite those who say they do not leave Italy alone to visit, as I have had the opportunity to do, the Cara of Bari, the Cara of Crotone, the Cara of Mineo and to look into the eyes of women and men who remain suspended for months in a limbo, women and men who enter the relocation program without knowing where they will be destined. I would like you to look into the eyes of those Mediterranean Hope volunteers who work on projects to build humanitarian corridors from below. This, practicing hospitality, practicing solidarity means not leaving Italy alone, because I want that, in addition to not dying and not shipwreck women and men in the Mediterranean, there is not even the shipwreck of an idea of ​​Europe.

The question to all of us is: what will the world do to stop that? We cannot just stand and watch this. The question to you, Mr Korčok, is: what will the European Council do? Will it send a strong signal, a strong message, or will it stand and watch? What will you do – what will the European Union do – to help those Syrians who have managed to flee from their country, from bombs and from terror, to find adequate international protection?  If we can believe the Council conclusions that are circulating, the answer is nothing. Nada. Where is the resettlement scheme that we urgently need to get people out of the horrendous situation that we have in Lebanon and in Jordan? Where is any message to the people fleeing that they are not alone and that we will help them? Instead, we have the Belgian Government, for example, fighting about whether or not to give a humanitarian visa to a single Syrian family. On the relocation of people who are already here, nothing. Fewer than 10 000 people have been relocated from Greece and Italy. So how does this fit in with the concept of ‘the Union that delivers’? It clearly does not deliver, even on things that have already been agreed. On top of that, the Commission is even recommending sending refugees back to Greece. That is ridiculous. Where is the solidarity? Where is even the common sense in the Council? Mr Korčok, what role is your Presidency planning to play in all of this?  On migration it seems that the only thing that Member States can agree to do is close the doors and do everything to keep migrants and refugees out. In order to do that, you are even prepared to do dirty deals with anyone in the world. You want to return, and you are returning – Member States are returning – people to countries where just the other day we were sending soldiers and armies. How can we return people to Afghanistan and to Mali where we have soldiers to protect a peace that does not really exist? How can we assume that it is safe for people when we are also sending soldiers? I think that, if we proceed like this – together as the European Union – and if we forget our own values, then we can also forget about promoting human rights elsewhere in the world. If we are not true to our own principles at home, we will just become a laughing stock in the world and there are other people who are competing for that role at the moment. On external security and defence, it seems that you just want to throw around more money and more papers with fancy titles. While there is absolutely nothing wrong with fancy titles, money is urgently needed elsewhere. We need it for investment, we need it to fight unemployment and we need to have it for social justice. By the way, we would have some more money available if the Council would finally get serious about tax evasion. So I suggest you focus on the issues that have already been talked about so many times many years ago, for example pooling and sharing, instead of nurturing the defence and military industry, because that particular industry is actually doing pretty well, thank you very much.  The European Council is meeting at a very crucial time, as colleagues have mentioned. There are a lot of challenges ahead and it is vital that we get it right. So I really hope that the Council can send an important signal for Europe, for solidarity and for human rights. I wish you every success and good luck. If you do so, we are of course ready to support you but, from the Council conclusions we have seen so far, unfortunately we cannot expect that. But I hope you can change that.

As it is Christmas, let’s think of those events in terms of the three wise men bearing their gifts. First, we had the Brexit deliverance; then we had the Trump triumph; and then thirdly, of course, the Italian rebellion. It’s just that in this case, the gifts were all the same: democracy and the rebirth of the nation state. I really think you had better listen, because I know in the past you’ve managed to ignore Danish, Dutch, Irish and French referendums, but this time it is for real. A democratic revolution has begun. Yet, when the 28 leaders of the EU countries meet tomorrow, I see no sign on the agenda of humility. I see no understanding of what has happened at all. In fact, what I see is the implementation plan of the EU global strategy on security and defence. In simple English: EU militarisation – the building of a European army. Indeed, Mr Juncker used Donald Trump’s magnificent victory to say: ‘well that means that NATO won’t be here anymore. We have to do this ourselves’. That is what you said, and this is a huge and dangerous error. Trump is not a threat to NATO. He wants it to be redefined, and he wants the members to pay their way. It is Mr Juncker who is a threat to NATO. You can pretend today, if you like, that your military structure is going to run in parallel with NATO, but those two structures cannot run together without being in direct conflict with each other.  It was Tony Blair that first really worried me about this project when he said the rationale for the EU today is not peace, it’s about power. Already we’ve seen that power exercised in terms of foreign policy in Ukraine, where we have wantonly provoked Russia – and we actually got rid of a democratically elected leader. You know, history is littered with conflicts caused by empires that seek to expand, and it’s about time the British Government stood up tomorrow and said: enough. This is madness. We, as an independent United Kingdom, will act as the bridge between America and the nation states of Europe to make sure that NATO is secure.  I also hope tomorrow that we see the British Prime Minister stop dithering on Brexit. It has been six months since we voted for our liberation, and at the minute we’re being dictated to by courts and European Commissioners and told what we can and cannot do. I hope we do that, but I suspect we won’t, and I suspect the other 27 leaders will continue on the same course. That’s why you can all look forward to some even bigger traumatic shocks coming in 2017. It’s going to be, for nation-state democrats, a very happy New Year.

And in the run-up to the summit, the slowdown in the international capitalist economy has a strong impact on developments. No imperialist center today can function as a locomotive of economic development. This uncertainty also applies to the European Union and the eurozone. The difficulty of a controlled devaluation of over-accumulated funds, states or banking groups hinders recovery and objectively leads to the intensification of competition and the outbreak of new wars. These impasses of the system reinforce the forces of bourgeois nationalism, economic protectionism, the review of international agreements in the United States, Britain, France, Italy and elsewhere. These are not anti-systemic. They work for other sections of the bourgeoisie. They also serve capitalist profitability like the liberal neo-social democratic forces like SYRIZA, cosmopolitan forces.

It is also relatively clear that you don't get anywhere with promises, but that you have to deliver something very specific, that you have to prove to people that we can do something.

We end up in an absurd situation when, in order to accommodate the asylum seekers from the terrible war in Syria, we are forced to send out those who come from somewhat less terrible armed conflicts. There is no peace in Afghanistan, and some groups in particular are very vulnerable, and the same is true in other countries, such as Mali. Our repatriation policy will lead to more and more people choosing to hide in Europe, and to become paperless. I understand them, and I would have done the same. But it would not have had to be the case that Sweden and Germany were now forcibly deporting people who, according to previous legal interpretations, had probably been granted a residence permit. It would not have had to be the case if all Member States had taken their responsibility for the asylum seekers who come to us.

Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council! Dear colleagues! At the end of the year, the European Council should not return to business as usual, but rather formulate clear messages again. I think there is an important clear message that needs to be sent to Turkey: namely to stop and freeze the start of negotiations with Turkey. We took a very clear position here in Parliament at the last plenary session. A country that arrests, imprisons, and deprives hundreds of thousands of citizens of their rights is miles away from representing what is important to us in the European Union, namely democracy and the rule of law. That is why I am in favor and I argue that Turkey should be dealt with honestly and that the negotiations must be brought to an end. I would also like to address something else in order to have a clear message. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you pointed out that a number of measures had been taken in relation to migration and asylum - you mentioned the protection of external borders, which had been strengthened, you mentioned Frontex, the Union for the Mediterranean and so on - but you left out one issue, that is the common European asylum system. The Commission has put forward good proposals here, and we here in Parliament have made clear statements and positions on them. The message is: The issue of migration / asylum must be tackled together. We need solidarity, we need responsibility from all Member States - including your country in particular - and I appeal to the European Council to make progress in this regard tomorrow and the day after tomorrow and to send out a clear signal of solidarity from all Member States in dealing with the crisis.

That said, border control really remains the major issue. The instability of the world is another source of anguish and what is happening in Aleppo is a tragic example on our doorstep. The Europeans must hold a place which will be difficult, between the Russia of Vladimir Putin and the United States of Donald Trump, and we will have to recreate this \"European leadership\" and the community method must find its place again.

This strategy was not just theory, but had focused on specific delivery. For this strategy to succeed, all actors need to play their part, in particular the Member States. The support of this House has been more than helpful. When everyone takes up their responsibilities, we have tangible results. One example, which has been mentioned on many occasions, is the European Border and Coast Guard. Tomorrow, the European Council will give further meaning to and guidance on the European Defence Action Plan.  The European Council will also address two foreign policy issues. First, it must ensure that the EU—Ukraine Association Agreement is concluded. This is a matter of geopolitical responsibility. It is time to complete the work of this Chamber and the Ukraine’s Rada when they simultaneously ratified the agreement. I would also like to congratulate the Parliament for having completed negotiations on the visa suspension mechanism. Visa-free status must now be granted to Ukrainian and Georgian citizens as quickly as possible. This is of major importance for the citizens of these countries and will be mutually beneficial for Europe and the region.  The European Council will also discuss the war in Syria. As has been said here, the situation in Aleppo is grave. There are reports of slaughter and children trapped under collapsed buildings. I call on the warring parties to see through the fog of war at least for a moment – at least long enough to recall their humanity – and to allow civilians, women and children to leave that great city in safety.  One of our next goals is to finalise the reform of the asylum package. I will come back to some of these issues later this afternoon, but I would like to say some words about Turkey. We shall come back to Turkey later. However, I want to express in this Chamber our condolences for the terrible and horrendous terrorist attacks. This again shows that we have common challenges and proves that dialogue needs to continue in all fields for the benefit of both the European Union and Turkey. The EU-Turkey statement is working and giving tangible results. We are committed to continue implementing it. On Dublin II, I must be very clear, because I think there has been a misinterpretation. The Commission did not decide to send refugees or migrants back to Greece. What we recommended to Member States was a gradual return to the application of the rules with the necessary safeguards for the best interests of these people, but also for Greece, which is under exceptional pressure. Greece’s progress, despite the exceptional situation, has been recognised by the fact that we have proposed a gradual resumption as of mid—March 2017. This means only migrants who enter Europe through Greece after that date and might try to move irregularly towards other Member States. But even then it will concern certain categories and will presuppose individual guarantees for the transfer of each migrant, which Greece should be in position to provide. It goes without saying that the Commission will constantly monitor the situation and update its recommendation if necessary. Ideally, if everyone plays their role, the implementation of the EU—Turkey segment should be accelerated, the relocation should be stabilised in larger numbers, and no migrant – or very few – should move irregularly on his own. Yes, the revision of the Dublin rules, based on a fair distribution mechanism, is the priority of this Commission, as it is for you in Parliament.  I have listened to everything you have said. What is important is that right now, at a time of crisis and divisions, this House leads the way towards more unity and common European responses to common challenges. Our responsibility is huge: not to allow populism and nationalism to destroy what we have built – not only for the sake of our past, our history, but for the sake of our future, our common future.

President Schulz will have an opportunity to raise this issue tomorrow when he meets with the members of the European Council.

On this, the Council agreed a general approach on 6 December and is ready to start negotiations and trilogues with the European Parliament, while we take note that the Parliament has postponed this until May 2017.  Lastly, the Youth Employment Initiative is an extremely important area and the subject of deliberations tomorrow in the European Council. I would like to recall that the Slovak Presidency was dealing with this issue within negotiations on the revision of Multi-annual Financial Framework. I would like to recall that the Council is proposing to allocate an additional EUR 1.2 billion for the Youth Employment Initiative until the end of 2020.

It is not responsible to say that we are helping all immigrants when unemployment is high among EU citizens and a significant proportion of people are struggling with livelihoods. Above all, the causes of emigration must be prevented, and this requires a stronger partnership with third countries, especially in African countries. People’s basic needs must be met and they must be offered a perspective on their future in their homeland.

The Juncker Plan received the most money from the states that were able to convince the European investment bank, which is allocating resources, of their country’s competitiveness.

Five years later I can say that we succeeded together. Parliament is more visible today, it is more audible and it is more influential than ever.

Many receive considerable financial support from both national and European Union budgets. Transparency will contribute to a genuine level playing field between European ports. It will also help make public funding more efficient. The Court of Auditors stressed the necessity to address this issue in a recent report.  Second, the regulation creates a common framework for the provision of port services. This framework brings legal stability for the tendering of port services. It will end today’s unclear situation where ports policy is not decided by EU legislation, but rather by judgment of the European Court of Justice on a case by case basis.  Third, it will ensure better training of port workers in line with the work undertaken by the social partners. Finally, the regulation will contribute to our decarbonisation strategy. We need to green the shipping industry and promote short-sea shipping. This requires investment and the right type of investment in ports.  Many of you attach great importance to clear and simple state aid rules. The Commission shares its attachment. We have been working a lot on the issue of state aid in ports over the last months. My colleague Commissioner Vestager and I are making sure that the views of European ports are adequately taken into account. Replying last week to a preliminary question from Mr Fleckenstein, the Commission clarified the framework for state aid in ports, including the general block exemption regulation. The situation is as follows: a new set of infrastructure analytical grids was published on 2 December. With this document, the Commission explains which infrastructures are considered to be non-economic and therefore should not fall under state aid rules. These infrastructures include defence infrastructure, such as docks, and access infrastructure to ports, such as a river flowing through a port that can be used by anyone. Last week, the Commission also completed its second public consultation on the general block exemption regulation. Its objective is to identify which public investments in port infrastructure are considered state aid but are unproblematic and therefore do not need to be notified. We are now analysing the replies to improve the text further and adopt the regulation in 2017.  The result of the analytical grids and the revised general block exemption regulation will be more legal certainty and more clarity, but there will be no change in the decision-making practice of the Commission. With this work, we are doing exactly what you have been calling for under Recital 45 of the Port Services Regulation. However, for institutional reasons and to recall the better law—making principles agreed between the Commission and the co—legislators, we will record a statement from the Commission to be inserted regarding this recital. The text is balanced. It is the result of three years of discussions with all stakeholders. All major organisations representing the European port sector stand behind it – the trade unions, port authorities, port terminal operators and port services providers. It received strong support in the Transport Committee and was accepted unanimously by Member States. It is now time to conclude the legislative procedure at first reading. All the circumstances allow it.

First, the recital does not relate to any of the enacting terms of the regulation and hence does not comply with the principles of the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making. In that agreement, the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission confirmed that they remain fully committed to the Interinstitutional agreement on common guidelines for the quality of drafting of Community legislation, which provides that the purpose of recitals is to set out concise reasons for the chief provisions of the enacting terms, without reproducing or paraphrasing them, and that recitals should not contain normative provisions or political exhortations. Second, the Commission recalls that the notion of State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU is an objective one, enshrined in the Treaty and not at the disposal of the Union legislator. It can only be applied as such by the Commission or national courts in specific cases, subject to the control of the Union courts. Third, the wording of the recital may create confusion. Having regard to the Treaty notion of State aid, it cannot be claimed that public funding of all access and defence infrastructure accessible to all users on equal and non-discriminatory terms always falls outside the scope of the State aid rules. The Commission’s decisional practice shows, for instance, that public funding of certain access infrastructure located within the area of a port may constitute State aid.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 119, "date": "2016-12-14.json", "name": "Bart Staes", "mepid": "4751", "text": "Reporter.- I will not take up much of your time.I would like to point out that this is the ninth time this year that we have appointed a new Member of the Court of Auditors.At the beginning of 2016, there were still 5 women in 28 members of the Court of Auditors.With the appointment of this Estonian member, we drop to the level of 3 women out of 28.

Thus, it is much more difficult to define the evolution of farm performance than undertakings in other economic sectors. Income uncertainty is particularly detrimental to investment and innovation and can therefore threaten the economic viability of farms. Moreover, due to the seasonality of agricultural production, agricultural product markets are characterised by an internal trend of volatility. It is widely recognised that excessive volatility is unhelpful either for producers (distorts market signals and therefore revenues depend on randomness) or for consumers (changes in food choices). Variability is a complex phenomenon whose origins are diverse, and sometimes contradictory. After a sharp rise in the prices of agricultural products on world markets, they began to fluctuate heavily between 2007 and 2008. This phenomenon has entered the agenda of international policy and is due to its possible impact on global food security. Therefore, in 2011.

The social costs of an eight-year-long economic crisis are evident and have revealed deep—seated structural problems in Greece that existed before the crisis. The new programme for Greece has been designed to address these challenges, paving the way for sustainable economic growth and job creation. We are seeing a gradual improvement in employment, although unemployment remains at worrying levels. We hope that these positive trends will continue in 2017 as the economic situation improves and growth takes hold. If the new programme is fully implemented, Greece will have come a long way in securing sustainable growth and job creation. The first review of the third programme has been completed successfully, and the last related disbursements were made at the end of October. The second review is ongoing. All sides are working towards a positive conclusion. As you will recall, in the summer of 2015, we negotiated– on behalf of the European Stability Mechanism – the new Memorandum of Understanding for a Stability Programme. The Commission insisted that social and fairness considerations were explicitly and seriously taken into account in the design of the adjustment programme. We conducted an ex—ante social impact assessment to this effect. Furthermore, this has most importantly translated into a number of policy choices and measures to strengthen social safety nets. One such critical example is the roll-out of a guaranteed minimum income scheme, or ‘social solidarity income’, to improve the effectiveness, sustainability and fairness of the Greek social protection system. We are also working with the authorities on vocational education and training measures to support employment and job creation to the benefit of the Greek people. In addition, measures to curb tax evasion, fight informality, introduce social and generational equity, strengthen decent employment, and reduce undeclared work can be found at the heart of this stability support programme. I would also like to recall the substantial support of the European Structural and Investment Funds for improving the labour market and social situation. More than EUR 4 billion is available to Greece from the European Social Fund for the period 2014-2020 to finance measures promoting job creation, social inclusion, institutional capacity-building and investment in education. Youth employment is supported by an additional EUR 170 million from the EU Youth Employment Initiative. Overall, the reform promoted through the economic adjustment programmes have aimed to help Greece to build a more solid basis for growth and job creation founded on sustainable public finances, a stable financial system and a more competitive and dynamic economy. Achieving these objectives required many changes, including in the sphere of labour market legislation, in order to facilitate the adjustment of the economy. This has sought to promote labour reallocation, reduce the extent of job destruction and contribute to restoring competitiveness. Under the memorandum of understanding agreed in August 2015, Greece agreed to bring collective bargaining, collective dismissal and industrial action frameworks into line with best practices. To facilitate this task, the memorandum provides for a broad consultation process involving a group of international experts. The expert group submitted a report in September 2016 after consultation with major stakeholders, including social partners. The Commission considers the report an important input into the ongoing discussions between the Greek Government and the representatives of the Institutions on how to improve collective bargaining and other labour frameworks. The goal is to establish a strong and more sustainable social partnership, striking an optimal balance between protection and flexibility, providing certainty to companies and adequate safeguards to workers. The gains in competitiveness of recent years must be secured, ensuring a pathway to sustainable growth and job creation. Regarding the framework for collective bargaining, the experts were not unanimous in their recommendations, but they also did not recommend reducing the scope of collective labour agreements. We believe in the importance of social dialogue and constructive industrial relations. This is about respecting workers’ rights and the autonomy of social partners in collective bargaining. The Commission has always tried to engage in a constructive dialogue with the social partners, both at EU and country level to discuss the economic developments and labour market reforms under preparation. Apart from the formal consultation process with the social partners on the existing labour market frameworks, the Commission held dedicated bilateral meetings with both sides of industry to exchange views on labour market reforms.  We welcome the steps that have been taken so far to improve the process of social dialogue in Greece. However, more effort is needed. The Commission encourages the process of establishing a framework for a more constructive social partnership as a medium—term goal. For that, respect, ownership and representativeness are key.

I thank the Council and the Commission for coming and, above all, for the statements on labour market reforms and industrial relations in Greece. I would like to take up our debate today in October, in which I referred to the lack of reforms in relation to a key area of structural reform, namely the labour market. Where are we, or should I say where is Greece today? Progress is encouraging, even though there has been no agreement between Greece and lenders on labour market reforms. Flexible labour markets with flexible collective bargaining rules and also redundancies are important elements for reducing unemployment and to ensure that Greek companies can and want to afford to recruit and employ Greeks again. A return to an outdated system of centralised collective bargaining and redundancies is certainly not a solution. This is also important in view of the lack of a well-functioning social security system. Pensions cannot be equated with or ultimately replace social security. The progress made over the last few weeks must not be compromised, but must be an incentive for further efforts to move forward at last.

Mr Juncker’s letter in response to us stated that the Commission acts in full compliance with the EU Treaties, but that the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights doesn’t apply as such to Greek measures.

Either we are on the Greek side or we are on the side of Europe. For my part, I have the impression that Greece is one of the Member States, that a number of efforts have been made, that when financial assistance reaches 330 billion, the Greeks cannot say that nothing has been done for them and that the fact that Greece is still a member of the euro area clearly shows the common will to keep that country in the euro area, moreover, in accordance with the will of its people. The solidarity we have shown is solidarity with a Member State that was experiencing imbalances — my own knows about them too, so I am not coming to get the little beast — I am simply saying that we must have a good chronological approach. It was not the European Union that precipitated Greece into difficulties: there were difficulties which the European Union has more or less well solved, but which cannot be fully attributed to the European Union. I would also like to speak a bit as chairman of the Intergroup Against Poverty. I agree with the idea that the social situation is very serious; that when there are so many children who suffer from poverty — about 23% living in difficult conditions — this is not good for the future of the country; that when youth unemployment is too high, it is not good for the future of the country; that equality before tax is not good for the future of the country; not always totally what one might want — i remember, when i was rapporteur for the two-pack, we tried to do a lot so that there were as many actions on the expenditure side as on the revenue side to rebalance a budget. I believe that the key question is whether the European Commission and Member States in the Council agree to focus on reforms that bring investment and employment. We must get a little out of this role play in which we reject responsibility to infinite and think effectively of the Greek people and the peoples of the other Member States who have contributed through their taxes to try to get Greece out of where it is.

I would like to ask you, gentlemen of the Commission and of the Council: the International Monetary Fund, which is not a Europe, is asking, especially for Greece, that the European acquis should not be applied. What's your position? How long will you give in to the demands of the International Monetary Fund, violating European legitimacy and hurting Greece, its economy, the Greek people and the eurozone, because if the eurozone and the European Union cannot prove that it solves problems, then the propaganda of the anti-European populist extreme right will be strengthened.

A year later, a new structural adjustment plan was imposed on Greece, and the social impact, which has never been studied, has become quite visible in the meantime: one million jobs lost since 2008, one third of the Greek population exposed to poverty and exclusion, one in six workers — one in six workers! — exposed to poverty, while millions of Greeks no longer have access to health care. Meanwhile, Member States and the IMF are coalising to impose on Greece a new package of measures, retargeting the labour market, with the annihilation of collective bargaining and the total liberalisation of redundancies. So, in fact, there is no obligation on the Juncker Commission to carry out social impact assessments. On the other hand, the Commission has a legal obligation to be guardian of the Treaties, to enforce the law of the European Union, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Everyone knows that the measures advocated by creditors, in this plan and in the previous ones, are a lighter violation of European law. If the European Union really wants to help Greece, it will be able to focus on four points. First, to alleviate the burden of Greek debt that is not repayable as it is. Secondly, to help Greece establish an effective tax administration to combat fraud and evasion, an area in which successive Greek governments have not really illustrated themselves. Thirdly, stop returning refugees to Greece and, on the contrary, relieve Greece — the front-line country — of the burden of receiving refugees. This is probably the country of the Union which has the least resources to do so. And finally, mobilize investment. You're gonna tell me, “There's the Juncker plan.” Congratulations! There is the Juncker plan: 3% of the investment in the Junker plan goes to Greece and, at the same time, 10% to Germany, a country that no longer knows what to do with its savings.

It was time, the minister said, to reward Greece's efforts with a lowering of debt, because Greece kept its word, it's time for Europe to keep its own.

Germany, the same one that has been violating surplus rules for years, the same one that hurts the whole euro area by not investing, when it should.

The German minister should explain to us what structural reforms are put in place by Germany to avoid a new diesel gate or to increase the wages of minijobs.

Moreover, I would like to address the Commission in particular, because collective bargaining is something recognized in European law (Article 156 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Article 28 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Article 6 of the European Social Charter). What cannot be done is that, in certain countries, because they are under a financial intervention programme, European law is suspended. Look, no. The fact that there is a programme in Greece does not mean that European law can be suspended. It applies the same as in any other country and, therefore, when the Greek Government has been trying to restore rights that have been abolished for some years, what it is saying is — just as the current memorandum, which does not speak of taking further labour measures — what it is saying is: 'I want to restore European law in my country'. And that, ladies of the Commission, is something that you should be supporting, because you are the guardians of the Treaties and it is you who have to ensure the application of European law throughout the continent.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 2774, "date": "2016-12-14.json", "name": "Dariusz Rosati (PPE).", "mepid": "28394", "text": "   – Madam President, Commissioner, the Greek economy has been in crisis for eight years, being unable to return to sustainable growth. A lot of blame for this unprecedented failure is routinely put on the European institutions and the so-called austerity measures, but the truth is that the necessary structural reforms in Greece have never been fully implemented. They have been incomplete, partial and delayed, and the damage has been further exacerbated by unrealistic promises made by populist politicians. If economic growth is to be restored, more flexibility is needed in the labour market. The EU should stand ready to help Greece with the European Youth Initiatives and programmes aimed at increasing mobility and employability, but the responsibility for implementing reforms is entirely on the Greek Government. Let me repeat once again that there is no obligation for Greece to accept financial assistance from outside.

First, thank you all for the very open and expressive debate.  The Commission does not agree that there has been any violation of European Union or international law and standards. International labour standards are universal instruments adopted by the international community and reflect common values and principles on work—related issues. They are common to us all. The European Court of Justice has not found that measures adopted in the framework of the economic adjustment programme are in non—compliance with the European Union Charter. That is also clear.  The suspension of the legal extensions of sectoral agreements and the favourability principle does not mean that collective bargaining has disappeared from Greece. The workers’ and employers’ organisations are free to negotiate and sign all forms of collective labour agreements at national, general, sectorial and company level. It would therefore be misleading to say that in Greece the freedom of collective bargaining has been abolished and needs to be restored. As I mentioned, at the end of September, a group of independent experts delivered a report with recommendations following a thorough assessment of the Greek labour market. We all need to see such a thorough assessment of the Greek labour market today. The experts made 12 recommendations relating to collective bargaining, collective dismissals, industrial action and the setting of a minimum wage. Four of these 12 recommendations were split, reflecting the lack of consensus within the group. These related to the setting of a minimum wage and collective bargaining, extension and favourability of principles. The Commission considers the report an important input to the ongoing discussions on possible labour market reforms in Greece. In principle, this could entail a revision of some measures which have already been implemented measures. However, simply returning to the pre—crisis status quo is not an option. The Greek labour market was already in poor shape before the crisis erupted, not least due to policies and the quality of social partnerships that were dysfunctional and not delivering. The objective of the review is to promote a more responsible social partnership today and ensure sufficient margins for flexibility to allow Greek firms still faced with the need to restructure to do so. This process represents a unique opportunity for Greece to develop a stable setting that is supportive of social dialogue. We all need such a social dialogue, of course, including job creation and competitiveness, ensuring the right balance between flexibility and fairness and taking into account the very high unemployment and the need to pursue sustainable and inclusive growth and social justice. We have carefully considered the group’s recommendations and discussions with the Greek authorities on how to reflect them are still ongoing. Therefore I will not speculate on what might or might not be. However, the Commission recognises the scope to improve collective bargaining in Greece with the goal of establishing a strong and more sustainable social partnership today. For example, extensions would need to be based on reliable mechanisms to measure the level of representativeness for collective agreements, which is something which the experts also recommended. Proper consideration should also be given to the design of all functioning systems of possible derogations. As in the past, we will do our utmost to ensure the success of the stability support programme for Greece and thus a return to economic, financial and social stability. We are convinced that the structural reforms foreseen, including those in the labour market, are necessary to enable Greece to modernise and secure the competitiveness gains of recent years. The goal is to regain the path of sustainable growth and job creation by strengthening the role of effective social dialogue and collective bargaining.

The resolution which the plenary adopted later that day provided a strong support for the Commission, and I would like to thank Parliament for this support. Today, I would like to explain what has happened since and how we see the situation since the adoption of our recommendation. As you know, the Commission raised three main issues of concern in its rule of law recommendation of 27 July. The composition of the Constitutional Tribunal, the publication of its judgments, and the effectiveness of the functioning of the Tribunal. The Commission asked the Polish authorities to address these concerns within three months. Regrettably, since the adoption of the recommendation, the situation has not improved. On 14 October, the Venice Commission issued an opinion on the rule of law in Poland which fully supports the concerns expressed by the Commission. Regrettably, the Polish Government has not accepted, but strongly criticised this opinion. Let me remind you, the Polish Government asked for the Venice Commission to give its opinion. On 27 October, the Commission received a reply from the Polish Government. However, this reply did not announce any new actions on the part of the Polish authorities to address the concerns identified by the Commission. It rather explained why the Polish Government disagreed with the positions of the Commission expressed in the recommendation. In particular, the Polish Government denied that the judgments of the Polish Constitutional Tribunal of the 3 and 9 December 2015 had any legal relevance for the composition of the tribunal.  Furthermore, three new laws regarding the Constitutional Tribunal are at the final stage of the legislative process; they were voted on last night in the Sejm. While these laws would address some of the issues raised in the recommendation of 27 July, they also introduce new provisions, raising concern in particular regarding the President of the Constitutional Tribunal.  The President of the Republic would be given the right to appoint an ‘Acting President’ of the Tribunal, which is in clear disregard of the provisions of the Polish Constitution concerning the election of the President and the Vice-President of the Tribunal. In addition, the functioning of the Tribunal is significantly impeded as three judges of the Constitutional Tribunal, elected by the previous Sejm, have still not been sworn in. Three judges appointed by the new majority are currently not participating in the Tribunal’s work. This leaves the Constitutional Tribunal unable to decide cases in composition of a full bench, which requires the participation of 11 judges. I am deeply concerned by these new developments, which threaten to deepen the rule of law crisis in Poland. I therefore urgently call on the Polish authorities not to put into force the new laws before the Constitutional Tribunal has had the occasion to examine their constitutionality, which is the role the tribunal has in the Polish Constitution. I also call on the President of Poland to urgently swear in the three judges elected by the previous Sejm, and I call on the Poland Government to publish, and fully respect, all the previous judgments of the Constitutional Tribunal. You do not get to pick and choose which judgments you like and then only publish the judgments you like; that is in violation of the separation of powers. The College is following the situation closely and will discuss the situation in Poland soon, in order to consider the situation and determine the best way of addressing this situation. Let me underline, once again, that this is not a political question; it is about our fundamental values. It is crucial that, whatever a government’s programme entails, it is done in full accordance with the constitution and the law itself. That is why the effective functioning of the Constitutional Tribunal is so important. This is also crucial for the implementation of all Union policies, including the Internal Market, and is the basis for the mutual trust between Member States. The separation of powers is essential for the functioning of our internal market, because the Court of Justice in Luxembourg has to be sure that, in its direct relationship with courts at the national level, there is no interference of the other branches of power. Judicial independence is of the essence for the whole system to be able to function, including the functioning of the internal market. To conclude, I would like to thank the European Parliament for its continuous efforts to uphold the rule of law in the EU and for supporting the Commission’s actions concerning the situation in Poland. As I said at our last debate, upholding the rule of law is the shared responsibility of all EU institutions, and it has never been as necessary as it is today. That is why, Parliament, your support is crucial; that is why, let me say this again, this is a dispute the Commission has with the Government of Poland, not with the Republic of Poland – certainly not with the people of Poland – but with the Government of Poland.

It was a dark card of Polish history. I, together with students, organized resistance at the University of Gdańsk. It was a naive barricade, in full sense of defencelessness at the sight of tanks, but also with a full sense of meaning for this protest and the hope that it would bear fruit. And we have come to a free Poland in a united Europe. This is a good opportunity to thank all those for whom the fate of Poland was not indifferent, who helped us on the path to freedom. Yesterday, which is 35 years after martial law was introduced and 27 years after independence was regained, tens of thousands of people took to the streets to voice their opposition to abuses of current power. That power came from a democratic mandate, but the mandate of less than 20% of those eligible to vote does not justify a progressive coup on the institutions of the rule of law, civil society, a healthy economy. He doesn't justify ruining Poland's position in the world. The list of these abuses is lengthening. Yesterday was a sad day for Poland, as a new assembly law stifles freedom of assembly — a fundamental right that Solidarity fought for. The list is lengthening, and you can point out the next objectives of this hearing with the public: local government, unhinged judiciary... This is all perfectly visible to the democratic world on both sides of the Atlantic. No longer can the new Iron Curtain be drained. The brainwashing mission, carried out by some public media in Poland, does not reach Strasbourg and Brussels. Anyone here who lies in the image of Polish reality loses credibility, also in this forum. It has already been referred to Poland five times in the European Parliament, so we are the sick link of this Community. The price is paid by all Poland. It is a wonderful collective work of millions of Poles that is Poland a quarter century does not deserve to be paid so great prices for abuses of power. That's why we'll be testifying to the truth. We will be the voice of millions of people who know that the principles in treaties and in our constitution are in order to protect civil liberties, a healthy economy, a healthy public and social order. We will be the voice of millions of people who feel good in the European Union, feel at home, and understand the European Union as a guarantee of our security and our chances for development.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 2802, "date": "2016-12-14.json", "name": "Birgit Sippel", "mepid": "96932", "text": " Mr President, on behalf of the S&D Group. The 30th anniversary of the Polish Constitutional Court should be a cause for joy, a symbol of Poland's commitment to freedom and democracy. But little of that can be felt. The ultra-conservative PiS government continues to amputate the Supreme Court, and in addition, reports of restrictions on the right of assembly or curtailment of women's rights are causing concern. No democratic majority in the world entitles a government to destroy democracy. That is why it was right that the Commission launched the rule of law mechanism for Poland. But the Polish government has no insight. I am tired of our calls for respect for fundamental rights, for the safeguarding of freedom and democracy bounce again and again on a wall of resistance that Mr Orbán and Mrs Szydło are building higher every day. Let's finally give a clear signal! Poland is on the Council's agenda, and only a four-fifths majority is needed to formally recognise the existence of a systemic threat to the rule of law in Poland. That would, after all, be a signal, even if there are no concrete sanctions. This also shows that the existing instruments to safeguard democracy and the rule of law are not enough. However, the Commission is not as helpless as President Juncker said in an interview. Mr. Timmermans! We urge you to present a proposal for an independent annual report on the state of the rule of law in all EU countries. Democratic fundamental rights are obviously not a matter of course. Like many places in Europe, the people of Poland have had to fight hard for this. Obtaining them now, however, is the responsibility of all Europeans.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 2803, "date": "2016-12-14.json", "name": "Ryszard Antoni Legutko", "mepid": "96796", "text": " on behalf of the ECR Group. — Madam President! Well, unfortunately, you're doing an Orwellian spectacle again. I hope that the last, though knowing this chamber, you never know anything. As before, this whole decision to debate Poland is senseless, unfair, extremely biased and unsupported. I don't know how, in such a short time, I'm supposed to disperse all these untruths that have been told. There is, please, no problem with the Assembly Act. It doesn't. Am I making myself clear? No, there are no restrictions on anyone's right to demonstrate in Poland — neither individuals, nor groups, or organizations. He doesn't! So why are you bothering people? How can you size so extremely with facts? Shame on yourselves! You must not do such things! Some comments here were on women's rights in Poland and on the Istanbul Convention. Please, if it comes to violence against women, Poland is in last place in Europe in this inglorious ranking. In last place in Europe! Your homeland, Mr Timmermans, is very high in this hierarchy. So why don't we take care of countries like the Netherlands, like Belgium, and stop talking about Poland. Come to Poland, maybe you can learn how to take care of women's rights. Apparently, it's never too late for science. This principle perhaps does not apply to the European elites, but I hope that something will change on this one. You, Mr Timmermans, are pulling the Constitutional Court case incomprehensible to me, demanding — well, because that's really what it comes down to — that this Court be dominated by nominees of one political party. This procedure was done in a way — to put it mildly — not entirely lawful at the end of your previous term during the previous government and you didn't react at the time. Why didn't you react? Why didn't the Commission respond? I'll tell you why. Because it was your site. I because I understand why you think that institutions, also Polish, should be dominated by one side of the political dispute. There has been one political constellation in the European Union since time immemorial and you have already become so accustomed to the fact that if there is a differentiation somewhere, they treat it as an anomaly. Mr President, believe me: if there are disputes in the Constitutional Court, then maybe well. If the lawyers differ, then maybe good, isn't it? Do you think that, in that case, one chorus of nominees of one party should govern, exercise control over the constitution in Poland? However, a similar attitude is characterised by — I say this with regret — the Venice Commission, which came to Poland for the first time in February of this year and did not even deal to meet the judges of the Constitutional Court who have a different opinion. She just didn't fend, and they threw their written opinion in the trash. How am I supposed to — sorry — believe in the credibility of the Venice Commission? What are these mores anyway? And don't tell me here that you're all about freedom and rights, because you're not the least about it. You mean — I repeat again — about preserving one side's monopoly. If you don't know how long they've been talking about European values here, the truth is that you have less and less to do with these values. You don't follow treaties. Mr President, you do not obey the treaties! All this procedure that you and your colleagues have initiated against Poland is out-of-war. You sir are completely ignoring it. You don't respect the principle of subsidiarity, you don't respect views other than yours, you don't recognize the principles of rational discussion, you don't recognize the Roman principle that one has to listen to the other side's rations. You don't follow another Roman rule that no one can be a judge in their own case. This alienation of European elites from European culture, which we have been seeing for a long time, is a deeply saddening fact and is fateful. More recently with my my colleague, Mr Tomasz Poręba, I wrote you an extensive letter pointing out gross errors — I repeat: gross errors — in your position and the European Commission and it is not about interpretation. It is about factual errors concerning the Polish constitution and Polish law. You, by your custom and custom, have completely ignored this. Either you didn't understand them, or you pretend you don't get it. This is the old method — pretending there isn't something. Just as the Venice Commission pretended there were no other judges to speak to. True, how does it all straight then look, if you don't have to answer arguments, no need to argue? Right? No need to look for some compromises, just you can sing the same aria at the clapping audience all the time. But this is not a political conversation, this is not a debate, this is not any way of settling a dispute. This is all unfortunately — I'm afraid — a fragment of a larger whole. The European Union, instead of stabilising itself, is increasingly swayed and you have a fair share of responsibility for this. You are antagonizing societies, deepening divisions, not only in Poland. Look at how it cooks in most European countries. Instead of unifying your allies, seeking support, you are producing new enemies at an ever-faster pace. Enemies — I say — not reformers like myself or my colleagues in my group who want the Union to reform. But it can't go on forever. Well, how long is this process supposed to go on, the process of generating a generation of new enemies who want the European Union to break up from the inside? What is your answer to this? More of the same, yes? More of the same. It could all be fatally over. Then, at the end, what can I do? I can appeal to some authority. I dedicate to you, Mr. President, and to you the famous phrase from the Old Testament, from the Book of Proverbs: “haughtiness treads before failure, and the spirit delicious before fall.” Just to make myself understood: 'Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall'.

For somebody who says that this debate should not take place, you have got a lot of speaking time from your Group. Having this debate, this is a very personal remark.  In this debate today, my thoughts go to my former colleague, Bronisław Geremek, who sat next to me for a number of years. He was always a big hero of mine when I was still a student, and I was ever so proud that he was my colleague. Today, I stand, my Group stands, this House stands with the Polish people – just as the European Parliament stood with the Polish people in 2012, when we debated and condemned the website by Geert Wilders’ party from the Netherlands against the Polish people; as the European Parliament also stood by the Polish people this summer, when we mourned a Polish citizen who was the victim of xenophobic hate crime in the UK.  We stood by the Polish people then. We also stand by the Polish people today; we stand by the thousands who took to the streets yesterday at a protest organised by the Committee for the Defence of Democracy, which I commend for their actions. We also stand by our own sister party ‘Nowoczesna’ and other parties like the EPP colleagues who are present. They are protesting against the erosion of their rights, because like all EU citizens, Polish citizens are entitled to an independent judiciary. Polish women, like other women, are entitled to protection against domestic violence. Polish women, like other women, are entitled to free choice into decide over their own bodies. Polish people have a right to freedom of assembly, freedom of speech and freedom of thought, Mr Legutko.  Now the Polish Government is robbing the Polish people of their rights and freedoms. I wonder if this is what the Polish people voted for when they went to the ballot stations a year ago. Did they vote for the restriction of their freedoms? I do not think so, Mr Legutko. They voted for a good life, to get a job, education for their children, housing and infrastructure. That is what they voted for, Mr Legutko. They did not vote for restrictions on the freedom of the press or the independence of the judiciary. Finally, a question to Mr. Timmermans: you have been criticising the Polish Government, but I would like to know what you are going to do? Because, in your letter of July 27 – I am coming to conclusion, Madam President – you described the situation in Poland as ‘a systemic threat to the rule of law’. Now, if that does not call for action by the European Commission, then what does? Even if you know that the Council will never vote for an Article 7.1 procedure, the Commission should take its responsibility and vote on that. We should put it on the agenda.

Two months ago, the Polish government wanted to criminalize and imprison women and those who helped them carry out an abortion. It was a draconian bill and so it was perhaps not so unexpected that hundreds of thousands of women and men in Poland and in solidarity demonstrations around Europe took to the streets. The Polish government was allowed to back down. It was a victory for all of us who see women as full citizens. Now the Polish government is coming back and continuing its assault on women. The government's responsible minister has declared that the country wants to withdraw from the Istanbul Convention. I'll say it one more time: pull out of the Istanbul Convention. Where are we anywhere? This is an international legal fundamental instrument to combat all gender-based violence. It is a human rights issue, of the rule of law, of fundamental principles. It is as important as respect for human rights. Clearly, one is worried about the protests of the people, because furthermore proposals are proceeding, and it has been voted on, to curtail freedom of demonstration. For us, the attack on democratic institutions and rights and the attack on women's rights are interrelated. It is democracy and fundamental rights that are being attacked.

They learn about the strikes, the protests and the demonstrations that brave Polish citizens organised in order to struggle for democracy and the rule of law. My own image of Poland is strongly shaped by these images. If young people ask me today why they should go out on the streets and get politically engaged, I very often refer to precisely these protests. In the last month, however, we have again seen mass protests and demonstrations in Polish cities and villages against restricting the right to free media, against limiting the rights of an independent jurisdiction, against depriving women of the right to their own bodies. All of these rights are fundamental rights and thus the European Union has to be concerned about them. We stand in solidarity with these movements and we support their struggles. Mr Legutko, if you are saying that we should not have this debate, I must honestly say that I would like not to have this debate and for these problems not to exist, but should I just shy away and close my ears to the concerns of thousands of Polish people who are asking me to speak up for them? Or should I shut my ears to the Venice Commission, an independent expert commission, that is saying that there are problems with the rule of law in Poland, and trust you? I don’t think so.

Let's be honest, Poland does not need your remarks, your false concern, your advice taken from the ceiling. Take care of the mess in your states, on your streets and in your societies. Poland needs no more of your hypocritical democracy. What, on the other hand, does Poland need? Freedoms. Poland needs freedom and Poland must stand on the side of freedom. We need freedom from EU laws, we need freedom from the supervision of EU officials, we need freedom from the comments of EU MPs — some people are Poles — we need freedom from the comments of EU commissioners. In a word: Poland needs freedom from this whole European Union. Poland needs freedom to work peacefully, to run the company peacefully, to live safely according to its own tradition and history.

Yet another session, and yet another opportunity for this Parliament to lecture Poland, its people and its government on how to run a democracy.

No wonder people feel more detached than ever from Brussels. The Polish Government needs no lecture from you guys on how to run a democracy; but the Left, they like to give lectures on democracy while the hypocrisy blinds them to the authoritarian regimes that they have supported in the past. Many on the left of this House kept silent or even supported Soviet socialism. While members of the Polish Government and governing party fought for years to throw off the shackles of communism and oppression, and on the week of the 35th anniversary of invoking martial law in Poland, this is fresh in our minds. It is very clear that whatever everyone's role is in this situation, it is outlined in the Treaties. This House has no real role in this; it should be for the Commission. The tone here, where we were supposed to be having a debate, seems to be undermining dialogue – it is just polarising. So often, Members in this House refer to the Treaties and call upon the Commission to act in a fair and impartial way; yet so many are happy to throw that rule book out the window if it means cheap political points can be scored here in the Parliament. Add to that, the Polish opposition parties that, having lost democratic elections at home, seek to attack their government in Brussels and Strasbourg – forgetting the fact that they packed the Constitutional Court when they were in power and did not follow international standards on media regulation, never missing the opportunity to play judge, jury and executioner. Some here will argue that they are defending democracy and offering a helping hand, but that helping hand is starting to feel like a controlling fist. The tone of this debate and the ones before it is why some Member States now feel less equal than others.

Please let me make a few points.  First of all, after the painful experiences of the first half of the last century, the free part of Europe – those of us who were lucky enough to end up on the right side of the Iron Curtain – immediately understood, inspired by Winston Churchill – and I am saddened by the fact that Mr Kamall, who made such horrible allegations, has left so I can’t answer him personally – what Churchill brought to the table, which was this: we have seen that it is possible to use democracy against the rule of law simply by saying, ‘I have a majority, therefore I dictate what the rule of law is’. That is why the Council of Europe, which was created before this institution, always said that, in a democracy, you accept the limits on democratic action which are set by the rule of law, which is controlled by a completely independent judiciary. That is the very foundation of democracy in Europe after very, very painful experiences in our common history. As soon as the Iron Curtain fell and the Polish people had fought for their liberty and obtained their liberty, they immediately subscribed to that principle and wanted to join the Council of Europe as soon as possible and, as a follow-up to that, also the European Union.  The fundamental principle is that you respect the rule of law, you respect human rights and you respect democracy, but you don’t use one against the other. There is a balance between the three that is essential for the European Union – for Europe – to remain free. I cannot understand that some people would use the word ‘freedom’ to fight the very concept of the rule of law on the basis of a democratic majority. The strength of democracy is based on the fact that those who have the majority respect the limits that the rule of law places upon them. This is the context within which we work and I am saddened by the fact that, with all the propositions we have made from our side for a dialogue with the Polish Government, we see exactly the same thing again here today in this Chamber. Mr Legutko took eight minutes not to go into the three points that we have put on the table with the Polish Government. What did he say about not publishing the rulings of the Constitutional Tribunal? Nothing.  If you respect the division of powers and if you respect the independence of the judiciary, you cannot as a government pick and choose which rulings of a Constitutional Tribunal you like and only publish those you like. You cannot do that. That is in violation of the Polish Constitution. You cannot ignore the vote in a parliament to elect judges to the Constitutional Tribunal simply because you do not like the composition of that previous parliament. When judges are lawfully elected, they should be sworn in by the President of the Republic. That is in line with the Constitution. You cannot introduce ways of operating the Tribunal that are clearly in violation of the Constitution. The arbitrator there is the Constitutional Tribunal, so the least you should do is submit these draft laws or laws to the Constitutional Tribunal and then accept the judgment of that Constitutional Tribunal. That’s the whole point of respecting the rule of law.  Also in political terms, I have already said something about some people here using freedom against this very principle. This is not the Commission of others looking at Poland. I am also a Polish Commissioner. I feel a responsibility for the Polish people. I feel a responsibility for the rule of law, all across the European Union. I can tell you, on a personal note, that I might not even been alive had my family, my father not been liberated in 1944 by Polish soldiers who offered their lives for our collective freedom. So I feel a huge debt of gratitude towards the Polish people, a personal debt of gratitude which compels me to insist on these points and to continue on these points. These men who freed us never saw freedom themselves, but their children and grandchildren are living in a free, strong and independent Poland. Poland has never been as independent as it is today as a full-fledged member of NATO and the European Union. This is something I cherish. This is one of the greatest achievements of European history. So please be aware. It is not only in Poland. I see it in many countries: nationalists and ultranationalists attacking judges everywhere in a personal way, attacking the judiciary, and ignoring the rulings of judges. This should be a warning to all of us, not just in Poland. We see it all across the European Union in some states: personal attacks discrediting the so—called elites. Who are these elites attacking the freedom of the press? I am not saying it is happening in Poland, but I am saying that it is a European phenomenon we should be aware of. Freedom is what so many people fought for. The European Union, based on the rule of law, democracy and respect for human rights is the concrete expression of the will of freedom, of 500 million Europeans. That is why I believe that these institutions – the European Parliament and the Commission – have a responsibility, where we can, to help 500 million Europeans in the expression of their freedom. For that, we need an independent judiciary in every single Member State, we need full respect of the separation of powers, which is an essential element of our freedom, and we need the possibility to debate and discuss. Because another element I warn about is portraying your adversaries as enemies. We are political opponents sometimes and we have a political debate. With your adversary you have a debate; your enemy you want to destroy or ignore. In a democracy there are no enemies, there are adversaries. That is how this Parliament operates, that is how the Commission wants to operate, and that is what we need to defend for our children and grandchildren and for our collective future: a Europe whole and free, based on democracy, the rule of law and human rights.

Let me first point out that, while these are two important elements in our comprehensive migration approach, they are not the only ones. Secondly, all our policies are interconnected, and the progress we have achieved so far – and all our reports from last week demonstrate this – is precisely because we have made progress on many fronts, not just one. From relocation and resettlement to returns, to improving reception conditions, to fighting smuggling, and indeed to cooperating with all important partner countries. All of these matter. This is why it is so important to sustain and deepen the progress that we have made so far.  We are not where we were one year ago, but the situation remains fragile. Now is not the moment to become complacent. Let me therefore start by emphasising that the EU-Turkey Statement continues to work and bear results. Fewer people are crossing the Aegean Sea – around 90 persons per day – and fewer people have lost their lives trying to do so. In parallel, more than 2 600 Syria refugees have been resettled from Turkey to the European Union since the entry into force of the Statement, and this pace continues to pick up. The main challenge is that the number of returns since September continues to be low, even if the Greek asylum service has doubled the number of experts working on the islands. Additional experts are expected to be recruited by the end of this year. Indeed, since the previous report at end of September 2016, 170 persons who went to Greece through Turkey have been returned to Turkey in the framework of the EU-Turkish Statement, including 42 Syrians. This brings the total number of migrants returned to Turkey since the EU-Turkey Statement to 777. In total, 1 960 irregular migrants were returned from Greece to Turkey in the course of 2016 under the EU-Turkish Statement or the Greek-Turkey Bilateral Readmission Protocol, and 95 of those were Syrians.  Further efforts and support are needed, in particular additional Member State experts through the European Asylum Support Office. The processing of asylum applications needs to speed up, and the number of returns of those who have no right to stay needs to increase. But there are more elements to the EU-Turkey Statement, and you know that. Both parties are fully committed to implementing and delivering on all.  The Commission has accelerated the implementation of funding through the Facility for Refugees in Turkey for humanitarian and for non-humanitarian purposes, with a view to addressing the most critical needs of Syrian refugees and host communities in Turkey. These funds are now starting to have a direct impact on the ground. On visa liberalisation, the Commission and Turkey are continuously engaged in committed dialogue to find solutions to all outstanding benchmarks. To conclude, the implementation of the EU-Turkey Statement continues to deliver results, despite challenging circumstances. The Commission will continue to drive this work forward and will present its fifth report on the progress made in early March 2017.  On the recommendation of the resumption of Dublin transfers to Greece, let me begin by repeating once again – and I want to be very clear on this – that no single Member State should bear the burden of the refugee crisis alone. No Member State in the future should be left alone to endure an unsustainable burden. Significant progress has been achieved in Greece to put in place a fully functioning asylum system over the last months and years under very pressing and difficult circumstances. We should all praise and commend Greece for this, and we should continue to support Greece. Greece is also facing huge challenges in implementing the EU-Turkish Statement. The number of asylum applications has multiplied by four during the course of this year. This why we have recommended a gradual resumption of Dublin transfers of asylum seekers, starting as of 15 March 2017, in order to reach a balance between the burden the country still has to face and returning Greece back to the Dublin system. But let me be clear on this: the Commission did not decide to send refugees or migrants back to Greece. What we recommended to Member States is a gradual return to the application of the rules. Greece’s progress, despite the exceptional situation, has been recognised by the fact that we proposed a gradual resumption as of mid-March 2017 meaning for migrants that will enter Europe through Greece after that date only and might try to move irregularly towards other Member States. But even then, it will concern only certain categories and it will presuppose individual guarantees for the transfer of its migrants which Greece should be in a position to provide.  We recommend that every time a Member State wants to execute a Dublin transfer, they should only do so after having received individual assurances from the Greek authorities that its particular applicant will be received in the conditions mandated by European law. Sending the message that rules have started to apply will encourage relocation efforts by showing Member States that Greece is respecting its legal obligations to take back asylum seekers who have absconded.  Relocation will only work if other Member States do their part in picking up the pace of relocation and deploying national experts. In addition to that, asylum seekers need to know that they cannot relocate themselves, and that if they do so, they will be sent back and cannot benefit from relocation. It goes without saying that the Commission will constantly monitor the situation and update its recommendation if necessary. The ultimate responsibility for resuming transfers lies, of course, with the Member States, and their national courts.  Returning to a fully functioning Dublin system is a key element in restoring the normal functioning of the Schengen area. As you know, secondary movements of asylum seekers from Greece have been one of the reasons for the reintroduction of internal border controls. The resumption of transfers, coupled with the fact that Greece has reinforced the control at its northern border, is important to move in this direction.  In parallel, we pursued together with you the priority of finalising the negotiations of the reform of the Dublin system based on a fairness mechanism which also relies on the effective carrying out of Dublin transfers.  As I said at the beginning, all these elements go hand in hand. This is also why the Commission called last week on Member States to sustain the good progress in terms of relocation and to ensure at least 2 000 relocations per month from Greece and 1 000 from Italy from this month onwards. And the Commission is doing everything to support all Member States to the maximum – and in particular the frontline Member States – to effectively address not only the immediate, but also the long-term challenges of migration, and to turn them into opportunities. But for all elements to go hand in hand, we need many hands. It is absolutely critical that all actors and stakeholders, all Member States, EU agencies, civil society organisations as well as you, honourable Members, take up their fair share of their responsibility.

However, lately we have on average arrivals of about a hundred people every day. It should be noted that in the islands of the North-East Aegean, sixteen and a half thousand people are currently hosted in places of capacity less than half, living in difficult conditions, while throughout the country there are more than sixty-five thousand, with enormous responsibilities, I stress, of today's government of Greece, which goes without a plan, creating deadlocks. It goes without saying that tensions and incidents are causing, which test the strength of Greek society. The relocation of refugees to the Member States is working, but slowly, as are the returns of irregular migrants to Turkey. The agreement is being respected but with problems, so that Greece is unable to accept more foreigners and provide them with decent living conditions, bearing in mind that hundreds of thousands of my fellow citizens are already living below the poverty line, due to the recession in which the country is for the seventh consecutive year. Given these facts, if, if, by God, asylum seekers are now returned to Greece under Dublin, they are certain that they will create complete suffocation and an explosive situation that will not be manageable.

The European Union is sending Syrians back to Turkey, where the human rights situation is deteriorating from day to day. Of course, migration pressure on Greece had to be lowered. But was there, sincerely, no alternative but to return these refugees to a country plagued by such a situation? To be clear, I am not against cooperation with third States, which is an essential instrument of a comprehensive and effective European migration policy, but that cannot mean the outsourcing of that same policy. It is clear that agreements continue to be reached in this direction, as with Afghanistan, Pakistan and Mali. We must tackle the root causes of migration. This is probably the most important thing and it must be done through our external action, with full respect for the values of the Union. It would be totally harmful if this approach was conditional, between humanitarian action and border protection. Finally, I would like to express my complete misunderstanding of the desire to re-establish transfers of asylum seekers under the Dublin Regulation, when, for example, the ECHR had already condemned Belgium a few years ago.

If you go elsewhere, you will be returned. This is the only way to discourage irregular migration and this is why we need the Dublin system and Dublin transfers.  Irregular arrivals in the Eastern Mediterranean have come down by 70% from last year’s figures, mainly thank to the closing of the Balkan road and the EU-Turkey statement.

On the issue of migration, I am afraid we are not performing much better. The so called EU-Turkey statement was entered into bilaterally between Member States and Turkey, explicitly designed to circumvent this Parliament’s legal rights to consent, or not, to international agreements. Basically, the agreement is to hand over EUR 6 billion of taxpayers’ money to the autocratic ruler Erdoğan, not on the basis of international law or any formal agreement, but on a joint press release.  Recently, I have heard different Member States suggesting concluding similar agreements with countries like Libya, Tunisia, and even exploring (like Australia, by the way) absurd ideas such as external processing centres in these countries. I wonder, Commissioner, if the Commission today can put an end to such ideas once and for all, and instead focus on the challenges that we are facing together. In other words, concluding the legislation that lies before us on the common European asylum system that must be resilient and stand the test wherever pressure is met in Europe.

They could have been describing many of the camps or reception centres, especially on the islands in Greece. They said: we look up to Europe as a symbol of humanity. Well, we are really failing at the moment. If it were not for local people in many of these places, themselves often in dire need, the situation would be even worse.

I read in the recommendation of the European Commission itself, among other things: 'There are 16 000 refugees on the islands, while there is only room for 8 000, and there is a waiting list of 1 200 unaccompanied minors in the area of adequate care. Many of the reception facilities in Greece are substandard. The hotspots are short in terms of sanitation and hygiene.” For example, I can continue for a while with the findings from the European Commission's communication. The question is therefore to the European Commission: how realistic is it that in three months' time we will have a situation in Greece where we can actually send people back to Greece?

Tens of thousands of refugees are waiting on mainland Greece. Solidarity is also an essential prerequisite for maintaining a functioning Dublin system in Europe in the current circumstances.

Honourable Members of Parliament, let me start by thanking you for your interventions. They contribution to a very lively debate. The Commission is very aware of your concerns. When we are dealing with a refugee crisis of this scale we can not afford to be ideological only, we have to be pragmatic. On Turkey, let me reiterate once again that this is an equal and mutually benefical partnership. The European Union Needs Turkey, but Turkey Needs the European Union as well. If anything has come clear this last year it is that the migratory challenges are not national or even European alone, they are global. You all Remember how this unprecedented phenomenon started. Everyone believed that it was a problem of the southern European countries, then it became a European one and now it has taken on global dimensions. And the EU-Turkey statement has started production tangible results. I spoke about it in the beginning, but our partnership can not be at all cost, it has to answer all the fundational and human rights and it continue to do so, and all elements and benchmarks must be fully filled. We are very clear on that. The European Union does not lower its principles. On Dublin now, I know some of you think we are not coming fast and other think we go too fast. Again I repeat what I said before, all our elements go hand in hand. But they also have to go hand in hand in an approximate and timely manner: no migrant will be sent back today, this week or next. What we recommend is that certain specific categories of migrants enterting Greece after 15 March, and who continue onwards to the north, can be sent back to Greece, if Greece is in a position to take them and provides individual guarantees about their reception. but from now until then further and intensified progress is needed in Greece, and we are supporting the Greek Government to better organise the reception centres and whatever is necessiary. And this is precisely where Additional Support is needed from Member States, Mr Papadimoulis is right on that. We can not accept that one or a handful of Member States shoulders this enormous responsibility of the refugee crisis. If we are a true European Union then one of the fundamental values on which this Union is built is solidarity, and solidarity, yes, does not come in pieces or à la carte. Our objective is to return to overall stability in the European Union. Relocation, Dublin, Schengen, it is all interconnected. And we can not have one without the other. Members of Parliament, we Need your support to continue delivery and moving forward on all such issues. And now, I accept your request, I turn to Greek. I should like to say a few words in Greek, since most of the last questions were addressed by distinguished Members of Parliament, who are Greeks: Mr Kyrkos, Mr Hadjigeorgiou, Mr Marias and Mrs Wozeberg. I wonder why there is a pervasive misinterpretation of the Commission's recommendation on Dublin. I have said it from the very first day I have repeated it today and I keep repeating it until it is understood. As I have already pointed out, no, Dublin returns to Greece are not starting. Clearly, it can't be said. The recommendation proposes a gradual and not complete recovery and, above all, it is clear that immigrants who are or will be in other Member States having entered through Greece before 15 March 2017 will not be sent back to Greece. Clearer positioning I think there can be no more understandable. It will actually only concern a small number of people, because controls at Greece's borders with Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have been strengthened and what we call secondary movements are no longer being carried out. In addition, the Greece has called for the development of the European border guard in the region, which is also under way. This means that already, and certainly long before 15 March, no immigrants will be able to leave irregularly. The recommendation is therefore positive for Greece. Greece since 2011 — and this is worth reminding you — has been out of law with regard to asylum legislation, for reasons related to human rights violations at the time. You understand that. It could not continue and would not facilitate discussions, negotiations for a fairer and more effective Dublin mechanism, which is currently being revised on our proposal. In other words, with this proposal Greece is returning to European legitimacy. Is there anyone who wouldn't want this in Greece? The Recommendation recognises the significant progress — and we should note this — that has been made in Greece despite what is being heard and written. In order for the asylum system to work better and more effectively, under conditions of unprecedented pressure in extremely adverse conditions and, of course, with the substantial substantial assistance of the Commission, the European agencies and the Member States, it has become undeniable progress. Therefore, the recommendation — I repeat — does not apply immediately, but since 15 March. Excludes outstanding refunds and no immediate refunds are foreseen. However, even after 15 March it will concern certain categories of the few that will manage to bypass the checks and under conditions and with guarantees that Greece should be able to provide for each individual request for return, so with the cooperation of Greece. Because we have to compare with the way things were a year and a half ago, where there was no control and there was a great deal of the entry of irregular immigrants and mainly refugees through the Aegean into our country. These I say, so that the picture is clear in the face of a proper and objective evaluation of what the Commission has proposed. If circumstances change, the Commission will obviously revise its recommendation and may I add: All the other progress reports it presented on the same day are directly linked to this composition, i.e. the need to continue to implement the EU-Turkey declaration successfully, i.e. a reduction in arrivals, increased returns, stabilisation of satisfactory rates of relocations from Greece and Italy, the need to send experts immediately to speed up procedures in the context of both the declaration and relocation. Mr. Hadjigeorgiou asked a question. Alternative agreements are not considered. The declaration of the European Union-Turkey works and we are committed to implementing it. I do not know, to be honest, what statement by Mrs Mogherini Mr Hadjigeorgiou referred to, but it obviously concerns something else. Mr Papadimoulis, I said this before: You are right. We agree. I told you, and I want to see fixed relocation numbers. I do not hide — I say so in public — that I am disappointed. I would have expected a much more consistent response from all the Member States, because, as you rightly said, solidarity is not a go-ahead, and solidarity is not just in the face of the good that the European Union does, but also in the difficult times that the Member States are going through. And this solidarity, along with responsibility, are the two basic principles that today also test the very existence of Europe. I have said many times that, after all, it is not the economic crisis that is bringing Europe to its knees. It is the refugee crisis, because it is it that calls into question the basic principles we have spoken about today. I would like to believe that with our constant efforts in the end we will be able to take down the last obstacles in order to fully implement what I told you about a year ago and get to the numbers that we have set as target. This is not going to be an easy path and I will need the support of the European Parliament, as in the last two years, to which I would like to take this opportunity to express my public gratitude, because all that we have achieved is due to the fact that I have had from the first the full support of the democratic and progressive forces of this area.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 2883, "date": "2016-12-14.json", "name": "Președintele. –", "mepid": "33984", "text": "The debate has been closed.

All the groups have been up to what they were asked, and we have been able to see the implications that this report had on the Union's foreign policy, general visa policy and, above all, on future liberalisation processes. Ukrainians and Georgians were following our debates and called for protection from Parliament from the Council's attitude, which linked the adoption of this report without legal basis to the negotiation of those other dossiers. I sincerely hope that, now that we are going to approve the reformed suspension mechanism, the Council will cooperate with Parliament on the rapid visa waiver for Georgia and Ukraine, countries which have long met the requirements. It has been six months of intense and hard debates in Parliament. We are thoroughly employed to reform this mechanism and make it more effective, operational and agile. Throughout this time we have tabled up to four different compromise proposals that sought to accommodate the positions of all parties. Unfortunately, we saw how all these proposals were rejected by the Council without any legal grounds. I hope that once all the related dossiers are completed, we will be able to know the intrahistory of the position of some Member States, especially those that blocked the agreement until late Thursday night. I know it's not the ideal text. That's not what we would have wished. We have all made great concessions, but without forgetting our positions: defending fundamental rights and preserving Parliament's role. And if we have done this, you were aware that with our commitment we strengthened the European project. The mechanism had to be more flexible, agile and operational, since the circumstances which gave rise to the originator's approval in September 2013 have been overwhelmed in recent years. Today we can guarantee the future of the Schengen area, avoiding possible abuses that could result from visa liberalisation processes. In addition, we can activate this mechanism in the event that some of the following situations occur in relation to a third country which is exempted from the visa requirement for access to the Union: an increase in the number of nationals refused access or for whom they are found to remain in the territory of the Member State irregularly; sudden increase in asylum applications in an unjustified manner; risks or imminent threat to the public order or internal security of States; or a decrease in cooperation on readmission. And at the same time, in line with our foreign policy, we ensure that the criteria that gave rise to visa liberalisation with third States are still respected in the future. We are talking about all the criteria contained in Article -1 of the Regulation: regional coherence, economic benefits, security, among others, but especially the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, both in our territory and in that of origin. This is something we achieved through the introduction of a new monitoring mechanism by the Commission, for a period of seven years after the liberalisation of the visa requirement, or subsequently if there are indications of violation of any of these criteria. And we do this in turn improving and ensuring Parliament's role in decision-making on future temporary reintroductions of the visa requirement. For us, the issue of delegated acts is an emblematic issue. It is a fundamental question, as I always have defended. Visa policy is a shared matter. Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 is amended, as in this case, through the ordinary legislative procedure and therefore any substantial amendment to the basic act must be made through a delegated act, rather than implementing. This has always been our position, it was in 2013 and we kept it before the Court in 2015, which gave us the right in its judgment of 16 July of the same year. Finally, to conclude this part of my speech, I would like to point out that the Commission is also taking a new role, adding to what already has the activation of the mechanism as a power within the competence of the Commission, the Member State concerned and the simple majority of the Member States. And the Commission also gains powers by activating the review and evaluation mechanism.”", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 2887, "date": "2016-12-14.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members of the Parliament, the last-minute addition of this point in the plenary agenda was a very welcome one to me. The agreement on the reinforced suspension mechanism goes beyond the importance of the mechanism itself. Let me start by expressing my thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Agustín Díaz de Mera, for his excellent work. I know it was not an easy job. You did it. Without his commitment it would not have been possible to reach an agreement before the end of the year. I also want to express my thanks to the Council Presidency, which brokered the deal in the Council. Both institutions made decisive steps towards each other at the last minute, which made the agreement possible. The Commission also made some concessions for the sake of an overall agreement – for example, by accepting some elements of automaticity introduced by the Council. We also committed to taking into consideration the categories proposed by the Member States and to ensuring that these categories are sufficiently large to address in a proportionate way the circumstances. The Commission has made declarations in that respect to COREPER. Overall we have jointly succeeded in making the suspension mechanism a more effective instrument for our common visa policy. It will enable the European Union to react quickly in situations of strong migratory pressures or high security risks by suspending the visa exemption for certain third-country nationals. The final outcome allows for a flexible approach and a proportionate reaction to the circumstances encountered. Very importantly, it also allows for a dialogue with the third country concerned to remedy the situation that led to the suspension. By adopting this strengthened suspension mechanism we will be able to pursue our visa liberalisation strategy based on stronger safeguards. I am pleased to know that the trilogue on visa liberalisation for Georgia has been successful, and I am looking forward to the same outcome for Ukraine. These two countries have concluded a series of reforms to implement their so-called visa liberalisation road map, and it is now for us to deliver and grant to their citizens visa-free travel to Europe. Our common priority now is to accelerate the procedures for the entry into force of the suspension mechanism as well as for the adoption of the visa liberalisation proposals for Georgia and Ukraine. We have delivered on the commitments made to our partners. The correct implementation of visa-free travel for Georgia and Ukraine will only be beneficial mutually, enhancing the cultural and economic exchanges and strengthening mobility between these countries and the European Member States.

At least such has been in the past. I remember the extraordinary emotions of the people from the Western Balkans when we managed to abolish their visas. Today, this same visa policy is losing its appeal due to constant tightening. On the one hand, due to additional, including political, visa waiver criteria and new measures such as the introduction of smart borders or ETIAS. On the other, because of the constant threat after the reintroduction of visas, which allows the newly adopted mechanism on suspension. Dear Commissioner! The European visa policy has another key side, that is, reciprocity. The European Union must also have the courage to act when it comes to the issue of reciprocity.

The mechanism for suspending the visa waiver is currently inappropriate, and that is why we have practically amended the regulation with regard to the suspension process, and that is what we will vote on tomorrow. It is very important to understand that the credibility of the European Union is also at stake, which grants visa waiver to some states, and then, obviously, expects those States to continue the progress and the criteria they met at the time of the visa waiver. If they take backward steps, it is not normal for them to continue to benefit from the visa waiver. Also, our credibility to European citizens, who see that we have exempted citizens of some states from visas, but then see that they violate public order, see that they do not come with good and clean intentions across the Union and create problems. That's why it's very good for credibility. What we are changing, very briefly, is: the deadlines for the visa waiver application have also been shortened, the reasons for applying for the suspension of the visa exemption have been increased, and one of them is new, namely the failure to comply with the readmission obligation of migrants where such agreements.

Both Parliament and Council had to make concessions, resulting in a two-step approach which I believe in the end does not affect the main objective of this proposal; but we lost time due to the interinstitutional in-fighting.

It is important to clarify what has happened and address concerns. I would like to touch upon the facts regarding the incident and, finally, to draw some conclusions. But first of all, we have to have all the facts straight. On 22 September, a former staff member of Europol informed Europol that she had been contacted by a journalist earlier that day in relation to Europol operational data. The journalist had obtained access to those data via a private storage device belonging to the former staff member. As soon as Europol was informed about this possible compromise of data, a security investigation was launched, in coordination with the national authorities of the Member State of the former staff member in order to identify the nature of the compromised data. The national authorities also initiated a judicial investigation. In parallel, the Member States directly affected were informed by Europol in order to establish any possible impact. The Security Committee of Europol, where all Member States are represented, received a classified report on the matter. The Europol Data Protection Officer was also briefed.  Later on, the information about the incident became public on 30 November, when a TV programme was announced and then broadcast on Dutch television. It was in that context that the Europol data compromise was mentioned. Immediately, Europol circulated a background note about the incident to the relevant stakeholders - the Europol Management Board, the European Commission, the Europol Data Protection Officer, the Joint Supervisory Body, the EU Counter Terrorism Coordinator, the Council Secretariat as well as the Chairperson of the LIBE Committee. The Europol Security Committee was updated as well. Last week, the European Data Protection Supervisor, which will become Europol’s data protection oversight body on 1 May next year, was also informed. As regards the content of the compromised data, it is worth noting that we are talking about historical data which are mostly more than 10 years old. According to the assessment of the Member States concerned and Europol, the data do not jeopardise on-going investigations. Let me also make some additional remarks. As unfortunate as this incident might be, the case reported in the media is not a data leak – Europol’s information systems and its operational environment were not ‘hacked’ or intruded upon. In fact, Europol adheres to the highest standards of data security, including continuous security awareness briefings provided to its staff members. Europol operates state-of-the-art databases and secure communication capabilities for processing and analysing operational and classified information. Unfortunately, as with any law enforcement agency, the design of a robust system cannot completely eliminate human error. The former staff member clearly did not comply with Europol’s security rules, which explicitly forbid the use of private equipment to produce, store, process or transmit Europol operational or other sensitive information. This is the first identified case of this kind since Europol was established.  As far as the Parliament is concerned, I would also recall that the new Europol Regulation, which comes into application on the 1 May 2017, foresees a mechanism to allow enhanced parliamentary oversight. A Joint Parliamentary Scrutiny Group will be established by the national parliaments and the competent committee of the European Parliament. I therefore sincerely hope that this incident will not undermine our efforts to increase the exchange of information. We all share an interest in this. Exchange of information, not least in the framework of Europol, is vital in order to address today’s security challenges.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2916, "date": "2016-12-14.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, thank you. Members of the Parliament, thank you for the invitation to this session. Before sharing with you all the information I have on this security breach, let me stress four key points. 1. It is my firm belief that we need more cooperation on security and effective data exchange. But I am equally clear that this presupposes a high level of data protection and state-of-the-art security rules. 2. This incident could not have happened today, thanks to the technical security improvements that are finally in place. Nobody can plug in USB drives and download data from Europol computers. 3. It neither affected the private life of European citizens nor any on-going security investigations. 4. With you we have adopted new rules for Europol that will impose a different handling of the case today from May 1st 2017. Let’s look at facts first. This data breach is a case of human error by a former staff member who broke Europol’s security rules. There is no indication that the security breach by the former staff member was ill-intended. Still, it is of course unacceptable. Our data security rules should prevent human errors from happening. The data compromised involves a limited number of Member States. Europol received written assurances from the journalist that the data will not be disclosed and that they are stored safely as journalistic evidence for the television programme. I am confident on the basis of information we were given that Europol respected all its current security and confidentiality rules. A security investigation was launched with the Member State of the former Europol employee and to which the employee returned at the end of February 2016. National authorities also initiated a formal judicial investigation into the matter. In parallel, the Member States directly affected were updated by Europol to establish any possible impact. All Member States through the Security Committee of Europol received a classified report for their attention. The Europol Data Protection Officer was also briefed at an early stage of the process. It was verified that no current investigation in Member States has been jeopardised, because the breach concerns historical data which are around 10 years old. When the case was reported in the media on 30 November, Europol provided external stakeholders with a background brief on the facts: namely, an update to the Europol Security Committee, which includes all Member States; the Europol Management Board, which includes the Commission; separately, the Commission, the Europol Data Protection Officer, the Joint Supervisory Body, the EU Counter-terrorism Coordinator, the Council Secretariat, and the Chairperson of the LIBE Committee. Last week also the future data protection oversight body of Europol, the EDPS, was briefed with a report. Internally, staff were also updated when the incident was reported in the media on 30 November. Prior to that, all staff received continuous security awareness briefings. Staff members, and in particular staff working in the operational environment, are continuously trained about the expected handling of operational and sensitive information. Staff have also been briefed about the implications of the security incident. Another security awareness seminar for all staff is scheduled to take place this Friday. Honourable Members of the Parliament, as far as I am aware, this is the first real security breach of this kind involving Europol data since the establishment of the Agency in 1999. The Member States concerned confirmed that the compromised data does not jeopardise any on-going investigations. Only two people accessed the data. There are no indications that data have been further shared or the lives of private citizens affected. A judicial investigation in relation to a potential criminal offence committed by these two people is ongoing. Europol today is a different organisation than the one back in 2009 when the human error occurred. Since then, Europol has introduced numerous technical measures preventing copying of data, such as prohibiting the connection of external drives I mentioned earlier. Staff are constantly trained and informed about security requirements. The case reported in the media is not a data leak. ICT systems or the operational environment of Europol were not hacked or intruded. Handling security breaches is always the primary responsibility of the organisation when data have been compromised. That organisation, Europol, is obliged to inform the entities that provide the data, the internal data security bodies and its external data protection supervisor. Having said that, we should learn lessons from this case and improve our handling for the future. The Europol Regulation that enters into application on 1 May 2017 lays down specific rules on handling data security breaches. These rules set high standards on data security. They oblige Europol to notify the personal data breaches without delay to the European Data Protection Supervisor and the competent authorities of the Member States concerned, as well as the data provider. They oblige Europol to inform in certain cases persons whose data have been breached, and they oblige the Europol Data Protection Officer to keep a register of data breaches. Under the new Europol Regulation, a new set of security and confidentiality rules is being established. In light of his experience, we look more closely whether any changes are needed there. Finally, I would encourage Europol in the – hopefully unlikely – event of a future security breach, to share proactively information with the Commission and the Joint Parliamentary scrutiny within the limits of the security rules.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2917, "date": "2016-12-14.json", "name": "Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra", "mepid": "28397", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is no secret that I trust Europol. I affirmed at the recent interparliamentary meeting and reiterate now that Europol is an essential tool for the safety of Europeans, so my commitment is unequivocal. We are in the presence of an isolated case triggered by a former Europol official, which occurred in 2009 and caused confidential information on terrorist investigations ranging between 2003 and 2006, in breach of all Europol security standards. Europol's prestige should not be affected by this fact, nor should the Member States' confidence be affected. That is why it is important that Europol now raise at least these three questions: have sufficient measures been taken to prevent such incidents? Secondly, how should Europol guide this fact so that it does not undermine its credibility in the face of Member States or third States with which it has cooperation agreements? Thirdly, can it have implications for the security of the Member States? Although we know and affirm that Tuesday's Governing Body was very positive. On the other hand, through my own efforts, I have been able to know that a significant number of measures have already been improved. Network security accreditation has been increased, and since December 1, all USB ports on the secure network have been blocked. In addition, as is common domain, from May 2017 the new Regulation — of which I was rapporteur in the European Parliament — will enter into force, which will strengthen the data protection system. The European Supervisor, as Mr Avramopoulos said, will, as last responsible, monitor the correct use of them. Finally, there will be a greater and better system of democratic control of the Agency through the joint parliamentary control group formed by the European Parliament and the national parliaments.

It is not possible to disregard this security breach, with the excuse of individual error and that no investigation has been compromised. An agency such as Europol must be equipped with procedures and controls so that the negligence of an official is not enough for sensitive information to appear suddenly on the net. Especially when the powers of this essential agency were extended later this year, and the role of democratic control to be exercised by the European Parliament in association with the national parliaments has been strengthened. It is not acceptable that the Europol Directorate, perhaps under pressure from the Commission and some Member States, chose not to inform this House when it attended the meeting of our Libya committee at the end of last month, and it is already in possession of this information. Ironically, the subject of this meeting of the Libya committee was precisely the scrutiny of this agency. Despite all the warnings and evidence that we are living in a hybrid war environment, it is intolerable that the Commission and the Member States, which have recently been everted to use the security argument to justify sprains to human rights and the rule of law, as is the case, for example, in the reception of migrants and refugees, are not really taking cybersecurity and the devastating potential of attacks on critical infrastructure and networks seriously. It is intolerable that the Commission is not fulfilling its role as a watchman when it is attacked itself, as was the case a few days ago. It is crucial to conduct an in-depth investigation and act urgently to ensure that all Member States, institutions and agencies effectively coordinate, exchange information and are equipped with the necessary security and defence tools, which implies adequate financial investment in technological resources and human resources, including human intelligence. Frightening reports also come from other parts of the world: Russian interference will have occurred to influence, and perhaps even pervert democratic expression in the United States elections, but when, here among us, in the agency responsible for coordinating efforts to combat crime in the digital age, it is enough to Negligence to show that the king goes naked, how can we say we're safe?", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 2919, "date": "2016-12-14.json", "name": "Monica Macovei", "mepid": "96824", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. — Mr President, seven years ago, two Europol workers inserted a flash drive into a computer and left there with confidential information from the institution.

This did not affect any pending judicial investigation, any kind of investigation in general and had no other consequences. It wasn't a leak, it wasn't a cyber attack on IT systems. But this incident existed, which is regrettable and unacceptable. Today, however, it would no longer be possible. Today, no one could put a flash drive into a computer from Europol and leave with information home because Europol operates with databases that are confidential and has very high security capabilities, higher than in many Member States; analysis and processing of classified information.

To me this sounds as though 700 pages of confidential information have been publicly available. When you say that it is only historical data and that it does not jeopardise any current investigations, that does not correspond exactly to the media reports saying that there may have been an impact on ongoing investigations. So I think this is extremely worrying. If the procedures apparently do not ensure that people do not make such mistakes, we have a very serious problem. We have been asked, under great pressure, to pass a series of measures like, for example, my favourite – EU PNR – which has decentralised the storage of data. If we cannot even secure the data stored by Europol, how can we be sure that the data which Member States are now obliged to store are safe? I’m getting extremely worried here. But actually my main concern here is that we have all been talking about security, security, security, security – OK? – and we have all agreed that one of the big gaps in the security system is information sharing. This will have a devastating impact on the trust between Member States. How are you now going to convince Member States to share information? A majority of this House, as well as the Commission and the Council, fiercely opposed compulsory information sharing. I am not really sure what to think any more. You are trying to reassure us here by saying, ‘Keep moving folks, there is nothing to see here’. Well, I am not reassured.

That is a question that I would like to get an answer to.

Do you really know, and this is my question to you, where did the data go? Are you sure it just stayed there? You're playing down the incident, and I wonder how stupid do you think Parliament is? Also in view of the fact that the Europol data monster will gain even more skills in 2017, more public authorities will be involved in it, and even more data systems will be networked.

It is true that this example is not the rule, and maybe today we have better standards to protect us against those losses, but there may be other occasions when data are lost and there may be other breaches of security. No system is 100% secure. There will never be any system which is 100% secure. That makes it even more important that we look for the data which are necessary, concentrate on that and do not build up a huge storage of data just because we can do it technically. We should rather have a better and quicker exchange of information built on common standards which are high on security and data protection. This should not only apply to the Member States with the Data Protection Directive, but should also apply to all EU data systems and agencies. That is not the case today.

However, there are good reasons why the police and the fight against terrorism should remain national affairs. Different states have different ways of combating terrorism, and the more diverse the paths, the more likely success. A single large authority runs the risk of monopolizing a defective structure. In January, Europol founded a European Counter Terrorism Centre. The nation states are encouraged to provide their data to this centre. A police officer has taken home 54 investigative files, 700 pages. It ended up in public, and you can not be one hundred percent sure that no one else used the material.

It is simply nonkind to believe that the fight against terrorism would be better if each nation state worked on its own. This is almost counterproductive at a time when it is known that both organized criminals are moving across all borders, operate internationally, and are facilitating and supporting each other. That is why we need information exchange, which is why we need cooperation, which is why we also need data security and we need intensive data exchange, which will make it possible to combat criminals optimally. We need the various centres that deal with the new information technologies and the strategies that criminals use.

Mr Díaz de Mera García was quite correct when he said that this was an unfortunate, but isolated, incident. It cannot – and will not – happen again. Mr Albrecht is also absolutely right: data protection and data security standards should be stepped up. Mrs in 't Veld, Europol’s systems were not hacked or intruded into. There was, as I said before, human error with an external hard drive. This cannot happen again. Europol has informed us that ongoing investigations have not been compromised, and the Member States concerned have confirmed that. Europol informed us – and you – and all the other parties concerned after the press reports. In its current rules, we are external parties. In future, with the new Europol regulation, the EU will scrutinise Europol’s activities through the Joint Parliamentary Scrutiny Group.

It was very kind of you to do so. What I will do on the Europol data leak debate, for which I was given no speaking time by my political group, is to answer Mrs in 't Veld in detail in the committee. I was informed in due course by Europol and, through full transparency, I will inform Mrs in 't Veld and the whole committee of how I was informed. Thank you for that opportunity. It is much welcomed. We now come to the important oral question, which many colleagues have been waiting for, on the very important, compelling and urgent issue of visa reciprocity. As colleagues will know, this is an ongoing issue of urgency, not just for those five countries and the citizens of those five countries – Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and Cyprus – but indeed a matter of principle for the whole House on questions of symmetry and equality in our relationship with the United States.  In 2013, Parliament and the Council adopted a regulation modifying, amongst other elements, the so-called reciprocity mechanism. It entered into force in January 2014. Under EU law and according to this mechanism, if a third country does not lift visa requirements 24 months after notification of a situation of non—reciprocity, the Commission is obliged to suspend the visa waiver for citizens of that country for 12 months, via a delegated act to which Parliament and the Council could object.  Notifications of five Member States – and I have named them – were published by the Commission on 12 April 2014. There were at times cases of non—reciprocity also affecting Australia, Japan and Brunei and all of them have now been solved. After 24 months had elapsed, on 12 April 2016, the Commission, instead of presenting the delegated act as we required, decided to publish a communication asking the Council and Parliament for their views. This communication was followed by another communication on 13 July updating the situation and again failing to fulfil the Commission’s obligations.  As Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, it is my view that the reciprocity mechanism sets out a procedure with precise time frames and actions not subject to discretionality by the Commission. Therefore, the Commission is under an obligation to adopt a delegated act pursuant to Article 1(4)(f) of Regulation 539/2001.  As the Commissioner knows, on 7 June 2016, I sent a letter reminding you, Commissioner, of the legal obligations of the Commission here. On 12 October, during the exchange we had with you in the Civil Liberties Committee, the Commission was again urged to act and all the Members who took the floor made it clear that the Commission does have some more room for manoeuvre. This was our view.  In this context, and with an overwhelming majority, we have in the Civil Liberties Committee adopted the following oral question for answer today: do you share the legal assessment according to which the Commission is obliged to adopt a delegated act – temporarily suspending the exemption from the visa requirement for nationals of third countries which have not lifted the visa requirement for citizens of certain EU Member States – within a period of 24 months from the date of publication of the notifications in this regard, which ended on 12 April 2016? In the event that the Commission agrees with the assessment that it is obliged to adopt a delegated act, by when will the Commission present this delegated act? And finally, if the Commission does not agree, what are the reasons for not agreeing with that assessment? This issue, as I said at the beginning of my presentation of this oral question, is not just about the deep and very understandable concerns of our colleagues from Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and Cyprus; it is about the idea that we in the EU have the right to expect symmetry and equality with the United States in our relationship. We are right to expect fairness. The right to expect fairness is something that we have transmitted directly to our United States partners and to the State Department in Washington, and we did so respectfully and forcefully. I believe now is the time that we need to find answers from the Commission on this very important issue. It is a troubling issue which is now persistent and this oral question comes at a time when I do believe my colleagues from these particular countries – but I do insist, well beyond those countries, and within the Civil Liberties Committee – want to find answers. So Commissioner, please try to answer these, I know, very difficult questions on visa reciprocity but which go to the heart of our relationship on visa fairness.

In October I discussed this with the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE). You will remember that, Mr Moraes. It should be clear that we all share the same objective. Full visa reciprocity is the central principle of our visa policy framework. With the United States and Canada it is a challenging and sensitive issue, and we all hope for tangible progress.  Before responding to the questions, let me start with the good news concerning Canada. As I told you in the past, I used the window of opportunity offered to us, the EU-Canada summit. A series of meetings and discussions were held ahead in order to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement. I took the plane myself to meet in person the Canadian Immigration Minister John McCallum, in order to address the real situation at political and not at technocratic level. We had a very constructive discussion with the minister and we agreed to engage in a political process to address each other’s concerns and make the lifting of visa obligations for Romania and Bulgaria possible. Indeed, and as I had hinted in my meeting with LIBE, Canada took a positive decision in line with the commitment of McCallum in July. At the summit Canada announced its decision to lift in late 2017 the visa requirements for all Bulgarian and Romanian citizens. Moreover, certain categories of Bulgarian and Romanian travellers who visited Canada in the past 10 years, or who currently possess a valid visa issued by the United States, will already become visa-free from 1 May 2017. We all welcome very much this outcome. It is a strong indication that diplomatic channels and engagement can achieve positive results. On this point, I would like to thank Members of Parliament for their constructive contribution too. We worked in close coordination with Bulgaria and Romania and they played a central role in addressing Canadian concerns. We have to continue this path to ensure that full visa waiver is achieved. The Commission will continue to do its part, in full cooperation with both Member States. Now the situation with the United States is different. While I continue discussions with our US partners, most recently at the EU-US JHA Ministerial Meeting on 5 December in Washington, there is no progress to report. But I want to assure you that I will keep this issue high on the agenda with the new administration and Congress. I will personally immediately engage in conference with my new counterparts. I call on all of you to give a chance for the political discussion to take place and to explain the mutual obligations, reservations, goals and work to find a solution.  It is very important to understand that the role of Congress is crucial. The visa waiver programme cannot be expanded without Congress, particularly if Member States do not meet the thresholds of US legislation. It seems certain that temporarily suspending the visa waiver for US citizens would immediately lead to a visa requirement imposed on all EU citizens. We are aiming for the opposite, not a reciprocal visa requirement but a reciprocal visa waiver. Let me be very clear. The Commission would not hesitate to adopt the respective acts if that would improve the situation of EU citizens, and lead to the visa waiver for all. At the same time, the Commission has a responsibility to inform you, the co-legislators, about negative consequences on the EU and its citizens from the implementation of our rules.  And this leads me to your questions. There is a regulation that says ‘the Commission shall adopt a delegated act’. But there are also other requirements and obligations to be followed which are difficult to reconcile with this obligation, and which are equally important. The same regulation says that: ‘the Commission shall take into account the consequences of the suspension of the exemption from the visa requirements for the external relations of the Union and its Member States with the third country in question’. The approach we put forward back in April outlined these adverse consequences. We still consider that the negative impacts we identified, which were not questioned by other institutions and stakeholders, should be taken fully into account. If a visa requirement is reintroduced, it will be difficult to explain to millions of EU citizens travelling to the United States every year that the EU serves their interests and that the EU action was appropriate in this case. Would legal arguments be convincing for thousands of EU citizens that would likely lose their jobs due to the expected decrease of US visitors? I very much doubt it.  A recent study for the World Travel and Tourism Council suggests that suspending the visa waiver would annually lead to a 22% drop in visitors to the European Union, or 5.5 million fewer visitors from the United States and Canada. This will be equal to a loss of EUR 6.8 billion annually, risking the loss of 140 000 jobs in the tourism industry. The most affected Member States will be Italy, Spain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Poland. I am asking the question: can we really afford that loss? Dear Members of Parliament, we are in a very unpleasant situation, but determined to work to achieve visa-free travel for all EU citizens to the United States, as we managed to do with Canada. Let us work together in this effort.

But I would like to make it clear that today we are discussing a procedural issue, not a matter of substance. I am very sincerely grateful for the Commission's efforts with Canada, but I must likewise say that I regret that the Commission is not complying with Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 which, in Article 1 (4) (f), clearly states that, if within 24 months after the date of publication of the notification, the third country concerned has not abolished the visa obligation, the Commission shall adopt a delegated act amending Annex II and suspending the visa exemption for nationals of the third country concerned — the United States — for a period of 12 months. Its room for manoeuvre is void and confirmed by the Court of Justice of the Union in its judgment of 16 July 2015. It is never said there that the Commission will present a communication or two, or that we will ask an oral question in plenary. What the Commission is doing with this attitude is simply in failure to comply with the Regulation. We are then facing a clear interinstitutional problem, and the Commission must act as the real guarantor of the Treaties. In view of this situation, I call for the Regulation to be respected and that the delegated act be presented. It will then be us, the co-legislators, who will debate the adequacy and the political, economic and other consequences. What needs to be done is to launch the delegated act because it is more important that the visa be removed from Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Croatia.

Commissioner Avramopoulos, I am speaking to reinforce the alarm, which was clearly expressed on behalf of the entire Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs by its chairman, our colleague Claude Moraes. And also to underline the arguments of Popular Party spokesman Agustín Díaz de Mera. This is not just a matter of substance, which is the lack of reciprocity — inadmissible on a matter such as visas — on the part of the United States. After the successful completion of the procedure with Brunei, Canada and Japan, it has not been successfully completed with the United States, which continue to deny the common visa policy that corresponds to the European Union as a whole at least five countries: Romania, Poland, Bulgaria, Croatia and Cyprus. That is the bottom issue, a lack of reciprocity that has no view of improving with the new Trump administration in the White House. Quite the opposite. We have to say it clearly. The question is therefore to bear in mind that substantive scenario, but also to require that the Commission comply with the procedure laid down in the Basic Visa Regulation, which is the issuance of a delegated act deducting the consequences of this absence of reciprocity in the relationship with the United States, in accordance with various judgments of the Court of Justice. Because — it is not forgotten — the soul of this European Parliament is not just an oral question before the Commission. It is also the Commission's absence of reply to the Court of Justice. And that lack of response has to be satisfied as soon as possible. A delegated act which will deduce the political and legal consequences of this situation, which is politically intolerable, but which legally and legally binds and competes the Commission and Commissioner Avramopoulos. It is therefore not only about honoring that demand — which has often been stressed by the vast majority of this House — that Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and Cyprus, in addition to Poland, should be treated exactly the same as the rest of the European Union countries, but that the Commission should talk about you to the United States about you.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 2952, "date": "2016-12-14.json", "name": "Филиз Хюсменова", "mepid": "34249", "text": "on behalf of the ALDE Group. — Mr President, Commissioner, the lack of visa reciprocity with the United States of America affects millions of European citizens in Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, Cyprus and Poland.

Until now, it has repeatedly been pointed out by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs that the European Commission is obliged to take action to address the lack of visa reciprocity, by a delegated act temporarily suspending visa-free regime for US citizens. I take into account the diplomatic sensitivity and the need to find the right time and means to achieve maximum results in relations with the US, but I believe that it is high time for the Commission to take a decisive stance and show that the different treatment of European citizens is inadmissible. This is the opinion shared by the majority of my colleagues on the LIBE committee of the European Parliament. I use the moment again in this debate to point out that the inaction of the European Commission creates the feeling of a double standard, of a two-speed Europe and for different classes of Europeans.

The concrete results with the negotiated phase-out of visas for Bulgarians and Romanians are proof that only with coordinated action between the Commission and the Member States — but here it is time to take into account the European Parliament as well — we can make progress. That is why I am also paying attention to the second aspect, so that we continue to speak with one voice on the international stage.

At least 25 people were killed and many more injured in the bombing. Our thoughts are with the victims and their families. The European Union expresses condolences to them as well as to all the people and the Government of Egypt.  An attack against Egypt’s Coptic community is an attack against all Egyptians and against their wish to live peacefully together. I visited Egypt recently because it is a key partner in the region for the European Union on many issues and we had a very fruitful discussion on all issues. I also met President el-Sisi and we also discussed security issues. They were aware that the situation is very difficult and attacks might occur at any moment.  These attacks endanger a multicultural society, which Egypt is and wishes to continue being. President el-Sisi is equally concerned about the destabilisation of his country as a result of the permanent terrorist threat. I assured him that we are partners against this common threat and Egypt has all our support.  Freedom of religion implies not only the freedom of belief, but also the freedom to worship, either individually or in a community, without fear or intimidation, discrimination, violence or attack. All people should be able to exercise their rights everywhere, based on the principles of equality, non—discrimination and universality. All states have an obligation to prevent violence based on religion or belief but, beyond this obligation, the prevention of this form of violence is also in the interest of every state because sectarian attacks make a society weaker, less cohesive and less resilient.  In the Middle East and North Africa in particular, an attack against any ethnic or religious group undermines the very fabric of society. Christianity belongs in the Middle East and in North Africa just as much as it belongs in Europe. Egypt’s Christian community is as ancient as Christianity itself. Obviously terrorist groups and individuals are afraid of the Middle East’s long history of diversity because it defies their weak narrative of a clash of civilizations. The Egyptian authorities must now work to ensure that the perpetrators of this attack are promptly brought to justice and that there will be no impunity for sectarian attacks. Overall, the number of terrorist attacks in Egypt has grown in recent weeks. Just two days before the attack on the church, there were two terrorist bombings in different parts of the country, killing security personnel. We stand on the side of the Egyptian people in the fight against terrorism. It is a shared challenge which we must tackle together. Terrorism, of course, needs to be addressed as a security issue. At the same time, measures to reinforce physical security will only be effective if police and judicial prevention and prosecution of terrorist acts is organised in a modern and effective manner. Countering radicalisation and violent extremism is also of fundamental importance.  We believe that a comprehensive approach is needed, including dialogue, education, the promotion of tolerance and pluralism, and adequate space for civil society. We are close to completing negotiations with Egypt on the priorities for our bilateral partnership and this terrible incident shows how essential it is becoming for us to work together with Egypt in this area, as in many others.  The importance the European Union attaches to freedom of religion and belief has also been reflected in the appointment by President Juncker of Mr Ján Figeľ as a Special Envoy for the promotion of freedom of religion or belief outside the European Union. The EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Mr Lambrinidis, has also been actively engaged in the promotion of freedom of religion and belief during official visits to partner countries and in multilateral fora. Our work to preserve religious diversity all around the world also has a financial dimension. For instance, the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights invests EUR 11 million in programmes focusing directly on freedom of religion and belief. Cooperation with our partners, both in governance and civil society will remain essential to all our efforts. From Egypt to Syria, the protection of diversity is – and will be -– a top priority in the years ahead. If there is one international actor that will always protect and defend the freedom of religion, it is us, the European Union. Let me therefore conclude by sending a strong message of support to Egypt. We are all standing by Egypt, united against the common threat of terrorism.

The attack on Saint Mark’s Cathedral is a stark reminder of the protection that this vulnerable community needs and the security threats that Egypt faces more generally on a daily basis.  Claimed today by ISIS, this atrocity is an early warning sign of the trend that we will see over the coming year as ISIS shifts its focus to North Africa and the Sahel, and Mosul and Raqqa are squeezed, and as their strongholds in Syria are weakened they will go to other places including, I am afraid, Europe.

For a long time there were no such serious episodes against places of Christian worship and the government proclaimed three days of national mourning. Some commentators speculate that this recrudescence is an attempt by groups linked to Islamic radicalism and Isis (mainly present in the Sinai area) to increase tension between Copts and President Al-Sisi. In fact, the Coptic community, which in 2013 had supported the current president against Mohamed Morsi, supported instead by the Muslim Brotherhood, strongly calls for greater commitment to the protection of its places of life and meeting. The international community and the EU have a duty to demonstrate with facts clear support for this community, the ancient guardian of Christianity of its origins, as well as the contrast to any attempt to further destabilization of the country, which today also experiences a difficult economic situation with the devaluation of the Egyptian pound and the scarcity of supplies of basic necessities.

As rapporteur on this issue, I would like to recall that we have given our agreement to this text, with a little bitterness, after tough discussions with the Council, because, in our view, this regulation is too unambitious. But we considered that it was a step, a small step, of course, but still a step towards more Europe, because the acceptance by one Member State of a civil status document from another Member State brings a little more comfort to citizens moving within the European Union. I have regretted, and I still regret, the reluctance of the Member States which have not shown enthusiasm to reduce bureaucracy and to bring a small concrete solution towards more Union and more Europe. I would like to see some progress, though modest, and I believe that the reaction to the malwell-being of the European peoples cannot be a retreat on oneself. On the contrary, I believe that we must fight for a European Union that serves the citizens. I dare believe that the Commission can and wants to help move forward in this direction. At the time, when the Commission presented its proposal for a regulation on the acceptance of public documents, a second proposal was envisaged, which would provide for the recognition of the content of civil registration documents. This recognition should also concern registered partnerships. I would like to emphasize this, because I think this element is quite important, since it promotes equal treatment for all citizens, irrespective of their personality, marital status and choice of life. During the hearing that preceded his appointment as Commissioner, Mrs Jourová told us that she intended to propose such a regulation and that preparatory work had already begun within the Commission services, with the launch of a study to examine all the relevant issues. So my question is, when will the findings of the study or impact assessment be available? Does the Commission still intend to present a proposal on the recognition of the content of public documents, civil status documents? When can Parliament expect this presentation? Does the Commission still intend to include registered partnerships within the scope of the proposal? If not, why would she have changed her mind?", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 2990, "date": "2016-12-14.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament for having raised the question of the important issue of the recognition, between Member States, of the civil status of EU citizens. People in the Union are increasingly mobile, and now more than ever, they live or raise a family in another Member State. 14 million citizens reside in a Member State other than their own, and 13% of all marriages in the Union are international. In order to facilitate the free movement of citizens, the Union has already adopted a number of legislative instruments. Several of these instruments are in the area of family law, and they enable citizens to have a judgment that is easily recognised in another Member State on such varied matters such as divorce, legal separation, child custody, children’s visiting rights, parental child abduction, maintenance obligations and succession.  Earlier this year, Parliament played a key role in making possible the swift adoption of provisions on the property regimes of marriages and registered partnerships, which will also facilitate recognition in another Member State of judgments on these matters. Parliament was also instrumental in reaching, last summer, a balanced compromise with the Council on a regulation to simplify the circulation of certain public documents within the Union. Under the Regulation, public documents on civil status issued in one Member State will be free of postal requirements when presented to authorities in another Member State, and the rules governing certified copies and translations of such public documents will be simpler and avoid language barriers. The Commission is aware that, despite existing instruments, citizens may encounter difficulties in having their civil status recognised when they travel or move to another Member State. Where recognition of civil status is governed by Member State law, the Union must ensure that citizens can enjoy their right to move freely within the Union. In this respect, the Court plays a very important role. With regard to a person’s name, the Court has already ruled that non-discrimination on grounds of nationality and proportionality must guide Member States in their decisions on whether or not to recognise a person’s name. As a result of the Court’s ruling, the Member States concerned have adopted their legislation or administrative practices on the recognition of names.  As for same-sex unions, an important development in the Court’s case law is expected. The Romanian Constitutional Court announced in November that it will seek clarification on whether a same-sex couple, a Romanian and a United States citizen married in Belgium, can be recognised as spouses under Romanian law, pursuant to the Union provisions on family reunification. The Commission, like the Court, must ensure that Member States apply correctly the Union provisions that facilitate the free movement of citizens.  In parallel to ensuring the correct application of existing law, the Commission has started a reflection process on how to address issues such as the expansion of the scope beyond what is currently covered by the Public Documents Regulation and on the recognition of civil status between Member States. In this reflection process, the Commission must consider the relevant case law developments in Member States’ frameworks and coherence with European Union policies. The Commission is also ready to continue the exchange with Parliament and engage in a dialogue with Member States and other relevant actors.  The Commission contracted in 2012 a study on the recognition of civil status in the Union. Since then, substantial legal developments have taken place in Member States regarding same-sex marriage and registered partnerships. Any eventual legislative action would need to be based on updated data and the Commission will look into ensuring the availability of the evidence base needed for eventual decisions. The Commission will keep Parliament and Member States informed on its reflection process and views gathered during it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 2991, "date": "2016-12-14.json", "name": "Емил Радев", "mepid": "124850", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. — Mr President, a few months ago we managed to make progress with the Member States on the adoption of the Regulation on the abolition of the apostille when presenting some official documents in the European Union. However, here we are discussing a completely different issue. In fact, different countries do not have the same vision of family law, especially in terms of marriage, adoption, registered partnerships. Family law represents relationships, not just facts. Their creation and existence is based on legal necessity, specific legal rules and arrangements. This means that the family relationship which exists under the legislation of one Member State may not exist within the law of another State. Recognition of the content of civil status documents would lead to a change in the substantive family law of the Member States. According to the Treaties, the EU does not have the competence to change the substantive law relating to civil status, especially as regards registered partnership or marriage. This falls within the competence of the Member States. If the European Commission incorporates registered partnerships in such a legislative text, this would be contrary to the treaties and would result in a kind of imposition of legislation that is not wanted by many Member States.

Article 67, the first paragraph of the Treaty, in the functioning of the EU, states that “the Union represents an area of respect for fundamental rights and different legal systems and traditions of Member States”. Automatic recognition of civil status at the level of the European Union would certainly entail the impermissible imposition of legal solutions in the domain of family law, over which the EU has no jurisdiction. Two-thirds of Croatian citizens who went to the referendum in 2013 advocated the constitutional definition of marriage as a community of man and woman.

I have met a few times people whose lives have been irreversibly damaged by Thalidomide and I know very well the extremely difficult day-to-day situations they are in and the problems they struggle with. It was actually this terrible tragedy which led to the creation of our European system for the safety of medicines.  Please let us inform the younger generation of the consequences Thalidomide had for survivors and their families, and let us collectively recognise that they need support more than ever before. They are rightly fighting for appropriate support and asking policymakers to help. They need more permanent national assistance and cooperation between Member States where patients suffered from this tragedy, and consideration from industry, which must be involved in the process.  Many Members of the European Parliament have written to me calling for support. We met and we also had the opportunity to discuss this issue in plenary already. Let me stress once again that I fully share your concern. I am keen to help within the limited competences of the Commission, taking into account the Member States separately and in cooperation with each other, to decide on how to support Thalidomide survivors and put a more patient-centred approach into practice in this case. Injury compensation schemes are currently not a matter of European Union competence and therefore the Commission is not in a position to take concrete legal action.  What the Commission can do is lend political support, and this is precisely what we have been doing. I have spoken with all the health ministers of the Member States involved and I am ready to do that once again. I have asked them to seriously consider additional support and I am willing to continue raising this issue. The key for finding a way forward lies with Member States, in particular the Member States concerned.  It is difficult to accept that the manufacturers and distributors of Thalidomide have shouldered only part of the cost of this tragedy and that society has to step in. It is also the obligation of the Member States and industry, through a more patient-centred approach, to restore trust and help people who have suffered from Thalidomide. We should not forget them, but rather remember the tragedy every year.

In 1954, the pharmacist Grünenthal created and put on sale this medicine as a compound for pregnant women. During the 1950s and 60s ten thousand children were born with congenital physical malformations caused by thalidomide. In early 1962, the drug was withdrawn in Germany, United Kingdom and Italy. However, in Spain it continued to sell for three more years and continued to appear in the Vademecum until 1975, causing more pain. Just a few months ago, this House was wondering why. Why, for fifty years, did governments around the world close their eyes to this tragedy? Why, fifty years later, are we still waiting for the company that put the drug on sale for forgiveness? Why, fifty years later, are we still not finding a solution? I, today, think we should ask ourselves until when. How long are we going to continue to regret our lack of compassion, without solving problems? How long are we going to allow victims to exist in Spain without official recognition and without enough help to live with dignity? Thalidomide victims have grown older crying.

This is a problem that cuts across different countries.

My point to German politicians is: if you change places with a  Thalidomide victim for 12 hours, you would change your tune. You know what to do – just to do it.

The Commission welcomes this debate. It confirms the shared interest of both our institutions to secure the best outcome for children. This debate comes at a timely moment; indeed the Commission is preparing a second report to the Council and Parliament on the Paediatric Medicines Regulation.  As honourable Members will know, the Regulation aims to ensure that we can provide children with quality medicines. This legislative stimulus was deemed necessary because pharmaceutical companies tend to focus mainly on adults. The Regulation succeeded in putting the spotlight on developing paediatric therapies. It was a game—changer; companies can no longer ignore paediatric development. It put an end to the dogma that children should be protected from clinical research. Instead, children merit the same evidence—based therapies as other age groups. It increased paediatric discharge also in the most vulnerable population of neonates. We now see an increasing number of new products for children entering the market. Indeed, more than 900 paediatric development programmes have been agreed under the Regulation, and more than 100 have been completed in recent years.  But there are also, of course, limitations to what the Regulation can achieve. As there is an obligation for it not to regard the development of adult medicines, the additional paediatric research may not address pressing paediatric needs, especially in diseases that occur only in children, such as many paediatric cancers. We are looking closely as this issue in the context of drawing up the second report. At the same time, we are analysing economic impacts with a particular focus on the rewards and incentives. Last month, the Commission launched a public consultation which will run until February 2017. This exercise is important as it gives everybody an opportunity for their voice to be heard before finalisation of the report. The Commission cannot therefore draw conclusions at this stage. We first needed to compare for you the data and gather experiences.  The Commission is committed to presenting, in the course of 2017, a detailed report on the Paediatric Regulation.

His mother wanted to continue fighting, through the association “Imagine for Margaux”. This is his fight, which I want to echo today. Like her, thousands of parents in Europe lose their children with serious illnesses every year due to lack of effective treatment. How can we continue to accept that children die from diseases that are known to be treated in adults? Despite the progress made by the 2006 Paediatric Regulations, for example, by requiring industry to conduct paediatric investigation plans, paediatric research remains too rare. Whereas the Commission is soon to proceed — as you said, Commissioner — to assess the current regulation, it is essential to make substantial improvements. Research is not yet sufficiently encouraged and too many exemptions are being granted to allow laboratories not to conduct or complete paediatric investigation plans. The first urgency is to use the flexibilities of the current legislation to base the obligation to conduct paediatric investigation plans on the mechanism of action of the molecule and to make them more realistic and feasible. The second urgency is to build a truly incentive system which, on the one hand, punishes those who do not play the game and, on the other hand, encourages laboratories to develop only paediatric indications and not necessarily modeled on adult products. A real reflection must be carried out in this regard. “Go ahead, fight and win”: these words, which we found in Margaux's notebooks, we are now the custodians of them.

We do not deny that this regulation has contributed to improving the overall situation and strengthening cooperation in the development of these medicinal products but, after ten years, a review is required critical of this text to eliminate the gaps so far found. Children, in fact, are the most vulnerable group of the population and there are substantial differences compared to adults on both physiological and psychological levels.

As already happens for antibiotic resistance, so it will happen and already happens for pediatric drugs. I also want to point out that in pediatric oncology scientific knowledge of cellular processes used to test drugs for adults has potential relevance also for the treatment of tumors Pediatric, but these drugs must be the subject of specific clinical trials for pediatric use. In addition, many of the cancers that affect young people are rare cancers and this is another factor why pharmaceutical industries have little interest in developing medicines in this area.

One of these is the need for companies to comply with paediatric research plans in order to respond to this differentiation of diseases between adults and children. But more emphasis should also be placed on research into diseases that specifically affect children, especially in the field of oncology, where especially progress has been made. 80% of pediatric patients survive cancer today, but there is still a significant lack of knowledge about many of the diseases that affect them specifically.

There is also a need for greater public funding, as well as a European network for research into the whole of these diseases.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 3033, "date": "2016-12-14.json", "name": "John Stuart Agnew (EFDD).", "mepid": "96897", "text": "   – Mr President, I am delivering this speech on behalf of my colleague, Dr Julia Reed. The Paediatric Regulation was adopted 10 years ago to ensure high-quality research into the development of medicines for children and appropriate authorisation of paediatric medicines. However, in 2013 several inadequacies were identified by the Progress Report adopted by the European Commission, especially with regard to paediatric oncology and neonatology. I appreciate that this motion for a resolution investigates this issue and that the development of a policy supporting paediatricians in improving children’s services is of major importance. I also agree with colleagues that children make up the most vulnerable part of the population and that research in the field of paediatric medicine should be given the same parity as adult health research.  We in UKIP are extremely concerned about the well-being and health of children. However, I firmly believe that this should and would be better done at national level. National parliaments should be the only entities entitled to legislate on this fundamental issue. Every Member State should shape policy and practices in order to provide high quality and sustainable healthcare services for all children in their own country.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3034, "date": "2016-12-14.json", "name": "Michaela Šojdrová (PPE).", "mepid": "124710", "text": " — Commissioner, the development, manufacture and use of medicinal products in general are a very professional sphere and also very sensitive, especially in relation to children's patients. The purpose of the 2006 Regulation is to promote the development of medicines for the children's population and to obtain new validated information on the properties of medicines intended for children and to obtain information on the use of of these drugs. The 2013 report on the implementation of this Regulation noted certain shortcomings and committed the Commission to adopt new measures. It turns out that so far the procedure is not fast enough. There is still a lack of information on the development of medicines, and also the development of these new medicines is not supported enough. I think the Commissioner has heard it repeatedly here. As my colleague, doctor Miroslav Mikulášik says, the child is not a diminished adult, therefore children need specific medicines adapted to their development and specific diseases. Commissioner, thank you for your response. But you hear from us repeatedly that we are not satisfied with the speed of the Commission's progress in this area. We ask you for greater deployment and support of research on pediatric medicines.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 3035, "date": "2016-12-14.json", "name": "Claude Rolin (PPE).", "mepid": "125107", "text": " — Mr President, the ambition of the regulation has been a real step forward, but without wanting to trivialise the progress that has been made, it must still be recognised that many, too many obstacles still persist. It is absolutely necessary to facilitate the accessibility of medicines to children, while at the same time providing adequate safeguards for safety verification. In some Member States, including my own, the reimbursement of a medicinal product for children is conditional on the statement in the package leaflet that it has been studied in the age groups concerned. It is therefore essential to encourage firms to study in children for the relevant molecules and indications. I insist that these should be relevant studies, as this should not lead to a blocking of the arrival of generic drugs, which also make it possible to alleviate budgets. Finally, pharmaceutical companies must, in a systematic manner, develop paediatric investigation plans. This is an essential condition for accelerating the development of treatments for children. We cannot despise this fundamental issue.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 3036, "date": "2016-12-14.json", "name": "Νότης Μαριάς (", "mepid": "125069", "text": "ECR). — Mr President, there is a European indifference to paediatric medicines and paediatric research programmes, and there is an almost systematic postponement of paediatric studies. The European Union must ensure that medicines used to treat children meet the highest standards and undergo high-quality ethical research. In addition, the Union must ensure that all children have access to the necessary medication and vaccines they need. In Greece the deficiencies in paediatric medicines and vaccines are serious. The situation can have unforeseen consequences, as the shortages of children's vaccines, such as hepatitis B, in areas where there is a large number of refugees are particularly high. Especially in Lesvos there is a huge shortage, with pharmacists filing a complaint against the pharmaceutical company responsible for the distribution of medicines in Greece. So this is a serious issue and we must take steps to avoid risks to public health for citizens, especially children.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 3037, "date": "2016-12-14.json", "name": "Nicola Caputo (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124851", "text": " Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the regulation on paediatric medicines has helped to improve the overall situation by bringing tangible benefits for a number of childhood diseases, but many sectors reported no significant progress, particularly pediatric oncology and neonatology. Often, the legal requirement to pursue the development of medicines for pediatric use is not observed, as the drugs were developed under pathological conditions typical for adults, which do not Occurrence in children. There are therefore delays in starting clinical trials of cancer drugs for children because the drug is expected to show promise in adult cancer patients. We need a legislative review of this regulation which takes due consideration first of all the need to base paediatric development plans on a mechanism of action, not just the type of tumor, and secondly to ensure greater timeliness and achievability of pediatric survey plans. Lastly, special attention should be given to the system of incentives envisaged to stimulate research more effectively and respond more effectively to the needs of the pediatric population, ensuring that at the same time the transparency of the research and development process.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws"}, {"id": 3038, "date": "2016-12-14.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, Mr La Via, I thank you because today we  have a good opportunity once again to discuss these very sensitive and very important issues. The health of our children is of vital importance. When they fall sick, we should aim to provide them with high-quality medicines. As you rightly said, Mr Mikolášik, children are without doubt not just small adults; they have their own specific needs. I appreciate Parliament’s initiative to raise this issue during the plenary session tonight. I have taken careful note of your comments and views, and I also think about Margot, whom you mentioned, Ms Grossetête. I also appreciate the Parliament’s comments to young people suffering from, for example, narcolepsy. Last Monday I met Members of the European Parliament, Mairead McGuinness and Jørn Dohrmann, together with patient representatives, to discuss this issue. Let me take this opportunity to express once again my sympathy towards all the patients and their families affected by this terrible condition. Remember, colleagues, we are in good time. Last year, in March, we launched European Reference Networks, and more than 300 hospitals voluntarily decided to create such a network. I disagree with those who argue that paediatric oncology is the competence of Member States. Can you imagine the possibility of treating rare diseases and rare paediatric cancers in the smallest countries where they do have enough medical expertise, clinical trials and possibilities to join with researchers? What can they do in Cyprus or in Lithuania, and so on? We need to understand that it is not possible to solve those questions at Member State level alone. No, we will push our resources, our clinical expertise and, of course, possibilities to properly manage the treatment of rare paediatric cancers, rare paediatric diseases and rare genetic diseases. There is no doubt. As Mr Mikolášik said, we must be very practical. I agree: we will do it this way. As you know, the Commission takes this issue very seriously and has taken a series of actions to ensure these possibilities and to do our best. Let me repeat: the Commission aims to provide this House and the Council in 2017 with a comprehensive report on the Paediatric Regulation which will serve as a solid basis for future discussions. Thank you once again for your interest.

However, to watch a child go through this pain is intolerable. 35 000 Children and young people are every year diagnosed with cancer in Europe. Every year in the European Union we lose 6 000 bright, young souls to this scourge. As Socialists and Democrats we are committed to continue working hard to help improve the quality of life of children with cancer and childhood cancer survivors.  This is why we firmly believe that it is extremely important for children with cancer to have access to new innovative therapies and drugs that can save their lives. The reality is that today there are limited innovative treatments because of the low profit margins in this area of research.  We call on the Commission to ensure there are enough funding provisions that support high-quality paediatric clinical research and on the Member States to concretely support research, development and the availability of medicinal products for paediatric use. This is our children’s lives that we are dealing with and we need to ensure that we do our utmost to provide them with the best possible therapies and medicines.
