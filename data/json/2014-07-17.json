Only two months ago Meriam Ibrahim, being eight months pregnant, was sentenced by a Sudanese court to 100 lashes for so-called adultery, that is for having married a Christian husband, and apostasy, that is for refusing to convert to Islam.

Internal conflicts with their share of refugees and displaced people have even increased in recent months. In the north, the sinister Bashir took the opportunity, more than ever, to accentuate the repression and violations of human rights. Yes, Meriam is, indeed, an exemplary case. Today, this region of the world remains one of the main playgrounds of the great world powers. It is linked to the oil manna and other sub-soil wealth, so much so that Sudan is the fourth land of foreign investment in sub-Saharan Africa. But it is also linked to the geostrategic situation of this country. So yes, Western countries have responsibilities. Last January, Bashir announced a national dialogue, but in terms of national dialogue, it is all-out repression that is rife. Worse, NGOs no longer have access to the territory. The humanitarian situation is dramatic. We passed a resolution in October 2013 as an unprecedented wave of protests took place across the country after the removal of fuel subsidies that led to massive tax hikes. Bashir did there, for once, only listen to the international community, the IMF to be more precise. The said international community is therefore more efficient in economic matters than in human rights. The opposition parties under the leadership of the revolutionary front in Sudan have been working on a peace plan for several months. They are now largely assembled, armed opposition or not, official or not. They understood that their disunity played the game of their tyrant.

What is happening is denying ordinary Egyptians the opportunity to earn a decent living. When the Arab Spring reached Egypt, it reached the centre of the Arab world. The calls for freedom of expression, in peaceful demonstrations in Tahrir Square, augured well for democracy. A military dictatorship has remorselessly crushed those hopes. In the process, it killed almost 72 people in a single day and it has placed thousands in detention. The role of the army is to defend the nation, not to kill their fellow citizens. Just recently, 46 sentences of life imprisonment and 10 death sentences were handed down, and several more court cases are pending. One hundred and one supporters of a previous, democratically elected government were each sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. It is of the utmost importance to respect the will of the people. I know that this Parliament does not always support democracy. I cite, for example, the Danish referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, which was ignored, and the French and Dutch rejections of the EU constitution, which were swept aside as the EU flagship project was pushed through.

The presidential elections in Egypt at the end of May marked an important step in Egypt’s constitutional road map, which will be completed with the upcoming parliamentary elections likely to be held this autumn.  The EU observed the presidential elections. The team led by Mr Mrio David, concluded in the preliminary statement that the elections were technically administered in line with international standards. However, let me remind Members that the report criticised the overall political environment and found a lack of respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights due to political polarisation. It expressed concerned at the clamp-down by the authority on the Muslim Brotherhood and on political opposition. The deteriorating human rights situation, including restrictions on the freedom of expression and of assembly is of great concern to us, and we call on the Egyptian authorities to ensure universal participation in the upcoming parliamentary elections. If not addressed, this issue will cast yet another shadow on Egypt’s transition towards democracy. Recent judicial proceedings against many civil society activists, media and supporters of the political opposition have been marked by a lack of respect for due process and by disproportionate sentences, notably on the occasion of the recent mass trials passing death sentences. We have denounced this and have called for the review of these sentences. Moreover, we are concerned to see that the death penalty was implemented on 16 and 19 June. It should be recalled that the EU is opposed to capital punishment in all cases, and calls for its abolition. We are gravely concerned at the sentences pronounced against the Al Jazeera journalists, including EU citizens, as was recalled by Mr Kelly, as well as those pronounced in absentia against other European journalists, and at the heavy jail sentences against prominent activists. We are closely following these cases through our delegation in Egypt. We call on the Egyptian authorities to allow media and civil society activists to operate freely. In this respect, I would like to refer to the EU guidelines on freedom of expression adopted last May in which we clearly state that ‘all governments must allow journalists to work in a free and enabling environment in safety and security, without the fear of censorship or restraint’. Finally, we worry about the continued detention of human rights activists arrested as they were demonstrating against the protest law. We have repeatedly called on the Egyptian authorities to allow peaceful protests. The protest law will need to be amended. We are fully aware of the volatile security situation and have condemned terrorist attacks, but fighting terrorism should not result in measures which de facto violate civil liberties and freedoms. Let me conclude by saying that we are monitoring newly-adopted legislation, such as the protest law, and draft legislation, such as the NGO law and counter-terrorism law, with regard to their compliance with human rights. In this respect, the last draft of the NGO law is very worrying as it discriminates against European NGOs. The EU stands ready to offer assistance to Egypt to bring its legislation in line with its international human rights obligations. Egypt, as we all know, is a key neighbour and partner in the region. We shall therefore remain constructively and critically engaged to address all restrictions on human rights, freedom of assembly and freedom of speech.

Boko Haram is part of an axis of terrorism that spreads across the Sahel, beginning with Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM)and including Al-Shabaab in Somalia, and stretches across the Middle East, where we see leading groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), as far as Afghanistan and Pakistan, with the Taliban.

I would like to draw attention to the fact that a very important concern for women's and girls' rights is that their sexual and reproductive health rights are being trampled on all over the world. And I hope that the European Union will continue to work internationally for these rights, so that every girl and woman has the opportunity to control her own body, decide on her own life, and not submit to the commodity, sexual slavery of such groups and lose every opportunity to live in dignity.

They brought him out, and asked him to renounce his faith or be shot. When he refused he was shot in the face. When they left he asked his wife to go to the other Christian men in the village to get help to take him to hospital. She came back to tell him that he was the only one who had survived.

The High Representative, Cathy Ashton, has strongly condemned the indiscriminate killing of hundreds of civilians and the abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls in Borno state. We continue to call for the immediate and unconditional release of the schoolgirls and for those responsible to be brought to justice. Our thoughts are also with the families of the girls, who are desperate to see their children return home safely. The violence in Nigeria has taken a heavy toll on the population. Since 2009 the insurgencies has cost nearly 5 000 lives, displaced close to half a million people, destroyed hundreds of schools and government buildings and devastated an already-weak economy in the north-east. Most worryingly, since the beginning of this year attacks have occurred on an almost daily basis and since January alone between 1 500 and 2 000 innocent people have been killed. The EU listed Boko Haram as a terrorist organisation last month, one day after their designation by the UN, demonstrating the EU’s firm and determined condemnation of the group’s unacceptable criminal activities which touch upon both Christians and Muslims.  The root causes of violence and radicalisation will continue to be addressed through the European Development Fund. The new fund will focus its activities in particular in the north of the country, supporting the health and energy sectors. The EU is also present in Nigeria with humanitarian assistance under ECHO providing EUR 5 million to the north-eastern states, particularly in response to the on-going food and nutrition crisis. On the political tack, human rights remain at the top of our agenda with Nigeria, including in our regular ministerial dialogues. Possible human rights abuses perpetrated by the Nigeria military have to be investigated and those responsible brought to justice.
