For the next six months, I’ll be representing the rotating Council Presidency, at the side of our Minister for Foreign Affairs, in this noble assembly. It’s a pleasure and an honour to be here. I want to say that we attach high importance to the relations with the European Parliament and we look forward to keeping a good cooperation during the six months of our Presidency. I think that this debate on the global strategy of COVID—19 vaccinations comes at a very relevant moment. In the Council we’ve been working actively on this issue, notably at the informal video conference of Ministers of Health that took place on 13 January. Yesterday, we also had an informal meeting of Ministers for European Affairs, where the issue was discussed, and I chaired that meeting. On 21 January, the members of the European Council will also discuss this matter at another video conference, following the presentation of a communication by the Commission that is expected today. So the debate comes at a really critical moment. The epidemiological situation in Europe remains very worrying. The impact of more social contacts during the holiday period, combined with the emergence of new, highly contagious variants of the virus, means that things are probably going to get worse before they get better.  Many Member States have decided to maintain, or even reinforce drastically, the restrictive measures that they have in place as their health care systems increasingly come under strain. And this, as you all know, comes at a moment when we all feel pandemic fatigue, when we all know the terrible consequences and social consequences of new lockdowns, and when we know that we need to preserve our internal market and Schengen. In this difficult situation the start of the vaccination campaign across Europe gives a glimmer of hope to save lives, a lifeline to recovery. We managed the development and authorisation of the first vaccines in less than one year. This represents an enormous success for the scientific community and for all the stakeholders that participated in this endeavour.  This also represents an enormous success for the European Union, which was at the forefront of a global mobilisation. Through a common European approach, we have accelerated the development of many of the most promising vaccines, through a common European approach we have secured access to vaccines for each and every European, and through a common European approach, drawing on the shared scientific expertise at our disposal, we have been able to authorise vaccines that are safe and effective. The EU strategy on vaccination has been a demonstration of unity and of solidarity. Now we need to go on. We need to continue this concrete expression of European added value. We need more vaccines and we need to ensure the efficient rollout of vaccination in all of our Member States because now people want to be vaccinated and, at the moment, we know that the demand for vaccines outstrips supply. While continuing our efforts to limit the spread of the virus, we now need to focus, in the coming weeks and months, on ensuring that as many citizens as possible have access to the vaccine and that the vaccination campaign progresses rapidly and effectively.  Despite the difficulties, there are still reasons to be optimistic. First the portfolio of authorised vaccines has been expanded, both in terms of the number of vaccines and the number of doses. Second, the production capacities of the authorised vaccines are being progressively scaled up in Europe. Last, but not least, additional vaccines are in the pipeline to obtain an authorisation in the days and weeks to come.  Yet getting the vaccine to the whole population remains a great challenge. This is where clear communication can play a decisive role. We must be able to explain to our citizens the main bottlenecks that we are facing. Equally, we have to be transparent on the number of doses that we receive and the number of doses that are effectively administered in our countries. We need to have comparable data. We must also combat the lack of trust in vaccines and convince people of their merits and importance. We need to work together to convey clear and effective messages on this aspect. Transparency and trust need to go hand in hand.  At the same time, we continue to monitor the vaccination campaign in close collaboration with all the EU bodies. We also need to discuss the format and role of the vaccination certificate and, finally, we need to discuss a common approach on the use and validation of antigen rapid tests and the mutual recognition of COVID—19 test results. The analysis of these tests will also provide fundamental input on understanding the genetic sequencing of the new virus variant. A last word on international cooperation. We know that we will not be safe while our neighbours are sick, so international cooperation is needed and the EU also has a huge responsibility here towards the most vulnerable in our eastern and southern neighbourhoods. Saving lives is saving the future and we can only do this together: Member States, stakeholders, civil society, Council, Commission, Parliament. We need to be together. This is what our citizens expect. It’s a huge responsibility and we need to deliver as best we can together.

Since the spring of last year we have lost more than 400 000 lives in the EU. With new, more transmissible variants of the virus emerging and detecting in Member States, we are still far from overcoming this pandemic. But we have also turned a page and we begin 2021 with a powerful tool at hand to progressively put an end to this pandemic. There is light at the end of the horizon.  Every day across the EU priority groups are being vaccinated with safe, effective vaccines from BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna. More approved vaccines will come, I hope, in the coming weeks, with the European Medicines Agency recently receiving an application for the AstraZeneca vaccine and expects to receive more applications in the coming months.  My gratitude goes out to the scientists who have delivered breakthroughs in record times and the countless healthcare workers that passed through the most difficult 10 months any of us could have imagined. They are now also playing a vital role in the vaccination rollout.  However, COVID-19 has always been bigger than the EU. It is a global pandemic and it requires global solutions to ensure that no one is left behind. No country will be safe and no economy will truly recover until the virus is under control in all continents. The recently emerged variants of the virus are proof of this. The European Union is ready to play its geopolitical role here in full alignment with its founding values. The simple principle was at the centre of our response from day one of this pandemic and it continues to guide our efforts today, nearly one year later. It is also at the very heart of the communication we will adopt later today, highlighting the measures necessary to keep the pandemic under control until safe and effective vaccines can be deployed towards population immunity. I’m very thankful to the Members of this House who have likewise constantly defended that we are all in this together when the EU has been unfairly criticised. Honourable Members, we want to ensure that every single person who needs a vaccine gets it anywhere in the world. We believe deeply that fair access can be insured through multilateralism and that is why we were among the architects of COVAX at the very early stages of this pandemic, with exactly this goal in mind. COVAX, the global facility to ensure fair and universal access to COVID-19 vaccines aims to purchase two billion doses by the end of 2021, including over 1.3 billion for low and middle-income countries.  The EU and its Member States, as Team Europe, have so far provided over EUR 850 million to COVAX, which makes the EU its biggest donor. We are aware that this is only the start and we need to mobilise additional support as we move forward. Also as part of the EU vaccine strategy we have invested in the manufacturing capacity so that vaccines are more rapidly available to everyone, everywhere. And we have called for the free flow of vaccines and materials without export restrictions, including through the trade and health initiative in the World Trade Organisation. We are also working with Member States to propose a European mechanism to share vaccines beyond our borders, especially before COVAX is fully operational.  Honourable Members, the EU’s greatest strength is its unified voice. By working together we have secured a diverse portfolio of vaccines and we can build on advanced technologies, collective bargaining and good contract conditions in terms of liability and delivery. But we also have a responsibility, a responsibility to use our position of strength to support others. Through the vaccine sharing mechanism, we will help priority groups in the Western Balkans and neighbourhood countries as well as health professionals in low-income countries, particularly in Africa, and most vulnerable populations in humanitarian settings, to get early access to vaccines.  We will provide grants for EUR 70 million to the Western Balkans so that they can buy vaccines from our Member States. We are working with the WHO to provide immediate support of more than 50 million for vaccination preparedness in the Western Balkans and neighbourhood countries. Each of these efforts contributes to the same goal: rapid, equal and universal access to safe and effective vaccines and they are based on the same one principle, that of global solidarity, because this is what holds the key to a healthier, more equal and a more sustainable world and this is what benefits each and every one of us.  Finally, let me assure you that I have been hearing your calls for transparency loud and clear and I fully appreciate and recognise that the democratically elected Parliament in the EU must be in the position to scrutinise our work under the appropriate conditions. As you know, we are bound by confidentiality clauses in the contracts, but I do welcome that the first of our vaccine suppliers has agreed to make our text available. I’m hopeful that this is not the end of the road and we will continue to work with all the vaccine suppliers to obtain their agreement and extend this access as quickly as possible. I now look forward to hearing your views and thank you once again.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2021-01-19.json", "name": "Esther de Lange", "mepid": "38398", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, when a 74—year—old inhabitant of a care home in Haarlem in the Netherlands was vaccinated yesterday, he was asked afterwards how he felt. ‘It feels like I now have a shield, like I finally will be shielded against this virus’, was his answer, and ‘I hope I will be able to go outside more and see my granddaughter again’.  Being a shield for those who need protection – is that not one of the key functions, one of the key tasks, of government, whether that government is national or local or European? When fighting an opponent like the coronavirus, it is clear that we need all levels of government to fight and work together, and this is why the EPP Group supports the work of the European Commissioner, of Commissioner Kyriakides, championing a European approach rather than one where Member States are out—competing each other like we often saw during previous cross—border health threats like the Mexican Flu.  Does that mean that the roll—out of the vaccination strategy is going perfectly? No, there are still many challenges in Member States and production needs to be scaled up. Does it mean that the pharmaceutical industry is an easy counterpart to negotiate with? Certainly not, and only more transparency can take away the widespread perception, whether this is justified or not, that too often profit is put before people in this industry.  But one thing is clear. Thanks to the Commission’s and the Member States’ joint approach, the joint purchase of vaccines, for example, we have had a stronger negotiating position than each individual Member State would have had on its own. That means more vaccines for a better price and under better conditions. It shows what Europe can do when we stand united. It can help save lives. Nearly a year ago, in February 2020, the EPP called for a common approach regarding incoming flights from China. At the time, some dismissed this as an overreaction. We now know better, and now that, thank God, more and more people are being vaccinated the EPP again calls for a common approach: a proof of a vaccine administered in Germany should be valid in Greece. The vaccination paper from Poland should be recognised in France. We therefore need a common European approach also in this phase of the pandemic, but not to take the place of the often very fundamental, very ethical debates that are taking place in Member States, such as is it fair to give somebody an advantage when he or she is vaccinated if not everyone has had the opportunity to be vaccinated yet?  I don’t want this to take the place of that very fundamental discussion, but we as the EPP do want to ensure that all levels of government keep working together, Madam President and Madam Commissioner, to provide this shield that many Europeans long for.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2021-01-19.json", "name": "Iratxe García Pérez", "mepid": "28298", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Madam President, the pandemic continues to hit severely and the third wave threatens social cohesion, as well as health. And, to protect both, the vaccine deploys as the most valuable instrument. We cannot allow health nationalism to threaten to crack the spirit of cooperation with which we set up the European vaccination strategy last June. In the face of the attitude of those Member States which would be trying to breach the mechanism for the centralised procurement of vaccines led by the European Commission, we must respond with solidarity and unity. Solidarity as a cornerstone on which we have been able to cement an unprecedented vaccination strategy. Thanks to the Commission's centralised scheme we have acquired up to 2.3 billion doses from different companies. And thanks to the european Medicines Agency's efficacy and safety standards, two drugs are being injected and a third will be able to see the light at the end of January. If we maintain unity and guarantee vaccines equally between Member States, the European Union could have immunized 380 million citizens in the summer. A scientific and health milestone that under no circumstances can be ruined by parallel contracts and unjustified postponements. Governments have an obligation to use all necessary resources to speed up vaccination. Every delay is lives that cannot be saved. And, as we fight the virus on European soil, we must respond equally ambitiously beyond our borders. European Union support for the COVAX consortium is essential to ensure that all people in the most vulnerable countries can be immunized. Our commitment to the most vulnerable in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East is both a humanitarian imperative and an opportunity to demonstrate our value as partners. On behalf of the Social Democrat family, I wanted to thank the Commission for its efforts in the fight against the pandemic and to ask it, together with the Member States, to ensure maximum transparency in the implementation of the vaccination strategy. Transparency is essential to combat misinformation and to convey the trust that citizens need today. We must move forward with determination in building the Health Union to ensure this value as the fundamental value of the Union. The pandemic has reminded us how interdependent we are, a fundamental reason for getting vaccinated. The discovery of the vaccine is a scientific achievement, but vaccination must be an achievement of the Commission and governments. Their success or failure will depend on billions of people living and working without fear. The health of humanity and the economy of the planet are at stake.

We have all lost relatives, friends, colleagues and we are still squeezed into the vise of the effects of this virus. With much research effort, money invested and will, a light appeared on the horizon. The vaccine gives us hope that we can begin to imagine a return to normal life.  I welcome and appreciate the Commission's unprecedented solidarity plan to give every European citizen equal access to a vaccine. But we must avoid the risk of undermining this success through lack of transparency and unnecessary delays. We have all received many questions and requests for clarification and I must admit that we have not had an answer at all.  What causes these distribution delays? Why aren't all documents and data on the purchase of public vaccines if they are bought with public money? No argument justifies the lack of such transparency with all the data and elements of contracts that are paid for with public money. What are we doing to increase the speed of vaccine doses across Europe?  I know that we are in a race against time, but in this race we must not forget that we have a responsibility to do things with transparency towards citizens in order to gain their trust, because that trust depends largely on the success of the vaccination campaign. Any unanswered questions will turn against our common goal. Fake news is born out of ambiguity. Conspiracy theories are born in the dark. So let us assume transparency in this process.  On the other hand, let us not forget that there are states that need our help in this fight, and I am thinking here obviously first of all of our neighbours, our closest partners, the Western Balkans, but also of our eastern border.

The European Commission, relying on European ministers or MEPs, thought it could take control of Europe's health. The current stage of active vaccination is cartoonish. After the release of large funds, let us recall the 30 million live for the CureVac laboratory, then the loan-purchase by public contracts grouped with six laboratories manufacturers of vaccines, after negotiations of the most opaque and unknown negotiators, we can also ask what the dark web will reveal to us after the hacking of the files at the EMA , we are in the distribution of vaccines and we are discovering that there is an early shortage and a break in the promise of laboratories. All of this is heartbreaking.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, anti-European demagoguery sometimes nestles in unexpected places. For example, Markus Sunder, the Christian Democrat who could succeed Angela Merkel in 2021, recently said that it would be too much bureaucracy in Brussels that would explain the small amount of vaccines ordered and the length of price negotiations. How easy it is to blame the European institutions when something is wrong at home! Of course, Mr Soder would like us to believe that, left to their own devices, Member States would have been much more effective in identifying the best vaccine candidates in advance and in negotiating quantities as well as prices. It's great anything! The truth is that it is in close consultation with the Member States and in a context of great uncertainty that the European Commission has negotiated with the laboratories, because it is precisely by acting together that we are best serving the public interest. What can, however, rightly be blamed on the Commission, is that it has ceded to the laboratories by keeping secret the contracts with them. I say, this opacity is an insult to democracy. In any contract, the buyer must know what he is buying, on what terms and at what price. And make no mistake: in a democracy, political decision-makers hold their legitimacy and power by delegation of citizens, it means that when they buy vaccines, it is in the name of the latter.  It is therefore unacceptable that essential conditions of these contracts should be kept hidden not only from citizens but also from their representatives. Beyond the question of prices, it is crucial to know, for example, who will be responsible in case of negative effects or problems caused by vaccines: public authorities or pharmaceutical companies? We don't know! Where is the transparency? Certainly not in this charade, which consists of giving a few Members access to certain contracts, in any case all the crucial provisions will have been purged, without even having the right to take notes or to report publicly what they have read. The Commission tells us that it was the laboratories that demanded opacity. Of course they did! Like all multinationals, they fear, like the plague, free and undistorted competition that, remember your first-year economics courses, requires the perfect information from all players, buyers and sellers alike. And this is not about revealing manufacturing secrets, but about the provisions and conditions of sale. We are saying that the Commission should and must now impose transparency and I would like to see which of these multinationals will refuse to hand over to the Europeans on the pretext that transparency would harm its interests.

The voices that can be heard in the context of the global COVID strategy are, above all, concerns about the slow implementation of vaccines, the risk of delaying the supply of the preparation, issues of contracts, purchases, transparency. From a medical perspective, all this is not a ticket to exit the pandemic. Despite the clear importance of the topics in the above discussion, Parliament should not forget about the patient. In the coronavirus era, systematic pharmacological treatments, prudent recommendations for the use of antibiotics and the determination of age-correlated effects of cardiovascular diseases and risk factors for COVID should be ensured. The use of geographical and social gradients should be ensured in order to seek to alleviate social and ethnic dissus in the population, thereby reducing the incidence of COVID.  At present, particular attention should be paid to monitoring cases of emerging reinfections and infections during the transitional period between the first and second doses of the vaccine and, above all, to support patient care through an appropriate information campaign.

Madam President, Commissioner, I was one of the first MEPs to see this contract that you have with pharmaceutical companies and frankly what a circus! Confiscated phone, declaration of confidentiality, all essential information stained in black. Basically, you let the company decide what MPs could read. Well done, you privatized transparency, you had to do it! So it's mind-blowing, but so governments are able to impose widespread containment on the whole population, but you, in front of the pharmaceutical lobbies, are making the carpet. Yet the vaccine is not primarily because of them, it is public funds that have paid for research and development, who have paid for the production capacity, who will pay, who knows, in case of hidden defects. Frankly, it has already been paid three, four times for this vaccine. For Pfizer, in the meantime, I think that represents an additional 24 billion inflows over a few years. So you let the multinationals make the law: they decide how much they produce, they can even turn off the tap. Did you hear that? In December, Pfizer came to Belgium, saying we would have 300,000 fewer doses. Meanwhile, in Israel, deliveries were at full capacity. Perhaps because Israel was paying twice what the European Union was paying. Because you know profit for them is paramount and countries that can't pay, well they die, right?  You are talking about Covax, but in the meantime Europe has bought five times enough to vaccinate its population, while South Africa has a vaccine for every three people. South Africa, which is facing one of the worst variants of the virus, let's remember. Yesterday, WHO, the World Health Organization, spoke of a catastrophic failure. And the bottom line is that, to guarantee Pfizer's profits, you refuse, you prohibit India and South Africa from vaccinating but also from producing the vaccine.  Through the patent system, you are preventing them today from producing vaccines for everyone. You prevent the vaccine from circulating but you will not prevent the virus from circulating. Do you feel the boomerang effect coming with this South African variant in Europe? We have to share the vaccine, we have to take it out of Big Pharma's hands and put it under public control. But you, you continue to make the cut in front of the multinational pharmaceutical companies.

It would be complete chaos, is that really the Europe you want? If so, take it, but we are proud of this unique, shared and supportive European process. But the second message I am giving you strongly, Commissioner, is the requirement for transparency.

Once again, we will only defeat this pandemic if COVID is stopped anywhere in the world. Hence my questions: how do we, as the European Union, want to donate superfluous doses of vaccines? Are there any agreements? And how are the manufacturers involved? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which It is good that the European Union is participating in the COVAX programme. But is that enough? No! The funding target for 2021 has not been met, there is a billion-dollar gap. That is another reason why I find it incomprehensible that the European Union still strongly rejects the proposal by South Africa and India for COVID patent exemptions within the TRIPs Agreement. As the EU, we can and must help, and therefore, in the end, an urgent appeal to the Council and the Commission: use the vaccination summit this Thursday and provide clarity on international solidarity.

In a year, the pandemic caused astronomical economic damage, estimated at $11 trillion. The vaccine will stop this pandemic, but it will not stop others from coming. Almost every pandemic has so far been caused by zoonotic transmission, that is, by moving from animals to humans. What we need to prevent is a process that is associated with the outbreak of these diseases. These are very clearly linked to the destruction of nature and the exploitation of animal species. About 1.7 million hitherto unknown viruses circulate in wild animal populations. Half of them have zoonotic potential. If we continue deforestation, massive hunting and trade in wild animals, we are critically increasing the risk of further transmission. Investing in nature conservation can prevent these diseases. According to scientific estimates, effective protection would cost about $30 billion a year. The damage caused to us by the virus would cover effective measures for a period of 500 years. Instead of buying mining permits and importing deforestation, we need to invest in natural areas for the purpose of not extracting them. We must invest in unspoilt natural areas and ensure that they remain so. Strict nature protection is both an insurance policy and an investment in these steps. It's really not too early.

Pfizer has justified its support with the Italian Government by saying that modernisations are under way at the Puurs plant and that they will try to remedy this decrease in the vaccine delivered. The truth is probably another, however, that Pfizer has sold or is selling these vaccines to non-EU countries. And the situation is even more serious, because these regions I have mentioned are a bit of a locomotive in the country, and slowing down vaccination work in these regions means somehow stopping the country. Furthermore, the clauses established by the Commission, namely the impossibility for large companies to buy vaccines directly and to be able to vaccinate their employees, mean that the large Italian companies are basically stationary and unable to go ahead until these vaccines are delivered.

A great deal has been discussed and mentioned and I will try to pick up as many points as possible. First of all, I just want to start by saying that we share the many concerns voiced by many of you here in terms of the COVID—19 fatigue and the need for citizens to return to their normality and I wanted to pick up with you an issue that hasn’t been mentioned today but that is extremely important, that we are aware of and that we are looking at and that is the impact that COVID—19 and this pandemic is also having on the mental health of each and every European citizen. Many of you mentioned the issues of production. I just wanted to share with you that the bottleneck at the moment is not in the number of orders that has been placed but in the worldwide shortage of production capacity. Because the strategy has been mentioned a number of times, I wanted to just say that in June we decided with the 27 Member States that the EU would not put all its eggs in one basket and that we would really work with Member States in order to have a diversified portfolio and that has been achieved because we now have six vaccines all with APAs signed, and two so far being authorised as being safe and effective. This shows the power of unity, the power of joining forces and it is what everybody wanted and we were mandated to do: to carry out the negotiations with and on behalf of the 27 Member States. All decisions on which vaccine candidates were taken to invest in and how was taken jointly with everyone agreeing on the approach of building a broad portfolio. In October, there was a communication by the Commission asking all the Member States to be prepared for their rollout for their vaccine strategies and I have said many times in this Parliament that finding a safe and effective vaccine would not be a silver bullet; it would not be possible for us to end the pandemic in one day. We are working as closely as we can with all Member States, of course, in order to be able to ensure that rollouts move as quickly as possible and in the communication that we issuing later on today we’re asking Member States to send information to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) at least twice a week so we are able to monitor the situation. So we now have two vaccines, which have been approved and are being progressively distributed at increasing speed. Every day and every vaccination counts and the stock of vaccines delivered need to be used as quickly as possible. We are working with Member States in order to support them with this, but let’s not all forget that this is the first time in history that we are all undertaking such a mass vaccination campaign of this size and of this complexity and we do face already and they will be more challenges down the road, but we are there to support Member States and solve these problems as they appear. Some of you mentioned the situation that appeared a few days ago with BioNTech—Pfizer. I just wanted to let you know that, from the moment that this situation appeared, I was in calls continuously with the health ministers and we called a meeting immediately of the steering committee together and we are working continuously with BioNTech—Pfizer in order to support them to develop more production capacities in the EU. We are fully mobilised – both the European Medicines Agency and the Commission – to support the ramping up of production as soon as possible. In terms of the importance of doing this together, I have said before that joining forces is the only way to ensure that all Member States had access to so many different vaccines at the same time and, as many of you said, at the same price. But now we need to really work as quickly as possible to roll these out and fairness has always been a crucial principle in our strategy. We were very clear about this and we are now asking Member States to move as quickly as possible to be able to reach citizens. You mentioned issues of bilateral contracts and parallel negotiations. I will repeat what I have said many times: the purpose and the guiding principle of our vaccine strategy is to avoid parallel negotiations. This would undermine the strategy’s effectiveness. We now have two approved vaccines. We have negotiated delivery of 300 million additional doses of BioNTech—Pfizer. We are awaiting the scientific assessment of the AstraZeneca vaccine at the end of this month and the Johnson &amp; Johnson is under review. We therefore consider that, with these supplies, we will be able to address fully the needs of Member States. All Member States joined the EU strategy for the COVID—19 vaccine and this implies both rights and obligations, and so far all Member States are part of the contracts we have negotiated. So, it is not legally possible for them to negotiate bilateral contracts with the companies in the EU portfolio and I have reminded Member States of these rights and obligations. Many of you mentioned transparency. I will be as brief as possible. We are, as a Commission, 100% in favour of transparency, we can show absolute flexibility on this. We have been working with companies; BioNTech—Pfizer has agreed to release its contract and we are now working with the other companies to move forward but we cannot unilaterally decide to disclose confidential information, such as information on prices, under the contracts unless the companies agree. Liability was used. Liability under the conditional marketing authorisations remains with the manufacturers and holders and they are responsible for the products and the safe use and this is the importance of the conditional marketing authorisation that we had followed. In terms of the global aspect, I believe that when it comes to dealing with a global pandemic of these proportions, we should not be speaking about competition between countries. We saw from the beginning that the ‘first us’ approach does not work and we need to have global solidarity in order to really be a shield against COVID—19. This is why we launched the coronavirus global response; this is why we are strong supporters of access to the COVID—19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator. The issue of diagnostics and therapeutics was also mentioned. We need to work on that as well for all countries and not just vaccines. Global access and equal access to vaccines is the reason why we have joined COVAX and we will continue to support it. In terms of delivery, in today’s communication we will be stressing that we need to work with companies to deliver a clear and transparent schedule for deliveries. I want to just say here that the practical arrangements of the deliveries are laid down in the contracts between the company and the Member States and we are doing our best really to help this on a daily basis, constantly on the phone trying to help our Member States with issues that appear. Wherever feasible we do step in to offer support to the Member States and to liaise with the company to help ensure that engagements are respected. The variants were mentioned. This is a very important issue, thank you for raising it. Currently there is no evidence that the BioNTech—Pfizer and Moderna vaccines would not be effective against this variant but information is still being collected and analysed and ongoing. I’m in constant contact with the European Medicines Agency for this. Typically, viruses mutate so we need to follow it up very carefully, and again today in the communication, we are going to be urging Member States to do more genomic sequencing across the EU to identify variants. This is crucial in order for us to share this information so that we are able to follow it. There is no evidence so far that it does not cause more serious illness or that the vaccines are less effective but it does appear that there is evidence that they are transmitted more quickly. And, last but not least, vaccination certificates. This is a common approach across the EU to monitor vaccine effectiveness, it may be needed once citizens are vaccinated. This could reinforce the success of the vaccination programmes in Member States. We are in active discussions with the Member States on how we will move forward with this because they need to be recognised across all Member States and we could also set a global example. We welcome all inputs from Member States, including that we had recently from Greece, it is an important issue and it is going to be one of the issues as well as the rollout strategies that will be discussed this week at the European Council with the Heads of State. I will end here. I want to thank you once again for a very important and informative discussion, and I want to say what I have been saying from the beginning, that we will leave no stone unturned until we exit this pandemic because we all understand how important it is that citizens and economies and societies are able to return to a way of life as we knew before.

I took good note of positions, demands and suggestions, but I also heard, loud and clear, the expression of support for all of the European Union to work united and at the EU level, together with the Commission. Since the start of this crisis, the European Union and its Member States have closely worked together and mobilised massive resources to fight against the virus. We have managed to develop, to distribute, and to start the process of vaccination. We need to continue, united and in coordination.  To start, the vaccination campaign offers a glimpse of hope. We still have a long way to go before we can get to herd immunity so we need to continue to work. We need the Commission to support us with the establishment of targets for all Member States in terms of the vaccination. We need to have European recognition of tests, and the capacity to produce and discuss the question of the vaccine certificate. We need to continue the genomic sequencing of the virus. We need to produce more data that is compatible and that we can use among Member States to get more information. We need transparency in all these processes. Only in this way will we get the trust of our citizens. The Heads of State and Government will discuss all these matters at the meeting that will take place in two days. I think this debate was really informative and very important at this stage. We need the continued cooperation of all the EU institutions in these challenging times. United, we can make the European Union and the entire world a safer place. We need to have a common goal in the European Union and around the world to defeat this virus. It is clear that no country will be able to defeat the COVID—19 pandemic. We need solidarity. We need to talk to other countries about COVAX and about how we can reinforce WHO technical cooperation and also work in the European team spirit.

The EU has in place competent regulators at the head with the European Medicines Agency, which, through its procedures adapted to operate in exceptional circumstances, ensures the highest possible standards (including in comparison with the US or Uk) in the scientific review and authorisation of vaccines. Nevertheless, I believe that the key role is parliament's efforts, which also controls the transparency of joint procurement with a watchful eye and the overall course of vaccination in the EU. I therefore believe that a comprehensive insight into the contracts signed by the Commission with pharmaceutical companies is crucial for ensuring this clarity and transparency. It is our responsibility to take due care of the use of European public funds. Last but not least, it is important to emphasise the unity and consistency in respect for the common European strategy for the provision of vaccines, and it is important that certain Member States do not take any reticence at the expense of others.

We cannot accept that the selfish interests of pharmaceutical monopolies prevail over the right to health and life of the population, and therefore action must be done to put pressure on the big laboratories and also to find solutions to diversify the acquisition of vaccines.

Despite being major players in financing the development of a vaccine, EU countries are lagging when organising to administer it to their populations. Second, many questions remain over the transparency of the whole process. How were deals done? How are they now being revised? And what constraints were allowed to pre-empt manufacture of the vaccine by a wider range of players in the market? Has it been a simple case of accepting that under free market rules, pharmaceutical companies needed to maintain exclusive rights on the production of vaccines?

Where did the EC make mistakes? First of all, she played too cheap. Israel and other EU states have overpaid, with supplies preferably. They calculated that doubling the price of a vaccine is still more cost-effective than two weeks of restrictions on the free movement of extra people. Secondly, the EC refused to take legal responsibility for collateral health problems after vaccination. In the US, Britain and Israel, the state and insurance companies took the blame. Thirdly, the approval procedure at the EMA is bureaucratic and lengthy. Finally, political balancing act prevailed in the EC for the fourth time.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done. The trans-European transport network is central to the competitiveness, growth and prosperity of the European Union. A high-performance and well-connected infrastructure is a key to Europe's integration. Since the adoption of the current regulation in 2013, there have been major changes in the transport sector. The focus is now on increasing sustainability, ensuring multimodality and integrating new technologies. In short, the way we think about infrastructure and mobility has changed. Not least against the background of impending delays in the construction and development of infrastructures, it is now time to revise the guidelines. I am therefore grateful that the Commission plans to publish a new proposal for the guidelines for the trans-European transport network in the third quarter of 2021. The issue is of great interest in the European Parliament: 402 amendments and the resulting 33 compromises clearly demonstrate this. With the revision of the regulation, there is now a significant opportunity to make the European transport network future-proof and crisis-proof. We must support the transition to smart and sustainable and also safe mobility. Multimodality and technology neutrality must be given special consideration as basic principles. I would like to make it clear that all modes of transport must have their place in the trans-European transport network. This network must help the transport sector to reduce its emissions while ensuring the mobility of citizens at affordable prices. The report now before us is clearly committed to the completion of the core network by 2030. There must therefore be no fundamental changes to network cards until the core network is completed. As a Parliament, we make it clear that there must nevertheless be scope for limited adjustments to take account, for example, of missing cross-border links. The average delay of 11 years in the completion of selected major projects, calculated by the European Court of Auditors, is indeed worrying. The Member States must meet their obligations more in this. Digitisation in national administrative and legal procedures must be pursued further, and this must also lead to an acceleration of processes and not to a slowdown. The European Commission must therefore play a stronger and more active role in achieving the objectives of the trans-European transport network. Clearly, the role of coordinators must therefore be strengthened accordingly.  Another important point that is particularly close to my heart is the combination of the core and the whole network. We need to look very carefully at this. Only if rural, peripheral and outermost regions and islands are effectively integrated can we reach our full potential here. The next few years will be crucial for the breakthrough of alternative fuels. As part of the revision, alternative fuels must be made available for all modes of transport. An interoperable infrastructure corresponding to the projected needs must be planned into the network. The European Parliament is calling for an EU road infrastructure roadmap. We have Vision Zero – it has to be a guiding idea when it comes to developing road infrastructure. Too many people are still dying on the roads. The transport network of the future must also be equipped for intelligent and autonomous mobility solutions. As a Parliament, we therefore call for research and development of innovative means of transport, such as magnetic levitation technology. We have fought this point, but it has now come through, and that is a good signal that we are also committed to new technologies here. The report reaffirms the potential of shipping and rail transport in the decarbonisation of the transport sector. Inland waterway transport, as a sustainable mode of transport, deserves a future-proof infrastructure that guarantees reliability, quality and constant navigability. The European Parliament also clearly recognises the important role of air transport in the EU's global, but also in the internal connection. The multimodality of airports should be increased here. Let me say a word about Brexit: we agreed on 24 December, Christmas. It was a difficult birth. This Brexit will also have an impact on transport. It is important to ensure effective connectivity for Ireland. The Commission must have a special focus on the impact of the exit in the now new border regions. Cooperation in the area of the trans-European transport network with the United Kingdom should continue, provided that the United Kingdom also participates in the financing. There will be no free lunch. Full stop. Ladies and gentlemen, I shall conclude. The negotiations were not easy precisely because of the difficulties of COVID-19. Everything had to take place online. Nevertheless, we have produced a comprehensive text which I believe also fulfils the importance of the forthcoming revision. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for this, but also all the staff who have worked hard. Commissioner, Parliament's expectations are clearly expressed in this report. I assume that you will include our proposals in the work. And the work is not yet over, because the bill is still going on. In this respect, I look forward to continuing our cooperation from the third quarter of 2021. Let us move forward together. It is good for Europe!", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 73, "date": "2021-01-19.json", "name": "Adina-Ioana Vălean", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, it’s again a great pleasure for me to be here today to discuss with you the foreseen proposal of TEN-T network based on your report, which is a great one, and I want to start by thanking the rapporteur Mr Jens Gieseke, all the shadow rapporteurs and the Committee on Transport and Tourism (TRAN) for an excellent report. I really appreciate it and it comes with an important recommendation at a crucial moment when we embark on a post-pandemic recovery. TEN-T remains the cornerstone instrument of forward-looking transport policy for some decades ahead. The development of the Trans-European Transport Network is vital for the European integration process as it enables businesses to enjoy the full potential of the internal market. Our citizens, in turn, benefit from seamless, safe and comfortable connections within the EU, bringing them closer together. The TEN-T also plays an essential role for territorial cohesion, ensuring connectivity for all regions. The COVID-19 crisis has certainly shown all of us the importance of well-functioning and coordinated transport infrastructure playing across borders. The revision of TEN-T guidelines will therefore be built firmly upon the ambitious goals set by the European Green Deal, primarily focusing on decarbonisation of the transport sector. The new legislation will therefore place major emphasis on three policy objectives. First, greening of transport infrastructure will be of utmost importance, in particular through the wide deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure. This can solve the current supply and demand dilemma. Equally important is the digitalisation innovation in our transport networks, which is closely linked to our objective of making our infrastructure more efficient and resilient. Gains in efficiency will help reducing further CO2 emissions and will increase seamless connectivity. We also need to make the network resilient to new threats such as cyberattacks or challenges triggered by pandemic outbreak such as Covid. Last but not least, we aim at reinforcing the multi-modal character of our TEN-T network by improving interoperability and the multi-modal integration of transport infrastructures through the European Union and even beyond, through improved links with neighbouring countries. While a lot of progress has already been made towards completing the TEN-T networks, some projects, especially those of a cross-border nature, are facing delays. In revising the Regulation, it will be important to ensure that all possible steps are now taken to complete the TEN-T on time. We will therefore strengthen the monitoring and management tools for TEN—T implementation, for example by strengthening the role of the European coordinators and by reinforcing all our available tools, including through the new TEN-T streamlining directive. In view of our ultimate objective of completing the core network by 2030, I particularly welcome the report’s conclusions that no major changes to the maps should be made. Minor adjustments will certainly be needed and will be accommodated. At the same time, I would like to remind everyone that becoming part of the core network also implies certain obligations and commitments, such as meeting ambitious infrastructure standards by 2030. EUR 300 billion will be needed over the next 10 years just to complete the TEN—T core network and build it as a truly multi-modal system. This is why we need to be very prudent in extending the core network further and rather focus first on what we already committed to achieve. Extending the 2030 deadline is not an option, and reducing the quality and requirements for the network is something we should also never consider. Honourable Members, this is just a first glimpse at what you may expect by autumn this year, without prejudging, of course, our impact assessment. The revision will address many other aspects highlighted also in your report. We aim to enhance protection to strategic and vulnerable infrastructure and improve some of the quality standards and requirements to make them future proof. Improved accessibility for passengers with reduced mobility will equally be addressed in the revision. This is just to name some topics we have in mind. So once again, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for this timely report and reassure you of my full commitment to make Europe’s infrastructure an agile driving force for our economy.

That is why it is so important to build a single european Union transport area, inter alia through trans-European transport networks. It is very important to remove bottlenecks. We had the opportunity to see how important this is when supplying products of protection measures at the beginning of the covid pandemic. It is also important to remove all barriers and delays, which in some countries – as has already been said here – often take several years. We also need to modernise and adapt infrastructure to future challenges, so alternative fuels infrastructure and the transition to smart, sustainable, intermodal, efficient and safe mobility are very important.  The report also emphasises the completion of the core network, complemented by the necessary adjustments that reflect the infrastructure development of individual countries. I am talking here, among other things – on the example of my country, my province – about the inclusion of new sections of the TEN-T corridors running through Poland, including the corridor leading through Kraków to Rzeszów.

The revision of the policy of the trans-European transport network will be one of the cornerstones of the new Green Pact and will enable the network to be updated in terms of sustainability, digitisation and security. With this own-initiative report, we aim to drive multimodal mobility that takes advantage of the benefits of each mode of transport and is interoperable, secure and accessible to all users. We want more sustainable modes of transport, such as rail, inland waterways or sea motorways, to be prioritized, and that there be an effective deployment of alternative fuels for all modes of transport.  The revision of theRTE-T Regulation is a unique opportunity to move forward with the implementation of the basic network of cross-border sections and pending links, but also of the global network, which ensures the capillary of all territories. An opportunity to move forward in economic and social cohesion, for territorial development and also to bring European citizens closer together. An opportunity to build more Europe.  The completion of European corridors is essential to achieve this. In the case of Spain, the review will be a unique opportunity to finish the Atlantic and Mediterranean corridors and, therefore, the Cantabrian-Mediterranean corridor, of great importance for the well-being of citizens and the regional, social and economic development of my region, Aragon.  But we must ensure that the infrastructures are of quality and that they are monitored in the maintenance of them; that they are resilient infrastructures and can cope with environmental shocks such as that of the drunken Filomena, which has caused serious infrastructure damage and left many peoples – thousands of people in much of Spain isolated and incommunicado. And for all this sufficient funding is needed.

I also notice your concerns regarding the resilience of the infrastructure, the maintenance work, the delays, especially on cross-border projects, and of course on funding. You are right in all of them. These are also my concerns but we have decided to try to address all of this. I believe that, with all the financial instruments which will be available, including the Resilience and Recovery Facility, we’ll have a better benefit in financing our projects.  Thank you again for your interest. I’m absolutely sure we will continue to have opportunities to exchange views on this.

The EU's ten-t approach so far has been aimed at developing east-west connections, thereby allowing for delays in the development of connections and socio-economic development of regions in Central and Eastern Europe. The TEN-T review is an opportunity to make up for losses and direct the funding stream to projects connecting Northern and Southern Europe, and in particular to investments in the central and eastern flank countries. Only this approach will allow the key growth centres to be connected to areas with lower development dynamics and to be integrated into the TEN-T European transport network. Unfortunately, my regions of Warmia and Mazury and Podlasie still qualify for the least accessible areas, despite the fact that they pass through two TEN-T core corridors.

We therefore have a duty to strive for a rapid and effective transition to sustainable, intelligent and secure mobility by incorporating new technologies and strengthening the link between transport and infrastructure.

With the impact of the pandemic situation this matter demands even more our committed attention to ensure that we live up to our values, that people arriving at the external borders of the Union are treated with respect and dignity. Since the start of our Presidency a few days ago, we have had the possibility already amongst Member States to address one humanitarian emergency situation, the one in the Lipa camp in Bosnia—Herzegovina, but we know quite well that more needs to be done. Our Presidency is closely monitoring the situation on all migratory routes and we will continue to do so throughout the semester. In 2020 the total number of illegal border crossings at the EU external borders was estimated as 97 000, at the lowest level in seven years. However, while the eastern Mediterranean route saw a very significant decrease of nearly 80%, arrivals on the central Mediterranean route increased 145%, and overall arrivals in Spain also increased 29% compared to 2019.  I would like to touch upon developments in Greece, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in Libya and in the Canary Islands. In January and February last year high numbers of migrants arrived in Greece, creating very difficult conditions of overcrowding the islands, in particular the island of Lesbos. The number of migrants present on the islands reached a peak of more than 40 000 people. The Greek authorities undertook many efforts to strengthen the border controls after the unrest, equal efforts were also made to improve the reception conditions which suffered from the overcrowding of the camps. The arrival of the COVID-19 crisis and the fire in the Moria camp in September only exacerbated the situation, calling for immediate action.  Some improvements have been made. The number of migrants in the centre of the island is now approximately 15 000 people. EU funding is in place. More permanent reception structures are in the pipeline and a joint task force has been established to ensure adequate living conditions and faster procedures. The situation remains volatile in this region of the world. The political climate between the EU and our neighbour Turkey plays a significant role in the stability of the region and hence on the arrival of migrants, and we need to continue monitoring the situation quite closely. During the next six months, we will continue to devote also much attention to the migratory situation in the Western Balkans region, in particular in Bosnia-Herzegovina where around 5 800 migrants and refugees are currently present, mainly in the north west.  Following strong advocacy by a number of actors, including the EU and humanitarian agencies, we note that the local authorities are making considerable efforts to address the situation, and have now identified an interim solution for some 900 individuals in dire conditions at the Lipa site. However, no long-term solution has been identified. We will need to continue to support the authorities but also urge them to provide better reception conditions and efficient services, including access to the asylum procedures for people in need of international protection. Regarding the central Mediterranean route, conditions for migrants in Libya continue to be dire. To alleviate the suffering of migrants and refugees in urban settings or in detention centres in Libya, the EU and individual Member States have funded projects via the EU Trust fund for Africa, our implementing partners UNHCR and IOM continue to do a very important work. This includes also the IOM programme for voluntary returns of countries of origin, which has resumed after a long break due to the COVID crisis. The same applies for the work of the UNHCR to evacuate detained persons of concern to either Niger or Rwanda, with a view to resettlement in the EU or other receiving countries.  Let me also mention the situation in the Canary Islands, where thousands of irregular migrants arrived in October and November in huge numbers, overwhelming for a period the capacity of the authorities to register, identify and accommodate them. The migrants, half of whom are Moroccan and half of whom are sub-Saharan, come from sub-Saharan countries, arrived in small boats and were rescued at sea. The influx led to the deployment of the Frontex officers to assist in the first registration and in the notification procedures. A contract was signed with EASO to also assist in improving reception capacities, and we strongly encourage the operational and technical support by EU agencies in front line Member States.  I would like to stress that the humanitarian situation at our external borders is a cause of great concern that needs our attention and more needs to be done, and I trust the Commissioner would also elaborate on the comprehensive assistance that the EU is providing at our external borders to improve the situation.  But before I finish, honourable Members, I would like to say that the Presidency is committed to finding better solutions as regards migration and refugee flows. We will give priority to the new pact and migration and asylum and the initiatives that it contains, aiming to establish a common migration management mechanism that is effective, resilient and reliable and safeguards human rights, based on a fair sharing of efforts and obligations. And we are committed to achieving results on the basis of the Commission’s last package of proposals. And I say we will foster the deepening of the partnerships between the EU and the countries of origin and transit, including through constructive dialogue and the development of a policy to promote legal migration channels.  This is a sustainable alternative and takes into account the objective of integrating migrants, especially unaccompanied minors. We will also aim to implement the Valletta Declaration and its action plan together with the accompanying regional dialogue and to follow up on the global compacts for migration and refugees, and in this context we intend to organise in Lisbon a ministerial conference on migration flows. Honourable Members, I remain at your disposal and I will listen carefully to your views on this difficult matter.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 112, "date": "2021-01-19.json", "name": "Ylva Johansson", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, 10 days ago, a mob stormed the Capitol in Washington. Their objective — to overturn an election result. To hunt down lawmakers. To harm elected representatives, even to kill them. They actually did kill a police officer. This was an attack on democracy.  That this can happen in the United States is a shock. It was hard to believe what we saw happening live. A tough reminder that we can never take democracy for granted.  Respect for human dignity, freedom, equality, rule of law, human rights —these values are at the core of our European Union. We must live by these values, protect and defend them. The European Union must uphold these values. Our Member States must uphold these values. Countries seeking to join us must uphold these values too, as must our agencies.  When Frontex was accused of involvement in alleged pushbacks, the Commission called for a prompt investigation. We called for emergency meetings of the Frontex management board, and the board will meet again tomorrow. When there were reports of alleged pushbacks at the Croatian border, the Commission called upon the authorities to investigate, as is their duty. The Commission and the Croatian authorities regularly discuss how to improve the existing monitoring and investigations. In the context of these discussions, in November the Commission sent a senior mission to Croatia, which visited two border-crossing points. The Commission is now working with the Croatian authorities to set up a good independent monitoring mechanism. The Croatian Ombudsman and UNHCR are also involved. Together with the Croatian authorities, we outlined key principles in a memorandum of understanding and we look to the Croatian authorities for swift signing of this document. This is not a one-off. It’s an ongoing dialogue to ensure high standards are met. Under the new Pact on Asylum and Migration, the Commission has also proposed for all Member States to set up an independent monitoring mechanism.  Also in Bosnia—Herzegovina, the Commission has been working to prevent a humanitarian crisis from the start. Together with the High Representative / Vice—President Josep Borrell, Vice—President Schinas and Commissioner Várhelyi. The current crisis is a humanitarian crisis, but also a crisis of governance. An unnecessary crisis. A crisis that could have been avoided if the authorities had acted responsibly. Each day of this stalemate erodes Bosnia’s international reputation. We knew the Lipa facility would be closed. It was set up this spring; it was always meant to be provisional. As the IOM had clearly signalled, Lipa was not built for the winter. There is a ready-made, fully winterised facility standing empty nearby, in Bira. This is equipped to house 1 500 people. It was unlawfully emptied by local authorities last September.  On 25 December, I urged the authorities to reopen the Bira facility, together with High Representative / Vice—President Josep Borrell and Commissioner Oliver Várhelyi.  That same day, the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina decided to reopen the facility. It did so again, 10 days later but so far, the authorities have not enforced this decision. On 23 December, the Lipa facility closed. People were now stuck in the freezing cold without shelter. To help these people and break the deadlock, I started calling our partners. On New Year’s Eve, I spoke with Zoran Tegeltija, the chair of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The day before, I spoke with Mustafa Ružnić, Prime Minister of the Una-Sana Canton, and most recently, High Representative / Vice-President Borrell spoke with President Milorad Dodik, chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We urged them to work together to provide shelter.  Commissioner Lenarčič announced EUR 3.5 million in humanitarian aid, to provide warm clothing, blankets, food and medical support. The European Union Head of Delegation and Special Representative continues to work around the clock to improve the situation. Following our discussions with the Bosnian and Herzegovinian authorities, the army has set up winter tents that now house around 900 people. Generators, heating, wooden floors as well as food and medical supplies are on site. Thanks to our action, the situation has improved, but only from grave to serious. Stopping immediate risk to life is the beginning, not the end of ensuring acceptable, dignified living conditions. Winter has a long way to run, and I must admit that it is frustrating to have to set up tents and temporary shelter when we have an empty, fully equipped and winterised facility just 30 kilometres down the road.  The Commission is fully committed to supporting migration management in Bosnia and Herzegovina, financially with EUR 89 million since 2018, and also with technical support from the Commission and the European Asylum and Support Office. We will continue our support but Bosnia-Herzegovina must show it’s capable of managing migration. It must take responsibility and address the humanitarian situation. As a country with the perspective of EU accession, we expect Bosnia and Herzegovina to work on sustainable long—term solutions, to set up facilities evenly distributed across the full territory of the country.  I am aware discussions between local and national authorities can be difficult. The immediate priority is still to save lives. To stop a humanitarian crisis from turning into a humanitarian disaster.  I intend to visit Lipa and meet the Bosnian authorities in February. The key is in the hands of the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina at all levels. They must show the political will to save lives and provide long-term solutions.  Of course, we have an acute humanitarian situation in many more areas at our external borders. Time limits make it not possible to comment on all of this, but I am happy to come back on that, in my final intervention.

So there is no room, there are no magic solutions: let us not hide behind our finger, it is known to everyone that in order to deal definitively with the problem, we need substantial and, above all, European border protection and a revision of the existing framework, which should focus even more on strengthening the guarding of land and sea borders, by modern technical means and absolutely in cooperation with the European Union.

Unfortunately not. As usual, it is all about tearful speeches, fundamental rights and calls to welcome ever more those who are wrongly presented to us as families in distress. However, on 8 January, the Frontex agency issued a press release stating that now, I quote, \"women represent less than one in ten migrants\".

Mr President, the situation at our external borders calls for sustainable solutions. By 2020, 124 000 refugees and migrants arrived in Europe. The largest group were people from Syria, followed by Moroccans, Algerians and Tunisians. And there is quite a difference: 85% of Syrians actually need international protection, while at the same time we see that 95% of people from Algeria are not fleeing from anything at all. And that also includes the challenge for the European Union's policy: to mercifully protect those who are really fleeing war and violence, while at the same time being strict and clear to those who come to Europe for other reasons. And the new proposals from the European Commission can help us do this: strict and clear screening at the external borders, mandatory border procedures for low-prospective asylum seekers, more emphasis on the return of illegal migrants and more solidarity between Member States.  But one basic condition of this, of course, is that we – with full respect for fundamental rights – guard our external borders in a good way. And when I see how, for example, in the Canary Islands – as the Council referred to this – the number of arrivals will increase by 800% by 2020, while we still receive very little information about the situation on the ground, whereas we see that Frontex is only there with one boat, I would like to ask – also to the European Commission – whether we should not pay any more attention to this.  And finally, quite simply, the situation at the external borders is not only the responsibility of the countries that happen to be there, but for all of us, and it is time for the European Union as a whole to take that responsibility.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 122, "date": "2021-01-19.json", "name": "Maria Arena (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124936", "text": "   Madam President, European migration policy is, as we know, based on very clear priorities, and certainly not new ones: curbing arrivals, limiting reception by sorting people and increasing returns. This strategy, which has been repeatedly criticised by NGOs and the academic community, has undoubtedly succeeded in reducing arrivals in Europe, but at what cost? Above all, it has not solved the problem of migrant issues and rights. For years, the outsourcing of the management of the migration issue has shown its inefficiency, with more than 20,000 deaths in the Mediterranean since 2014, a process of encampment at the union's borders and above all an exponential cost. This policy has increased the rate of violence on the roads of exile and has violated international law with impunity.  Over the past year, violent returns by Croatia, Greece, Malta and Cyprus have been increasingly reported. How can the Commission effectively treat these back-ups with sanctions?

In winter it is cold, and it is also cold in the camps at the EU's external borders or even within the EU, in Greece, in Bosnia or in Croatia.

In this respect, there is a self-inflicted need, and we should therefore be talking more about blackmail. Because every winter the same blackmail starts.

I started my intervention by talking about values and I think that this debate has clearly shown that this is about values and fundamental rights.  I would like to comment on some borders that I didn’t mention in my first intervention. First, on the Canary Islands, there is a very severe situation. Last year, we saw an increase of 1 000% of irregular arrivals on the Canary Islands. This is of course a very difficult situation. That’s why the Commission has been providing extra money. We have been providing personnel from our agencies. Somebody asked for Frontex to be there. Frontex are on the Canary Islands and they are happy to help the Spanish authorities with whatever kind of help they need.  It’s also important to address their routes. This is absolutely one of the most deadly routes to the European Union and we don’t actually know how many lives have been lost on this route. I think that was rightly pointed out by Mr López Aguilar. I have of course been to the Canary Islands, I have been to Morocco and I’ve been to Mauritania. We also need to work with our external partners to fight the human smugglers and to protect people’s lives.  I was asked questions on how we work on the external aspect of migration. I will be happy to answer that in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) or in a special debate here in the plenary. We have done a lot, but there is also a lot more that we need to do.  Many of you also mentioned Greece and the Greek islands. We also have a serious situation there with a lot of problems still to be addressed, but I must also say that I reacted when I heard that nothing has happened for a year. One year ago, we had 42 000 migrants on the Greek islands. Now there are around 15 000 – still too many of course, but actually things have improved. We have relocated migrants to the mainland, to other Member States, and we also have a programme for voluntary returns. The backlog on Greece assessing their asylum applications is close to zero. This is good, but I’ll be the first to say that a lot more has to be done. We do not of course have a satisfactory situation, but it’s not fair to say that nothing has happened.  Many of you have asked for the sustainable regulations to deal with a proper way of managing migration. We have these proposals on the table and I hope the Pact on Migration and Asylum can be adopted by both Parliament and the Council because we need that. The last thing I would like to say is that, when listening to this debate, I think it’s important to point out one thing. Not everybody that wants to come to the European Union has the right to come here or to stay here. We welcome those in need of international protection and we welcome those regular migrants that come to the European Union, but let me make one thing crystal clear. We are talking about human beings. We are talking about people. All human beings have rights and dignity. Even if they don’t have the right to stay in the European Union, they have the right to be treated in line with their rights and their dignity. That is our obligation to our values and as human beings ourselves.

As I have already stressed, we are committed to improving migrants’ conditions, especially those of vulnerable groups. All the interventions coincide here today in the rejection of the dire situation where thousands of migrants and asylum seekers are living in our borders. This is not sustainable. We all worry about the fundamental and the humanitarian situation of migrants and refugees. This is what I’ve listened to in this noble assembly. But I also listened to very divisive lines, when it comes to the analysis of the problem, the causes of the situation and the solutions we find.  Unfortunately, it is also difficult to reach consensus at the Council level. Nevertheless, I would like to reiterate that the Portuguese Presidency will look, will continue to reach out for solutions: focusing on implementation, focusing on a comprehensive approach to migration, looking into external relations, the need to find partnerships with other countries, so that we can save lives, so that we can fight the smugglers.  We will look into all these elements with the political will to try to find a consensus.

Let us simply remember that, by the very admission of a representative of the International Organization for Migration at the Euronews microphone in 2018, 85% of those present in these camps are in fact economic migrants. A significant proportion of them come from Pakistan, with allegations of visa trafficking as a backdrop. Moreover, the Bosnian representative of the tripartite presidency visited the country in November, confirming the scale of the problem.  The European Union is largely responsible for this tragedy, because of its inability to ensure effective protection of its external borders, and once again its action seems to have been limited to pouring its humanitarian aid with lost funds.

Local authorities are blocking the distribution of refugees in the nearby town of Bihac, where the EU-funded centre is located. The situation on the Greek islands is also worrying. Although the number of migrants there has fallen from more than 40,000 to 15,000, there is a lack of information on the conditions in which refugees are staying in the so-called Moria II camp in Lesbos, where humanitarian workers are banned from entering.

Democracy must follow certain principles, it must follow certain rules: the European Union and the Member States were right to strongly condemn what has happened.  We cannot allow states close to us to cooperate with and dialogue with which we dialogue that use the judicial weapon or even, potentially, the weapon of the attack to silence the political opposition. Respect for civil rights, human rights and political rights must always be at the heart of relations between our Member States, between the European Union and third countries. We have therefore done well on several levels and the international community has done well to condemn what has happened and to demand clarity, so that the Russian authorities allow the international community to clarify what happened in Navalny. However, I believe, Commissioner Borrell, that in order to be completely credible in your request, the European Union should have a common approach with all the third countries with which we are in dialogue and cooperation.

Putin is doing the same by arresting Aleksei Navalny.

Russia has long sabotaged and undermined freedom not only in relation to its own people, undermining and sabotaging freedom in relation to us Europeans. And it's time to say enough. We are not only angry here today. Today, we really need to make it clear enough to stand up to Russia in a similar way to how we have faced Belarus, with sanctions, economically, financially and politically. Navaľnyj belongs to freedom and Russia does not belong to Europe in today's situation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 193, "date": "2021-01-19.json", "name": "Josep Borrell Fontelles", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Madam President, I would like to thank honourable Members for their participation in this debate. The question is what is the timeline for the European Union to continue addressing this matter further, in what fora and doing what. Well, first of all, the arrest of Navalny will be discussed in the relevant bodies in the Council. We expect it to be raised in current affairs in the upcoming Foreign Affairs Council on 25 January. We will continue to follow the situation closely and consider its implications. Any further listings in sanctions, as some of you have proposed, are subject to a decision of the Council by unanimity under the proposal of some Member States.  We have called, and will continue to call, on the Russian authorities to investigate this crime thoroughly and transparently and to cooperate fully with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons – Russia has signed this Treaty – and to ensure an international investigation. In calling for a joint response, the European Union will do whatever it takes, including through restrictive measures if the Member States consider them appropriate, and it will be discussed at the next Foreign Affairs Council.  Some of you have raised the issue of the Nord Stream pipeline. Well, you know the situation of Nord Stream 2. This is a project by a group of private firms. The Commission has stated several times that it considers that this pipeline does not lead to diversifying the energy sources of the European Union. This is one of the objectives of our energy union and this project is not in the framework of our objectives, but we cannot prevent the companies from building it if the German Government agrees with that. Should these companies finalise a pipeline, they should know that they will need to operate in line with European Union law. But this is the most we can do at European Union level.  Does the arrest of Mr Navalny have any other implications for European Union relations more broadly? Well, you know that our relations with Russia are based on the five guiding principles, as reaffirmed by the European Union Foreign Ministers on 12 October last year. As I explained after this Council, the whole of the EU—Russia relations cannot be reduced to the poisoning of Mr Navalny. We will respond swiftly and decisively to this poisoning, but we have other dimensions in our relations with Russia that we need to continue to address, such as, for example, implementation of the Minsk agreement. We maintain open channels of communication with Russia to enhance engagement on issues of common interest. The five guiding principles approach gives this possibility in order to continue defending our interests and values, which certainly include respect for international law and fundamental rights.  I think this is everything that I can say at the moment. Let’s see what the Member States decide to do and how the discussion at the next Foreign Affairs Council goes in order to know what the next steps will be. In any case, we are putting on all political pressure in order to get Mr Navalny’s freedom and I will continue to do so through whatever ways and means that I consider appropriate.

After the assassination of Boris Nemtsov, Putin's main opponent was Alexei Nawalny, whose Russian services tried to poison him using banned combat chemicals. In Russia, eliminating opponents through assassinations has become a weekday. The Kremlin is unable to silence all voices of discontent. Protests against corruption, increasingly poor living conditions and lack of freedom have gone beyond the great cities of the European part of Russia. Support for Putin fell to its lowest ever. Not surprisingly, in the face of the upcoming Dummy elections, the Kremlin has taken a number of measures to secure the continuation of power. One of them is the arrest of Nawal.West can no longer close his eyes. We call on the Council to impose sanctions on Russian oligarchs associated with the regime. The EU should not be a capital-friendly place of unknown origin. Those who benefit from putin's system - officials, businessmen, people of culture - cannot enjoy its fruits with comfort by hiding assets in the EU, buying luxury goods, or educating their children.

It is about tough economic and personnel sanctions. Economic sanctions should be extended by the Council of the EU to the Nord Stream 2 project. In this case, we can count on cooperation with the US. Personal sanctions should affect Russian oligarchs.

The first act of this action was the Ministerial Conference that the German Presidency hosted in Berlin on 14 December, which I had the honour to chair, and I think it was a great success. 49 foreign ministers from the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean participated in Berlin together with leading partners like the European Investment Bank, the EU-LAC Foundation and the EU-American General Secretariat. The European Parliament also play an important role. The chairs of the Committees on Foreign Affairs (AFET), International Trade (INTA) and Development (DEVE) as well as the chair of the Eurolat and the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly were also invited to participate as observers. Dear Members, as we wait for the incoming President, Joe Biden (President of the United States, evidently), there is a strong interest about the new Transatlantic relationship with Washington. However, on the other side of the Atlantic there is not only the US; sometimes when you talk about Transatlantic relations it looks like on the other side there is only the United States. There are other Transatlantic relations. We must not forget these other Transatlantic relations – the one that unites Europe with Latin American and Caribbean countries. We, in many respects, are the closest people in the world. We share a history, dramatic history but our history, languages and cultural values. We have a dense network of institutional ties with the region. We have political and trade cooperation agreements with 27 out of the 33 countries in this region. It’s one of the most dense networks of institutional relations that we have with any other region in the world. We are the third largest trading partner, the third – we were the second, now the second is China, every day more present in Latin America, and China has recently moved ahead of us. But we are still the leading investor in Latin America, with a direct investment stock worth almost EUR 800 billion at the end of 2018. And I want to tell you something that people are surprised at, because it’s not very well known. The investment of the European Union economy’s firms in Latin America is bigger that what we have been investing in China, in India, in Japan and Russia all together. All together, not one by one. More than in China, plus India, plus Japan, plus Russia – surprising, but it’s real. Our investment focuses on a strategic sector – telecommunications and energy – and these are priority areas for our Green Deal and the digital transformation. So, as demonstrated during the Ministerial Conference in Berlin, our regions fully agree on the need to defend multilateralism and will join forces to advance towards a greener, more sustainable development model. Together we represent almost one third of the votes in the United Nations. It’s a big political potential. Our aggregated influence, as a standard-setter, will become even stronger. Together we can better tackle the existing health crisis and its socio-economic consequences. Latin American and Caribbean countries have been very active, particularly in the COVID-19 pandemic. Unhappily they have been heavily hit. With 8% of the world population, the region represents one third of global deaths and now is facing the biggest economic recession in its history. The pandemic is exacerbating structural gaps, inequalities and social exclusion. The increase in social unrest does not help, particularly where governments are making a strong effort to tackle the structural violence. These are, I think, good and enough reasons why we must show real solidarity and engagement with Latin America. We are already doing something – more than something; not enough, but quite a lot. We are already the region’s leading development cooperation partner and the leading provider of humanitarian assistance. We have mobilised EUR 2.4 billion in emergency aid to help Latin America to fight against the pandemic. It looks a lot, but it’s a drop of water in the ocean of the need they have. This is, however, not enough, given the scale of the problem. Dear Members of the European Parliament, working together with our Transatlantic partners on environmental issues is especially important, given that Latin America is home to 50% of the world’s biodiversity – and don’t forget the Amazon rainforest is the major lung for our planet. As part of the green partnership with the region, we are preparing a key European initiative that can address the drivers of deforestation of the Amazon. That will be aligned with the 2019 Leticia Pact. We also look ahead to the COP26 in 2021. We all need to step up our ambitions on climate issues, as we agreed also in Berlin. There we also agreed on the need to promote digital alliances to make the most of the opportunities offered by people focused on digital technologies. You know that we are going to have a new underwater optic cable stretching across the Atlantic. It’s called Bella. It’s a digital highway for knowledge and exchange of information between our countries: a powerful example of the benefits of working together. In a nutshell, the Berlin Ministerial Conference has confirmed that we are on the right track, but we have to go quicker – we have to speed up our relationship. The track is good, but we are too slow. We have important work in front of us. This year we need to move forward with the signature and ratification of our modernisation agreement with Mexico and Chile, as well as an EU agreement with Mercosur, which has been in negotiation for 20 years. I know these are sensitive issues, but we cannot say that we want to engage and to be best partners and to work together with Latin America and not ratify in the way that you consider appropriate, because this Parliament has to ratify this agreement, these long deal agreements with Mercosur and the modernisation of the agreements with Mexico and Chile, who have a long story behind them. They were the first and the best agreements that we signed with a third country. They have provided extraordinarily good results and they have to be modernised. Mexico is this year the chair of the Latin American Countries Association. This is a good year to sign this agreement. This is a good year to have a high-level meeting with Latin America. In the last five years we haven’t celebrated any summit with Latin American countries. Here in Brussels we have a summit almost every day with someone. In the last five years, we haven’t had any one with Latin America. Do you think it is a sensible thing? No, it’s not. So I would like the Parliament to put on all the pressure in order to reinvigorate our relations with Latin America and to take seriously the ratification of the agreements with Mexico and Chile and to look for a solution for the Mercosur. I know that this Parliament has already said that under the current circumstances and the way it is, it will not be ratified by the honourable Members. Let’s look for a solution. Let’s look for a complementary statement, declaration, whatever you can imagine, but don’t throw through the window 20 years of effort and work, go back to the initial point and tell the Latin American countries that in this difficult moment of their history we are not going to agree with them in order to increase our economic and trade and investment relationship. I really urge you to take this very much into consideration. These ambitious treaties include political, cooperation, trade, and sustainable development aspects which will reinforce our ties and our shared defence of an international rules-based order, and from any point of view we will be better off with these Association Agreements than without them. You can rest assured that the position of this Parliament is well noted, and please help me, help us, help the Commission, help the Council, on working to set the right conditions for the entry into force of these agreements.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 202, "date": "2021-01-19.json", "name": "Francisco José Millán Mon", "mepid": "28400", "text": "  PPE Group. – Madam President, Mr Borrell, I very much welcome the meeting of ministers from the European Union and Latin America and the Caribbean online.

In the meantime, the global challenges that Europeans and Latin Americans face are increasing in a coordinated way. Alongside climate change, COVID-19 has also emerged, which has so much impact on both continents. But it is also true that they will increase the instruments to strengthen our relationship. I am also referring to the European Union-Mercosur Agreement, which I hope can be approved soon after so much effort and such a long negotiating effort. I am confident that it will also be a priority of the Portuguese Presidency. I will also highlight the recent conclusion of the negotiations to modernise the European Union-Mexico Association Agreement. I hope that the agreement with Chile will be terminated soon. I do not want to forget one essential aspect of the relationship: commitment to democracy and the rule of law. In this regard, I would like to stress that, following the recent fraudulent elections in Venezuela, the European Union cannot weaken the institutional recognition enjoyed by Juan Guaidó.

Secondly, intensify our cooperation, now to combat the pandemic—vaccines are a good example—but also for a joint economic recovery, which takes into account climate change, gender equality, debt relief, inequality and also strengthening democracy.

The Guapinol environmental defenders who were finalists of the Sakharov Prize last year, have now spent more than 500 days in pre-trial detention for defending their water resources against a mining company. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated the inequalities in Latin America. The EU needs to support the right to vaccination for everyone, especially for those living in extreme poverty and under difficult sanitary situations.  I am also worried that some leaders are taking the pandemic as an excuse to restrain civil rights and democratic freedoms such as in El Salvador and in Nicaragua. But I have also in mind the pictures from yesterday of Guatemala where the army attacks a Honduran ‘caravan’ of refugees. The respect of human rights should be at the core of the EU-LAC partnership.

Encouraging redistributive policies and social investments is, if possible, more urgent amid a pandemic that increases precariousness, poverty and also wreaks havoc in the already precarious middle class.  Secondly, the protection of the environment and natural resources. Certainly, the region contains half of the planet's biodiversity, but also the greatest number of environmental-related conflicts, often violent conflicts that have indigenous peoples as their main victims. Thirdly, the protection of fundamental rights and their defenders, which are threatened in not a few countries in the area. The Union already has instruments to influence these areas.

The EU has lost the moral ground in Latin America. In Venezuela, you claimed that the elections weren’t fair before they even happened. We went to see for ourselves and found the process to be fair. The EU didn’t. In his latest book, Vijay Prashad reveals that in 2018, former US Ambassador to Venezuela William Brownfield said that the US and others had to accelerate the collapse of Venezuela. We should do it, he said, understanding that it’s going to have an impact on millions of people who are already having great difficulty finding enough to eat. In the midst of a pandemic, one would expect that all countries would work to mitigate the spread of the virus and the impact on human society.

The health, economic and social crisis arising from the pandemic has reinforced the view that multilateral cooperation is not a mere political option. It is a need of peoples at the global level and specifically of the European Union and Latin America, not only in combating the pandemic and in cooperation for access to the vaccine as a fundamental right, but also in building a robust recovery strategy attentive to combating inequalities, social exclusion and a recovery that is based on technological innovation , economic and social, focusing on meeting the sustainable development goals of the 2030 Agenda and which cannot leave anyone behind.

In Latin America, the health, economic and social crisis has increased inequalities, affecting mainly women, the elderly, minorities, indigenous communities and migrants: the caravan in Honduras is only the latest episode. In addition to efforts to strengthen health security and universal health coverage, I consider it important to explicitly mention a social partnership focused on combating inequalities and protecting human rights, with a specific appendix on gender differences and autonomy, to stop violence and feminicides.

European companies have invested in Latin America more than In China, Japan, Russia and India together. We need to move forward with the agreements and, in particular, in the Association Agreement with Mercosur, which is not a mere trade treaty, because it has a strategic geopolitical dimension. In the face of tension between the United States and China, this Agreement is key to preventing us from being placed in a subaltern position. Let us do our best to ratify it from this Parliament with additional environmental guarantees, in the style of the democratic clause introduced in 1991 on the initiative of Argentina, considering this clause as an essential element in line with the Green Pact, which is perfectly compatible.

I see that everybody is eager, is willing to increase our relationship with Latin America. Good. We will have opportunities to demonstrate that we really want to do it. The whole region is in a very difficult situation. They are facing the worst recession of their history, and in Central America, especially, you know the drama of migration – we see that on the TV screens. The violence, inequalities, bad governance in some countries would require a stronger engagement from our side. This is the moment to show real solidarity and work together, to join forces and promote green, digital, and fair transformation. Green and digital is not enough. We have to add also that the transformation has to be fair and look for more social and environmental justice. And from our side, we cannot become the geopolitical power we claim every day that we are or we want to be without a strong presence in Latin America and the Caribbean. If we do not reinforce our relation with the regions, others will do so – they are doing so. And if we don’t agree on reinforcing our ties with these Association Agreements that are on the table, others will do. I am not sure the result would be better from any point of view: no digital, no environmental, no climate, no justice, no better governance. So let’s seize this opportunity; let’s have a look at the situation of these agreements. Two of them are almost finished, one of them practically finished: Mexico. I hope it will be presented to the Parliament in the second quarter of this year at the latest. The Chile agreement should also be ready to be ratified – approved first, because it’s still not approved – at the level of the Commission. Because Chile is living a political process of writing a constitution, and we should accompany Chile in this very important political process. This country has decided to put aside the constitution inherited from the Pinochet times and write a new one. As a Spaniard, it reminds me of a moment in our history. So we have to accompany Chile on this process; we have to show that they matter for us – and frankly speaking, they will not believe that they matter for us if we say that, okay, we don’t like this agreement, let’s put it in a corner. With Mercosur, maybe things can be more complex, I understand. There are several solutions on the table. The Council and the Commission will have to take a decision about whether to split it in two parts – let’s see what the Parliament can think about it – or to go together with the whole package, complementing it with what is needed in order to ensure a better protection of the environment.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have severe economic, social and political consequences. It also had and has geopolitical consequences, and they will inevitably affect key aspects of the European Union’s Common Foreign and Security Policy. The last year has reminded us that the European security environment is today more volatile, more unpredictable, more complex and more ambiguous than at any time since the end of the Cold War. Potential threats have become reality, and in the wake of a global pandemic, democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms are deteriorating in many parts of the world. Disinformation campaigns and cyber-attacks have increased, isolationist trends and competition between major international actors are on the rise. Let me underline three main findings of my annual Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) report. Firstly, the European Union should position itself as a partner of choice in a changing geopolitical order. We are living in a weakened global system where multilateralism is being heavily attacked. It is essential to quickly adopt and adjust our European response to this new geopolitical reality. The European Union is a partner of choice for third parties guided by the promotion of democracy and the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. We are a reliable actor and mediator in conflict resolution, but also a leader in promoting multilateral frameworks. However, too often, the European Union was and is divided, lacking the necessary weight and credibility to have a decisive impact on the geopolitical developments. A second point: a new level of ambition is required to shape the CFSP. What the European Union needs, first and foremost, is a genuine political will from all Member States to jointly push our common foreign policy goals and counter third countries’ attempts to divide us.  There is still a large untapped potential in combining and integrating all strands of the European Union’s external actions, hard power and soft power to achieve our common goals. And thirdly, concrete steps are necessary to strengthen the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy and thereby our global influence. We need to consolidate our strategic alliances with like-minded partners across the world, and also diversify our cooperation on an ad hoc basis. We need to reinforce our strategic sovereignty and need a common understanding of what this actually means. We need a quicker and more effective decision-making process.  This means, for example, as often discussed in this plenary, to move from a unanimity to qualified—majority voting at least in selected areas of CFSP or to consider additional formats to improve our external actions such as a European Security Council. On our common security and defence policy, we need to strengthen the capacity at EU and also at Member State level to establish a fully-fledged defence union.  Finally, the Common Foreign and Security Policy and our external actions as a whole require appropriate financial resources. In this regard, I welcome the breakthrough in the trilogue concerning the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument to name just one. All financial instruments including the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) III and others need to be finalised and become operative soon. Dear colleagues, to conclude, no single EU Member State can respond effectively to today’s global challenges on its own. We must continue to strengthen our Common Foreign and Security Policy, we must continue to reinforce our global influence and we must continue to enhance our capacity to act. I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for the good, constructive and fruitful cooperation on finalising this document and, dear High Representative Vice-President, let me also thank you personally and your team for the helpful support in writing down all these parts of this report. ", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 220, "date": "2021-01-19.json", "name": "Sven Mikser", "mepid": "197497", "text": "  rapporteur. – Madam President, in addition to the CFSP report and the human rights report, at this plenary session we are also debating and voting on the report on the implementation of the common security and defence policy (CSDP).  I believe that every pro-European group in this Parliament shares the position that the Union must play a major role as a provider of sustainable peace and stability on the European continent and its immediate neighbourhood, as well as beyond, and that we should be a strong promoter and defender of rules—based multilateralism on the global stage. The Union’s ability to deliver on these fronts depends on a variety of different factors, but it is inevitable that, in order for our diplomatic, political and humanitarian efforts to bear fruit, we must also be a strong, capable and credible player in the area of defence and security. This involves a greater strategic autonomy and an increased ability to plan and conduct operations without having to rely on external assistance regarding critical enablers and capabilities.  But, before getting to the capabilities and strategic autonomy, let me first say a few words regarding the ongoing CSDP missions and operations. While the report obviously goes into greater detail regarding individual missions, I would like to share some more general remarks.  First, in order for our civilian and military CSDP missions and operations to be successful and achieve the long-term goals of producing sustainable stability, it is of paramount importance that they be properly resourced. Therefore, let me repeat the call on all the Member States to contribute all necessary forces and assets to those CSDP missions. Let me also stress the importance of a conflict—sensitive and people-centric approach, which puts human security at the core of our engagement. This should go hand in hand with an effective strategic communication strategy that prevents the spread of misinformation and provides adequate and accurate information about our operational goals, as well as broader policy objectives.  In several theatres where we are currently engaged, other external actors are also operating. Some of them do not share our goals and our value system and in some instances they are actively trying to subvert our efforts. If we want our achievements to be sustainable and if we do not want to see other potentially hostile parties reaping the benefits of our sacrifices, we must also work towards the implementation of the future European peace facility. Needless to say, this has to be done with all the necessary safeguards in place.  Similarly to every other policy area and undertaking of this past year, the CSDP missions and operations have also been directly affected by the COVID pandemic, which has exposed a number of our vulnerabilities. The lessons learned here must be thoroughly analysed and all the shortcomings must be swiftly addressed. Let me now move to the issue of European defence capabilities. I sincerely believe that if we want to achieve strategic autonomy in the area of defence and security, if we truly aspire to technological sovereignty and if we want our defence industries to be competitive, we must also be serious about the need to invest in defence—led research and technology and to address the existing capability shortfalls. We need to enhance the coherence and consistency of the EU’s defence planning and development tools – the European defence fund (EDF), the European defence industrial development programme (EDIDP), permanent structured cooperation (PESCO), the coordinated annual review on defence (CARD) – and we must properly resource capability development initiatives. A failure to do so from the Union’s long-term budget is not only regrettable, but it will directly and negatively impact our ability to achieve the ambitions we have set for ourselves.  All the Member States operate on the principle of a single set of forces so, even with the best cooperative efforts, our collective capability continues to be, to a large extent, the sum of our national capabilities and therefore I believe it’s also imperative that individual Member States honour their commitments regarding the defence expenditure. Let me stress that a more autonomous European defence capability will in no way be in contradiction with our goal of strengthening our cooperation with other organisations, notably NATO. The EU’s quest for greater strategic autonomy is fully compatible with the aim of strengthening EU—NATO cooperation and the transatlantic relationship.  In addition to our traditional or, if you wish, conventional, capabilities, I would also like to underscore the need to strengthen the European Union’s collective resilience to hybrid and cyber threats. This call has a particular urgency since hybrid and cyber operations are increasingly used by our adversaries, both to interfere with the democratic processes in our Member States, as well as in our partner countries, and they are also used to undermine our missions and operations abroad. Finally, another growing threat to stability and security in the world, including on the European continent, is the gradual weakening and erosion of the global arms control architecture. The non—compliance by certain parties with the existing treaties or the collapsing of those treaties altogether increases unpredictability in the European area and the likelihood of a sudden escalation of tensions and conflicts.  To conclude, I would like to express my thanks to the shadow rapporteurs for their contributions to this report and for the constructive spirit in which all the compromise amendments of the final text were negotiated.

Without this, it would not have been possible to produce such a comprehensive and balanced report.  The fact that this is the annual report does not transform it and can not be transformed into a mere ritual. It is a document expected by many around the world who see their rights violated and so often denied and look to the European Union in anticipation of a sign of encouragement.  Throughout this report, comparing it with previous ones, we found that improvements are slow and challenges are increasingly complex. The global threat to democracy and the rule of law, resulting from the combination of factors such as the rise of authoritarianism and populism, the rise of inequalities and poverty, the restricting of the space of civil society, the malevolent use of information technologies and political interference by external actors, call us at every moment. Framework in which the European Union is called for action increasingly aimed at strengthening democratic institutions and transparent and credible electoral processes, combating inequalities and supporting civil society organisations. The fight against climate change and the protection of the environment and human rights are increasingly intertwined and require a multilateralism-based response. Attacks on human rights defenders, environmentalists, indigenous peoples, journalists, political opponents and minorities remain a constant. Putting an end to them and combating the impunity enjoyed by perpetrators of human rights violations requires the convergence of states, not only in the adoption of firm conclusions by foreign affairs, but also in firm and assertive action. Setbacks in gender equality, health and sexual and reproductive rights in various parts of the globe cannot count on our complacency, such as stigmatisation and persecution of LGBTI people. Child health and education, the eradication of child labour and the fight against all kinds of abuses against children remain battles that do not allow truce. The need to respond to the tragedy experienced by migrants and refugees imposes a determined, supportive and sustainable action, aligned with the Pact for Migration. The rise in international tensions and the effect of the activity of non-state armed groups and terrorist organisations on the growth of violence are sources of serious human rights abuses and require an increasing effort in cooperation for peace and development. In addition to overcoming these many other challenges, it is imperative to put human rights and democracy and the rule of law at the heart of our foreign policy and at the heart of European policies. This implies using all the instruments at our disposal, systematically introducing human rights clauses in all international union agreements, with particular attention to trade and association, making the implementation of the Action Plan for Democracy and Human Rights 2020-2024 an open and participatory task, promoting consultation and structured dialogue with civil society and Parliament , assume the uncompromising defence of multilateralism and un reform and support the International Criminal Court, to expose the effectiveness of our foreign policy through qualified majority voting in the Council on human rights matters, to move forward with the establishment of a necessary urgency mechanism that will move products and raw materials away from our supply chains, which are in violation of human rights , among others. The exceptionality of the pandemic moment experienced between the reference time of this report and its presentation made it not unscathed to the subject. We welcome the response to COVID-19 by states that have made the right to life and health their priority, but we cannot but express our concern that in some countries COVID-19 has led to the decline of the standards of democracy and human rights.  This crisis cannot be used to consolidate authoritarian powers or weaken the rule of law and all pandemic response measures must be based on human rights, non-discrimination in any person.  But in our face to face the future, it is important not to give in to the density of this whole picture and grasp the signs of hope. The new global mechanism of sanctions for human rights violations, which have been claimed for a long time in this Parliament, represents a milestone in the fight against impunity and here I extend a greeting to the High Representative for his role in this matter.  Despite the persistent tendency to compressure the civil society area, seeing citizens, especially young people, mobilise around political and social causes, in demanding more and better responses in combating climate change, in the defence of democracy and human rights, shows us that another one is possible tomorrow. The requirement of the present time does not allow our resignation. It's time to act.

Three reports, Article 36 TEU: common foreign and security policy; common security and defence policy; and Human Rights. I wish we could have several differentiated strategic debates to discuss all the interesting points you have raised, but how do we do that? We have a very limited time for three reports, so allow me to cover the most important aspects of them. First, all reports stress that this year – 2020 – the pandemic has accelerated political trends and revealed a weakness in global governance and also in European governance. Facing the COVID—19 challenge has been very challenging, but I think we can be proud that we not only stuck together but grew together, and now our bloc is a more cohesive one. We have been fighting for multilateralism – the rules—based order for global solidarity – as the only sustainable way out of the crisis, when others have been pushing to narrow nationalist agendas. I hope in 2021 multilateral cooperation will make a strong comeback and, at the same time, I hope that we will pursue our open strategic autonomy and apply the concept in concrete ways, to stop discussing about theology and going to practicalities. In everything we do, we will continue to defend our values of freedom, democracy, rule of law, human rights, as your reports have underlined. I cannot agree more on that. On the geographical front – you will understand it is impossible to cover everything; let’s go to the telegraphic style: USA, transatlantic partnership, we have been talking a lot about it; ask tomorrow. The Biden administration, I hope, will be finishing with governing by tweeting and offering another approach and to try to make multilateralism great again. It will require closer cooperation between the EU and the US, at least on three areas: climate change, Iran nuclear deal, and regulating big technological platforms, among others. And Latin America, we have just talked about it. Africa remains a top priority for us. COVID shapes our agenda. We had to postpone the African Union summit: we are still waiting for it. We have been supporting Africa. We need to do more together. Debt relief initiative, very much important. Our relationship with Africa is such a strategic one that we should invest much more on getting an equal partnership. When you see the demographic imbalance between Africa and Europe, one has to ask every day that we should engage more with them, otherwise we will pay the price. On Asia, we have to work with like—minded partners. We have upgraded our relation with ASEAN to the level of a strategic partnership, and we are proud of it – I think it’s a good achievement. We overcame the difficulties related with palm oil, and now we are on the way to becoming a strategic partner with these countries. This is going to give us a solid basis to improve our influence in a region where there is a growing demand for a growing EU presence. China: maintain both a principled and pragmatic approach. We have signed a comprehensive agreement on investment. It shows our effort to address economic imbalances and improve our access to the Chinese market. I’m sure there will be a very lively debate in this Parliament about this agreement. But keep in mind, you have to engage with China. We cannot expect China to stop being China before engaging with China on challenges such as climate, Covid and debt relief. No one can talk about debt relief today in the world without taking into account the fact that China has become the biggest creditor of the emerging countries. And at the same time we must stay firm on defending human rights in Hong Kong: that’s clear. On the wider neighbourhood – Western Balkans, Eastern Mediterranean, North Africa and the Sahel – there, Belarus has been remaining the most important actor on our agenda. Russia and Turkey, you make a particular mention of these countries: yes, they play a key and often complicated role – we have been talking about that with respect to Russia. Tomorrow I will have a long meeting with the Foreign Affairs Minister of Turkey. We are going to engage on trying to look for a better understanding. The leaders of the European Union Council send a clear signal of willingness to engage with Turkey on a better neighbourhood but, as with the tango, you need to be two to be good neighbours. We will try. And it seems that the ambiance is much better than in the last summer. Let’s hope that my meeting with Minister Çavuşoğlu will be at least longer than the one I had in Malta during the month of August, which lasted no more than one hour. So let’s see if we can change the dynamics. I’m sure we will. UK: the new trade and cooperation agreement to be ratified by this House will provide the basis for a new start, and then we’ll have to deal with our friends and neighbours as a third country to the European Union. Let’s go to the horizontal issues, or let’s go to the issues that go beyond the geographical approaches. The first one is disinformation. More and more, disinformation plays a crucial role. Disinformation has always existed. In Spain, before we talked about fake news we were saying bulos: something that is not true, and everybody tells it, and at the end everybody believes it and it changes mentalities and changes the perception. They have always existed. Now the problem today is the incredible power that the social networks give to disinformation: the amplification of any bulo, of any fake news. And if people believe that the election has been stolen from them: do they believe it, true or not? Well, it doesn’t matter, they believe it and they act accordingly with it. And the assault on the Capitol is a good example of this combination of disinformation plus the power of the social networks on disseminating it. I would like to stress the importance of the StratCom in the European External Action Service to fight disinformation and the support that this Parliament has given to the StratCom services. I think that in cooperation with Member States, we have to do more and to counter any threat, especially to the elections interference. On security and defence: I would like to commend our colleagues in our 17 missions and operations for delivering on their mandates in this difficult situation. I also appreciate a lot your support. You have helped navigate this common foreign and security policy budget to a safe harbour during 2020 as well as the multiannual financial framework. Particularly important is the political agreement reached on the European Peace Facility: 5 billions, 7 years, for sure it will make our CFDP more effective and respond better to our partners’ needs. Operation Irini deserves a special mention. It has made an important contribution to improving security in the Mediterranean. And Atalanta? And if we want to be a global maritime security actor or provider, we have to expand the mandate of Atalanta and to introduce this idea of the coordinated maritime presences. Member States always have a warship somewhere. Not all of them at the same time in the same place, but look at any geographical position and you will find that, a certain amount of the time, there are some warships from some Member States. Why don’t we coordinate their presence and make all of them together an EU presence through coordinating the presences of the Member States? We are going to launch our first pilot initiative in the Gulf of Guinea next week. Also, we launch a new civilian mission in the Central African Republic, a country in a very difficult situation, complementing the existing military mission. Our partnership in nature remains strong, but we need to strengthen our role in security and defence. It is not one thing or the other; it is not one thing against the other; it is not more of one and less of the other – they are complementarities. And now we are building on a threat analysis conducted for the first time at European Union level: the so—called Strategic Compass. And I think this is going to be very important to define which are the challenges that we are going to face in all critical domains. I think that this is complementary also of other reports, like the first strategic review of the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) that has been focusing on how the Member States have been fulfilling their commitment. There are 26 out of 46 PESCO projects that will deliver results by 2025, but I think that the PESCO project has to be much more operational: less focusing on capabilities and more on operability. Finally, the area of human rights. I think there is one achievement that I have to mention: the EU global human rights sanctions regime. Your support was vital. Remember that we launched this initiative in December 2019 in the first foreign affairs meeting that I had the honour to chair, and now I am expecting the first proposal for listing to come from Member States. It is a tool and it has to be used. If you keep the tool in the toolbox, it is useless, so let’s wait and see if the Member States have the will, once they agreed in the Council by unanimity to use it. In tangible terms, through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, we have supported nearly 45 000 human rights defenders in the last five years. Well, this is a figure to take into consideration. When people say: what are you doing? What do you do?, please give this kind of answers. We have been supporting financially 45 000 human rights defenders during the last five years, and we remain particularly committed to women’s and girls’ human rights, as reflected in our Gender Action Plan. Dear Members, I would like to talk a lot about other things in our foreign and security policies. We have to work more on the security side of this policy; we have to work more in order to make human rights taken seriously by third countries. And there are also some successes – we should not be hiding our successes, we should be proud of what we have achieved. Mongolia and Pakistan agreed to conduct a child labour survey; in Sri Lanka child labour has been down from 16% to 1%, through the pioneering child labour—free zones. In Bolivia the minimum age to work has been raised to 14 years. Fourteen is still too low for us, for our standards – it is still too low, but it was even lower. Through the implementation of the third Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy, we will increase our resilience even more. We have approved the European Democracy Action Plan. We have a lot of plans and a lot of strategies, but the important thing is at the end, how do you implement it? You should be more attentive to the implementation than to the drafting. The important thing is action. Yes, I know we have to have a plan, have to have a strategy, but this is just a starting point. What really matters is what comes later. And a funny thing; people, the media, even the parliamentarians pay more attention to the plans than to the implementation of the plans. And I think it would be much better to have the debate not about the plans but about how they have been implemented, because these are the real things that matter. Thank you for your work, and especially to the ones who have been participating as chief observer on electoral observation missions. The last three were Guyana, Peru and Ghana. I’m sorry, this year has been a very meagre year from the point of view of electoral observation missions – it’s one of the effects of the virus, sorry. I know that the parliamentarians are very much involved in that and are eager to participate in these missions – it is an important part of our external action. I hope that we will be able to do more in 2021, even if the prospects for the time being are quite dire. We have done a lot, and for sure, we will do more. This year will be a year of recovery, hope and delivery. We have demonstrated the added value of the European Union in 2020. I think the Union is more cohesive. It is much more difficult to doubt about the utility of the European Union after the pandemic because of the answer of the European Union. And if you compare with the answer that we gave to the euro crisis is still more, has been impressive, both internally and externally, be it on the pandemic or in the wider set of challenges that we are facing.

Madam President, Mr High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, let me first have a thought for the five French soldiers who have died in recent weeks in Mali, killed in operation. They remind us that our debates are not just about disembodied subjects, but that, in operational theatres, today young Europeans are dying for our safety. On the annual report of the PSDC, I would like to welcome and thank our colleague Mikser, with whom we have cooperated well, and I would like to raise two particular points. Our debate comes on the eve of the inauguration of the new American President and we see how strong the temptation is here in Brussels, in our House, to consider that the end of the Trump presidency closes a bad bracket and allows a return to the comfort of before, if ever, to the comfort of american protection all over the place and the slightest European effort.  I think it would be a profound mistake to approach future years in this way. The desirable improvement of transatlantic relations cannot absolve Europeans of their responsibilities, for their own security and also to be reliable allies in an increasingly unpredictable world. This is called strategic autonomy. I know that the term is a matter of debate, but I believe that this ambition should not be abandoned. The second point I wanted to make is about our missions of the common security and defence policy. Recent developments on our southern flank, and particularly in Africa, illustrate the fragility of our commitments. In the Sahel, Somalia and Central African Republic, our European missions and operations are increasingly overwhelmed by the activism of new actors who have none of our legal, political, moral and material constraints.  Our models based on training and advice have their virtues, but they are not decisive, so we will have to think quickly about the formats and objectives of our missions and operations to be effective, because if we want a more effective and relevant PSDC in this unstable world in the future, our Member States must be more voluntary and robust.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 224, "date": "2021-01-19.json", "name": "Kati Piri", "mepid": "37229", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Madam President, let me first of all thank Isabel Santos for her excellent report.  The deterioration of the human rights situation around the world is rapid and severe.

They are trying to rewrite the rules. Autocrats have launched the most comprehensive attack on the human rights system in decades and these regimes do not have any red lines. China’s atrocious crime against the humanity of the Uighurs is a clear demonstration of that, and what is more, many blatantly use the cover of today’s pandemic to undermine the rule of law, weaken democracy and trample on fundamental rights, and the freedom of expression was the first to suffer the consequences. For instance in Morocco we saw a further clamping down on any journalist reporting on the Hirak movement and when the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called for the release of political prisoners to protect them from the virus, these autocrats flatly refused. And Turkey’s unwillingness to release Osman Kavala and opposition leader Selahattin Demirtaş is just one reprehensible example. I sincerely hope the High Representative will raise these two issues in his meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister tomorrow.  What is more, autocrats are stepping up their disregard for international law, with Putin first trying to assassinate Navalny and then arresting him on political grounds the moment he returned.

The European Union prefers postures to realistic action, it appreciates sanctions rather than diplomacy, it has a big voice but small arms. What have we done this year? We talked about the accession of Albania and Macedonia when Turkey was multiplying provocations and interference in the Balkans. We talked about Alexei Navalny when war broke out between Armenia and Azerbaijan, both members of the Eastern Partnership. We talked about the events in Belarus, when French soldiers are fighting and sometimes dying alone against Islamists in the Sahel. In short, the European Union has been absent from the major issues, worse, it has fallen into all the traps of international politics. Brussels did not support Greece and France other than with a few speeches when Erdogan multiplied the provocations. Brussels was humiliated by the unilateral withdrawal of the Americans from the Vienna Agreements, Brussels did not say a word when Milo Ukanovic violently suppressed demonstrations for religious freedom in Montenegro. The reality is cruel, everywhere and all the time, the European Union abandons its principles as soon as the Atlantic Alliance demands it. The observation is damning: a hasty enlargement, the submission to NATO in our treaties, the general jealousy against countries that maintain diplomatic and military independence combine their effects to make the European Union an international dwarf. Like the communists in the past, the European Commission responds with the same sentence, we would not be federalist enough, we are still too attached to national sovereignty.

Have we resolved any of the conflicts that surround us: Russian-Ukrainian, Middle Eastern, Syrian, Libyan? Do we have a common position on China and Taiwan? The recently enforced agreement with China shows that it basically represents the interests of only parts of the Union – the richest and largest countries in the Union. The Nord Stream II pipeline is also an icon of lack of solidarity, this solidarity lies at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.

No, it means that the security interests of many EU countries will be marginalised. Human rights are also part of the report.

The minimum is to raise our voice and denounce so that these crimes do not get lost in the shadow of impunity, going so far as to allow crimes to be ignored and their perpetrators covered by anonymity. The issue of impunity is at the heart of our concerns and I would like to welcome the creation of a mechanism to specifically target individuals guilty of serious human rights abuses, our European Magnitsky Act. However, the Council, therefore the Member States, and also the External Action Service must have the courage to implement it quickly, but it is simply our credibility. As for the state of democracy in the world, I personally wanted us to identify the dangers to democracies of restrictions on fundamental rights, which were inevitable, however, during this COVID-19 pandemic. The defence of democracy must always be in mind again and everywhere, even where it seems obvious.

The 2019 report shows that human rights defenders, journalists and media workers were threatened and attacked for their day-to-day work. The civic and democratic space continued to be restricted, the fundamental rights of women and girls were far from being respected, and vulnerable groups were often left behind and exposed to new inequalities. What about the development in 2020, where the pandemic has not only aggravated the already precarious situations of the most vulnerable populations, and I am particularly talking about those imprisoned for defending human rights, Nasrin Sotoudeh for example in Iran, but we have also seen the emergence of authoritarian approaches in the management of this pandemic. While it is true that the European Union remains a key factor in the defence of human rights in the world, its capacity for concrete action has also been weakened on the one hand by the rise of skeptics in the defence of human rights, as the Trump administration has been at the multilateral level, or as are authoritarian regimes such as China. , Belarus, Egypt, Turkey or illiberal democracies such as India, Brazil, Venezuela, and unfortunately the list is long. In this context, I believe it is essential for the Union to wage this battle for the defence of human rights at an international level and to stress that human rights clauses, both in international and bilateral agreements, must be respected. And here I am astonished, Mr Borrell, at the signing of the agreement with China, at the very moment when it violates, I would even say exterminate, a population, that of the Uighurs. Mr Borrell, if Europe is to remain credible on its core values, both in order to defend its model internally and on the international stage, it is important to be consistent and not to apply double standards. As such, I also support multilateral tools such as the International Criminal Court and will also be attentive to the concrete and effective implementation of the action plan as you suggest.  I also thank you for the work you have done on the global instrument to combat violence and human rights violations.

It is necessary to invest in defence capabilities thoughtfully and rationally, without duplicity. Joint investment in new technologies and capacities is therefore necessary. Challenging times, when citizens' needs are multi-man and diverse, require a broader social and political consensus. The epidemic has once again highlighted the need to strengthen the european Union's strategic autonomy, which is impossible without a single strategic culture. It is therefore necessary to strengthen common European operational capacities, as well as to create a single European strategic thought, which will be reflected in the decisions taken in a renewed and democratic decision-making system. This will make EU missions and operations more successful, especially in our immediate neighbourhood, where we are facing increasing aggressive action by regional powers, including through increasingly aggressive cyber attacks and fake news campaigns.

In other things, I cannot support this report in good conscience. I still take the view that the nation state takes precedence. The report's commitment to a global EU strategy, which also provides for militarisation, therefore goes a step too far for me. The strategic compass to which the report also refers sounds harmless at first, but comes dangerously close to an EU military doctrine and is comparable to NATO's strategic approach. I think that the ever-faster pace of efforts to deepen EU-wide defence cooperation and the progressive definition and development of a common defence policy are at least worrying. Also from the point of view of the prerogatives of the nation state, I cannot support qualified majority voting( DQM. And this is a key issue. The European Union does not have the moral or political right to send people to war, and that is really what this is about.

How can the EU put pressure on Egypt for its human rights record, also against Giulio Regeni, when Italy sends more weapons than ever to el-Sisi?

A pro-democracy fight is always an anti-corruption fight, and leaders like Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, Juan Guaidó, Aleksei Navalny or Uighur activists all understand this very well, and they keep telling us over and over again that political oppression is always rooted in a corrupt and repressive state and in a network of cronies tormenting everyday people.

Rather than seeking to build a European defence and security policy, it is the greatness and independence of nations that must concern us here.  I will constantly reaffirm this fundamental doctrine stated by General de Gaulle: the defence of France must be French. A country like France, if it happens to go to war, it must be its war. If it were otherwise, our country would be at odds with everything it has been, since its origins. And what applies to France also applies to other European countries. It is hard to see how they could send their compatriots into operation to risk their lives outside that framework. In fact, they do little, and I think at this moment of the price paid by France, the five French soldiers recently killed in Mali.  The only possible framework for a defence of Europe lies in the sovereignty of each European nation. As such, France must leave NATO's integrated military command, an alliance whose brain death actually noted by Emmanuel Macron no longer masks the use of it by the United States to impose its hegemony - and President-elect Biden's words raise fears of the worst - and also does not repress the violent attacks of Erdogan, who dreams of imposing on our continent the Islamist caliphate he calls for.

But we must look at a profound change that can undermine our efforts: the European is no longer the model for countries in transition, for iliberal regimes and for emerging democracies. Until now, these regimes asked us for time to adapt, but they did not question that we were the model. They now feel much safer building what they call \"their model of democracy\", far from our standards, but always trying to come to an appearance of democratic legitimacy with elections that are not usually free and fair.  This change erodes our ability to influence and weakens us as exporters of democracy.

The crisis caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic and the way countries have responded to it have reduced the sense of economic and legal security, especially in the case of the weakest and most marginalised groups. This has caused a crisis in international relations. In addition, it has seriously undermined activities related to respect for human rights. The crisis caused by the pandemic has prompted many countries to take measures that have restricted civil liberties. There were reasonable doubts as to their necessity, proportionality and non-discriminatory nature. The violation of religious and religious freedoms is particularly worrying. Let us not forget that an important part of human rights is also the rights of national minorities, especially indigenous ones, which cannot be restricted or violated in any way, which unfortunately happens in many countries of the world and in the European Union. The latest European initiative, Minority SafePack, which has been supported by more than one million citizens and actively involved in the Vilnius region, should therefore serve as an example of legal solutions in the area of the protection of the rights of national minorities in Europe and the world.

Again we are here to deal with the situation in Venezuela. This year, this country and its political crisis have occupied a very important part of my work, because of the very serious political and humanitarian crisis it suffers and which, despite our efforts, has not improved.  We have had occasion at previous meetings to discuss, inform you and receive your criticisms and opinions on the diplomatic efforts that the European Union has made to try to facilitate a national consensus. And I say 'national' well, because it was a question of an agreement between Venezuelans so that an election to the National Assembly could be held on 6 December that we could consider homologable. This has not happened and, consequently, the Member States of the European Union in the Council on Foreign Affairs have clearly expressed their rejection of those elections, considering that the way in which they have been held – as in the case of Belarus, the same thing – cannot be accepted and that, consequently, the National Assembly resulting from those elections cannot be regarded as legitimately elected.  The lack of political pluralism and the disqualification of opposition leaders, who ultimately decided not to run for elections—also, on that, last August I had the opportunity to intervene trying to mediate between the opposition and the government, without success—in addition to the lack of participation of the electorate does not allow us to consider the National Assembly constituted last January 5 to be representative of the democratic will, freely expressed, of the people of Venezuela.  The elections did not meet internationally accepted parameters to give credibility to the process and, by two statements on behalf of the European Union, we have made it clear that we cannot recognize either the elections or the legitimacy of the Assembly resulting from it. We will maintain the necessary pressure – calibrated and selective – and dialogue with all actors who are willing to work for the democratic restoration of the country, starting, of course, with Juan Guaidó and the representatives of the outgoing and legitimately elected National Assembly in 2015.  Clearly, the difficulties are great. There's a long way to go. And this failed electoral process has just missed an opportunity that would have been very valuable in achieving the goal of a democratically established political exit to the country's crisis. Now, more than ever, we must help our Venezuelan friends—all Venezuelans—overcome political division, which increasingly proves to be more unproductive and that has taken citizens away from their leaders—as was also demonstrated by a huge abstention—and the Venezuelan opposition's unity of action is critical. We had to demand this unity of action in the months leading up to the election and we will continue to demand an end to threats to the opposition, persistent human rights violations and protection for civil society actors, who work every day to provide tens of thousands of people with services essential to their survival.  According to figures estimated by the International Organization for Migration and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, five million Venezuelans have left the country. But, if the trend continues, by the end of this year it can be more than six million. Mr Maduro's Venezuelan government denies these figures — it decreases them a lot - but I believe that the figures given to us by United Nations agencies deserve credibility and, if they are what they claim to be, we are at the levels of Syria. By the end of this year there may be as many Venezuelan migrants as there have been in Syria for an appalling civil war.  Therefore, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, we must deal with the situation honestly and with the will to find solutions. The solutions will not be exogenous. They will not be achieved with statements, let alone military interventions. Nor will they be forged overnight internally in Venezuela. But if there is one thing we can do from Europe — of course, we can and must do so — it is to support the real protagonists of this tragedy , which are the Venezuelans — by promoting the rapprochement of positions for the call for new elections on the basis that both sides can accept.  And I repeat, the only lasting way out of Venezuela's serious problems will be one that is politically dialogued, inclusive, peaceful, with the participation of all political actors in civil society. I know that's hard; experience has shown us this—and to me personally and directly in an obvious way in this past year. It will require a willingness to dialogue and concessions on the part of all actors. The new American administration can also contribute to this process.  This Parliament knows better than anyone the importance of consensus, and we also know that, in all the political transitions that have taken place in the world, the solution has been agreed. It is essential that positions are approached so that Venezuela does not continue to fall into the vacuum of its crisis.  We're going to convene the International Contact Group. We have not done so so far because of the logistical difficulties involved in the circumstances of COVID in many countries. There has been a position taken by the European Union; another, by the Lima Group.  And finally, and just twenty-four hours after the inauguration of a new government in the United States, let me—apart from reiterating the congratulations to the new president—hope that we can share with the new American Administration—an indispensable partner—efforts to promote this peaceful, dialogued and inclusive solution that Venezuela needs. We will be in contact with the new Administration – as we are with the Norwegian delegation and other political actors – to continue working politically to this end.

It is indisputable that the European Parliament is the voice of the popular will, a directly elected institution of the European Union and the recipient of a mandate of more than four hundred million citizens spread among its 27 Member States, the ultimate expression of sovereign democracy. However, if we are to embody the voice of this popular mandate, we must respect, recognize and empower the legitimate word of citizens who are in these critical circumstances and, in many cases, put at stake their own integrity for freedom.

The Venezuelan opposition is on the right side of history and the European Union must have the courage to choose: we must put an end to ambiguities, we need to promote a strong multilateral diplomatic initiative involving the United Nations, we must support the action of the International Criminal Court to condemn those responsible for crimes against humanity denounced by UN investigators.

I would simply like to point out that the text referred to is not a statement by the high representative. It is an agreement of the 27 Member States. It's very important that we make a difference. When there is no unanimity, the high representative may take responsibility for issuing an opinion that he believes represents the majority; well, it finds that it represents the majority, but not unanimity, and therefore is not a position of the European Union. In the case referred to, about the word outgoing, it is not a statement by the high representative. It is a unanimous statement of the 27 Member States. Let us be true to reality and please do not deform it to support the arguments that everyone wants to make. You may or may not agree, but the important thing is to say things as they are.   It is the 27 Member States that have adopted this communication setting out the position of the Council of the European Union. Of course, Parliament may have another position and the Commission might have another opinion, but you know what the division of competences is in the institutional framework of the European Union, and the competence in foreign policy, today, belongs to the Council. Just as the European Union does not recognise or cease to recognise governments or administrations, because it has no competence for that, it has no competence. And if tomorrow the Foreign Affairs Council unanimously decided whether or not to recognize someone would be a toast to the sun, because it has no competence to do so. And I can say the same about Parliament's resolutions. You can say whatever you want in what you have skills in. When they have no competence, well, it is an interesting opinion, worthy of being taken into consideration by the high representation that this assembly has —you will not tell me, that I have presided over it — but the competences are where they are. And, by the way, it is also not right to say that at European Union level there is a change of heart, because the Council of the European Union never referred to Juan Guaidó, who has all my respects and support, never referred to him as President-in-Office of Venezuela, because there was never unanimity in the Council in this regard. Because there were countries that didn't accept it as such. There was no unanimity and, consequently, what we are going to do to him, the European Union never referred to Mr Guaidó because institutionally he could not do so, there was no unanimity in the Council to do so. Finally, beyond these procedural differences, which are very important—because in democracy procedures and competences count—we will continue to work together to try to resolve Venezuela's political and democratic crisis. That's the goal and it won't be solved by enchanting statements. It won't be solved by saying \"Mr. Maduro, you have to go.\" The problem is that you don't want to go and therefore we have to look for ways that go through the procedures that we can apply. We're against military interventions. We have to find political solutions.

But it is a strategy that will only grow in relevancy, an unavoidable policy framework if the EU really wants to be a valid global actor and the attention on the connectivity strategy is indeed increasing.  If we look back, we can clearly see how much internal connectivity has been at the centre of integration policy success within our EU. Now, in a fast and fundamentally changing world in which we are trying to define the EU’s space, we need to streamline our external relations also along the fundamental ideas of connectivity thinking. Simply said, we will be more successful internationally if we remain open to the world and cooperate wherever we can to promote our values, our interests and global goods, common global goods. Not those who insist on the highest emphasis on autonomy will reach their goals best, but those who are best and most effectively connected.  My report’s aim is to help give a second breath to the EU’s connectivity strategy by expanding it to a global scale, by following a team Europe approach, by tying it strongly to the headline goals of our Union, like the European Green Deal and digital innovation, by having clear and strong priorities and good connectivity governance and by cooperating with willing partners and contributing to connecting the connectivities. It is important to take note of how much others are interested to cooperate with the EU on connectivity, in particular Japan, which has already struck a connectivity deal with the EU, India, that is negotiating on an accord and will put the item on the summit agenda, South Korea or the ASEAN Community, with which we have agreed in a ministerial meeting a common statement on connectivity. The EU connectivity strategy is an offer that will find many takers. Let’s not waste these opportunities. It will also be very important to actively pursue connectivity collaboration with the African Union and its members.  I happily see intensified interest in connectivity on the part of Member States including, for instance, France, Poland and Germany, and in the business community as reflected in Business Europe’s China strategy, published one year ago. So colleagues, let us move forward together to put wheels under this car and use this great tool for implementing our shared promise to live up to our international responsibilities by attaining Weltpolitikfähigkeit as Jean Claude Juncker used to say – the ability to help shape international developments and international progress.  In conclusion, I want to thank all the experts and interlocutors involved, including those from EU partner countries. I want to thank the Members of the Commission that have actively supported connectivity, even though it didn’t make it into the 2021 work programme, the many DGs of the Commission that have supported connectivity as well and also the External Action Service, in particular Ambassador Vlahutin.

On the one hand, it is undoubtedly economically viable and useful for us to maintain transport trade and social relations with our partners in southeast Asia, one of the fastest prosperous economic regions in the world. On the other hand, however, we should not forget that the main actor on the international stage in this Asian region is not another, but the systemic adversary of the European Union, communist China.  The text of the report counts China's name as the most problematic. A major problem for European companies remains access, lack of access to the Chinese market, lack of a level playing field. Given the outspoken cynicism and persistence of the truth of the Communist Party of China as regards the initial spread of the Chinese virus, it is, to put it mildly, astonishing how an investment agreement between the European Union and China came to an end last year, dear Mr. Commissar. Instead of the Communist Party of China being subjected to economic sanctions to make Beijing account for its actions that have devastated the global economy and caused chaos in the markets, we have rewarded this Communist Party. That's, to put it mildly, unwise, I'd say irresponsible. It is right that the Europeans finally understand that, unlike the ASEAN countries and Japan, China cannot be called our friend, but rather our competitor. China is a systematic and motivated competitor, not to say an adversary, not only of the European Union, but of Western civilization in general.

Firstly, principles. I agree we must apply principles vigorously: sustainability in support of a green transition (climate, environmental, social, economic and fiscal), non-discrimination, global rules and a level playing field. A just transition, fundamental rights, security and good governance, full participation of partner countries in global value chains, and achieving sustainable development goals. Connectivity must promote normative excellence and sustainable investment.  Secondly, governance. Yes, we need strong wheels for the car. We also need fuel to finance it. EU and Member State cooperation is crucial. Our reinforced ‘Team Europe’ approach has proven its value already. As you have pointed out, the role of the private sector and civil society is also key. Global connectivity needs are massive: EUR 67 trillion of investment by 2040, as reckoned by the G20 global infrastructure hub. To meet these, the whole planet must make smart use of scarce resources.  Thirdly, we need to set clear priorities. Global changes since the strategy launch in 2018 must be taken into account. COVID-19 exposes opportunities, but also vulnerabilities, growing inter—dependence. I agree with the seven priorities identified: green transformation, transport, digitisation – this is very important as digital connectivity touches all our lives now – people-to-people contact, trade and international standardisation, health, and security.  We must continue to translate priorities into action. We must show rather than just tell. We will mainstream connectivity within the multiannual financial framework programming between 2021 and 2027. We will help to deliver the EU’s core strategic priorities, such as the Green Deal and the Digital Agenda.  The EU has already mobilised over EUR 10 billion for connectivity investments in Africa, and EUR 1.6 billion in Asia and the Pacific from 2016 to 2019. Moreover, connectivity is already a key pillar of our engagement with the Western Balkans. Success has made it more visible.  Fourthly, partnership for connectivity. I agree we must work harder to implement the EU-Japan connectivity partnership of 2019. We’re engaging with India and the ASEAN. Australia and the Republic of Korea reach out to us. We must work with our sister continent Africa and, as of tomorrow, we can work with the incoming US administration. Despite challenges, we should continue engaging with China, notably within the EU-China Connectivity Platform, always based on our norms and standards, principles and values. Lastly, global scope. The current strategy spanning an arc from Lisbon to Tokyo must guide actions at the global level. I fully agree to address connectivity globally as part of our priorities. Actions support our global aims. The Europe-Latin America BELLA cable project, for example, presents commercial, developmental and strategic opportunities for our two continents and will be launched under the Portuguese Presidency. It makes sense to develop more such initiatives under a coherent global connectivity brand.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 306, "date": "2021-01-19.json", "name": "Andor Deli", "mepid": "124714", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, first, as the shadow of the PPE Group, let me thank the rapporteur, Mr Bütikofer, for his openness during our work. I am convinced that with this report we have managed to prepare a pretty solid overview of the present situation. We have also provided points showing the way forward, with the European Strategic Planning and connectivity concerning Asia and even beyond. But looking at its Annual Work Programme, it seems that the Commission does not plan to tackle this topic, although there are plenty of reasons to do so. If you look at the data, the EU is handing out the most grants in the world, yet it seems that our global influence is shrinking. In the meantime, our partners – and also our rivals – are doing the same work much more efficiently, achieving higher visibility for a lot less money. Therefore the EU, and Europe as a whole, needs new strategic thinking and planning. We need greater synergy and better governance. We need a more focused and streamlined governance within the EU institutional framework, and we also need enhanced coordination between the EU and our Member States. Instead of sulking and criticising, we should take action and start being proactive and more assertive. I remember that in the 90s, Europe was a clear economic leader, while Asian countries were mocked for being copycats. Now, 20 years later, I think that we should get off our moral high horse, forget about the good old days, and start diligently to copy the best practices that are lying around us and adapt them to our goals and needs in order to stop the sidelining and backsliding of Europe in this global strategic game.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 307, "date": "2021-01-19.json", "name": "Juozas Olekas", "mepid": "197838", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, mr President, I would like to – (DE) Mr President, dear colleagues, the European Union has the means and levers to pursue its own development, economic, scientific cooperation and other policies towards foreign partners. However, it is still often common to see that these different instruments are not sufficiently coordinated. I therefore very much welcome the report on closer links we are discussing today and the EU-Asia relationship. In the future, the strategy for closer relations should become a strategy that covers different areas of cooperation and coordinates everything. The report we are debating today draws clearer guidelines for the European Union's cooperation with our Partners in Asia. However, it is equally important that it can serve as an example of european union cooperation with other regions of the world. This should be a mutually beneficial cooperation based on mutual respect, promoting a sustainable fiscal, economic, social and environmental link. The transfer of both best practices and standards is equally important. I firmly believe that greater EU involvement, the transfer of best practices and stricter standards, such as those in Central Asian countries, can have a rapid, positive and clearly visible impact. The need for infrastructure investment in Eurasia is enormous. It would therefore be best for the EU to not compete, but complement, in the future with the EU's closer interfaces and China's Belt and Road initiatives. I believe that the strategy for closer links between the EU and Asia can also have a positive impact on china's Belt and Road initiative by promoting high standards and sustainability requirements.

Indeed, I want to start by saying that connectivity is a key priority in the European Union’s work as a global actor. Asia is the biggest trade partner of the EU, and there is no doubt that we need an effective and sustainable strategy, including on connectivity, which is of economic as well as geopolitical importance. The European Union and Asia account for 70% of the global population and 60% of the word’s GDP, with large parts of potential between both regions untapped due to a lack of physical and digital infrastructure. Europe already has good examples of connectivity partnership with Japan, for example, and we should build on this and establish more such partnerships with other Asian countries. Of course, the EU connectivity strategy must be based on the EU’s fundamental values and should serve the goals of our key policies, such as the European Green Deal, the digital transformation and the global promotion of human rights.

But the other major flaw of this report is that it is a prisoner of a free-trade ideology that is not relevant in Asia. We see that China is expanding outside, not because it wants to participate in globalization, but because it simply wants to take advantage of it. We can see that Vietnam is happy to have an agreement with the European Union, not to improve its labour law, but to win contracts. We can see that the European Union is making use of human rights in the region. Indeed, why impose sanctions on Cambodia, while drawing a line under the defence of human rights among its neighbours? Moreover, the subject of the Silk Road is poorly addressed. This great project is an obvious sign of the emergence of a multipolar world. Relations with China as well as with Russia cannot ignore this development. Our relations with the Central Asian republics, including Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, cannot ignore this change either. The European Union should serve the interests of the Member States by speeding up its relations with project owners. Yes, therefore, to progress in our connectivity with Asia, yes to independent and autonomous relations from the Atlanticist point of view with this part of the world, but not to a relationship that does not approach them from a realistic point of view.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 310, "date": "2021-01-19.json", "name": "Alviina Alametsä", "mepid": "204335", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, human rights and the climate crisis cannot be forgotten in the context of EU—Asia cooperation. Over a million Uighur people are held in concentration camp—like conditions in China and face torture, fear, forced labour and sexual abuse. The EU must do everything in its power to end this crime against humanity.  This report on EU—Asia connectivity importantly calls for respect for human rights in all connectivity initiatives. I hope that this report can support the EU commitment to human rights in practice. For instance, transportation infrastructure should never be built with forced labour or without respect for minority rights. No cooperation should take place between the EU and actors involved in such violations.

We cannot ignore the opportunities for cooperation offered by the strategy between the European Union and Asia.  The pandemic has given us the importance of coordinated responses and cooperation between countries. This proposal promotes connectivity as a principle that seeks such cooperation. The European Union must look to Asia not as a systemic rival, but to find ways for systemic cooperation. For this, sovereignty, inclusivity, human rights, climate action, sustainability... they must go through this strategy.  But there is another axis that is essential: social justice. We welcome the inclusion of the objectives of the 2030 Agenda and that human rights defenders have been included in its development. Digitization and infrastructure improvement are a vector of development, but they can also lead to growth in inequality and economic and social digital divide. We don't want two-speed connectivity.

We are constantly talking about economic cooperation between Europe and Asia and, in particular, its enormous potential, but in practice we still lack the necessary infrastructure connectivity. Asia will dominate this world, whether we want it or not. But we, as the European Union, must strive to develop strategic connectivity with Asia, where it is not just Japan, China or Korea. As the COVID-19 pandemic also underlines, and even more so the need to unite in the fight against climate change, we need a real strategy that will enable us to link this link with Asia. Only in this way will our partners and competitors see a strong actor in the European Union. We need to invest a lot of effort in connecting physical and digital infrastructure, transport networks, but also in health and global safety. But in order for this not only to end with words, we must also spend adequate financial resources. Nor can we forget Russia or Turkey, which we tend to criticise for a number of reasons, because they, too, want to become important players in the Euro-Asian interconnect.

Greater connectivity brings with it a natural trade facilitation and thus creates opportunities for greater access to their respective markets, including procurement and investment, and dialogue on specific issues such as subsidies and the defence of intellectual property rights as a means of preventing counterfeit goods from entering the single market.
