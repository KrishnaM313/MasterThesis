We take note of this vote, although not without regret, and respect it because it is an expression of the will of the majority of the political forces present in the House of Commons. However, this vote must be read correctly, we do not escape the fact that these various forces voted against the agreement, but for diametrically opposed reasons, some concerned about the 'Brexit backstop', others calling for a closer relationship with the European Union in the future, for example through continued customs union. I think it is too early to assess the consequences of this vote, but we are certainly not yet in a 'no deal' scenario, moreover, at Westminster, there is not even a majority in favour of this hypothesis. We understand, in fact, that there are two negative majorities in the British Parliament, one against the agreement and the other against the possibility of an exit from the Union without agreement, but there is no positive majority. We therefore hope that work will begin on building a majority in favour of a shared solution as soon as possible, and we look forward to knowing how the British Government intends to proceed. We, for our part, are ready to be ambitious about our future relationship with the United Kingdom, if the British Government also wants to be ambitious and decides to change the 'red lines' that it had imposed itself. The European Parliament has full confidence in the negotiator, Michel Barnier, who conducted the negotiations with the United Kingdom with moderation, intelligence and wisdom. If it is not possible to be more ambitious, we will be faced with a no-deal exit, but one that would have negative effects in every respect for everyone. We will certainly have to continue our preparations to deal with a no-deal exit scenario, thinking, as I think is right and this is the line of the European Parliament, first and foremost the citizens of the European Union living in the United Kingdom, and the British people who live on the continent. Citizens who, more than anyone else, suffer from uncertainty and who would be the first victims of a disorderly exit.  We must continue to follow the Irish problem closely, we must not leave Ireland alone, we must ensure that the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is a flexible border, but at the same time that the interests of health, agriculture and European agro-industry are guaranteed. We must, of course, continue to maintain, at this juncture, the unity between the Member States and the institutions that we have managed to build during these long and difficult negotiations. Unity that shows that the Union, in difficult situations, exists and is able to have a cohesive political line.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 1, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Presidente. –", "mepid": "2187", "text": "   The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the WITHDRAWAL of the United Kingdom from the EU (2018/2970(SDR)).", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Melania Ciot", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, last November, the European Council endorsed the agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU and Euratom. The European Council also approved the political declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the EU and the UK and restated the Union’s determination to have the closest possible partnership with the UK in the future. This outcome would not have been possible without the sense of unity, shared purpose and responsibility among the EU’s 27 Member States, as well as among the EU institutions.  Today, having just learned the outcome of the meaningful vote in Westminster, we cannot but regret this outcome. This makes a disorderly exit by the UK more likely. Such a scenario will have serious consequences for all of us, but in particular for the UK. Addressing those consequences will no doubt call for the same unity, shared purpose and responsibility among Member States and the EU institutions. Given the many conflicting messages that have been conveyed in the UK before and during the debates leading to the vote, on all sides of the political spectrum, it is hard to single out one particular explanation of this outcome. This outcome is, of course, not the end of the game. While having been clear that renegotiation of the agreement is not on the cards, we should stand ready to act once the UK Government has clarified what this result means for the UK ratification process and what the next steps should be. In the meantime, as repeatedly called for by the European Council in its invitation to the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council to take the necessary steps, we are continuing the ratification process in the EU. In this respect, I am pleased to mention that, last week, the Council adopted its decision on the signing of the agreement and approved its decision on its conclusion, as well as the request for the consent of Parliament. Responsibility for ensuring UK ratification of the deal remains with the UK Government. Our determination to proceed should, however, be of comfort the UK Government in its effort to complete its part of the ratification process. However, the final result, in terms of both timing and content, is far from certain. We therefore have to continue our preparation for all outcomes, including a no—deal scenario. We do not want such a situation, but we will be properly prepared for it if it happens. The preparedness and contingency dimension of Brexit should therefore assume greater importance at EU and national level, building on the solid work already under way. This, of course, means extra legislative work at this late stage of the parliamentary term but we are confident that the European Parliament will rise to the challenge in the interest of all the stakeholders. The Presidency, in any event, is determined, with your cooperation, to facilitate the adoption of the necessary contingency measures in good time.

The Commission regrets the rejection of the Withdrawal Agreement, as the representative of the Council has said, because we do believe this was the best possible outcome in a situation where two parties were negotiating, each looking after its own interest.  The Commission negotiator, Michel Barnier, did a remarkable job negotiating on behalf of the 27, the British Government negotiated on behalf of the United Kingdom, and we do believe the outcome of that negotiation led to a withdrawal agreement which did as little harm as possible.  Nobody should be under any illusion: Brexit does harm. It does harm to the United Kingdom, it does harm to the European Union, and we are under an obligation as politicians to limit the harm to the absolute minimum possible, and we do believe the Withdrawal Agreement delivered on that obligation.  I think it’s not for us to speculate on what sort of Brexit we will have. We will now have to wait for what’s going to happen in the House of Commons in the United Kingdom, for the position of the British Government and the British Parliament, and we will have to take it from there, but, we’re also under an obligation to make sure that we are prepared for any possible outcome, including a disorganised no-deal Brexit, which would have far-reaching consequences both for the United Kingdom and for the European Union, but the Commission will be well prepared to make sure that we react to any possible outcome.  As the representative of the Council said, we will continue our process of ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, since it was agreed with the United Kingdom Government. It is, and remains, in our view, the best possible outcome to ensure an orderly withdrawal.  Let me end with a quote by C. S. Lewis. We ‘can’t go back and change the beginning, but [we] can start where [we] are and change the ending’.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Michel Barnier", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Chief Brexit negotiator. Mr President, honourable Members, Secretary of State, the Commission takes note of the vote in the House of Commons last night. As said by our Commission First Vice—President, Frans Timmermans, the House of Commons voted yesterday with a crystal-clear majority against the Withdrawal Agreement which the European Council agreed with the British Government in November, and which the European Parliament welcomed. Right now, it's too early to assess all the consequences of this vote. We have always respected, and we continue to respect, the democratic parliamentary debate in the UK, and I will not speculate on the various scenarios. What yesterday's vote showed is that the political conditions for the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement are not yet there in London. We profoundly regret this vote, as President Juncker has said, and that regret is obviously also linked to the intense work we have done, not only together with you, honourable Members, with your Brexit Steering Group, for two years, but also with the British Government, on the basis of its 'red lines' and on the realities of leaving the EU. We deeply regret this vote, because we have built this withdrawal agreement together, with the British Government, on an objective basis, taking into account the shared requirements so that there is no border in Ireland, respecting the British wish to preserve the integrity of its customs territory. And together we have developed, with the British Government, the framework for a future relationship that the European Union wants as close and as ambitious as possible - and as close and as ambitious as the British red lines will allow. Ladies and gentlemen, listening to the public statements, we see that the Members of the House of Commons who voted against the agreement negotiated with us did so, as your Chairman pointed out, for very different, very different, sometimes opposing or even contradictory reasons. This vote, objectively, is therefore not the clear manifestation of a positive majority that would define an alternative project to the agreement that is now on the table.  In this context, it is up to the British authorities, as Frans Timmermans said, to assess this vote today or tomorrow, and to the British Government to indicate how it wants to proceed with an orderly withdrawal on 29 March, as the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, recalled last night. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, contrary to what has been said at times in recent weeks or days, the agreement we have reached with the British Government - this almost 600-page agreement - is a good agreement. It is obviously the result of a compromise, but it is the best possible compromise and we have worked on it, again, objectively.  This compromise brings legal certainty wherever Brexit has created uncertainty, like any separation. Security for citizens, British citizens, European citizens of the other 27 Member States, whose rights would be guaranteed in a sustainable way. These rights have always been our priority, have always been your priority here in Parliament, and the protection of these rights will remain our priority in any event. Security for public or private project holders, all beneficiaries of the European budget, whether they are British - there are many of them - or from each of our other 27 Member States. These projects would be preserved through the agreement that is here. Security and stability for Ireland and Northern Ireland, where the return of a hard border would be avoided through a solution that would preserve the integrity, on the one hand, of the United Kingdom and, on the other, of the single market, with respect, to which we have subscribed, to which we have committed, of the Good Friday Agreement or Belfast Agreement. This is also why, ladies and gentlemen, the backstop we have agreed with the UK must remain a credible backstop.  The backstop must be a backstop. It must be credible. Security for businesses and for administrations that would have a transition period, which I would point out that the only legal basis is the withdrawal agreement, during which they would have the time to prepare and adapt. This compromise also gives us, of course, with this transition, the time necessary to negotiate our future relationship on the basis of a political declaration which we have also agreed, on the Union side, with the British Government. This political statement, I recall, leaves the way for different options, while respecting our fundamental principles. Of course, in any event, I would remind you, the ratification of this withdrawal agreement is needed. This is a prerequisite for creating mutual trust between us, in the run-up to the second negotiation, which must be opened as soon as possible, on our future relationship. With regard to this future relationship, which is obviously the most important for the future, and for the future of our continent, I would like to point out that your Parliament and the European Council, unanimously, have always said that if the United Kingdom chooses to evolve its own red lines in the future and that it chooses more ambition to go beyond a simple - which is not insignificant - free trade agreement- , then the European Union will always be immediately ready to accompany this development and respond favourably to it. In referring to this future relationship, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not only talking about the economic relationship, trade, trade, which are so important for growth and employment, I am also talking about all the sectoral cooperation to which your committees are obviously attached: university cooperation and research, in fisheries, a very important sector , in aviation, in transportation, and much more. I am talking about police and judicial cooperation, which we need after Brexit. I am also thinking, of course, of the stability of our continent, of security: the United Kingdom, a great member of the United Nations Security Council, a friendly and allied country, will remain our long-term partner in terms of foreign policy, development, cooperation and defence cooperation. Ladies and gentlemen, we have been working together for 18 months. This collective work has been validated at every key moment by the British Government, by the European Council, by yourself in this European Parliament. As long as a solution is not found to the current British political impasse, as long as an outcome is not clearly identified and supported by a parliamentary majority, we will not be able to move forward. That is why the next steps must now be, as you said, clearly stated by the British Government.  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, an orderly Brexit will remain our top priority in the coming weeks. However, as I speak, no scenario can be ruled out. This is particularly true of the scenario we have always wanted to avoid, that of a no deal: it is 16 January, only ten weeks before the end of March, that is, the time chosen by the British Government for the United Kingdom to become a third country. Today, ten weeks from that moment, the risk of a no deal has never seemed so high. Our resolution remains to avoid such a scenario, but we also have a responsibility to be lucid. That is why, on our side, we will intensify our efforts to be prepared for this eventuality. This work, the European Commission, all its services, the General Secretariat of the Commission, we have been doing it for several months, with the Member States and with you. This work will have to be accelerated in conjunction with all the partners, all the actors who could be called, in a very short time, to adopt emergency measures to deal with the possible consequences of this scenario. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in thanking you for your confidence, I mean our conviction, the one that Frans Timmermans has reminded us, that the compromise we have reached after 18 months with the British Government remains today the best possible compromise. It is the result of constructive work between the two parties throughout this negotiation. It is also the result of a constructive attitude that will remain ours, mine, to the end: calm, unity, dialogue and transparency. It is now up to the British Government to clarify how the Uk wants to proceed to organise the orderly withdrawal it has requested, and how, beyond this orderly withdrawal, it wants to build an ambitious and lasting partnership with us.

First remark: I am proud. I am proud as a European, having in mind the comments after the Brexit vote two and a half years ago that a lot of speculation was on the table, that the European Union would experience a domino effect, that this would follow as the experience is so strong in Great Britain.  Having today’s situation in mind – the 27 Member States are so strongly united, the European Parliament is backing their positions, we know what we want. That the people in Europe feel the strength of unity of being a European Union – our Irish friends especially have this experience. I think we can be proud of what we have achieved in the last month, thanks to Michel Barnier, thanks to his engagement, also to Jean-Claude Juncker. That’s good. (Applause) The second remark I want to make is that 28 governments said ‘yes’ to a Treaty, confirmed the Treaty; three institutions at European level said ‘yes’, that’s a good Treaty, and now one parliament has said ‘no’ with a clear majority.  That means for me that the ball is in the field of our British friends, and not so much on the governmental side, mainly on the parliament side. We have there a camp of hard Brexiteers, we have a camp of those who want to stay in the European Union, we have a camp of Norway—plus, a camp of CETA—plus, whatever; so please tell us, finally, what do you want to achieve? Give us a clear orientation and then Europe is ready to conclude the negotiations in a good way. The third element I want to put on the table is: reflect again on our goals. We have a difficult political situation ahead of us now and we started with clear principles. For example for me, the idea of the single market and especially the idea of freedom of movement – that Europeans on this continent can freely decide where they want to live – is a great achievement of this European Union, and I did and I will defend this principle whatever the outcome of a British vote is and what will be. And we have other elements in mind, for example, the idea of avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland or the question of keeping the rights of citizens strong and alive. That’s why I must say that I don’t see any room for manoeuvre if our British friends want to have renegotiations, and if they have further requests in the negotiations then we have also the right to ask further questions and then we open the whole box – not only the British questions would be on the table if there were to be any kind of renegotiation.  So for me there is at the moment no room for manoeuvre in any renegotiations. And the final statement I want to make is that I am traveling around Europe at the moment, as a candidate like we all do, and I see nobody in the European Union who thinks that the British approach is a clever approach. Nobody is telling me this. People in the European Union tell me more that they see political chaos and the economic uncertainty in the British development. That’s why our main message in the election campaign ahead of us is: don’t follow the nationalists, don’t follow the egoists, they are liars. It’s much better to reform the European Union than to leave or even destroy the European Union.

An overwhelming majority voted against the Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration. This is a historic defeat for the Tory government and Prime Minister Theresa May. We now know what the British Parliament does not want but, 70 days before the exit day, we don’t yet know what they do want. The parliament has also made clear last week that they reject a no—deal scenario. This is welcome because no deal would be the worst outcome for everybody, but especially for the UK. We make clear today, we will not water down the Withdrawal Agreement and put into question the credibility of the backstop. Protecting the peace process in Northern Ireland, avoiding a hard border and safeguarding the integrity of the single market are not up for negotiations. Protecting the rights of EU and UK citizens has been our priority throughout the negotiations and we won’t accept any solution that threatens their rights. The autonomy of the EU legal order, the safeguarding of our social, labour, environmental and taxation standards, the honouring of financial commitments, the balance of rights and obligations, none of these can be put into question. And we will not allow any temptation for bilateral solutions, which will not be beneficial for any of the parts involved. The unity between the institutions and within this Parliament in support of our chief negotiator is, and will remain, our greatest strength. We are united and we support you, Michel. So where do we go from here? We need a positive majority from the UK side, and we need a clear direction and the capacity to deliver. Yesterday’s vote clearly shows that, at the moment, we do not have that. The majority supporting this government may tonight stick together to stay in power, but they have shown they cannot agree and deliver on the most important question facing the country. Either a positive and credible majority on Brexit takes shape in the parliament, or you need to put the question back to the people. We have always been and will be open to a closer relationship if the UK wants to change its red lines. Permanent customs union and the single market were always options on the table. It was the UK Government’s red lines that made them impossible. A more ambitious future relationship would be positive for both sides, and we are ready to engage in it in a constructive way in full respect of our guidelines and red lines. We have always said very clearly that we respect the outcome of the referendum, but we consider Brexit a historic mistake that would leave British people worse off. Article 50 is revocable and if the UK parliament is not able to define a credible way forward, maybe it is the right time for the people to have their say with new elections or a new referendum. Our group is clear that, if an extension of Article 50 is needed to provide the necessary time for any of these options, then we would not object. But any extension must be for a clear reason and not just to waste more time. Brexit is at a deadlock, the ball is now in the UK’s court. It must show responsible leadership and a clear vision, which are needed to open new perspectives and charter its way out of these difficult waters. We will remain constructive and reliable partners working for the interests of the European citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Syed Kamall", "mepid": "33569", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, Mr Barnier, Mr Timmermans and Minister. I would first of all like to start by thanking both Mr Barnier and Mr Timmermans for their measured speeches this morning. I thought they were very fair, and people can’t really have much to complain about.  Let me speak today, as someone who has observed the debate about the UK’s membership of the EU from both sides of the Channel over the last few years, as someone who has regularly spoken to individuals on both sides of the negotiating table and at times suggested solutions to unlock some of those difficult issues, and as the leader of the ECR Group, that not only tells you what we are against, but offers alternative solutions.  Since becoming an MEP, one of the things that has struck me about the UK-EU relationship has been the gap in perceptions between both sides of the Channel. Many in this House believe strongly in the post-war 1950s model of political integration, while for the last 40 years in the UK, the political class has often sold the EU more as a trade area, often neglecting to mention or downplaying the goal of political integration.  The fact that politics is often about perception is equally true when looking at the withdrawal agreement. On this side of the Channel, the EU has been very clear – while they would not seek to punish the UK for leaving, they say that being outside the EU cannot be seen to be as good as being inside the EU. You in the EU have taken a tough stance in negotiations, not only because it is a good thing for negotiators to do, but also to make sure that any deal acts as a disincentive to other countries that might be thinking of leaving. Most people in this Parliament are happy that these negotiations or these objectives have been met, but have also stressed to me that compromises have been made along the way. Some worry that the backstop could give an unfair advantage to UK companies accessing the single market. Others are concerned that it may affect the ability of the EU to conclude future trade deals with other countries, and they tell me that they hope that a backstop is never needed – a sentiment often repeated by speakers here.  Let me tell you that in Westminster, opponents of this deal see it very differently. There is, once again, a gap in perceptions. They see a withdrawal agreement with legal obligations that they believe could bind them to a customs union forever. They refer to briefings from Commission officials who have told the press that the customs union will form the basis of the future relationship. They see the text on the future agreement as a list of aspirations, with no legal obligations to move towards a future trade relationship or future relationships quickly. They are concerned that while the EU treaties have an exit clause in terms of the infamous Article 50, under the backstop they worry about being trapped in a customs union, possibly forever. Many of them quote the song Hotel California – you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.  They also believe that the agreement shows a lack of respect for unionists in Northern Ireland, and they feel it does not take account of the views of both the unionist and the Irish nationalist communities, as required under the Good Friday Agreement. They also ask me why we need a backstop at all, given that the Irish Prime Minister said that there will be no hard border in the event of no deal. For those Westminster opponents, many of whom are normally loyal and considered moderate, no deal is better than this deal.  But of course there are other reasons for the results of last night’s vote. As the official opposition, the Labour Party will seize every opportunity to seek to defeat the government, and, as you see, they’ve already called for a vote of no confidence. But then there are other politicians who think that the public was smart enough to vote for them, yet somehow too stupid to understand what they were voting for in the referendum. These MPs aim to disrupt the process in the hope that they can reverse the referendum result.  So as a consequence, today we find ourselves in a critical phase of the process. The EU has been very patient while the ball has been in UK’s court, but I’m afraid you’re going to have to wait a little longer while the government faces the vote of confidence, which I expect it to win, and the Prime Minister holds cross-party discussions to find a realistic way forward that can win the support of Parliament. At this point, the EU will face a choice: you can do nothing, and prepare for no deal; you can gamble that Brexit could somehow be stopped, or you can attempt to address some of the concerns expressed. For example, you could convince British MPs that you have no intention of keeping the UK in the customs union forever and that the backstop, if ever applied, would only be temporary. I understand that you see this as a lot to ask, given that you believe the UK has been offered a good deal, but just as in 2015 when a few tweaks to the renegotiation sought by David Cameron might have been enough to change the result of the referendum, it would be a great pity if no further efforts were made to try to reach an agreement that could help the British Prime Minister to forge a consensus at Westminster.  We must never forget that this should be about people, not politics. Whatever our views, we should remember that our decisions in the coming days and weeks will affect people’s jobs, the success of companies and the growth of our economies.  Monday’s letter from President Juncker and President Tusk hinted at more flexibility. Let us see, when the Prime Minister comes back, if we can turn that flexibility into concrete proposals to address the concerns that arose in the lead-up to last night’s vote. Only then can we stop looking back at the past, move on from the present negotiations and look to build a more honest relationship for the future.

I have to tell you, I’m not so surprised, because, since the outcome of the referendum, British politics, in Downing Street, in Westminster, in Whitehall, has consistently produced majorities against something or other: against membership of the Union, against membership of the single market, against the Customs Union, against the free movement of people, against the Irish backstop … the list is long. In this debate this morning, Mr Kamall, the question is how to break the deadlock, and I had hoped you would give an indication in that regard. You described the situation in Britain, and we can follow it. But how do you break this deadlock? How do you avoid the devastating no-deal scenario? My answer to that – and I hope you are in agreement with me – is that we need urgently a majority in favour of something, in the House of Commons and in British politics, a majority in the interest of Britain and in the interest of the Union too. And I think that can be achieved if, finally, the political parties in Britain – and I mean all political parties not just the Conservative Party – start to put the interest of the country, the interest of Britain, above their own narrow party political interests. That is the key. (Applause) Let me put it differently. That Jeremy Corbyn wants to become Prime Minister of his country is legitimate. That Theresa May wants to remain Prime Minister is legitimate. That the SNP wants to use the situation to have an independent Scotland is legitimate. That the DUP wants to keep the unity of the country is legitimate. All these ambitions that everybody has are legitimate. But what is more important is that they should all come out of the trenches now, that they should transcend the binary system in which they are currently locked, a system that has produced antagonism. Let’s be honest: Brexit started as a catfight inside the Conservative Party on the back of the European Union. That was the start of the whole discussion. But today it is something completely different. It is no longer a catfight inside the Conservative Party, it is an existential problem for Britain, a problem of Britain’s future and Britain’s souls. So it’s not a catfight anymore. I know it’s not up to me as a humble Belgian to lecture the Brits on what to do, but I think it’s time now to tell our British friends that, for the sake of Britain itself, it’s time for cross-party cooperation in Britain, as we have had here in this Parliament from day one. It is time to define what the new relationship between the UK and EU must be and to redefine, too, the red lines – that have, in fact, been imposed unilaterally from the beginning by what I will call the ‘hardliners’ in the Conservative Party. We in the European Union, I can tell you honestly, are ready for a deeper future relationship, even deeper than what is envisaged, Michel, in the Political Declaration, and you confirmed that a few minutes ago. And, if there is a cross-party majority in the House of Commons to go in the direction of a deeper relationship, we are ready to engage fully in order to obtain that and to make it happen.  But there are two small warnings that I want to give. First of all, what we will not let happen, deal or no deal, is that the controversy in British politics is now imported into European politics. While we understand that the UK can have, and needs, more time, I think it would be a bad thing to go with Article 50 beyond European election day. That would only prolong uncertainty for businesses and for people. My second warning concerns the interests of our citizens, EU citizens and UK citizens alike. Deal or no deal, Mr President, we will do everything in our power to safeguard their rights – rights provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement – and, if necessary, together with our Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, we will engage directly with the House of Commons, with the Home Office Select Committee, to secure those rights, because no citizens should ever be the victims of party political games such as those we see around Brexit today.

We in the European Parliament stand firmly and staunchly behind that negotiated agreement, as Michel Barnier presented it. My second point is that I’m encouraged to see that an amendment that was tabled – which basically amounted to creating the possibility for the United Kingdom to unilaterally get out of or breach the Good Friday Agreement – was massively rejected. I’m really encouraged to see that, on both sides of the Channel, there is determination to preserve the Good Friday Agreement. Do not underestimate the potential that any unilateral action in Northern Ireland could spark violence again and we don’t want this. We have a vast majority against a Withdrawal Agreement and I understand that there’s a vast majority against a no—deal scenario. But make no mistake about that: a no—deal scenario is what will automatically happen by default if no positive majority can be found for an alternative, an alternative that would probably require the British authorities to reconsider their aspirations for the future relationship. If the House of Commons is either unwilling or unable to find such a positive majority, as a democrat, I believe that the only alternative will then be to ask the British people to choose whether they want Brexit along the lines negotiated both by the British Government and the – (Heckling) Dear colleagues, my understanding of British traditions is courtesy and fair play.

I would basically expect British MEPs to stand by the values of their own country, and this is why I cherish the membership of the United Kingdom in the European Union because you can bring a lot to our Union. As I said, the only other option would be to go back to the British people to decide between Brexit, as negotiated, or to remain in the European Union. Finally – and I will conclude there – there’s a lot being said in the discussion about the economy and business. I would urge all of us, on both sides of the Channel, to keep in mind the three million citizens of the European Union in the United Kingdom and the two million British citizens on this side of the Channel because they are held hostage by this ongoing chaos. This should remind us that democracy and politics are, and must remain, about people’s well—being.

Daily, the British Government shows contempt for the people of Ireland and a complete disregard for the Good Friday Agreement. The part of the British establishment that the DUP supports has always been opposed to the Good Friday Agreement. Some see Brexit as a way to get rid of it. No positive resolution for Ireland will ever come from a British parliament. It never has and it never will.  In contrast to the frustrating and infuriating circus at Westminster, the EU is committed to supporting the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts. One vital aspect of the Good Friday Agreement presents a route out of this mess for Ireland and – Mr Verhofstadt – it is both legitimate and democratic.  It states that once the British Secretary of State considers that there has been demonstrable attitudinal change she will trigger a border poll on Irish unity. Well there has been demonstrable change. Theresa May knows that – she stated so publicly – as does Karen Bradley. The Irish Government needs to take more account of what the European Council statement of April 2017 stated, which was: ‘In the event of a successful democratic vote on Irish unity, the north of Ireland would remain part of the EU’. That was referred to as the ‘German clause’.  In the meantime Ireland needs a contingency plan to uphold the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts. Supporting and preparing for the holding of a referendum on Irish unity has to be part of that.  So let’s de-dramatise that conversation. We are entitled to the right to decide our future without external interference. That’s a Good Friday Agreement provision. So let’s have our say on what Union we want to be a part of.

I realised on 8 December 2017 where this was going when, in order to meet a deadline set by Mr Barnier, an unelected bureaucrat in Brussels, the Prime Minister left Downing Street at 4.15 in the morning to fly to meet you, and in the run-up to the deadline, she signed up to the principle of the Irish backstop. The pass was sold from that moment. It has been throughout a total failure of leadership. But perhaps more significantly, she hasn’t learned or heeded the historical lesson that if you appease bullies, they always come back for more. She has behaved like a leader of a nation defeated in war, and that is why this Withdrawal Agreement looked more like a surrender document and it was smashed to pieces in the House of Commons last night. She of course believed that she’d get some concessions from you today, but it’s perfectly clear from what you’ve said that there are no concessions to come. She is still our Prime Minister, and that of itself is quite remarkable. If she had any sense of honour, she’d be gone by lunchtime today. There are some here today, Mr Barnier, who say you have wasted two years of your life. I disagree completely, because you’ve got us now exactly where you want us, and that is despite the fact that 500 MPs voted for Article 50, which of course makes it very clear that there are two years in which to negotiate a withdrawal agreement, or we just leave. And that was backed up of course by the Act of Parliament, the Withdrawal Act, which once again says, unconditionally, that we leave on 29 March.  Mr President, you say there’s no support for no deal, but then you all thought there was no support for Brexit in the first place. You might be surprised how quickly public opinion is changing. Mr Timmermans, you say this would cause great harm, but if we leave on no deal, if we stick to the law as it is, we become an independent country. I would say to you: what price freedom? I’d be the first to admit that I doubt this will happen, because working in cahoots with you we have Mr Blair and many other leaders of the British establishment who treat the Brexit vote, and treat voters in general, with total and utter contempt. There is a great tradition here, isn’t there – we’ve seen it with Denmark and with Ireland – where you make people vote again. All I can say is that if we finish up with an extension of Article 50, we may well finish up fighting the next set of European elections, and we will fight them. If the betrayal becomes complete and we are forced to vote in a second referendum, you may be in for a big surprise. The British may be a very placid people, very laid back, but I promise you: if they get pushed too far, it’s a lion that will roar.

The remainers don’t want it because they don’t want to leave. The leavers don’t want it because under it we don’t really leave. And what is the purpose of it all, which has now been extended? It is to wear the British people down to the extent where they accept defeat and surrender and the result of the referendum is overturned.  Not for the first time I found myself agreeing with something that Mr Verhofstadt said. He said, how to break the deadlock in the British parliament we need a majority in favour of something. Absolutely right Mr Verhofstadt, and in three days. Ms May has to come up with a plan B. Well, the good news is, there is a plan B – which should have been plan A in the first place – which is to repeal the 1972 European Communities Act, leave the European Union under our law and then to tell you how we are going to repeal and amend 45 years and tens and tens of thousands of bits of legislation under our priorities and under our time-scales.  Now Ms May should immediately resign and hand over to somebody who can become prime minister who really does want to leave the European Union, and the British Parliament has the opportunity to redeem itself.

Last night in the House of Commons, MPs acted on behalf of the British people and decisively rejected the draft withdrawal agreement. In doing so, they defended the integrity of our precious Union, the constitutional position of Northern Ireland, the unity of the UK’s single market and the UK’s right to an independent future outside the European Union. Already in this House this morning, there is some confusion around the legal position in the United Kingdom, much talk about delaying Article 50 or another referendum. Let me clarify: it is the legal position that the United Kingdom leaves on 29 March 2019. This is the one clear element of law within this whole conundrum. There has also been much focus on the backstop proposal, much ill—informed talk and threats of violence if Europe doesn’t get its way. Again, I repeat in this House, we in the DUP do not want to see a hard border, but the intransigence of Dublin and EU leaders in this House in demanding the backstop leaves a no—deal option on the table. By refusing to countenance legally viable changes to the draft withdrawal agreement, these institutions made the result of yesterday’s vote inevitable. All sides have said that there can be no hard border under any scenario. We should now direct our energy to a positive and beneficial negotiation on trade which minimises all frictions at all borders without the controversy of the backstop.

I believe that in this debate, as well as from many statements from capitals, it is clear that the unity of the European Union on this issue remains. Twenty-seven countries and their institutions agree, and there is no consensus in Britain. That is the real problem. We remain united and will defend the integrity of the internal market and the unity of this European Union. That is in our interest. The second point is that yesterday a coalition of opposites was found. They have nothing to do with each other in terms of content for a solution, the hard Brexiteers and the Remainers and all that is in between, who have said no because they have different ideas and desires. Theresa May is unlikely to be able to offer a constructive solution after this situation. Now, after two years, to say that we are going to talk to the opposition seems to me to be two years too late. I believe it is now important that a proposal is made from Within Parliament for a constructive solution to be found from within the British Parliament, which we can then discuss accordingly. And if, for example, Mr Corbyn has said that he wants a customs union, then he should bring in this proposal, get a majority for it. That would not be a problem for us – under the existing circumstances, I would add this – and to find a solution here would be very welcome. And if there is a constructive solution, then we should do so accordingly.

As we know, history always comes as a surprise. When we started our mandate in 2014 nobody could have predicted such a debate today. Not even in 2016, when we discussed the unexpected outcome of the Brexit referendum. It took more than 900 days for the British Parliament to come to a meaningful decision. Months of uncertainty are behind us, and the result is clear, very clear. The future development is still not foreseeable at all.  Only one thing is certain: we are running out of time. Seventy days to go – this great nation is sleepwalking towards the edge of the cliff. Yesterday’s vote should be seen as a wake-up call.  We could start discussing accountability, bad governance or how a small self-centred elite was hijacking the country’s future for short-sighted reasons. It is evident that British Conservativism has dramatically failed.  But this is not the moment for insisting on being right, much less for revenge or retaliation. Now is the moment for responsible action in the interests of the many and not the few. The ordinary people of Britain would be the losers in a hard Brexit. We, the remaining 27 Member States, who stayed united over the negotiations, have to be flexible in breaking the deadlock and to provide pragmatic solutions to minimise the damage. You can count on the Socialists &amp; Democrats.  And we should not forget that over the last 40 years the UK has made a huge contribution to our common project. We will miss the expertise of our British colleagues, but life goes on and we have to deliver: therefore we need certainty on what the UK wants. We need a clear signal and a people’s vote undoubtedly could deliver this. The British people should take back control and this time nobody could argue that the people did not know what they were voting for.

(Applause) Colleagues, you have to deal with the United Kingdom as you find it, and you have to respect the United Kingdom’s constitutional order. I respect that.

It’s bad news for Scotland; it’s bad news for the United Kingdom; and it’s bad news, as well, for the United Europe – the European Union. My job is not to mitigate Brexit, it’s to stop it.

I apologise for that, but that’s the reality of where we are. If you want to keep us in, we need more time to achieve that. A referendum may well be a way out of this process: we need more time to put that case together and to make that case now that the United Kingdom Government might just possibly be starting to listen to voices other than its own. Secondly, citizens: too many people, the length and breadth of our European continent, are feeling too anxious right now – UK nationals across the EU and EU nationals within the UK. A lot of work on citizens’ rights has gone into the Withdrawal Agreement. Those provisions must be spun out into a ring-fenced agreement now, so as to give those people clarity and certainty over their day-to-day lives. They feel prisoners of a process they do not control and that is not good enough. We in this House, the people’s house of Europe, have a duty to our citizens. Our Commission has done a great deal of work to try to guarantee those rights but, in the absence of complete buy-in from the United Kingdom government, we must act – and unilaterally guarantee those citizens’ rights – now.

The absence of a Withdrawal Agreement would deprive them of all rights linked to freedom of movement; from the limbo of these years they would go to hell with legal uncertainty. It is difficult to say how we can get out of this massive disavow of the executive line without the people being questioned again.  However, if the No deal is confirmed, the Commission and Parliament will have to do everything possible to preserve at least the rights of English residents, recommending that national procedures be aligned with the best practices already envisaged in some Member States and guaranteeing them free movement within the Union.  The case of European citizens in Britain, more than 3 million, is much more serious. They will become victims, as will third-country nationals, of the hostile environment promoted by the Tories since 2012. Theresa May's promises can be cancelled out of the uk parliament. Only an international treaty safeguarding the rights of the Withdrawal Agreement would give them legal certainty. So-called rights ringfencing is possible if the EU, in addition to unilaterally protecting British residents in Europe, conditions negotiations on future relations to a preliminary BILATERAL EU-UK agreement, which preserves and improves the chapter on rights contained in the Withdrawal Agreement.

Having said that, I just want to say that the vote in the House of Commons last night, though disappointing, was entirely predictable. But one thing is very clear: before the vote you sensed that the unity of the EU27 is to be admired. Thanks are due to Michel Barnier, who did a tremendous job, and to everybody involved. Ireland would like to express its gratitude for that. I must take issue, though, with a comment made by Arlene  Foster yesterday when she said ‘There is no need for the backstop, as we never had a hard border’. My goodness, try telling that to those who were killed when they were crossing the border, who were subjected to searches by British soldiers, who saw the watchtowers, who were victims of the violence and, indeed, terrorist acts. I must say that this is not helpful, and because of that violence we had the Good Friday Agreement. And in fairness, and to give credit, to Theresa May, Michel Barnier and the EU as a whole, they did everything in the Withdrawal Agreement to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement would be observed in all its parts and that peace would continue on the island of Ireland. I want to say as well, though, to my colleague Martina Anderson, that this is not the time to be calling for a referendum on Irish unity. It’s not the Irish Government’s position. It’s not what the Irish people want. Even though we aspire to a united Ireland, we know that to be calling for it at this time is divisive and that is not what we want. The big worry now for most people is that there will be no deal, that the United Kingdom will crash out of the European Union, and preparations are in place in case that is the outcome. But I think it’s important for the United Kingdom to make a decision that that is not what it wants. I have no doubt that the good people of the United Kingdom do not want that scenario, and if given the opportunity they would say so. While clarifications might be needed from Brussels regarding the Withdrawal Agreement, the sensible thing, I think, would be to consult those who actually voted for Brexit in the first place – the British people – and ask them ‘Is this really what you want?’.

My country too is grateful for the freedom that British soldiers brought to our shores. There is an unbreakable link between the United Kingdom and Europe, and whether the United Kingdom is in the European Union or not it will be part of Europe in a way that will define our common destiny.  Now it pains me to see the United Kingdom as divided as it is today: the division caused by Brexit has a paralysing effect on British society. I will remain eternally grateful not just for our liberty but also for the British teachers I had as a young lad, who taught me to love British literature and art, who taught me the English language, and this will not change whatever happens. But I want to make one thing perfectly clear in reaction to what was said by Mr Kamall and by Mr Farage. I have not encountered, in the Commission with Michel Barnier, nor in any of the 27 capitals, a punitive attitude in this process. Nobody wants to punish the United Kingdom for leaving the European Union. (Applause) In the negotiations we have seen an attitude, in all the capitals and in the Commission, of wanting to do as little harm as possible in this process. However, let’s not create the illusion that this could be a process without harm. Brexit will do harm to the United Kingdom and to the European Union. It is our collective responsibility to limit that harm as much as possible. Now, what will happen in the next weeks, months and perhaps years is up to the British people to decide – which means, in the first place, up to the House of Commons, where this discussion will be held. And we will have to play with the hand that will be dealt by Britain in this, whatever our thoughts are. I’ve never made a secret of the fact that, of course, I would prefer the United Kingdom to stay in the European Union, but that’s not up to us. That’s up to the British people and the British politicians to decide. I also want to make one thing very clear in relation to what Mr Kamall said about the internal market and other elements of the European Union. You can’t honestly say ‘I’m going to leave the European Union, but I’m going to take with me everything I like’ regardless of what that does to the European Union. I think we are under an obligation – as European politicians, as Member States, as institutions – to safeguard the essential elements of what it means to be part of the European Union, which includes the integrity of the four freedoms, which includes the integrity of the internal market. That is non-negotiable.  What also astonishes me is that Mr Farage’s pipe dream of independence would lead him to disregard completely the fundamental importance of the Good Friday Agreement for peace in Europe. It is absolutely clear to the Commission that we have a collective responsibility as Europeans to make sure that peace remains on the island of Ireland. (Applause) And, for that peace, in our analysis, it is essential that there are no hard borders in Ireland. Therefore we need the backstop: that also is non-negotiable. And, while it’s encouraging on the one hand that we have this level of European solidarity, that no one in the 27 capitals will throw Ireland under the bus in any circumstances, it is mind boggling that so many people in Westminster would not see the essential value of the Good Friday Agreement and, for their pipe dream, would sacrifice stability and peace in Ireland. (Applause) I’m not even talking about the jobs lost, the investment opportunities lost and all of that. It would have been honest, in this campaign that led to the Brexit vote – which we respect – if they’d said: ‘We want this so much that we don’t care that you lose your job, we don’t care that investment will be lost, we don’t care that there will be havoc in the NHS, we don’t care that there will be havoc on the roads. We don’t care, we just want this, regardless of the consequences.’ That would have been an honest Brexit campaign. Anyway, we will wait for the decisions in Westminster and the UK. We will continue in an honest way with our project to do as little harm as possible, regardless of the cards that we will be dealt. Mr Kamall quoted the Eagles.

It is not realistic to start new negotiations, knowing that the agreement that has now been rejected was negotiated for 18 months. Nor do we need to open the agreement. The withdrawal agreement, which was rejected by the British Parliament, would have covered the three main objectives that the EU Parliament wanted to secure. The agreement would have safeguarded the rights of EU citizens living in the UK and agreed on the UK's payment obligations to the EU, and there would have been no hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The most important contribution to the agreement would have been the transition period for withdrawal until the end of 2020, during which the UK would have complied with all EU laws and paid membership fees, but would not have been involved in the decision-making process.

And I say \"exciting\" with all conviction and from one's life experience. In 1985, when Spain's act of accession to the then European Economic Community was signed, I was 13 years old. And, despite the time elapsed, I remember clearly that day.  I remember the emotion felt by those who had suffered for decades the absence of democracy and freedoms in my country, in Spain.  I remember the emotion in a whole generation of Spaniards, that of my parents; men and women for whom Europe meant, during many years of dictatorship, freedom and the rule of law, progress and cohesion.  That moment represented many things for Spain, above all it represented the guarantee that there would no longer be going back; that, at last, we were at peace with our history; that at last no one would ever, ever take democracy back from our country.  (Applause) Since then, later generations of Spaniards—my own—have seen the inner borders turned into relics of history and built solidarity and affections with once distant peoples. Always from respect for the values we identify today as European: legal certainty, respect for the social and democratic state of law, dialogue and tolerance, feminism and equal opportunities, fraternity and coexistence, environmentalism and intergenerational solidarity.  So, yes: you can consider me a passionate Europeanist. Proud of what this attribute represents and, precisely, proud now, when some use anti-Europeanism as an alleged electoral asset.  Thank you, President Tajani, for giving me the opportunity to address this Parliament. Putting it at the heart of this debate seems to me to be a great success, precisely when we are going to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the first European elections. The Union is not understood without the primacy of democratic values.  Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to mention yesterday's vote in the British Parliament.  I respect — as it cannot be otherwise, as President of the Government of a Member State — but I can only regret the negative rejection of the UK withdrawal agreement from the European Union.

As I said, an agreement that has been negotiated for a year and a half, and which I think is the best possible deal. It is the option that better protects the interests of the United Kingdom and also of all the Member States of the Union and, therefore, of European society. It is the option that protects not only the rights of its citizens, but also the rights of the main economic operators.  An agreement, therefore, which contains a balance of concessions which is very difficult to reach and which seeks, first and foremos say, an orderly exit.  In this regard, it is for the United Kingdom Government to adapt or take the decisions it deems appropriate on the steps to be taken. We are, as Member States and also as Community institutions, doing our job; adopting, both the Member States and the European Commission, the necessary measures to minimise the impact of a possible exit without agreement.  Ladies and gentlemen, I have always expressed my opinion, both in the Spanish Parliament and also in successive and different interviews with the media, that Brexit is a disgrace to the British people and also to the whole of the European Union. No one wins; we all lose, especially the British and, in particular, those who need their government the most, those who are the most vulnerable.  But it is a sovereign decision which we can only respect and, therefore, I want the United Kingdom to choose to maintain as close a relationship as possible with the European Union as a whole. The decision rests with them, but our principles are clear: the integrity of the internal market, the indivisibility of the four freedoms and the autonomy of the Union's decision.  Within the framework of these three points we will always find ourselves.  Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to speak to you about the need to mobilisation Europe.  I would like to talk to you about the need to relegate Europe to new challenges, but also to those who want the destruction of Europe. Let's be clear: there are, inside and outside, important actors who they want the destruction of the Union.  As leader of the Social Democratic family, I know that you expect me to talk about social Europe, the Europe I am covering; and I'm going to do it, because I think social Europe is the Europe of convictions.  However, precisely because of this moral conviction and because it is necessary to reconcile the idea of Europe with what is expected of it by the public, if you ask me what the central idea is in my speech, it is a much broader appeal. It is very simple, it is summed up in one sentence: for Europe to protect, it is up to us, right now, in this historical time, to protect Europe. Protecting Europe is building a Europe of rights that protects the most vulnerable.  (Applause) It is to promote a Europe of opportunity for our young people and also for the long-term unemployed , who must not necessarily be 60 years old, but, in countries like mine, are 45 years old and are suffering from long-term unemployment; is to move towards a social Europe that strengthens our business fabric and our industrial fabric, but also to safeguard labour rights from the precariousness that floods the labour markets of each and every Member State of the Union.  Protecting Europe is to ensure the safety and defence of our fellow citizens by making the Union a global player, capable of defending its values and ideals.  To protect Europe is to reaffirm our commitment to the Paris Agreements, in the fight against climate change. It is also the culmination, once and for all, of economic and monetary union.  Only in this way, with a Europe that reconciles itself with citizenship, with an autonomous Europe to defend its model of welfare status, with a Europe that completes economic and monetary architecture, will we be able to address the challenges that will mark the coming decades with sufficient guarantees.  So this is no time to hesitate. To Europe's enemies I say that our conviction and determination will overcome authoritarianism. As harsh as it is the exclusionary rhetoric of some, however questionable their methods and lies are logically, it is time to show conviction and determination in defending our common project which is Europe.  Today a real battle is taking on the field of ideas. This is a scenario in which this battle is surely also unfolding, as in each and every national parliament: involution in the face of progress.  We know that the future was never conquered by taking steps backwards and, therefore, we cannot go back a millimeter in defending the European model. Europe protects whether each and every one of us who feels concerned — not only the Member States, not just the European Parliament and the national parliaments, not just civil society, but all of the citizens — protects Europe.  To those who also extend messages of retreat from this rostrum, I say that Europe is and will never be a threat to the extraordinary diversity of our countries, of our languages, of our cultures.  Europe is quite the opposite. Europe is multiplication, never the division of identities. You're no less Spanish because you're European, on the contrary.  The European Union was never and will never be a mere geographical expression, it is what unites us. It was, is and will always be a community of values, the values of the French Revolution: freedom, equality, fraternity — so important in our day – values that are typical of open and optimistic societies, those that innovate and those that believe, because they see the future as an opportunity and never as a threat. Societies that link necessary competitiveness and economic development with something fundamental that defines us as European, such as social cohesion and our welfare model.  This commitment like the one that unites us in the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda, which is a real global contract of the next decade, which must find in Europe its main activist and ambassador. Ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that there is social unsenchantment in the context of globalisation. We live it in each and every street, the villages, the squares of our cities throughout the continent. Disenchantment that feeds ultra rhetoric and is born of a great paradox: on the one hand, globalization has redistributed wealth between regions of the planet and, consequently, has reduced global inequality; but, on the other hand, it increases inequality in this or within our own societies.  And in short, if we think about it, the rise of anti-European messages owes much to this latter phenomenon. However, globalization is not a natural catastrophe for which we must be helpless. Goethe said parents should give their children \"roots and wings.\" Similarly, the European Union must provide their citizens with \"roots\"—that is, an anchor, protection, protection—and \"wings\"—ultimately empowering them—so that they can thrive from opportunities in a global world.  We are, ladies and gentlemen, facing a change of time, and on 26 May it will open a new political cycle in Europe. And the priority must therefore focus on regulating globalisation to ensure the validity of the European social model.  We must consolidate the foundations of economic and monetary union, complementing it with the indispensable basis of a political, social and , I would also like to add, environmental union.  A decade after its inception, many of our fellow citizens still suffer the consequences of the Great Recession in the form of wage inequality, social exclusion, precariousness, pay drop. A crisis that unfairly associated Europe's idea with austerity. To austerity, by the way, of those who were always austere out of necessity, in front of those who were never austere and were behind the responsibility of the financial crisis that affected and hit all European societies. (Applause)  The consequence was inequality and, in particular, intergenerational inequality, the inequality that young people suffer on our continent. And, of course, gender inequality, because women are the ones who are suffering with the greatest impact and intensity the precariousness and inequality in the workplace. Therefore, inequality, precariousness and the weakening of the welfare state.  This account, it must be acknowledged, divided societies, but it also divided us, as a Union: it divided countries between north and south between east and west, between creditor countries and debtors. So it's time to close that stage and relegate Europe where it's most needed, which is among the citizens.  And to achieve this, we must vindicate social Europe, the Europe of rights. Social and territorial cohesion is an essential pillar and, I would say, unique in the world of European societies. In order to regain legitimacy, the Union must promote a new social contract; make globalisation, under European protection, a source of opportunity and not just a source of threats.  It is essential to strengthen social cohesion, with clear and measurable objectives for employment, for social justice and also for the sustainability of our welfare state. We must strengthen this perspective in European economic coordination procedures and also in cohesion policy.  That is, and not another, ladies and gentlemen, the philosophy of the proposal advocated by the Government of Spain within the European Council, such as the creation of European unemployment insurance — a genuine backstop for people — from which to give content to such important concepts, for those of us who believe in the Union, such as solidarity and as European citizenship is. A path that we must actively promote and in parallel with the culmination of economic and monetary union.  And, in the same line, it is imperative to complete the task entrusted to us by European trade unions — the Directive on the reconciliation of personal and work life and also that relating to transparent and predictable working conditions throughout the European Union — and to ensure that all persons, regardless of their race of sex or age, , have access to free work —worthy, rather —on our continent.  The Union must be present in the fight against occupational precariousness. Uncertainty at work implies vital uncertainty, and we cannot allow the idea that young people on our continent are destined to live worse than the previous generation. It is paramount at this point – and this is the position of the Government of Spain – to bet on the Youth Guarantee.  Ladies and gentlemen, seven months ago Spain formed the Government with the most women from the OECD. It is a milestone on the path of real and effective equality between men and women, which still has a long way to go.  (Applause) A path we could never have walked without the impetus and without the example and inspiration of Europe. So today, in this house, I would like to thank the commitment of women, mePs across the continent, to the ideal that is already part of the European acquis, such as feminism.  In the cause of gender equality, what I can guarantee you is that Spain is not going to take any steps back; we'll keep taking steps forward. But we also need the competition from Europe.  That is why today I would like to propose the adoption of a european Union gender equality strategy on a binding basis, a strategy to combat the gender gap, the higher unemployment rate faced by women and the precariousness it suffers with particular intensity of women. May the voice of Europe lead this struggle in what is already the 21st century of women. (Applause) We must, ladies and gentlemen, make progress in binding on the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights, on equal opportunities in access to the labour market and on fair working conditions, as well as in protection and social inclusion. I therefore reiterate my support for the Regulation on the European Labour Authority to ensure the rights of workers in the labour market.  Europe must be able to expand equal opportunities and ensure access to all studies, including those of high improvement. In culture, in science, in research, we will all agree that we have a fundamental strong point against those who want to destroy the European dream. Ladies and gentlemen, in order to ensure the safety of our citizens and to strengthen our role in the world, as a genuine global player, decisive progress is needed, with determination, in the Europe of security and defence. Just over a year ago we launched Permanent Structured Cooperation. We are taking the first steps to building our own capabilities in the field of defense after decades of paralysis. And now is the time to do it with a decision. To move forward, openly, in the creation of a true European army. The Union, ladies and gentlemen, has to show the world that it is a soft power — if I may say so — by choice, not by weakness. For conviction. The ability to project forces together, beyond our borders, and the political will to do so, are fundamental conditions for being a credible power on the international board. The Union is undoubtedly an attractive model for the world in many respects. A lot of times we forget, but we do. It is precisely the union that allows us to aspire to a leadership role at the global level. We represent the possibilities of a multilateral order, which is now being challenged by very important international forces; a multilateral order based on law and commonly accepted rules.  Spain I want to tell you that you are ready to contribute to this leadership. Providing. And contributing decisively, thanks to our privileged relationship with Latin America, with North Africa and with the Middle East. But, however, in the face of major global challenges, Europe's weight is much lower than in other areas, where the Union has exclusive competence. And in this sense, I would like to make some reflection. We have to become a true global player. We're not today. And to do so it is necessary to eliminate the rule of unanimity; not only on foreign policy, but also on such important issues as taxation, the multiannual budget and the mechanism for verifying respect for the rule of law and human rights. (Applause) Protecting Europe is, today more than ever, providing it with tools that need to be necessarily agile in decision-making. To bet, in short, on a new sovereignty, which is the sovereignty that you represent, which is neither more nor less as important as European sovereignty. Thirdly, ladies and gentlemen, we must complete the architecture of the single currency and move forward in the Multiannual Financial Framework. Fifty years ago, in The Hague, the heads of state and government of the then European Economic Community opened the way for economic and monetary union. And there is a paradox that the final year of each decade was always marked by substantive progress in this area. Note: – In 1969, the Hague Summit, to which it referred earlier; – In 1979, the adoption of the European Monetary System; – In 1989, the Delors Plan to Achieve Economic and Monetary Union; – And in 1999, the official implementation of the euro. Between the latter date, 1999, and the year we just premiered, 2019, there is only one striking gap in this almost perfect sequence, which is 2009, when the international financial crisis revealed the shortcomings of our unique currency architecture.  So nothing better illustrates the impact of the crisis than this broken cadence. So, let's make this 2019 a definitely year to move forward. The euro, in my view, despite the difficulties it has logically entailed, especially at times as difficult as those of the decade of the crisis, is a success story that brings economic and political benefits to the European project. But without the reforms needed to strengthen our single currency, economic union will remain incomplete and exposed to instability. It's not just about strengthening the financial system through a banking union in the three fundamental and mutualized pillars — that's clearly, you know this and have defended it—but also to undertake, in the medium term, closer fiscal integration. With stabilization tools to mitigate adverse effects on economic activity and employment in the face of future crises. To relegate Europe in this area to me seems to be key. It's critical. And to do so, citizens must feel the protagonists of these reforms, they must feel at the heart of these reforms: protect their savings, protect them from inflation, or protect them and protect them when there is economic crisis and unemployment. A common currency is a key pillar in a shared political project such as the European Union. Reform of Economic and Monetary Union must ensure that social protection and inclusion are present from the very conception of our common economic policies. The time is this. Moreover, this is when economic conditions remain favourable. Let it be the policy that, for once, anticipates events. Let these not be the ones to redial the European Union's agenda. We must complete the structure of the euro before the next crisis weakens our currency and our Union. Let us learn from recent experience and move forward with decision; we can't afford the price we know the inaction would have. For institutions, but above all for those we represent in this forum and in many other institutions, at the national level. And look, with regard to the new Multiannual Financial Framework, we face new challenges to be addressed. But we must also consolidate strategic initiatives, such as the common agricultural policy or cohesion policies, which are as important to countries as Spain; urban Europe cannot be neglected from rural Europe, if I may have the synthesis of this reflection. Reducing the budget means accepting the idea that Europe is withdrawing from a backward Europe. So, let's also think about who benefits from such messages. The Commission's proposal, in the view of the Government of Spain, contains positive, very positive elements, such as the level of expenditure, the external dimension of migration policy, to which I will subsequently refer, or the strengthening of innovation and technological development programmes. Europe needs to be sovereign in innovation, and reduce its reliance on artificial intelligence, quantum computing, cybersecurity and automation. Only by pooling our capabilities and resources can we compete with guarantees. And so the proposal to double the Erasmus programme funds is particularly timely, and of course the Government of Spain supports it. But progress is also needed on other lines. There must be a European response to phenomena that we believed to be banished in our societies, and which are growing at the cost of rising inequality, such as child poverty. The Europe of Opportunity has been starting, ladies and gentlemen, from childhood. That is why I would like to expressly support, as President of the Government of Spain, the need to promote a child guarantee to tackle the earliest social exclusion. (Applause) Ladies and gentlemen, the proposal we have - even with shortcomings in this area - is a good starting point. But it's time to take a leap forward. Our Union is worth much more, it weighs much more than 1% of europe's gross national product. So, prudence in spending, rationality in spending and ability to address the priorities arising from the transnational challenges we face. We all win with a reasonable, forward-looking Union budget, creator of synergies and economies of scale. To protect Europe is to move forward, as I said, in social Europe, in defence Europe and economic and monetary union. A Europe, in short, federal, which is re-edituted if it regains the favor of its citizenship; who needs to confront the story of distance with measures that make it a close reality; and that finds its north, its guide, in the values that identify it. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to return to this idea by addressing the last vector of my speech, which alludes to climate change and migration challenges. In both frameworks, I want to appeal to clearly and purely European values. And to do so from a sincere will to reach consensus, beyond ideological boundaries; consensuses that unsern those who benefit most from the division of those of us here. These matters are the chosen battlefield, if we think about it, by those who neither believe nor believe in Europe. They are the conceptual framework from which they seek to undermine the foundations of liberal democracy.  This is where, again, I invoke the need to protect Europe. To preserve, to defend our European model, but also to our European values. In climate change, recent international forums show the advancement of skeptical, resigned, or even belligerent positions. Our perspective in this area must combine global commitment and future opportunity. The energy transition can and should be a vector of modernization and opportunity creation in our countries. But also cohesion, with the boost of energy interconnections to improve our efficiency and reduce emissions. The consequences of this challenge are devastating. You have certainly discussed it on many occasions within this forum. The very entity of this challenge reaffirms to us the validity of political union. Because neither authoritarianism nor exclusionary nationalism can deny evidence that borders can do nothing against this climate change challenge. That's why they militate in irrational denialism. Climate change is being combated from reason and from science. And they're both on our side. On the side of a Europe whose voice is essential in the face of the retreat of very important actors from the international stage. And in similar terms I would also like to refer to the second area to which I referred earlier, which is that of the migration issue. We are talking about a subject, ladies and gentlemen, in which joint and coordinated action, in collaboration with the countries of origin, transit and destination, is essential. For Spain, this perspective is crucial. Especially from our status as the Union's external border. From that point of view, we are very mindd at the key role played by countries very important to the whole european continent, but also to Spain, as is the Kingdom of Morocco in this area in terms of cooperation and control. A role that I would like to highlight expressly in this House. We need to drive a parallel global approach in this area. The Marrakesh Conference represents or represented a first step towards multilateral management of the migration issue, and Spain is, unfortunately with very few European countries, one of the signatories to this global pact. I know very well, as you all know, of the dividing potential of this debate in our societies. But we cannot start from a negative approach to the migration issue, focused exclusively on irregular migration. Regular migration has positive implications for our economic development; plays an essential role in labour-deficit sectors and helps alleviate one of the challenges we have on our continent, such as population ageing. But there is no possible response to this challenge without a commitment to a continent, to Africa, which needs a profound socio-economic transformation. This medium- and long-term political route must pass in parallel with border control, which is an obligation of each and every Member State. A single area, without external borders, requires a joint migration policy, in which the reform of the Common European Asylum System is at the heart. We need rules adapted to today's reality and two principles must guide this reform, such as the principles of responsibility and solidarity. May the complexity of the negotiations not make us lose sight of the original meaning of this reform when it was proposed: to fulfill our duties — derived from international conventions for the protection of human rights — towards people fleeing persecution, war and conflict. The prestige of Europe, ladies and gentlemen, is questioned when attitudes contrary to the most essential humanity emerge within us. Being supportive and empathizing with others also helps us to be with ourselves. Europe is not following fashions, ladies and gentlemen. Europe, with its democratic acquis, is the one that creates trends. That's where our fortress lies. Ladies and gentlemen, our division, here in the Union, is our greatest weakness. Only those who, as I said at the beginning of my speech, seek failure, bankruptcy and defeat of our model benefit from it. A model that crystallizes in a triangle in my virtuous judgment, and that is unique in the world: democracy, economic progress and welfare status. Overcoming our divisions requires mutual understanding and fighting stereotypes. In May of this year, we faced a crucial test. We are faced with those who are sending a message already known on this continent, ladies and gentlemen. A message that sowed this land with ashes decades ago, not many ago. Also then many found this rhetoric and gestures harmless. Peace, democracy and freedom can never be taken for granted. I saw it with my own eyes in the late 1990s in Bosnia, working for the United Nations in a city devastated by the civil war and hatred. En Sarajevo. Barbarism, which we believed to be banished from the history of this continent, was present when no one expected it. Fed by forces that always put hatred before reason and coexistence. The strength of these forces not only threatens our integration project. It also subtly conditions — and I would also like to ask all of you – the agenda of actors in principle contrary to them. Today, I ask in this House that no Europeanist should be dragged by these forces. I turn to all of you to ask you to remain firm in defending European values; and strength to resist the siren songs of authoritarianism. Because they are only pursuing one goal, which is to destroy Europe. That is why today I appeal to the need to protect Europe, for Europe to protect its citizens, Europeans. Over the next few years, I am convinced that our common project, despite the difficulties, will continue to move forward. There will be divergences, of course, there will be setbacks, but there will undoubtedly be more progress in the global computation than setbacks. Consensus that will not completely fill anyone. That is the toll that we must assume naturally. The Union is the synthesis of different, and even contraposed, ideas. Ideas that are peacefully confronted to make progress in well-being and prosperity, preserving stability in an increasingly changing world. We have, however, despite the difficulties, a solid foundation: de facto solidarity, which has continued to grow over the last few years. We see it every time we've suffered the bush of terrorism. They are the germ of a real, tangible European citizenship. When a Spanish citizen covers his profile on a social network with the flag of France, in solidarity with a terrorist attack in Paris, he is embracing the flag of Europe. When a German citizen feels his own the attack on Barcelona's Ramblas he is embracing the flag of Europe.  And when today we honour the victims that this very city of Strasbourg suffered in an appalling terrorist attack just a month ago what we are doing is embracing the flag of Europe. (Applause) Nothing can Europe's enemies against this growing sense of invisible but real solidarity. May it take root strongly, especially among the youngest, among the young people of Europe. They are the ones who display the European flag as a symbol against injustice, against authoritarian drifts, against machismo or against racism. Or simply to express your discomfort at decisions contrary to the logic of the times and your interests. Forgetting history, ladies and gentlemen, is a luxury we cannot afford. Being conservative in the face of uncertainty makes us more vulnerable. It is determination, conviction in our ideas, that will allow us to regain the impulse lost. We are faced with an authoritarianism that lives on invented nostalgia. But there is no nostalgia worse than longing for what never happened, as a song by a great Spanish author says. To all those who live from such invented nostalgias, and I stress the \"invented\" thing, I ask: Was peace firm when the borders separated us? Was there economic progress when customs limited trade? Have social and citizenship rights advanced in each state more than they have in recent years throughout the European Union? Very close to here, on the battlefields of World War I, we have the answer. That is why today I want to say: in the face of involution, progress. In the face of the rhetoric of exclusionary identities, identities that add up, which are not nullified by each other. The past, a good colleague of the Party of European Socialists and an extraordinary Vice-President of the European Commission, Franz Timmermans, told me, the past will never be the future of our societies. The past is a place to learn from our successes and our mistakes. It's time to move around Europe. It is time to protect and defend the values that make ours a unique project in the world. Envied in the world. Only in this way can we defeat those from the outside, but also from within, who want to destroy our ideals. And they want to do it, and I would like to underline this and remember it, for one reason only: for the values defended by the Union. In defending such values must be our answer. On this path, ladies and gentlemen, we need conviction and determination. To combine ideals with the search for pragmatism, as we have done during these last sixty years of life. Our task, as heirs and depositaries of this great legacy, is to preserve and improve what is received to pass it on to generations of Coming Europeans. If a lesson we have learned is that, at specific moments in our history as we are, to resist is to move forward. Today, it is up to the generations you represent in this Parliament to have a single but momentous task: to protect Europe so that Europe can protect its citizens. Thanks a lot. (The Assembly, standing up, applauds the speaker)", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 52, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Frans Timmermans", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   First Vice President of the Commission. – Mr President, I want to start by thanking Prime Minister Sánchez Pérez—Castejón for his inspiring speech. One notion he tried to share with us is that, if Europe wants to protect its citizens, we politicians have a collective responsibility to protect Europe. Only a Europe that is united and strong can actually protect its citizens.  And those who sell the illusion that you can protect citizens by isolating those who are different, by building fences and walls, and by selling a pipe dream of nationalism will only lead to disappointment because there is no protection in protectionism, but there is isolation in isolationism. Nations left on their own in Europe will not be able to face the many challenges the world is throwing at us. Only a united Europe can do what its citizens demand, and that is protect them and help them shape their futures as independent people – free people. I know that Europe runs deep in Pedro Sanchez Pérez—Castejón’s veins. He is from a generation that was the last to be born under dictatorship, a generation that went on to grow up with the hope of freedom and democracy and then to realise the rights and freedoms of European membership, as Spain took its rightful place at the heart of Europe. The message I have for the Spanish Government today is – looking back over the last 40 years – that it is right to say that Europe shaped Spain as it is now, because that was the wish of the Spanish people. But I also believe it is right to say now that Spain should step up and shape Europe. It should take its responsibility as a leading nation in Europe. Use the potential you have to shape our collective future. (Applause) You are strong and resilient. You have shown in this terrible crisis that affected the Spanish population how you can come out of it stronger. Yes, unemployment is still at 13% – it’s much too high – but you’ve made huge progress in the last couple of years to put that behind you, with a determination from the Spanish people that was an inspiration to all of us in the rest of Europe. The Spanish people also share the analysis that Europe is first and foremost about democracy, liberty, freedoms and prosperity, and that these things are precious and can never be taken for granted. Spain has such a unique and important place in our Union, and its European story goes back much further than 1985, in particular about how much Europe owes to the determination and the ideas of people like Salvador de Madariaga, who helped to build the European project after the Second World War. He never gave up on the idea of a free Spain and a democratic Spain. People who never give up on their ideals, even in the darkest days, are the people who shape our future best. He saw our European destiny as intertwined with the destiny of Spain, our identities linked, and our successes linked. This is why he would be proud of what he sees today, a democratic Spain, celebrating 40 years of its Constitution, now at the heart of a strong and united Union. He would be proud of the social and economic progress made since 1985. Whilst growth is now above 2%, unemployment, as I said, is still too high at 13%. So there’s clearly a lot that needs to be done, but there are so many positive signals in the economy – the economy that’s back on its feet – and I again want to stress that this is thanks to the courage and determination of the Spanish people and also the solidarity of the European people – a solidarity that was more than reciprocated by Spain. It did receive solidarity from its European partners during the financial crisis, but it has shown time and again that it will also show solidarity to Europe, and it is showing it on a daily basis if I look at the issue of migration.  Countries like Spain and Malta, even in difficult times, really show solidarity with people in dire need. Spain has been a leader in many respects, and you, Pedro, have been a leader in generously welcoming those stranded on board the Aquarius boat. This was for me a defining moment in Europe when you stood up and said, on behalf of the Spanish people, ‘we will not let these people float on the sea and get into trouble’.  (Applause) That is true political leadership, not the easy way out of looking away, not the easy way out of blaming refugees, but taking the responsibility for their destiny, and I salute you for that. The images of these boats and the divisions caused by only a small number of arrivals on our shores show the need for Europe to overcome its differences and find a sustainable solution that works for all. It is now high time we conclude the necessary reform of our Common European Asylum System (EASO). Only if we make all these reforms, can we come to a sustainable situation. Border protection alone will not get us there. We also need a working asylum system based on solidarity and the fundamental values of the European Union. I also want to underscore, Pedro, what you said about Africa. If there is one continent that will be defining for the future of Europe, it is Africa. There is no one else in the world that can take this responsibility – or wants to take this responsibility on their shoulders – other than Europe. This is our sister continent, a stone’s throw away from our shores, and if we do not work towards a collective responsibility for the future of both continents, then the troubles of Africa cannot be kept away from Europe, however high the fences you want to build. Only stability, prosperity, optimism and a future that people in Africa can believe in will create the necessary stability for Europe also to be stable, prosperous and free in the future. I call upon you, Pedro, to lead in Europe and to lead Europe to understand that this relationship with Africa should not just be an issue for Mediterranean Members of the European Union, but for every single Member State, whatever its position in the European Union.  In our budget, there will be an almost threefold increase in funding for migration and security to reach nearly EUR 33 billion. This will be especially important for Spain, not only because you have shown such responsibility and solidarity as concerns migrants, but also because you know all too tragically the horror of terrorist attacks on Spanish soil. Funding for research and innovation will also be increased by 50% and the new Digital Europe programme, with EUR 9 billion, will support Europe’s digital transformation. Both of these will provide real opportunities to further boost the productivity of the Spanish economy. We will build on the success of the Juncker Plan, which has already triggered more than EUR 46.2 billion of investment in Spain’s economy and supported almost 150 000 small businesses. It is already making a difference on the ground through cleaner, more efficient buses in Palma de Mallorca and a new mill for recycling paper in Zaragoza for example, creating 110 jobs in the local community and supporting Spain’s circular economy in the process.  Prime Minister, I know your Government’s strong attachment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and I know Spain needs to make that transformation, as Europe needs to make that transformation. I want to use the opportunity to salute my colleague here, next to me, who has been a leader in the world to make sure that Europe can really attain the Paris climate goals. I think he has been one of the global leaders in this respect and he deserves our recognition for that.  The new programme InvestEU has the potential to go much further by triggering another EUR 650 billion of investment across Europe between 2021 and 2027. Following in the footsteps of Manuel Marin, the founder of the Erasmus exchange programme, we will more than double its funding to more than EUR 30 billion. I had the pleasure of working with Manuel Marin in the past. If ever there was an explosive character, it was he, but he could get things done.  This increase will open up new opportunities for many more young Spaniards to gain new skills and experiences. All of us in the rest of Europe have had experience with young Spanish people coming to work in our countries and we were all inspired by their knowledge, their determination and their openness to differences. All of these investments can, and will, make a real difference on the ground in Spain and across our Union. So it is crucially important that we can agree on our new budget as swiftly as possible. I count on the support of Pedro, his counterparts and this House to make it happen. I also want to emphasise the importance of the equality agenda the Spanish Government has put forward. Why don’t we have a better plan to put an end to the pay gap in Europe between men and women? Why don’t we all agree that we will put an end to the pension gap, which is still 40% in Europe? Why don’t we all agree to break the glass ceiling and to make sure that more women are on boards? Why do we put 50% of our human potential on the back burner in Europe? This is unacceptable. I count on Pedro’s Government’s leadership to make this happen. Why don’t we finally put an end to violence against women? Why not? This is our duty. (Applause) And why don’t we call out those who falsely claim family values as an excuse to deny women their full rights in society? These are not family values, to say that women should not have full rights. These are not family values if you use them to justify violence in a marriage. Never ever can there be a justification for that.  Prime Minister, in my eyes, Spain and its European story are an example for the future of our Union. It shows what the values that we talk about really mean, and it shows how much can be achieved when we work together, take responsibility and make European solidarity truly meaningful. If Europe is to protect, then we need to protect Europe.

Your presence is a great kick-off for the year 2019 firstly because you as a person, as a leader, are a committed and clearly pro-European prime minister and politician and your country is clearly pro-European. Thatʼs why itʼs great to have you here. For Spain, Europe has meant peace, stability and prosperity for more than four decades, and for Europe, Spain means strength, fresh ideas and leadership. Thatʼs why itʼs great to have you here.  Secondly, itʼs great because 2019 is a year when we will celebrate democracy in the European Union. The European elections will take place.  I also thank you for your commitment on the so-called Spitzenkandidaten concept. To support Franz Timmermans in your capacity as a Socialist leader gives us a clear indication that you believe in a democratic idea for the future of Europe and we have to keep this alive after the elections too – like me? – ... as a reminder.  (Applause) Talking about the future of Europe, we have to speak about extremism and nationalism: thatʼs clear, bearing yesterdayʼs vote and the developments in Europe in mind.  Many of the founding fathers of this European dream were Christian Democrats, Liberals, and colleagues from your parties, the Socialists and Greens. We are in one boat, and the reason why the anti-Europeanists are attacking is that we represent everything that they hate. The extreme right is a danger. There is no doubt about this. But let me stress that extremists have no colour. You are a committed pro-European – there is no doubt about this – but your government could not exist without the support of the extreme left and the pro-separatists in the Spanish Parliament, and that worries us. The answer to populism, we believe, is first of all to create stability, to do a good job as politicians. Frans Timmermans praised the perfect – not perfect – but very good development of the Spanish economy during the last few years since the economic crisis.  I want to remind everybody that this was due to the efforts of Mariano Rajoyʼs Government to create the conditions for economic success in Spain. (Applause) And now you are considering going back on Mariano Rajoyʼs labour market reforms. That, we think, would be the wrong signal. To create opportunities for the future, to create an economic future, means to be ready for reforms, and a real social Europe means creating jobs and increasing peopleʼs income. So please donʼt follow the populists: keep the reforms in place. And the second thing which I want to underline is that we have the utmost respect for your Government, even if we donʼt share the same political values and ideas. But we are worried about political stability. For the moment you have been unable to secure a constructive and stable majority in your Parliament for a budget for 2019. You are representing one of the biggest economies in the European Union, in the eurozone, and such a big economy without a stable budget means less stability and more uncertainty. Thatʼs why this cooperation – this sum of the parts of the Spanish Parliament – is increasing uncertainty in Europe.  And then, finally, there is migration, which you mentioned. We as the EPP have a clear picture, a clear priority. The first way in which we care is with the Marshall Plan for Africa, with the idea of a strong and an ambitious resettlement programme. We want to help people from Syria and other regions who need our help. But one thing is clear: illegal migration has to be stopped.  We have to destroy the inhuman business model of the smugglers and send illegal migrants, after a fair procedure, back home. And Spain has a special responsibility: illegal crossings in Spain have doubled for the second consecutive year to 57 000 migrants. I very often hear the argument that it is difficult to protect the border. During the summer break last year I was on the other side of the continent on the Bulgarian-Turkish border. There the Prime Minister installed a 5 metre-high fence over more than 180 kilometres, and he showed that if you have the political will, then you can protect the border and stop illegal migrants from crossing borders, for example with a fence.  You do this as well in Ceuta and Melilla, so you have the same concept there. We are looking to you to fight extremists. We have to solve problems, and that means that we are looking to Spain to protect borders against illegal migrants. The extreme form of populism is nationalism. The old ghost is alive again, and in Spain it has a concrete name. It is a Catalan question. We as the EPP stand behind the Constitution of Spain. We stand behind the territorial integrity of Spain and we stand behind the Government in preserving the unity of Spain.  Europe is built upon the rule of law and Spain is built upon the rule of law. We stood beside the Rajoy Government and we would do the same for you if you needed us.  So thatʼs why we should together fight against the nationalists on this continent. My group, for example, voted here in this House in favour of a Communist Vice-President, but we refused to vote in favour of a far-right Vice-President of this House because we want to guarantee that nationalists will never have anything to say about the future of Europe. They are our enemies. Thank you very much for your presence. We have a lot to do. My group and I thank you for your clear determination in support of Spainʼs European path. The EPP has a clear direction: no more fears, but hope; no more egoism, but solidarity; no more nationalism, but a common European future. Thank you for your contribution.

Dear Pedro, I cannot help quoting you again: 'if Europe has to protect us, we have to protect Europe'. I wish that this would be the motto of all European governments. I wish that this would be the slogan of all European leaders and for it to become the new benchmark which everyone with political responsibilities in Europe has to live up to. But unfortunately we are far from that. And this is the very reason why we were looking forward to having you here, to listening to you, to this ambitious speech, to this passionate idea of justice and progress for our homeland, Europe. Unfortunately, Mr Weber, it is not as easy as you are. We are all in the same boat. But if we want to counter nationalism, if we want to prevent Europe from becoming the victim of the right-wing extremists, then this boat must also sail, it must develop a certain dynamism. And we must overcome the stalemate of the last few decades, where the people of Europe are waiting for us to deliver and that we take care of their jobs, their social situation, their pensions, their prospects in the modern world of work. That's the real problem, that everyone always says they're in a boat, but no one is developing the momentum of riding through the waves, through the dangers of this modern world. What are we waiting for? We know that on the other side is someone like Putin who has no interest in our idea of freedom. But we also know that on the other hand, there is Trump, who has no idea of our ability to organize social justice in our society. What are we waiting for? Why do we not ignite the dynamism that lies in European societies? I have to say here that I really liked what Pedro Sanchez said, because it is a programme to bring the European Union together in the light of the interests and fears that the people of Europe have. We need to learn to deliver again! That is the crucial point. I liked this speech, Pedro Sanchez, because it broadcast it, because it has sprayed what we need – and we also need it in the next five years of the new mandate. But I must honestly say that I also liked it because it was presented by the head of government of Spain, a country – and I would like to underline what Frans Timmermans said – in which the fate of Europe will be decided. A country with cultural wealth, a country that knows about its different roots, knows its history, a country that has overcome Franco – the authoritarian fascist regime – and has developed the democratic power to resist everything that wanted to move back to the time of injustice, to the time of the state of government, to the time of the abolition of democracy. We rely on Spain and we know that Spain is in good hands. The programme he has presented is a programme which my group accepts, which we ourselves draw up. Yes, we say we never want to talk about the economy again without the perspective of working people. But we cannot talk about the economy and work without acknowledging that there must be this change – a change that saves the planet. But this change will only succeed if we take people with us, if we give them hope, if we give them perspective, and it will not go against the people. Look at France and the experience that Mr Macron has had to have. We need to make people strong so that they can go through this change with us. That is why the social perspective, the social justice that we must establish, has a very crucial part to play. And to conclude: yes, it also depends on how we govern. The many news that have come from Madrid: that you, Pedro Sanchez, have succeeded in putting together an intelligent cabinet, a forward-looking cabinet, where competences are pooled, energy and the environment, a High Commissioner for the issue of sustainability and, finally, finally, a clear signal not only for gender equality, but a breach of the dam for qualified women in the front row. I would like to see more of this in Europe. I would like to congratulate you. We want to work together along the lines you drew today.

Sie hatten zur Zukunft von Europa gesprochen und Sie haben – ich finde zu Recht – Ihre Rede mit Ihren Gedanken zum Brexit ausgeführt.  Davor hat in dieser Diskussion Vizepräsident Timmermans seinen Dank gegenüber den britischen Soldaten ausgesprochen, die sein Land von den Nazis befreit haben. Herr Vizepräsident, mein Vater – ich bin Deutscher – ist im Krieg geblieben. Unser Haus wurde 1943 von den Briten zerbombt und ich muss Ihnen sagen: Ich bin froh darüber, dass wir – die Deutschen – die Schlacht um England verloren haben.  I’m happy we lost the Battle of Britain, but I tell you I will be totally destroyed if we lose the battle for Britain. Prime Minister, said earlier – and rightfully so – that Brexit is a lose-lose situation for both, not only for Britain, but also for the European Union. I believe it is a lose-lose situation economically, politically and morally. Economically, because Brexit is equivalent to 19 other countries leaving the European Union and the Common Market at the same time; politically because Britain has always been the voice of reason, of subsidiarity, of competitiveness and of decentralisation; and morally, because rightfully many people in this Parliament have said earlier that Brexit makes everybody poorer, so it is actually an immoral proposition. In the earlier discussions we heard, everybody here seemed to regret Brexit, except these people here to my left, but not a single person has offered anything to stop it. It’s time to do that. More than 140 Members of this Parliament earlier wrote a letter addressed to the people of Britain asking them to come up with a second vote. I support that. But they should have written the letter to themselves, because let’s not forget – contrary to what Mr Verhofstadt said – it’s not only a catfight within the Conservative Party, there was a reason for the British to start thinking about Europe.  In the Lisbon Treaty we talked about subsidiarity – and what was done? More and more centralisation. In the Lisbon Treaty we talked about competition – and what was done? The opposite: harmonisation. In the Lisbon Treaty we talk about self-responsibility of a country for its debts – and what are we doing? We are trying to socialise them. So there are good reasons for this Parliament, the Commission and the Council to start doing something else.  I agree with everybody who said that it is unlikely we will come up with a new deal that will help Theresa May get the support of Parliament, so let’s change the strategy. Let’s offer Britain a deal which enables Britain to stay in the European Union. That is the call of the day, and not moaning and blaming Britain. It is also up to us to agree that we have a responsibility for Brexit. So let’s offer a new deal to Britain for them to stay in the European Union, and that can only be a special temporary deal on immigration. So that’s what I’m saying. Instead of always blaming Britain, let’s also recognise that Europe and Brussels are part of the problem. They should become part of the solution. Let’s fight a battle for Britain.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 56, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Guy Verhofstadt", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, I will try to say this in four minutes because I have a Catalan colleague and a Basque colleague who want to speak and I do not want to be killed afterwards.  But, Prime Minister, there is one underexposed characteristic of Spain which you too have demonstrated, namely that it is maybe for the moment the most pro-European country in Europe because it has the guts to talk about a federal Europe. There are not so many of your colleagues who are come here and have the courage to talk about a federal Europe. This is no accident. The reason, I think, is that European history and Spanish democracy are interlinked. Over the last decades those who have taken responsibility in your foreign affairs departments were all Members of this House: Íñigo Méndez de Vigo, Ms Mendez de Vigo, Ms Palacio, Josep Borrell, my good friend, who was a former civil servant, and Miguel Moratinos. Last but not least, there is competition in Spanish politics to be the most pro-European party between the Partido Popular, the PSOE, and Ciudadanos, and I like that. I like to see national political parties in every country in the European Union competing among themselves to be the most pro-European. That’s the way forward. But I have to tell you that after – I don’t know – the 15th debate that we have had on the future of the European Union, I am a little frustrated because every time there is a prime minister, or a president, who comes here to make a whole list of all the new European policies that we need to have – social policies, tax policies, migration policies, or a European army – and we never tackle the question why doesn’t it happen today? What is the obstacle? Why do we always do too little too late compared, for example, with our American friends, who in nine months can tackle the financial crisis, whereas after nine years we still do not have a banking union?  (inaudible) after several years of an enormous tragedy in the Mediterranean, I want to congratulate you on the way that you dealt with the Aquarius refugees, but let’s be honest: that was the consequence of inhumane nationalistic policies by Mr Salvini, who was the real source and reason in that case, and of the lack of European policies. Why do we still not have a European border in Ceuta? Why do we still not have an agreement on the reform of Dublin, for example, after so many years of tragedies in the Mediterranean? Why do we today not have a European army? Why are we still struggling with the reform of the eurozone nine years after the start of the financial crisis? That is, for me, the key question and I hope that in your reply in a few minutesʼ time you will go into it. To my mind the problem is that for the moment we have bad institutions in the European Union and bad institutions create bad results. Good institutions create good results. The problem – and I want to repeat this again and again and again, and will continue to do so, together with a number of you –is the unanimity rule that exists in our Union and especially in the European Council: that is the main problem which has to be solved.  (Applause) That’s the main problem. The imbalance that exists between the European Parliament deciding by a majority and the European Council that continues to act unanimously. All five of the examples that I have given are blocked in the European Council. So my plea to you, now and in the coming years, is to take up this political battle that we need to win, as otherwise all our long lists will be wish lists that will never be realised. Mr President, I think that I have for the first time done something which is impossible, namely to keep more or less to my four minutes.

We see many governments who are actually falling short of providing rule of law and progress on democracy in their countries. So it’s good to see that things can be done differently – very good to see. Let me congratulate you specifically on some of the measures that have already been taken in Spain, which reflect the commitments you were voicing here. Namely, first, your decision to increase the minimum salary to EUR 900, which helps many families who suffered considerably in the past from the budgetary cuts and anti—social reforms, and also, especially, in combination with your taxation reform, which will be a great improvement. We want a true social union, and for that we need more effort in the Council and in every single Member State, so I really hope that others will follow your example. Secondly, your decision to make sure that families who put up solar panels on their roofs will actually benefit from doing so is a way not only to combat climate change but also to reward people for their own initiative and make sure that everyone will contribute in this big quest to save our planet. We need these concrete steps. Lastly, I’m very happy that, as you also mentioned today, your cabinet has the highest proportion of women in the whole European Union. Women’s rights are human rights, and we’re still far from real gender equality but we need to take progressive steps here. We are seeing a big backlash in many Member States inside the European Union against women’s rights, against human rights, and it’s very good to see that there are still some governments left who can champion an ambitious agenda on gender equality. However, your job in Spain is certainly not an easy one and, of course, you’ve inherited a lot of problems, among them the situation in Catalunya. The harsh and uncompromising way in which your conservative predecessor dealt with the issue hardened the conflict and made it worse. Now the issue is on your desk, and it’s very clear that only a democratic political solution can open the way forward, and this includes a solution for the prisoners. Two former members of our political group are currently in prison and what they’re accused of does not stand up to scrutiny, as has been pointed out by courts in Belgium and in Germany. So we urge you to initiate a sincere dialogue because only goodwill from both sides will bring us closer to a solution, and that is sorely needed for Catalunya, for the whole of Spain and for the whole of Europe. Prime Minister, you mentioned European values and how all of us need to stand up for them. I am very concerned in that regard when I look at Andalusia because an extremist right—wing party will be included in a governmental deal and tolerated in the government. I am sad to see that the conservatives and liberals are agreeing to a deal which will not only make sure that those nationalists have a say in our future and the future in Andalusia, but which also goes beyond that context. I am sure that many of you are concerned about that. I’m sure that many of you are not happy about it, but it is something on which, precisely, you can take concrete action, and all of us and all our groups have to work towards ensuring that this does not happen – because it’s a shameful deal, as it would be for any one of us to make a coalition with an extremist, nationalist, right—wing party. Let’s not do that. Use all the powers that you have in your hands – and you have those powers – to end that deal. We support the women who are protesting right now for gender equality because machismo and violence against women have no place anywhere in the European Union. I would like to remind you, Prime Minister, that many of the goals that you mentioned – all of them, in fact: gender equality, ecology and social Europe – need action at European level, so we hope you will take the initiative in the Council as well. We hope for your support in the Council, and we hope your colleagues in the Council will follow your example.

A more necessary debate than ever before in the face of the push of far-right populist forces, which are whipping Europe, including Spain.  However, beyond whether or not it coincides with your diagnosis of the dangers and threats that plague the European Union, I have to disagree on the solutions that you and other European leaders have brought to this Parliament. With reference to the far right, these formations of fascist tendencies, must be confronted and fought from the root. The origin and breeding ground for the emergence of these phenomena lies in the leave of functions that many governments have done with regard to their obligations to the working class.  I don't need to remind you how neoliberal policies driven from Brussels have only reduced the already diminished welfare state. The crisis has heightened existing problems, and crisis management is responsible for unsustainable inequality. With their policies, at the service of the privileged, they have caused enormous social pain and a crisis of legitimacy.  The Governments of Spain, no matter their color, have been participants and collaborators of the bitter moments we live in. Express constitutional reform involved cuts in health, education, pensions, dependency and two labour reforms that are extremely harmful to workers. This is something that can't happen again. They have created a perfect storm for the far right to take advantage of the defenselessness and despair of the social majority and offer false enemies and false solutions.  Mr Sánchez, the European Union today has more than 140 million poor people and precarious workers, also the result of the territorial asymmetry of the productive model with which southern Europe is punished. We are condemned to subsidiary models based on cheap labour and little added value. Today we have thousands of people whose jobs are pending a thread because in their companies, or they are not paid, or they will be kicked out with an employment regulation file.  There's Alcoa: they've reached a pre-agreement with the unions. I hope you ratify it. Vodafone, Deliveroo, Globe, Amazon. The list is too long to read whole. This is the result of leaving democracy in the hands of the interests of multinationals, when the priority is the real problems of citizens, wherever they live and wherever they are. That is why public policies, which promote quality employment and prevent labour exploitation in any of the Member States, must be promoted. Because, so far, the free movement of capital has been in parallel with the free movement of poverty and inequality.  Do not continue to agree on economic policies with the right, do not continue to weaving sterile alliances, tend from now on to the problems affecting the working class. We don't need good intentions. We need commitments. For example, for social policy to become the axis of European policies, will it force ratification of the European Social Charter? That's a good social contract. What are you prepared to do to make the European Union's foreign policy a factor of credibility without contradictions, as in the case of Western Sahara or Palestine?  Ended. Derogue the begging vote and reform the Organic Law of the Electoral Regime. And finally, equality between women and men is threatened. The gap is suffered by women. It is structural and occurs in all areas. But we're not going to give in to it. We will continue to fight to defend our interests as women.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 59, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Laura Ferrara", "mepid": "124833", "text": "  EFDD Group. – Mr President, Mr Prime Minister, thank you very much for being here with us today.  This is the fifteenth debate on the future of the European Union that we are holding here in the European Parliament. For the fifteenth time we must repeat that the Union is undoubtedly going through a moment of extreme difficulty and, for the fifteenth time, we have to wonder why. Our answer is always the same: wrong policies lead to harm and injustice. I'll cite only two examples.  Austerity policies have caused enormous damage to our society. Yesterday President Juncker admitted in plenary that these austerity policies have caused some damage.  It's called \"better late than never.\" But not here, we've spent the maximum time here. We have created economies that have dismantled the system of protection of workers and the most vulnerable categories, leaving the needs of those living in difficulty dissatisfied.  Talking about social justice, respect for human dignity, the drama of poverty, lack of work and social exclusion that millions of European citizens live on does not mean being populist, but means taking note of reality and giving immediate answers.  Juncker, Commissioners, enjoy these last few months that the Commission has left, because the next elections will bring a wind of change not only to this House, but to the whole Commission.  The second example of the wrong policies I want to cite concerns migration policies. Here, the failure of the Union — a Union of name and not indeed — is evident.  The lack of a common position on the equitable sharing of responsibilities and solidarity in asylum and migration policies among all Member States has sunk the reform of the common European asylum system. These two principles are laid down in Article 80 of the Treaty, but have already given way to national selfishness. This means that the highest levies on the management of migration flows fall mainly on border states and on few (incomprehensible words) collaborators. The European Union's failure in these policies has a very large impact on fundamental rights and also in terms of social and economic costs, estimated annually at around EUR 49 million, according to a recent study. It is no coincidence that you have cited these two examples, Mr Prime Minister: Spain and Italy are two Mediterranean countries that have matching interests, such as managing migration flows and the economy.  You and I are an expression of two different political forces. However, our countries should work together to combat austerity and find solutions to the migration crisis. On this issue, the whole European Union should give signs of life; and we, ladies and gentlemen, should give other signals to the citizens.  Citizens ask us for concrete facts and answers. For example, we could start by killing the waste. We are going to start a great fight against the collapses of the Union, and let us do so on the part of this Parliament here of this useless and unjustifiable triple seat.  Maintaining Strasbourg costs citizens up to 1 billion euros for each legislature, or 200 million euros each year to be open forty-eight days a year. With what face and with what encouragement can we justify these huge figures to our citizens? It's not possible.  Ladies and gentlemen, asking for the cancellation of this waste is not an attack on democracy, and democracy is not a privilege, nor is it a building.  Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Prime Minister, on one side are decimals, austerity, waste, privilege; and in the other are the citizens and the request for change. People must be put at the heart of European Union policies and decisions. Respect for the rights and well-being of all citizens must be put first and not sacrificed in the name of certain economic and financial interests that benefit few people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 60, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Nicolas Bay", "mepid": "124760", "text": "  on behalf of the ENF group. Mr President, Prime Minister, less than a year ago you were accidentally at the helm of Spain thanks to the scandal that has engulfed Mariano Rajoy. Your arrival was miraculous for the Spanish Socialist Party, which has only 80 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, but disastrous for the Spaniards who are now suffering from your politics. Your first step was to welcome the Aquarius, the ship of a Franco-German NGO, whose trade fund is to support illegal immigration in the Mediterranean. Mafias that thrive on human trafficking use and abuse the naivety of Europeans. Smugglers are the main beneficiaries of these so-called humanitarian operations, which allow them to save money on the fuel of their makeshift boats, where they pile up migrants. Mr Macron and Mrs Merkel, delighted to receive this unexpected support for their crazy migration policy, were obviously quick to congratulate you. Last summer, you twice received Mrs Merkel, the second time, for that matter, at your summer residence in Andalusia. Without consulting the Spaniards, you have reached an agreement with the Chancellor to recover the overflow of migrants which she finally wants to offload after opening its borders wide in 2015.  In your zeal, you did not even realize that you were treating Morocco as an underdeveloped country by referring, I quote, to an \"abyss of inequality\". However, your predecessors have concluded several agreements with this country, the most stable and prosperous in the Maghreb, including an agreement on the readmission of illegal immigrants, which is all the more important since only 14 kilometers separate southern Spain from northern Morocco. But after showing your willingness to welcome illegal immigrants, they obviously rushed to your doors and we saw chaotic scenes of migrants rushing to Ceuta and Melilla attacking your border guards, including sometimes with weapons. Submitted to Berlin, you are also in Brussels. And for a long time now. In 2011, in the discretion of the summer and under your leadership, the Socialist Party decided to support a major change in the Spanish constitution. Since then, any government has been obliged by its own constitution to comply with the European Commission's budgetary injunctions.  But the Spanish people are waking up. Since the beginning of December, a party that your friends have treated condescendingly has made a historic breakthrough in your Andalusian stronghold. I am obviously talking about Vox, which, as part of a coalition, has helped to free up the Socialists who have held this region for 40 years. And this is just the beginning, because Santiago Abascal puts you in front of your responsibilities: in 2018, because of you, the arrivals of migrants have increased by 129% compared to 2017. Conversely, in Matteo Salvini's Italy, illegal immigration has fallen by more than 95% because the message is clear: Italians can no longer stand the violation of their laws by arriving illegally on their territory. This is all the less so since the mafia - the real one, the one against which Matteo Salvini fights tirelessly - exploits human misery in all these traffickings. A recent article in The Guardian newspaper reported that migrant trafficking was more profitable than drug trafficking. Not to mention multinationals that often welcome the arrival of cheap labour.  Prime Minister, solving the migration problem is only a matter of political will, because the men of the Guardia Civil are just as competent and determined as their Italian counterparts. But instead of relying on them, you preferred to announce before Christmas the creation of a special fund dedicated to the integration of migrants.

I would like to start by thanking the Prime Minister for speaking out and, on this occasion, to pay tribute to Spain, because I understand that every head of government here represents not so much his political party – this debate is too partisan – but his country. So I would like to warmly congratulate Spain on all its efforts, that it can celebrate the 40th anniversary of its constitution and that it has saved its integrity under previous governments. Mr Verhofstadt sees in your speech an expression of federalist doctrine. I am a convinced European, but I believe that Europe today needs realism and a more practical approach, greater respect for countries, competitiveness of the economy, a retreat from centralism. That is what I missed in your speech. I would also like to say that the idea of solidarity must be understood very precisely. Solidarity is a need, a necessity to come to the aid of others, especially when it is in an unhappy state through no fault of its own. But solidarity is not paying for the waste of others. Europe needs financial responsibility. This responsibility lies with the Member States. And I hope that Spain will, in a practical sense, be a partner for talking about a more realistic approach to European policy than what the Prime Minister presented today in his speech.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 62, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Pedro Sánchez Pérez-Castejón", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  President of the Government of Spain – Mr President, thank you to all the participants and thank you also for the tone of the debate, which has been encouraged as each of the interventions has been aroused and developed. I am going to be allowed by the spokespersons of the various groups to answer them as a whole and not personally, because I believe that if we would not over-extend the answer to their questions. The central idea of intervention, of all the time, is that Europe must be protected in order for Europe to protect us. And that is clearly what has flown in many of the interventions, at least those of the main parliamentary groups. We all agree that we need to strengthen Europe, above what the ideological discrepancies we have. The question is in what sense, in what direction. I want to refer first of all to migration. I would say to Mr Weber that it is right for him to move the vision of the People's Party of Spain, but it would be good if he also knew and contrasted that information, because migration did not come with the Socialist Government last June. For an idea to be made, in 2017 the increase in migration flows in Spain was 137%. 137%. Therefore, what came with the Government of Spain was not migration, it was migration policy, which did not exist until then; that didn't exist until then. What I will tell you, and what I will also say to the other Members, is that we have always known, we have always known – and that is why we also take the decision to host the Aquarius, to offer as a safe port Valencia – that the challenge of migration requires all countries, all Member States, to have a shared position , a common position, based on two fundamental axes. The first, responsibility and the second, solidarity.  Of course we, and the Government of Spain, are defending a policy, a foreign policy like the one raised by the Vice-President of the European Commission. It argues that we need to dump economic resources for Africa's development and momentum. It advocates bilateral cooperation with many of the countries of transit and origin of migration. We have strengthened bilateral dialogue with Morocco, Mauritania, all the Sahel countries in seven months, not only in the interests of Spain, but in the interests of the European Union as a whole. To get an idea, Spain, for many years, has had return policies, with Morocco, with Mauritania and with so many other countries in Africa, of the Sahel. In fact, a few days ago I was in Mali, where we also promoted, or somehow reopened, a policy of voluntary return of Mali nationals who are living in Spain right now. Therefore, return policies are being promoted by the Government of Spain.  We are also strengthening our border policies. And, without a doubt, what we are doing is also strengthening integration policies, because we believe it is important to strengthen these migration policies for all those migrants who are on our continent. And, without a doubt, what I want to transfer to you in this matter is that we are, the Government of Spain is, of course, in favour of reforming the common European asylum system and not questioning Schengen, and, by the way, I am concerned that minority parties, ladies and gentlemen will not do so. It has been made by parties that are part of large parties in the European Parliament, such as the People's Party. And I don't think we can do any throwbacks on that. That is why what concerns me, speaking and simply referencing the far-right, what worries me is not so much the presence of the far-right, ladies and gentlemen, what concerns me is how subtly the far-right is conditioning the discourse and political agenda of parties that were again European and which wanted the strengthening of the European project. This Government , and I recognise its oratory brilliance, Mr Verhofstadt , this Government certainly supports the adoption of the multiannual financial framework. We have also done so at the European Council. We have defended and defended in particular, and not only I, also the previous government, with President Rajoy at the helm, approved the Multiannual Financial Framework before the elections. Because we consider it to be fundamental to essential policies in Spain, such as agricultural policy, such as cohesion policy, but also important policies, such as immigration policy or policies related to science and innovation. By the way, Mr Weber, don't worry, because we are going to approve the general budgets of the State probably in April. The previous administration, with Mr. Rajoy at the helm, presented the budgets at the Congress of Deputies in April. So what I want to say to you with this is that it is not that we are going in a timely way, but that we are going to anticipate what the previous administration proposed as a budget offer to the House as a whole. And I think we are going to take it out, because I think they are good budgets, not only in the social sphere, with a considerable increase in the items linked to redistribution, but they also propose innovative formulas from the point of view of tax justice, such as the imposition on large technology corporations, such as the creation of the financial transaction tax , which are undoubtedly some of the measures that you have proposed here in this House and which we are also leading at the level of Spain. Let me also speak for an instant about Catalonia, because this is how the spokeswoman, Mrs Keller, has done so.  First of all. In Catalonia, since 2014, since 2014, there have been five votes, five votes, around three regional electoral processes and then two referendums contravening the Constitution, the Statute of Autonomy in Catalonia. Well, what has been the result of these referendums and those votes also in the Spanish statutory context? At most, 48% of Catalan society has supported pro-independent formations and 52% have not supported pro-independent formations. Therefore, first conclusion: independence in Catalonia does not have a social majority. It has a parliamentary majority, product and derived from the Electoral Law, but does not have a social majority. I insist 52% of society in Catalonia does not support independence, it does not support independence. Well, therefore, independence has to recognize is that there is no social majority in Catalonia. And, therefore, it cannot support, or cannot impose a political project on a majority that is repeatedly telling it, since 2014, that it does not share this independence drift. First. Secondly. It is clear that, in Europe, not only in Catalonia, if we go, for example, to Germany, in Bavaria, or if we go, for example, to Italy, in Veneto, or if we go, for example, to France, in Corsica, there are territorial tensions, there are movements of territorial fragmentation, of decomposition of what were the state nations. What is the difference between what has happened in Catalonia and what has happened in Veneto, for putting a case, or for example in Bavaria, when the independence of Bavaria from Germany or the independence of Veneto from Italy have been defended by different political formations? That when the Constitutional Court or the Supreme Court has ruled in Veneto, rather, in Italy with the Veneto case or in Germany with the case of Bavaria, those independence forces have said is 'we abide by those judgments'. It hasn't happened in Spain. In Spain, despite repeated rulings of the Constitutional Court, what the pro-independence formations have done is unilaterally break the Statute of Autonomy, that is, the regional constitution in Catalonia and the Spanish Constitution. Therefore, the problem is that, in some way, the constitutional mandate has not been fulfilled or not complied with by the independence forces, because that regional and state constitution has not been recognized. Thirdly, it is clear that since 2010 Catalonia has a regional Constitution, a Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, which in its entirety was not voted by Catalan society. So that's a problem we have to solve. And the Spanish state is aware of it. One thing is also true. For ten years to this part, it is clear that there are political parties that, when in opposition, use Catalonia as a territorial grievance to make opposition to the socialist government on duty and, when they are in government, what they do is claim loyalty, in this case, to the Socialist Party. We're always going to do it. We're going to be loyal, not with the government on duty, when we're in opposition, but with the state. Spain is a great country. Spain is a country that has a level of decentralization, economically, socially, culturally, in the recognition of languages, in what represents the educational approach of children who are in communities that have a high feeling of very important nationality. There are indices in the international community that are not minor and quite solvent, by the way, that place Spain as the second most decentralized country in the world. Therefore, first of all, I think it is clear that independence in Catalonia has to do is open a sincere dialogue and recognize the other party, which is a majority in Catalonia, which is non-nationalist, and therefore Catalonia has to talk to Catalonia. And Spain, the Government of Spain, has to facilitate that dialogue between the two, say, the two dimensions that exist right now in Catalonia: the nationalist and the non-nationalist. And, of course, what I can guarantee you is that the Government of Spain, unlike in past times, does have a firm will to resolve through dialogue, but always in compliance with the Constitution and the Statute of Autonomy, the situation in Catalonia. But first, what independence has to do in Catalonia is to recognize 1, that it has no social majority and 2, that it has to talk to the majority part of Catalan society, that it wants a new agreement to get out of this loop in which it has been installed for more than ten years. To be summarized in a very synthetic, very simple way, in Catalonia the problem is not independence, it is coexistence. And finally, you have made, Mr Weber, an allusion to the motion of censure. The motion of censure had a mandate, which was democratic regeneration in our country. What has happened in Andalusia between the People's Party, the Liberal Group and the Brothers of the National Front in France is an involution, a question of rights and consensus assumed and consolidated during recent years, such as gender equality and the fight against gender-based violence. Therefore, in Andalusia, what has happened, ladies and gentlemen, is that a border that exists in Europe has crossed, which is that it cannot be agreed with the far right. Of course, we, social democracy, will never agree with the far-right one, as we have very well seen with its approaches. In any case, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to tell you that the approach of the Government of Spain is to make Europe strong. There are the proposals that we have put forward in terms of the strategy of gender equality, in what represents equality, or rather, the fight against occupational precariousness, which represents the guarantee of children, the guarantee of youth. In short, in all those aspects that have to do with the strengthening and protection of Europe to protect us and, above all, those most vulnerable will be able to find the Government of Spain and, without a doubt, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which is also represented here. And finally, Mr Verhofstadt, I will also tell you one thing: you have been in the European Parliament many more years than I have. I have been at the head of the Spanish government for seven months. I'm sure you can share your experience of frustration with me. I will also tell you one thing: I believe that in my speech I have pointed out some way out of this lack of speed in many of the decision-making that is needed in the field of economic and monetary union, in the field of foreign policy, which has to do with the change in decision-making procedures, both of the Council and Parliament and the Commission. And, of course, there we are going to be, so I have done from this rostrum, arguing that it is not unanimously on matters as essential as the ones I have referred to above. There are some of them that will need an amendment to the Treaty, but others will not. There are the catwalks reminded me of by the Foreign Minister, Mr Borrell. We can perfectly use these gateways to reinforce, say, the global character of our continent, of our Union in the field of foreign policy.

First, I want to thank you for the tone; secondly, I also thank you — why not say it — for the intensity of the interventions, because I believe that it also encourages the debate, especially after having to listen to many interventions, a significant number of interventions of different signs and different orientations.  If it seems to you, what I will do will logically be to answer you as a whole, not individually, and I will also do so around two axes which I think you can sum up not only the spirit of my first speech, but also the spirit and content of the responses in this reply to the interventions of each Of The Members: firstly, , multilateralism and, secondly, as a Spanish socialist MEP has said before, federalism.  With regard to multilateralism, I said in my first speech, ladies and gentlemen, that the Government of Spain believes, defends Agenda 2030, not only from the point of view of a political agenda of transformation at national level, but we also believe that in the next decade the European Union has to be the great ambassador, the great activist of the 2030 Agenda in the multilateral order.  There is, for example, this 2030 Agenda, which makes a closed and unequivocal defense of gender equality; is absolutely incarnating with the approach I have made to all of you in relation to the European Gender Equality Strategy. Or also what we are doing at the Spanish level with the adoption of a series of measures related to the fight against gender-based violence, but also with the implementation of the State Pact against gender-based violence or the adoption of laws that reduce the gender pay gap, and labour equality between men and women.  In this matter, I would also like to say one thing: there have been some people who have spoken of unemployment, which is absolutely unacceptable still in Spain, in comparative terms with other countries of the European Union and in terms of average of the euro area and the European Union. But I will also tell you one thing: right now in Spain there are around 19 million affiliates and affiliates, and it is the first time in the history of Social Security that 48% of social security members in our country are women. More than eight million women have found work, are affiliated with Social Security and are integrated into the labour market.  I will also tell you one thing: the move that the Government of Spain has approved to increase the interprofessional minimum wage by 22%, that is, the most important increase that has been taken since 1977 in the history of our country, in the democratic history of our country, benefits, by 70%, especially women, who are the ones who are charging , unfortunately, a lower salary and are therefore the perceptors of the interprofessional minimum wage.  Therefore, gender equality, child poverty...  The fight against child poverty is also one of the main axes of the 2030 Agenda. We here have not only raised to the House the need to reinforce this proposal for the 'child guarantee', but we are also raising the same thing at the level of Spain.  In the general budgets of the State that we presented in the Courts last Monday, what we do is a determined commitment in the fight against child poverty, reinforcing – and much – everything related to child guarantee — if we could call it or translate it this way – in the field of Spanish politics.  With regard to climate change, there have been some stakeholders who have spoken about the degree of commitment of the Government of Spain in relation to this issue. We will approve in a very short period of time, I hope, in the General Courts, presented by the Government of Spain, a climate change law, a national ecological transition plan or strategy, where, if I may say so, one of the fundamental issues — at least for the Government of Spain — is that this transition is fair, that is, that those mining basins , those areas of Spain where there is a strong presence of thermal power plants can find opportunities and that, logically, make understandable to those affected, the main affected, the need to make that transition.  And finally, reference has been made to a comprehensive package of rights, of freedoms which, unfortunately, during seven years of conservative rule were launched by the previous Administration.  There has been talk of the 'gag law', there has also been talk of everything that has to do with labour reform and the labour rights of workers in our country.  And two questions. The first, in relation to the \"gag law\". It is currently in the process of amendments, in presentation at the Congress of Deputies, and I hope that it can be resolved and approved by the General Courts at the session to be opened from February. Secondly, with regard to labour rights, I would like to tell you that the Government of Spain has promoted social dialogue, which has approved in seven months – in just seven months – a youth employment plan to reduce the youth unemployment rate by three years by ten points and mobilize EUR 2 billion.  We have also approved a plan to combat labour exploitation, a plan to combat labour precariousness, which has brought out more than 50,000 jobs, which were not, say, in line with our country's legislation and are now indefinite hires.  And finally, I would also like to tell you, in this area, that you know that self-employed people, that is to say, employed workers in our country, who amount to more than three million people, men and women, thanks to an agreement we have reached with trade unions and employers in just seven months have been strengthened by all the social guarantees linked to unemployment benefit and also to coverage in accidents at work , et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And we have done this, logically, with the hand of social agents and also entrepreneurs. Therefore, multilateralism, a clear social agenda on the part of the Government of Spain, not only at European level, but also at national level, and I also wanted to make two added reflections that have emerged in line with the interventions.  With regard to foreign policy and linked to Venezuela, I would like to tell you that the Government of Spain, but I too, as leader of the opposition before elected president of the Government, did not recognize the legitimacy of the Venezuelan elections, nor have we acknowledged the Maduro regime at all. The proof is that we have not been present at the inauguration. We have consistently called on, on the recurring occasions, for the Maduro regime to release political prisoners – there are political prisoners there. Thanks to the good efforts of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, we have also managed to enable some political prisoners – the last, a young boy with which I had the opportunity to meet – and, without a doubt, the approach that the Government of Spain has with the question of Venezuela is to try to forge an alliance, a group to facilitate dialogue , both in European countries and in Lima Group countries.  I would also like to make a point. France has not participated in the decision taken by the Lima Group, and I can also assure you that the Government of Spain is not in that idea. The Spanish Government is trying to build a facilitation group which, precisely, it does is allow a dialogue to resolve, once and for all, the Venezuelan crisis.  I was surprised that when we talk about Venezuela, let us not talk about the migration crisis in Venezuela, because one of the main – say – affected are our asylum offices in Spain, because there are many Venezuelans and Venezuelans who are seeking asylum in our country. But neither of the migration crisis that exists throughout the Latin American continent and, in particular, in Colombia, in Peru, in Brazil, in Chile..., in many countries with which I have had the opportunity to meet during these seven months as president of the Government.  I have to tell you that, at the Foreign Affairs Council, the Foreign Minister – and also the Government of Spain as a whole – has advocated the unlocking of economic resources to help these countries to be able to manage in a at least reasonable way the huge amount of migration flows that are reaching those countries and, in the first place, Colombia which , logically, it has all our support.  On the Canary Islands, I would just like to tell you that the Government of Spain..., that thanks also to this Government, the renewal of the Statute of the Canary Islands has been processed in just over seven months and all the agreements that were pending to be signed have been signed in a timely and form. Therefore, it is not that we believe in the outermost regions, not that we believe in the opportunities, in the rights of the Canary Islands, but that we are exercising them with the signing, for example, of a road agreement for 1.8 billion euros – nothing more and nothing less – to be managed by the Canary Government.  And finally, I would like to reflect, a global reflection on some of the interventions most linked to the People's Party and also to the question of Catalonia.  I said it in the Spanish Parliament. I would also like to raise it with the Members of the European People's Parliament who are of my nationality, who are Spanish. I want to tell you that, right now, the right agenda is being set by the far right. And it is being marked by the far right on two fundamental issues that are typical when the right is in opposition: the first, territorial grievance and using Catalonia, that is, coexistence and territorial cohesion, as an element and as an ariete to make opposition to the Government of Spain.  The Government of Spain , the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party – is and will always be loyal to the Constitution. And we are in opposition and we are in government.

Despite the welcome effort to simplify the mixed architecture of territorial cooperation programmes, the Commission's proposal for a new regulation contained a number of critical issues, on which we have successfully intervened, both in the amending phase and in the negotiation phase, the result of which is reflected in the consolidated text as voted in the Committee on Regional Development.  Firstly, the report adopted has brought cross-border maritime programmes under the first axis. The change of architecture proposed by the Commission, which provided for only component two, transnational, for maritime cooperation programmes, was not only not functional to the needs of the regions, but was also not supported by sufficient elements, to introduce a radical change and thus undermine those maritime cooperation programmes, which are so important and strategic for Italy and other countries.

Because we have states such as Bulgaria where there is low taxation and this has negative consequences for the prefecture of Evros, Drama and Serres, which are adjacent to Bulgaria, and this creates, one might say, a tax dumping.

When this Parliament adopted the resolution on European conscience and totalitarianism 10 years ago, we launched the debate on forming a common reading on the history of Europe with condemnation of all totalitarian regimes of the twentieth century. By putting up a sign of equality between the suffering caused by both fascism and national socialism and communism. By rethinking them and learning from the tragic events of the history of the Western European peoples, as well as from the history of the peoples of Eastern Europe.  Lessons to be learned to promote democracy, the european unity we need today, the rule of law, respect for human dignity and freedom. At the same time, lessons have been learned to prevent the rise of hatred, xenophobia, the sowing of authoritarian or totalitarian ideas in European societies. Ten years later, my personal assessment is that for various reasons this debate did not take place. During this period, the European Union faced new challenges that it would surely have responded to more successfully if it had learned lessons from history. I think Europe today needs a restart of the debate. Right now, we're not doing enough to deal with the resurrection of the spirits of the past. Nationalism and populism are reinforced by a lack of memory and understanding of our history, the role of European integration in overcoming the deep wounds of totalitarian regimes in Europe. Singly enough to look at some countries where, frustrated by the precarious economic present and social inequality, young people support extremist far-right or far-left parties to see how great the danger of repeating the tragic mistakes of the past is. That is why it is so important to convey memory so that young Europeans do not become victims of political players who offer easy solutions to very complex societal problems. When we do not pass on the memory of past events, we allow young generations to be misled with propaganda and disinformation campaigns, both for national socialism and for communist regimes, who still enjoy nostalgia for not knowing about the scale and duration of their crimes. What this leads to is what we see very clearly in Russia and in other countries where there are worrying trends for an increase in nostalgia for Stalinism. There are different policies that individual Member States of the European Union implement, but one of them is universal and can be a model anywhere. And that's education. Through education, subsequent generations of Europeans, whether in Western, Central, Eastern, Northern or Southern Europe, need to get an idea of totalitarian regimes in the twentieth century and know that millions have been sacrificed for the freedom, democracy, human rights they have today. To know that freedom is not a given, and as Ronald Reagan used to say, is always a generation away from extinction and must be defended. Yesterday in this chamber we solemnly celebrated the 20th anniversary of the introduction of the euro, but it is worth remembering that the European Union is not only a common market and currency, but above all a guarantor of freedom, peace, democracy and respect for human rights on our continent. The European Union is a response to the horrors of totalitarianism, which oppressed and limited at the cost of millions of innocent victims, destruction and immeasurable suffering. Today, as we face the challenges of protecting our value system, we must, more than ever, aware of the threats of a lack of historical memory. Let us, with the help of education, preserve this unique project for the next generations of Europeans, instead of allowing them to fall victim to ignorance and manipulations that stubbornly plant nostalgia for bygone times of totalitarian regimes.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 137, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Melania Ciot", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, the topic of our debate today touches on the very core of our Union and what it stands for. The authoritarian and totalitarian regimes across Europe in the last century remain a dark chapter in our continent’s history. Our Union is based on the common values and the general principles of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights. Its aim is to uphold and promote these values, which, as we are all well aware, have been increasingly challenged in recent years. Fortunately, younger generations have not suffered under totalitarian regimes, yet there is now a risk that we are taking these common values and principles for granted. Our common values have enabled the longest period of peace in Europe. They remain a cornerstone of our democratic societies and they need to be safeguarded and constantly nurtured. Today we face a number of challenges that put our open societies at risk, be it through xenophobia, divisive nationalism, discrimination, disinformation or violent radicalisation, to name just a few. If we are fully to understand the present, an awareness and understanding of the past is crucial. A lack of knowledge about the origins of the Union and about the way in which it works increases the risk of discrimination. It also prevents citizens from developing informed opinions on the actions that the Union takes. On the other hand, knowledge about the diversity, heritage and traditions within the Union and its Member States promotes mutual respect, understanding and cooperation, which in turn can strengthen a common sense of belonging. We know that education can play a crucial role in promoting our common values and in promoting a better understanding of the Union and of each other. We are also all well aware that the Union’s competence in the field of education is limited and that Member States remain fully responsible for their education systems and for the design of their curricula. However, at a time when Europe is looking to the future and seeking to re-engage its citizens, especially young people, around an agenda of shared values, we believe it is important to create a sense of belonging among Europeans. In this spirit, the Member States have therefore made a number of commitments, as evidenced in various political statements, be they Council conclusions or recommendations, which provide a strong basis for cooperation in this area. At the Gothenburg Summit in November 2017, the EU heads of state and government chose education and culture as the first subject to be addressed under the new Leaders’ Agenda, underlining their resolution to do more in these areas. The Gothenburg discussions were followed by the conclusions of the European Council of December 2017, which highlighted how education and cultures are key to building inclusive and cohesive societies. In May 2018, the Council adopted a recommendation on promoting common values, inclusive education and the European dimension of teaching. This recommendation was a follow-up to the Paris Declaration of 2015, in which education ministers stressed the importance of the role that education can play in this respect. The commitments of the Paris Declaration are as relevant today as they were then. In addition to our efforts in this area at national level, we need to make the best use of the Union’s instruments and programmes, such as Erasmus+, Horizon, Creative Europe, Europe for Citizens and the European Solidarity Corps, the support initiatives that serve to promote our common values. We need to provide our young people with the skills and competencies to become active, informed and responsible citizens. Media literacy and critical thinking are crucial skills in today’s society. Our young people need to develop the critical analysis and understanding needed to cope with the ever—growing volume of information. They need to be aware of the need to identify correctly, and use, reliable sources of information and of the risk of disinformation. Finally, it is of the utmost importance to promote and encourage tolerance, mutual understanding and intercultural dialogue in order to secure a better future. The role of educational staff and their continuing professional development plays a key role in this respect. It is important to learn how to address difficult or sensitive topics or controversial issues and not to leave them unaddressed. Teachers need support in their new role in an ever more diverse classroom. This subject is closely tied in with the priorities of our Presidency. As our Prime Minister outlined yesterday, one of our main pillars is the Europe of common values. We aim to stimulate the solidarity and cohesion of the European Union by promoting policies on combating discrimination, ensuring equal chances and equal treatment, and by increasing the involvement of citizens, particularly young people, in the European debate. To conclude, I can assure you that this issue will remain high on the Council’s political agenda. Thank you for your attention.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 138, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, thank you very much for having put this important and very timely debate on the agenda. Learning about our history and analysing the complex forces at play between and within our societies is the basis for understanding the world we are living in today. Knowing about our past is also critical for building the future of our continent and our countries.  Let us not forget that the original underlying idea of the European integration project – ensuring that its dark history does not repeat itself and preserving our freedoms, shared values and ways of life – needs to be defended every day. Commemorating and teaching that past, as well as cultivating the memory of troubled times, are key to shaping a common future. It is important to include all totalitarian regimes – be they fascist, communist or others – as we do on the Europe-wide day of remembrance for the victims of these regimes, on 23 August each year.  The Commission supports remembrance, research and education in the field of totalitarianism in a variety of ways. Preserving the memory of Europe’s totalitarian past is one of the core themes of the current Europe for Citizens programme, which supports activities that encourage reflection on European cultural diversity and on common values. Funds are available for initiatives that reflect on the causes behind the rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe’s modern history and commemorate the victims of their crimes. Furthermore, Europe for Citizens is the Union’s main tool to support initiatives that raise awareness of and educate about the Holocaust. Each year the Commission invests EUR 3.5 million in these projects. Several operational grants support Holocaust memorials and education sites. Remembering the Holocaust needs to remain a priority. In that context, the EU has recently acquired permanent international partner status with the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. The Commission is also supporting the largest-ever EU-funded research initiative on the Holocaust, with EUR 8 million, through the Horizon 2020 project. It is called European Holocaust Research Infrastructure. Further, in the field of research, in 2015 and 2017 the Commission published calls under the Horizon 2020 programme to support research on cultural opposition in the former socialist countries and on improving mutual understanding among Europeans by working through troubled past. Take, for example, the project COURAGE which stands for - Cultural Opposition – Understanding the Cultural Heritage of Dissent in the Former Socialist Countries. This project has created the first digital database highlighting various forms of cultural opposition in former socialist countries. The project concluded that education and research on cultural heritage are crucial to support open pluralistic democracies. In the field of education, the Union supports and complements national policies aimed at better understanding our history and shared values. The current Erasmus+ programme has so far supported some 30 projects dealing with history and totalitarianism in the EU. These projects gave pupils and students the chance to learn about the past in a direct way and make changes in their own lives as a desired result. Last year, the Commission put forward a Council recommendation on promoting common values, inclusive education and the European dimension of teaching. Member States agreed on it after only several months; this was a real milestone. Never before has the EU said so clearly how important it is to promote our common values, to create a sense of belonging, to teach about the functioning values and origins of the EU, and, most importantly, learn about the complex cultural and historical experiences in our Member States.  The Commission strongly believes that education is also the most effective means of preventing antisemitism. This is why the Commission is co-funding a study entitled the Holocaust in Contemporary Education, a joint initiative with UNESCO.  Finally, we can raise awareness and understanding through our cultural heritage, and I am proud that the European heritage label has been awarded to sites of historical significance. Sites such as Poland’s historic Gdańsk shipyard or the Sighet memorial in Romania. Let me reassure you that the Commission will continue to promote remembrance of totalitarian regimes, whatever their ideological basis.

That’s why totalitarian crimes must not be repeated. We need education, research and remembrance to build immunity and resilience in our societies against every temptation of undemocratic solutions. Europeans need this knowledge in order to clearly recognise and resist nationalists, populists and radicals on both the left and the right and to prevent them from hijacking and denigrating our democratic values and brainwashing our open societies. The European Union was constructed against the backdrop of trauma brought about by National Socialism and Communism. Also, they defied ideology. They originated as groups of populists who used manipulation to grab power in order to build the most brutal regimes that claimed the lives of millions. The historical experience of Western Europe was Nazism, whereas Central and Eastern European countries have experienced both Communism and Nazism. These authoritarian regimes are our common legacy, and Europe must be able to speak in one language about this double legacy.  To this end, the Union should provide a framework and sufficient financial funding for comprehensive research into Europe’s totalitarianism – both totalitarianisms – as well as educational programmes and cultural projects. We also need the full opening up of historical archives to verify the historical lies.  We have to see the clear link between populism, extremism, autocracy and dictatorship around the world.

Mr President, I would like to thank the In the 20th century in particular, Europe has a history of aberrations, of crimes of war and injustice, but also of success: with the founding of the European Union, the fall of the Iron Curtain and the deepening of European integration. Democracy needs memory. Only those who are aware of the past can shape the future. The creation of the European Union and the common defence of the fundamental values of an open, liberal and pluralistic society are the lessons we have learned from the darkest chapter in European history of the 20th century. Looking into the past helps to find solutions for the present and the future by recognizing mistakes, making oneself aware of how this happened, and also by admitting guilt, even for actions that one is not responsible for. Willy Brandt's kneeling in Warsaw is the most notable example of such an admission of guilt. However, I warn against pursuing history politics with a culture of remembrance. This is not possible. History is always long, complicated, diverse and, above all, contradictory, even in its narrative itself. Culture of remembrance never claims to be absolute truth. There are historical facts that cannot be denied and discussed away. But a culture of remembrance that does not clarify contradictions and would try to tell events from only one perspective is pointless. Nothing like this unites. Remembrance culture succeeds whenever it clarifies breaks and acknowledges that classifications of black, white, winners, losers, heroes, perpetrators or victims often do not work like this and questions of guilt and complicity are not so easy to answer. A culture of remembrance succeeds when the doubt remains with oneself. In this respect, culture of remembrance also helps against populism. It urges us to review our own position. Thirty years after the fall of the Iron Curtain, we should remember that those who claimed absolute truth for themselves have fallen. Totalitarianism and populism have one thing in common: they do not demand a culture of remembrance, but stories of history from the point of view of the supposed victor.

A large proportion of us Members sitting in this Chamber of the European Parliament have experienced for themselves what it means to be a totalitarian regime that has ruled much of Europe for 40 years. I am the child of socialism, where our communist ideology-led government imagined how we would build a blissful socialism. There is now a man in front of you who, under the violent influence of this ideology, had to make promises as a child when I was a sparker, then a pioneer, then a unionist, that I would always build and defend the socialist homeland. But, it wasn't really what I really wanted. As a man from Czechoslovakia, where we were dogmatically taught that communism and socialism, the thesis of Marx, Engels, Lenin are the best that may be that God does not exist, and they prohibited him from speaking at all about his existence, and the government preached that the spread of the teachings of Jesus Christ was a bad thing. I therefore really consider it important that we educate our young people even in the dark part of our history. History needs to serve as a memento of the match precisely so that it does not happen again. The heroes of our time, whom I want to remind, serve us as role models for today. In Slovakia there is such a resistance warrior, soldier Jozef Gabčík, who served in the exiled Czechoslovak Army during the Second World War and, together with Ján Kubiš, carried out the assassination of a representative of Nazi totalitarianism, the Reich Protector Heidrich, but when we defeated her, the Communist one who wanted to build a common good in the Eastern Bloc began to rule.

In a totalitarian reality, ideology replaces reason, and truth is simply identified with power. If Europe's memory falters, if citizens do not understand their past, including the great traditions of reason, the end of the continent's division under the Treaties will not become a reality. This common history should encourage all research initiatives, all educational plans to prevent totalitarian dementia. Because the fight against totalitarianism, which the classics simply called tyranny, is a common struggle for the Union, for freedoms and democracy, precious but fragile goods, such as human memory, which need attention and persevering care. It is vitally important to preserve the memory of totalitarianism, but we must do so from a perspective of European history, from a common European history, so as not to encourage excessive national particularism, so as not to give wings to nationalism and to, in short, to live up to the truth.

The European Union's neoliberal policies have led to the dismantling and fragmentation of education by suggesting privatisation as a panacea based on market imperatives.

It is not enough, however, as we know, to be caught or have memory to be risk-free. We know that if there is also no value education, a practice of European citizenship, an increase in critical thinking, it will be very difficult for culture to be accompanied by conscience, and we must know that it is precisely not enough just to cultivate memory, but a democratic conscience born of that 'never again' that we spoke at the beginning of the experience of the European project.  There are some interesting examples, but also negative examples in Europe, in the education systems. For example, there are some countries that have found it very difficult to insert the history of the Shoah into their history books and others, such as, for example, I am sorry the Czech Republic, in recent days has decided not to remember Jan Palach anymore or in Hungary you no longer want to remember a heroic Imre Nagy. These revisionisms are not good for the creation of a common European consciousness, while there are some very positive experiences that I do not say, and that ...

Fifty years since the self-immolation of a student of the Faculty of Philosophy Jan Palach.  As I listened to the debate, I realized how strongly and symbolically this information resonates here today precisely in the context of totalitarianism, with censorship, and I cannot remember the moment when my mother, when I was about 15 years old, I think it was whispered, told me who Jan Palach was and what he did in 1969. I remember her telling me very accurately, \"Don't say that name anywhere, but remember the name.\" And then January 1989 came and this name was us Czechs chanting on Wenceslas Square and I realized then that the sacrifice that Jan Palach made was self-immolation, such an agonizing and ousting death that he chose, that the sacrifice was not in vain and that he had done his important work in Czech society. And it should continue to do so not only in Czech society, but throughout Europe. I think that today we should recognize these contexts, recognize that totalitarianism brings censorship, brings bending of the backs, repression, emigration and distortion of morality. These are all fruits that we may still be harvesting today, and against which we must do everything.  With regard to education, I think that no one, as we are here, nor the European Union, of which I am a representative, wants today's education system to tell children the only possible truths allowed. It's a sign of totalitarianism. We want schools to give objective information so that they do not shy away from the subject of modern history and, above all, to teach the younger generation to work with information to lead it to critical thinking. Because believing that only our education system, our schools will ensure that we know our modern history, that's a very naïve idea. Today we are in an era of the Internet, in an era when, as many have discovered, we are being attacked by disinformation waves. That is why it is so important not only to pass on information to young people, but to teach them to work with information, to teach them critical thinking and to let them work with the information they receive from different sources.

This report had to be relatively brief, which it is. When you consider all fundamental rights in the whole of Europe during one year, it is clear that you are tempted to speak about a tremendous amount of things.  We have avoided this and have focused on six main topics. Some of them necessarily extended, all of them of undeniable relevance and of major concern: the rule of law, migration, women’s rights, media freedom, freedom of expression and assembly, racism, xenophobia, discrimination, hate speech and other forms of intolerance, the role and mandate of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA).  We agreed from the very beginning on the criteria under which we had to work on it. Our main political and moral criterion is the common view that we didn’t want to produce a completely neutral analysis of fundamental rights in Europe, but our aim was to make a joint reflection on the values of the Union, not just to defend them but also to suggest ways and steps to improve the Charter. Allow me a personal remark. No one thinks that the Charter will be stronger and more vivid if we maintain Article 51, which should be interpreted in a wider way to avoid that we have to advance at a good speed but with the handbrake on.  I am convinced that we have produced a good report. I will highlight just a few aspects. First, as for the rule of law, we stress that the EU’s ineffectiveness in ending the breaches of the values referred to in Article 2 is undermining both trust among the Member States and the credibility of the European Union.  Migration is still a major concern. In 2017, 650 000 first-time asylum seekers applied for international protection in the Member States. More than 1 000 refugees have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea. Humanitarian aid has been criminalised. States have not been able to undo the knot of the Dublin Regulation.  Women’s rights are clearly defended in the text, now when in some countries and among certain people they are attacked or dismissed.  Media freedom, freedom of expression and assembly that in the past counted among the fundamental rights for free men and women have now to be restored, even in places and countries where one would not expect them to be under threat. Artists or social leaders are also the victims, now and then. Racism, xenophobia, discrimination, hate speech and many forms of intolerance are reducing equality and freedom among human beings. We have tried to show that there are many forms of intolerance and discrimination, that our life can only be built up if it benefits from a rich soil of justice and a good atmosphere of freedom. As a final point, we mentioned the Agency for Fundamental Rights, FRA, based in Vienna, which is doing an excellent job and has never before appeared in our annual reports. FRA should be active, not only in giving support when asked to do so but it should also be proactive in discovering and denouncing cases where human rights are at stake or have been abolished. The FRA needs a new mandate.

The Commission has, over the past years, been committed to upholding the rule of law in all Member States with a sound rule of law policy and it closely monitors the situation in Member States. The rule of law has never been so high on our European agenda as it is today. The Commission has proposed a regulation on protecting the Union’s budget in the event of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in the Member States. The Commission also intends to present an initiative on further strengthening its rule of law framework, taking due account of the work of Parliament, including the resolution on democracy, the rule of law and a fundamental rights mechanism that was adopted in 2016 and the discussion that followed. Following the actions of the Government of Poland, we have initiated the Article 7 procedure. In September last year, Parliament decided to initiate the same procedure following the actions of the Hungarian Government. These are unprecedented steps.

We also use other instruments, including audits and investigations related to the use of EU funds as well as measures through the European Semester to monitor justice reforms in Member States. Overall, the EU is encouraging Member States to improve the independence, quality and efficiency of their justice system. National judges are also EU judges. They are, together with the Court of Justice, the guardians and the ordinary court of the EU legal order, particularly through their role in the preliminary ruling procedure. Effective justice systems are also essential in maintaining mutual trust between Member States and their judicial authorities. This has been underlined by the recent case law of the Court of Justice, which stressed that mutual trust is founded on the premise that the national courts meet the requirements of effective judicial protection. After all, as the Court of Justice has recently phrased it prominently, effective judicial review is of the essence to the rule of law, one of the values upon which the European Union is founded. With regard to the challenges still faced by women, I would like to stress that women’s rights were at the heart of the Commission’s work in 2017 with the year of actions and a dedicated colloquium.

That is a good thing, because the violation of the tripartite power, the politicisation of courts and prosecutors, unprecedented scheduing in the state media and the lack of response of the authorities to acts of aggression and hatred against political opponents lead to an atmosphere conducive to acts of terror. The victim of such an act of terror was The President of Gdańsk Pawel Adamowicz, a victim of institutionalized hatred that we have been dealing with in Poland for three years.  Today's report is therefore an appeal to the whole of a free Europe to restore the most important values in public life: the rule of law, tolerance and respect for human dignity. Only if this is done, the death of Paweł Adamowicz will not be in vain.  It is good that the rule of law and other fundamental values of the European Union are described in such a fair manner in the report, because neither national sovereignty nor the principle of subsidiarity can justify a systemic breach of those values. It is also good that the amendment pointing to the poor effectiveness of Article 7 and calling on the Council to determine as soon as possible whether there is a clear risk of a serious breach of the values contained in the Treaties for Polish and Hungary has been maintained.

As rapporteur for the Socialists and Democrats, I can say that 2017 has been a pivotal year for many rights, and what we are talking about today is crucial. I would like to point out some of the principles and rights that have been undermined, on which collective firmness has been required in the negotiations because, in my opinion, they are non-negotiable. The rule of law: in several Member States, reforms contrary to the rule of law and democracy are taken - threats to the independence of the judiciary, the good health of NGOs, corruption, and media nibbling. The report lists these borderline, or sometimes frankly illegal, policies and urges states to change course. The Council and the Commission must continue the current Article 7 assessments and sanction countries, if necessary. Women's rights: In 2017, harassment and sexual assault have received high profile, thanks in part to the Me Too movement. As we know, women's rights are never taken for granted. Beyond economic equality in education and the fight against violence, it is time for Member States to ensure equitable access to family planning, modern contraception and safe and legal abortion, which is not always the case today. Every woman in Europe must have the right to decide what she does or does not do with her body safely. Despite opposition from some on the right on this point, my group is fighting for the report to retain this imperative. Migration: while arrivals have been decreasing since 2017 and Parliament has already adopted its position, Member States are still refusing to organise themselves at European level. We therefore call on them once again to agree on the reform of the Dublin Regulation. There are so many other important themes in this report, including the fight against discrimination of all kinds - homophobia, racism, anti-Semitism, etc. - and the importance of guaranteeing the rights of European and British citizens in the face of Brexit. These remarks and suggestions are, of course, messages to the Member States, to the Commission and to Parliament. They must be heard.

Mr President, again this year the European Parliament is reporting on the situation of fundamental rights in the Union. Once again, Parliament calls for action against unacceptable abuses and unacceptable violations of treaty values in some Member States. This call is all the more urgent today in the run-up to the European elections.  We actually have a choice, this is not new, between two Europes: a democratic and liberal Europe, where fundamental and universal values continue to underpin European integration and protect citizens, as has been the case since the end of the war; or a Europe that is at odds with history, and which considers that the principles of the rule of law and the protection of minorities are, in essence, cumbersome details which hinder the increasingly disturbing rise of authoritarian temptations or selective moralities. I just heard it from a colleague a few moments ago. Women and politicians must choose their side and assume it in front of the voters. To this end, I cannot help but stress that it is now urgent that the leaders of the Member States clearly stand in favour of the establishment of a monitoring mechanism, as has long been called for by Sophia in 't Veld and the European Parliament, which would also involve the Council and which must analyse and report annually on the respect of fundamental rights in each country of the Union.

I am dreaming of the Commission's effective reactions in this area as in economic and budgetary matters. We're a long way from that.

It is not surprising that gangrene spreads to all minorities, whatever they may be, and that migrants become scapegoats, if it is the politicians, including governments, who set the wrong example? We have seen this with the surreal debate around the Marrakesh Pact, with which we have reached heights of bad faith, including on the part of some governments, questioning a text they had adopted unanimously in July 2018.

We are talking about racism, xenophobia, serious and widespread acts of violence against women, migrants and minorities, attacks on the rule of law and freedom of expression and the media. We are talking about the scourge of corruption, which has always been a threat to the equal enjoyment of citizens' rights and to resources allocated to public services.  I have already strongly supported the need in the past to establish a European monitoring mechanism to prevent and combat violations of the Fundamental Rights of the European Union. I would have welcomed a greater focus on the problem of increasing poverty and material deprivation, which would require the promotion and implementation of national minimum income schemes, so that decent living conditions, as well as an improvement in the level of social inclusion and in the labour market, are ensured for all people with insufficient income, as well as an improvement in the level of social inclusion and in the labour market, in order to promote access to goods and services and a better quality of life.

Unfortunately, the undemocratic functioning of the Orban government has degraded my country, Hungary, into a kind of \"veterinary horse\" of violations within the EU, as regards the dismantling of the foundations of democracy and the situation of European values and fundamental rights. In particular, with regard to the independence of the judiciary, freedom of the press and anti-foreignerism, they reflect the political situation in Hungary that we discussed and condemned in the EP last September in connection with the Sargentini report. However, the weakness and lack of consequence of these important and accurate annual fundamental rights reports is increasingly being questioned and is now questioning the credibility of the EU and the EP. The report also refers to the slowness of the procedure under Article 7 and the inconsistenty of infringement procedures, which makes the community almost inconsistent with Orban's unscrupulous policies.

Late payment is really an issue which has a strong impact on our businesses. Let me very briefly recall the history of the file, because it started in 1995 with the Commission’s recommendation on payment periods in commercial transactions. It stated that payment delays were really a danger to the survival of our European businesses. In 2000, the first Late Payment Directive concluded that the situation had not improved – on the contrary – so in 2011 the revised Directive laid down stronger rules to combat late payments both by public authorities and businesses. In 2016, the Commission’s Report on the implementation of the Directive noted a reduction in average late payment delays. So can we say that late payments are a problem of the past? Of course not. Let me remind you that, today, only one in four businesses in the EU pays within the period agreed in the contract. Putting it another way, 60% of European businesses are regularly paid late, and this is really dangerous. Over half of those businesses suffer payment delays of more than 90 days.  For a small company, the probability of going bankrupt increases after six days of non-payment. And that is why late payments still account for 25% of insolvencies in the EU. And, of course, as everywhere in the economy, late payments are especially harmful to smaller companies – to SMEs – which rely on regular streams of liquidity to run their daily operations. Is this all or partly the Directive’s fault? I really do not think so. I fully share the rapporteur’s position that the Directive remains the most appropriate instrument to combat late payment. Under this Commission, we have strictly enforced the Directive so, on the one hand, we have opened an active dialogue with the Member States – provided guidance, provided an exchange of best practices – but, on the other hand, we have not hesitated to take more formal and stringent steps. As for today, we have six ongoing infringement cases in the European Union.  I believe that it is still too soon for the revision of the Directive. The point is that late payment is a very complex problem that cannot be solved through legislation alone. I rather think that any change to either hard or soft law should be preceded by a profound change in the business culture and this is what we should focus on. Evidence shows that late payments are intentional. It is widely known that businesses practice late payments to suppliers. It is the cheapest and the cost-free form of borrowing, but is it really cost-free for all of us, for the economy in its real effects? Of course not. Payment delays cascade down from one supplier to the next. In most cases, late payments are also avoidable as in the case of delays in public contracts. Let me focus a little bit more on this issue.  Lengthy administrative procedures result in extending the payment deadlines artificially and, again, this is especially damaging to smaller companies who are more dependent on contracts with public authorities. In fact I have to tell you that I find late payments by public authorities even more inexcusable than those by private businesses, because we should remember that these are the same public authorities who have very limited tolerance for late payments in the other direction, so from businesses to the tax authorities. Again, this is very dangerous. The report describes the fear factor affecting smaller businesses – fear that prevents businesses from using the rights the Directive has granted. Fear forces businesses to accept unfair payment conditions from larger counterparts and this is the case for 70% of small and medium enterprises. So, abuse becomes habit, and habit becomes a culture. I firmly believe in the freedom of negotiations, but this freedom should not be abused to the disadvantage of the creditor. The report lays down a thorough roadmap for building a more responsible payment culture and also strikes the right balance between combating late payments and defending contractual freedoms. It also calls for more transparency of payment practices, stronger enforcement policies and more education on financial matters, again especially for SMEs.  I am also pleased to see that the report takes into account several conclusions of the Commission’s own Implementation Report from 2016. I believe that more can be achieved now by leading by example and it can be done much more effectively.  The Directive calls for a decisive shift towards a culture of prompt payment, and this should be, in my view, our ultimate aim. Prompt payment speeds up the flow of money in the economy. It ultimately benefits everyone in society. So again, I want to applaud the report for the strong message in recognising and rewarding prompt payment practices. Before concluding, I want to say one word on the very hard work of the rapporteur, Ms Comi, and of course the shadow rapporteurs. It was a huge effort in a short time. The result is a very thorough, very balanced and inspirational report, and I also want to thank President Tajani and my predecessor for adopting and starting to implement the Directive. I am looking forward to the debate and, of course, I want to call on you to accept the report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 222, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Lara Comi", "mepid": "96775", "text": "  Rapporteur. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, First of all, I apologise because I understood that the debate was starting at 6 p.m., so I apologise to you, to my fellow Members and, above all, to the Commissioner.  I would really like to thank my fellow Members who have worked with me on this report because, as has been said, it is an important and very sensitive and useful issue, not least for the survival of our European businesses.  The first question I asked ourselves and asked ourselves together is: how do you measure the state of health of a company? Certainly when there is a good balance between an economic aspect and a financial and capital aspect and when a company is able to invest and be able to expand, create jobs and also generate benefits in that economy that is both national and international.  Today, however, many European companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the industrial fabric at European level, are forced to face many obstacles in order to cope with the crisis. Obstacles such as the delay in payments, in commercial transactions, by another company or, above all, and this is the real problem, on the part of the public administration. In Europe, six out of ten companies are paid late, compared to what is stipulad in the contract.  We considered some cases: 62% of cases with financial difficulties concerning their debtors, 48% of intentional late payments, 45% of administrative inefficiencies and 19% of disputes.  But the real problem with aggravating the situation is often when one passively accepts longer payment periods, because there is a dominant position of some companies over others. Think that, if everything were properly applied in payments, we could really avoid cases that we have also seen in the news in Italy but also in other realities, where entrepreneurs take their own lives, where entrepreneurs are so desperate and go bankrupt but for unpaid debts, not for unpaid debts, and this also leads to job losses and relocations.  Starting with the directive that the Commissioner mentioned in 2011, which did not achieve the objective we set ourselves in all the Member States, we have decided to introduce, in this proposal, a greater effort to pay within thirty days, as had also been established, and greater transparency with regard to late payment behaviour.  We must help, value businesses and entrepreneurs and also the public administration that pays in good standing, with a so-called white list, promote those who are good and capable, provide entrepreneurs with adequate training in credit management and invoices and considering that thousands of start-ups and SMEs fail every year due to late payment by the public administration , it is necessary to provide mandatory and adequate forms of tax compensation, including compensation and other forms of support, such as factoring, which unfortunately is not yet active in my country.  We also need to promote best practices such as the Spanish one that we have also introduced into the document and the project, precisely because when a local authority is unable to pay, the State intervenes.  All of these, I think, are very good solutions, also linked to the issue of public procurement. It is good to exclude contractors who do not comply with future contracts if subcontractors are not paid on time by the main contractor, because this means that best practice ultimately says who is wrong pays, but to all effects and also to the consequences.  Member States are invited to set up mediation services at national level. I believe that if everyone paid properly, we would save EUR 158 million in financial costs. We can do that, we have to do it and thank you all, because we have managed to achieve a very good result.

That is why I believe that the point misses the point. A few years ago, we did indeed have a major problem in Europe. Late payments between Northern And Southern Europe vary up to 180 days. This shows that we have particular regional difficulties, and Mrs Comi's report has taken particular account of these difficulties. We have seen that we have really achieved something by amending the late payments directive, which we adopted in the last parliamentary term: late payments have decreased. But late payments are, of course, always a problem that must be seen in the context of economic development. That is why we must make it clear once again – and Mrs Comi's report makes it very clear – that small and medium-sized enterprises suffer particularly from late payment, and that is why the report's demands in this direction are of real importance. Secondly, there must, of course, also be exceptions to strict rules for small and medium-sized enterprises, because if companies want to agree on something different among themselves, then there must be room for this, because freedom of contract applies in the European Union. Thirdly, we must also be careful not to create different late payments rules for each sector, but that it is clear – as with passenger rights – that late payments are not allowed in the European Union. There is a minimum payment target, and everyone must respect that.

According to the figures provided by the Commission, more than half of Member States, and more than half of Member States’ companies, are still not paying and respecting the 30—day limit imposed by the law. Even worse, many of these small companies are not asking for compensation because they are afraid of becoming the enemy of somebody to whom they owe money. Our report puts forward measures that will improve this. We are encouraging Member States to introduce even stricter payment terms. We are calling for the introduction of mandatory information – as was talked about just five seconds ago – on payment behaviour, such as databases and registers for both the public and private sectors. We are urging Member States to set the national and regional free and confidential mediation services so that these businesses can go to somebody else and ask them to fight their cause instead of them.  To finish, we are advising Member States to take all necessary steps in order to ensure that the public authorities pay their suppliers in due time, because this is happening sometimes for economic reasons and sometimes for political reasons as well.

As we have seen in the past and every day, late payments in commercial transactions are unfortunately the reality facing many European companies. And here, in fact, none of the European countries is particularly safe. In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises are particularly at stake, which most often receive this delay in payments. This, of course, has very serious consequences. We have heard of cases where small medium-sized enterprises have gone bankrupt, when whole families have suffered as a result. And it is that, of course, we can and must leave a lot of things to the market itself, but we certainly need to put in place a regulation that will protect the weaker from the abuse of the stronger. And these late payments are just one form of so-called illicit trade practices, which unfortunately too often occurs at every turn. And non-payment or late payment is only one of these elements, apart of, of course, the return of unsued goods, the mi mishandling of small suppliers, and I think that, as the European Union, we have a duty to provide for mechanisms that will protect weaker in this part. However, in addition to this mediation, which colleagues have already mentioned, I would like to mention one thing: there is also a public sector among the large defaulting payers or late payers.

I thank the rapporteur for mapping and showing in detail the situation surrounding the implementation of this directive. It turns out that there are still a number of problems and obstacles, such as a lack of awareness of the existence of this legal instrument. I would also like to say that there is only a small percentage of SMEs that have experienced positive effects on late payments from debtors thanks to this directive.  Ladies and gentlemen, we have much to improve. I do not agree with my colleague Sulík not to get involved in this matter, because there is no worse enemy for medium and small businesses than the Tax Office and its apparatus, which always plays a power play. I therefore fully support the rapporteur and her proposals for a number of measures that could lead to improved enforcement of the Late Payment Directive.

We have achieved a lot: the elimination of geoblocking, the elimination of roaming – these are spectacular huge successes. We have managed to do this, and we are all, all citizens of the European Union. Today we are looking at the situation of entrepreneurs in the European Union and we have a report on the implementation of the directive on so-called late payments. Many small businesses have a problem due to unpaid payments. The spectre of bankruptcy due to delays is facing many entrepreneurs who are still sufficiently worried about intricate regulations, e.g. tax or low liquidity. That is why we are checking whether the law adopted in this parliamentary term is working as it should. And what turns out? It doesn't work. The report rightly points out points where the application of the rules could be much better. However, this matter – let us remember – is the responsibility of the Member States and they are responsible for the proper implementation and enforcement of EU rules. It is important to call for greater transparency, e.g. with regard to payment behaviour. This solution could encourage sluggd debtors to pay their debts more speedily. Both when we adopted this directive and today we have to balance all the reasons.

I therefore believe that this report, which Parliament will adopt tomorrow, seeks to propose improvements to eradicate this scourge. In particular, I would like to highlight three points: firstly, to introduce faster repayment and recovery procedures for companies with claims against public administrations.  Secondly, to promote the establishment of free and accessible mediation services to support small and medium-sized enterprises, which often do not have the appropriate financial means to deal with lengthy legal disputes.  My third point is that it should be made compulsory to publish information on public and private bodies that pay at the right time. I believe, Madam President, that the certainty of payment times is a very important challenge that we have and can also appear difficult, given the not very brilliant results of recent years.

The loopholes in the legislation that give defaulters free rein must be closed. Two out of three Belgian companies accept a longer payment period than those they actually consider comfortable.

Linking procurement rules with the terms of the directive – a particularly important measure after the collapse of Carillion last year – is exactly the kind of initiative we need. Automatic accrual of interest for the public sector: the public sector should lead by example and should pay on time.

Be ware that this method of infringement leads to penalties and therefore to an additional payment, which then affects the citizens, and this is a problem, because you pay twice as much, that is, the State does not pay you and in addition you also have to pay for the infringement. So you have to find another method.  The other thing that President Tajani mentioned before you was that, for example for Italy, it was possible to exceed 3 % to pay off the debts of the public administration. Of course, this must not be the rule, but austerity, as Mr Juncker rightly pointed out yesterday, is not achieved, and so there is no excuse, in this case for Italy, for not paying public administration debts to businesses.

In Europe, six out of ten businesses receive payments after the deadline set in a contract.

Delays in transaction have a negative influence on enterprises’ ability to invest, grow, plan production and pay their employees’ salaries, and it hinders their general financial health. In the worse cases, delays might lead to bankruptcy or debts. Therefore, I am closely observing the implementation of the Late Payment Directive, under which businesses must pay invoices within 60 calendar days and public authorities within 30 days. Furthermore, the Directive introduces automatic payment of interest for exceeding the relevant payment date. I believe that authorities and business organisations should promote a culture of prompt payments within their guidelines, sharing the best practices processes and, if necessary, legislate.

Madam President, Commissioner Katainen, Mr Hoyer, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Hoyer, for the work he has said on how to Today we are talking about the annual report on the financial activities of the European Investment Bank. First of all, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the draftsmen of the opinions of advisory committees, my team and their teams for being able to produce a comprehensive report on the Bank's activities in 2017 in a few months' time and in a pragmatic manner. The EIB's Overall Operational Plan for 2017-2019 is based on the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in the areas of energy, transport and mobility, health, rural infrastructure development and support for agricultural enterprises, SMEs and mid-caps, environment and innovation. Last year, the 60th anniversary of the EIB was also included in this period of observation, on which I would like to congratulate you, President Hoyer, and also the Member States and, ultimately, all of us. The EIB is now the world's largest multilateral bond issuer and lender. Over 60 years, a total of EUR 1 100 billion has been invested in 11 900 projects in more than 160 countries – a fact of which we can be quite proud. The bonds issued by the EIB Group have the highest credit quality. The bank itself has an AAA rating and, thanks to its conservative risk management, has a share of non-performing loans of just 0.3% – a good practice, too. High creditworthiness, a solid and high-quality asset portfolio and sustainable investment projects are the fundamental values of the EIB's business model and also a best practice. And, despite all the internationality, with investment volume in more than 160 countries, more than 90% of loans have been granted within the EU. In 2017 alone, 901 projects were approved and €78 billion was allocated to innovation, the environment, infrastructure and SMEs. Over the last ten years, more than EUR 200 billion has been invested in the economic and social development of the regions, and some 700 000 SMEs have had better access to finance. On the fundraising side, I would like to make one comment, Mr President: in 2017, around one third of EIB bonds were issued in dollars. Yesterday, we celebrated 20 years of euros in this House – the second largest currency in the world in the meantime. Perhaps, Mr President, you could carry out more euro bond issues in the future and gradually reduce the dollar. However, the EIB also has an eye on Europe's competitiveness. In 2017, loans amounting to EUR 13.9 billion were granted for, among other things, 7.4 million high-speed digital connections and the installation of 36.8 million smart meters. EUR 16.6 billion went to projects in the areas of environment and sustainability, the development of renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, biodiversity, clean water and air, waste management, sustainable transport, etc. The EIB is the world's largest green bond issuer. A quarter of the loan amount will be allocated to climate-related projects. That is why the Bank also has a special role to play in financing the Paris climate agreement. In 2017, the EIB supported small and medium-sized enterprises with investments of EUR 29.6 billion. This has given 287 000 companies, employing 3.9 million people, access to finance. Given the enormous importance of SMEs and start-ups to the European economy, the EIB's SME strategy and the associated cooperation in overcoming credit shortages should be highlighted. The EIB also played an important role in overcoming the crisis-related investment gap in Europe. In particular, the EFSI should be mentioned here. The fund, which is managed by the EIB, has so far mobilised EUR 371 billion in additional investment. I would particularly like to thank Mr Molterer, the Managing Director of EFSI, and the EIB will also be in charge of implementing InvestEU by 2021.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 247, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Eider Gardiazabal Rubial", "mepid": "96991", "text": "  rapporteur of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. – Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Hoyer, today I am intervening on behalf of the Committee on Budgets to set out the points which we have considered important to highlight in our opinion on the european investment bank's activity report. And, for lack of time, I'm going to focus on the most important issues we've included in this opinion.  First of all, the EI needs to further strengthen its investment capacity to fill the investment deficit we have in both the public and private sectors and maintain its countercyclical profile through these investments. Investments that have to have a clear objective of job creation, but of quality employment, and also that can be sustainable over time.  And, in this regard, it is also important to stress that support for small and medium-sized enterprises needs to be further strengthened; communication and access to information for all programs available to the Bank needs to be improved so that small and medium-sized enterprises can participate better.  It is also essential — and not only because of the existence of the European Fund for Strategic Investments — that collaboration with national and regional banks and development institutions continues to develop in order to improve the impact of investments and to provide adequate technical assistance to project promoters.  And in this same sense, but speaking of investments abroad, greater and better coordination with development banks is also essential in order to ensure coherence in mandates and, above all, to be more effective and eliminate duplication.  On the other hand, I would also like to highlight the Bank's efforts to achieve this target of 25% of investments made in favour of climate. We need to move forward on this path and improve this goal in the next period.  And finally, like every year — and this is the last of this mandate — I would like to ask the EI to continue working, to continue to work further to improve transparency and accountability, as well as to control financial intermediaries to combat tax evasion, evasion and avoidance.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 248, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Werner Hoyer", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Präsident der Europäischen Investitionsbank. – Frau Präsidentin, sehr geehrte Mitglieder des Europäischen Parlaments, meine Damen und Herren! Lassen Sie mich zunächst einmal der Berichterstatterin, Frau Kappel, und ihren Mitstreiterinnen und Mitstreitern für diesen exzellenten Bericht sehr herzlich danken. It’s a great pleasure for me to be with you this evening. These debates play an important role in further reinforcing the working relationship between this House and the European Investment Bank (EIB).  Many issues raised in the report are extremely relevant, and I very much appreciate the support you give to the EIB in its role as a catalyst for investments that support growth and jobs, both within and outside the European Union.  As you rightly point out in your report, the EIB is a very good deal for the EU. We put money to work. By the way, not so much taxpayers’ money, but money we raise from investors on the capital markets. The financing scheme of the EIB is unique. The Member States own the EIB, but they are not the principal source of funding. Indeed, the Member States, over 60 years now, have only paid directly EUR 14 billion in cash to secure their equity share of the bank, plus EUR 3.4 billion into the reserve. This has enabled us over the past 60 years to disperse more than EUR 1.1 trillion, as the rapporteur just mentioned, mobilising up to EUR 3 trillion of overall investment. This is a very efficient use of EU resources – all in support of EU policies that you in this Parliament shape and that we follow. It is also thanks to you that we operate at an increasingly sustainable and innovative way – from issuing sustainability awareness bonds and green bonds, to ambitious climate action targets in our lending. By the way, sustainability awareness bonds – our latest product – are very interesting. When we all praised the United Nations for defining the Sustainable Development Goals, we were all made aware of the fact that taxpayers’ money will never suffice to enable us to reach these objectives. We need to crowd in the private sector. This is exactly what we in the EIB are doing and for which we developed, for the first time ten years ago, green bonds. We are now also developing sustainability awareness bonds, and the first issuance on the market was very successful and encouraging.  Ladies and gentlemen, investment in the EU has recovered, but the recovery is still uneven across countries and sectors. We cannot afford to become complacent when it comes to closing the investment gap in Europe – just think of the areas of infrastructure or innovation where the EU is lagging behind. One key instrument to tackle this challenge is the Juncker Plan and the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI). I thank you very much for your kind words and Mr Molterer for his work. Ms Kappel, in your report you take stock of the success of EFSI. It is our joint success, and it was the right decision by this Parliament to extend the programme to the end of 2020, with an increased goal of mobilising EUR 500 billion. It has been a remarkable decision of this Parliament and Council to, so to speak, sacrifice EUR 16 billion of the EU budget in order to shift money from subsidies and grants into a guarantee scheme. This exercise, which, at first glance, would not seem very popular for a parliamentarian, has been a success. I thank you for that courageous decision. EFSI has already had a concrete impact. As of December 2018, it has supported over 850 000 SMEs across the EU and is expected to trigger over EUR 371.2 billion of additional investment. It is a great example of what the EIB can do to help scarce public resources achieve more. It reflects a paradigm shift from grants and subsidies to loans and guarantees and has become a very strong element of Europe’s public policy tool kit.  I fully share the view that we should retain the key success factors from EFSI and learn the lessons when designing the future InvestEU programme. We are in very good contact discussions with the Commission on this in order to translate what has worked with EFSI into the new regulation on InvestEU – and EFSI has worked. In this regard, I welcome very much Parliament’s position on InvestEU, which was voted on earlier, that indeed reflects the successful EFSI model. We very much appreciate that Parliament has called for the EIB group to have a dedicated share of 75% of InvestEU in the legal text. We also welcome the fact that the report proposes changes that will deliver a higher impact, ensure efficient management and support national commercial banks to benefit from InvestEU. Let me briefly turn to our role as the EU’s external financial arm. For over 55 years, the EIB has supported the EU’s external and development policies in a very broad range of countries, at minimal cost to the EU budget. The EIB is a global leader in crowding in private sector finance and delivering innovative financing solutions for the public and private sectors.  Through our engagement, in projects both inside and outside the EU, the EIB has sectorial expertise across all regions and project types that it can deploy globally. As the external arm of EU investment, we are very active across all parts of the globe. For instance, with the aim of improving livelihoods and creating local jobs, we finance SMEs and microenterprises with limited access to finance in Africa, with particular focus on youth and African women.  At the same time, we finance climate action projects in Asia and Latin America and support EU diplomacy. We are supporting EU policy very closely in the neighbourhood, where we stand ready to respond to urgent EU priority needs, as was the case, for instance, with the Ukraine Package. Moreover, through the Economic Resilience Initiative for the Western Balkans and the Southern Neighbourhood, we have stepped up our support to countries affected by migration, whether host countries, countries of transit or countries of origin. There are many inefficiencies within Europe’s development finance architecture, and there is growing demand among European bilateral development agencies for greater coordination, new financial instruments and innovative banking solutions. While grants will continue to play an important role, there is widespread recognition that financial instruments to mobilise investment must grow in importance. The EIB stands ready to facilitate and coordinate EU external investments for our policy makers. The challenges facing EU foreign and development policy are substantial, with uncertainties surrounding US global leadership, China playing a bigger role internationally, and – this might be the most important fact – with threats to the very concept of multilateralism. Europe is called upon to show leadership and tackle global issues. For this, we need a strong financing arm, and for this, we need a strong EIB. I am therefore very pleased to see the emphasis in your report on keeping the central role of the EIB firmly reflected in the post-2020 architecture for financing outside the Union. I am confident that we can translate what we have now learned from EFSI for InvestEU into the new regulation about our activities outside the European Union. These negotiations are going on at this moment. Thank you, Ms Kappel, for raising the issue of transparency, accountability and tax compliance. I fully agree with you that we cannot become complacent in that respect. On transparency, we are already second to none compared with other international financial institutions, and we intend to keep it this way. I would also welcome the European Union and its Member States using the same criteria and standards for the lending activities of other multilateral financial institutions which they use for the EIB.  We are publishing more and more information about our activities and the impact that we have on the daily lives of citizen. On curbing tax avoidance, let me assure you that we are putting a lot of effort and time into this and are fully behind the EU’s push to mitigate these practices. We of course apply the EU black list and remain extremely vigilant that our money is not misused. Let me finally update you on one issue that will unfortunately keep us all busy for some time, as yesterday’s events have yet again illustrated, namely the impact of the UK leaving the EU. When, in my view very unfortunately, the UK leaves the EU, it consequently stops being a member of this bank, which has a number of implications both institutionally and financially. In this context, I would like to express my gratitude for Parliament’s swift adoption of its positive opinion on amending the EIB’s statute and governance due to the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. The UK’s departure means that the EIB’s capital will be reduced by approximately EUR 40 billion, of course most of it in the form of callable capital, because the Member States paid in so little in cash. This would translate into a roughly EUR 100 billion reduction in our maximum lending space. I do not need to tell you that such a scenario is in nobody’s interest. As a sign of trust in the EIB, the Board of Directors, representing all Member States, has agreed on measures to sustain and strengthen the bank’s capital base after Brexit. The EU 27 Members have agreed to replace the UK’s share in paid-in capital using the bank’s reserves and to increase their callable capital. Some Member States have even volunteered to contribute paid-in capital to increase their role in the bank. We are therefore confident that we will conclude an agreement on capital replacement before the UK leaves the EU, and, most importantly, preserve the EIB’s ability to achieve EU policy objectives. We will all lose in the context of Brexit, but I think Parliament and Council and the Commission are doing what is necessary to reduce the damage to a minimum. Thank you very much for your attention. I am very much looking forward to the debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 249, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Jyrki Katainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to welcome the report and thank especially Parliament and in particular the rapporteur Ms Barbara Kappel, for its very relevant input. We welcome the importance that Parliament rightly attaches to monitoring the European Investment Bank as a key player in delivering our European political priorities.  Our Bank is an indispensable partner for implementing EU policies inside and outside the borders of the Union. Our Bank has also proven its ability to reshape significantly its activities. The successful implementation of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) illustrates perfectly this capacity to seize new opportunities and redefine its business models to address investment gaps that still affect the EU today, especially in sectors like innovation and infrastructure.  The strategic positioning of the Bank on key sectors was at the heart of a discussion that took place in 2018 in light of the expected departure of one of the major shareholders of the Bank, the United Kingdom. I particularly welcome the recent agreement in principle found by the Member States on the capital aspects after the UK’s withdrawal, as well as the reforms of the cabinet. This package demonstrates the shareholders’ strong commitment to the EIB, which is key to ensuring that the Bank retains its triple A rating and to preserving the sustainability of its lending volume. In the context of the negotiations on the next multiannual financial framework (MFF), I would like to recall that the EIB will remain a key implementing partner for the EU. Under the InvestEU fund, the Commission and the EIB Group have proposed to establish a partnership to support programme implementation and ensure consistency, inclusivity and efficiency. Under this proposal, a 75% share of the EU guarantee for the EIB would be enshrined in the regulation. Moreover, the EIB Group’s banking expertise will be pressed into use to design, implement, monitor and report on the InvestEU programme.  The Commission proposal on the post 2020 Neighbourhood, development and international cooperation instrument will bring together existing and new programmes currently serving the EU’s external policies. The Commission has proposed that the new instrument should be deployed through an open architecture using all available expertise from the EIB, international financial institutions, as well as national and regional development actors. With decades of experience, the Bank will remain a major partner for the EU for external lending activities in the next MFF. Currently the Commission is holding discussions with the EIB and other financial institutions in order to find a common approach that could provide the EIB with basic operational predictability post 2020.  Let me conclude by speaking of two particular relevant issues highlighted in your report. Firstly, climate change. The Commission fully supports the ambitious climate action strategy of the European Investment Bank, matching the commitments of the Paris Agreement. Increased investment in renewable energy and the energy efficiency sector is key to achieving this objective. Secondly, tax compliance. The EU has achieved unprecedented progress in fighting tax avoidance in the course of the last two years. This includes new requirements against tax avoidance in EU legislation, governing in particular financing and investment operations. As a follow-up action, the Commission has been working closely with the EIB and other implementing partners on adapting the current compliance procedures of this new environment. We also adopted a communication in March 2018 to facilitate the implementation of these new requirements.  I welcome the collaboration of the EIB and Commission services in reflecting recent developments at the EU and international levels in the procedures of the Bank. The Commission will continue to monitor closely this important file and we look forward to the EIB’s proposal for the revision of its relevant policies.

Mr President, we believe that the European Investment Bank, the investment bank of all Member States, is doing a good job. Major infrastructure works such as Oosterweel in Antwerp can count on a loan from the European Investment Bank, which makes these projects as possible.  We support this report and I would like to go into the document on the financing of the European Investment Bank. Because as you know, this is mainly done through bond issues on the international capital markets. For about 60 billion euros annually. Nowadays, however, that happens almost for a third in dollars. Therefore, the bank may be exposed to possible US sanctions, which could lead to the European Investment Bank no longer being able to choose what it wants to invest in. The dollar is indeed a tool of the US to geopolitically act worldwide. Europe must be able to set its own course, which is why we are calling on the European Investment Bank to gradually reduce its financing in dollars.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 251, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Werner Langen", "mepid": "1928", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Mr Hoyer, Vice-President Katainen, rapporteur, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for the work she has First of all, I would like to thank Mrs Kappel. She has done a good job.  Mr Hoyer, you should not be surprised that the Chamber is so empty. Group meetings are currently taking place in preparation for tomorrow's vote, in all the major groups. You can also be reassured because yesterday, at the Annual Report of the President of the ECB, only three colleagues were present more than he spoke.  That is why I say that the report is a good one. The European Investment Bank is a very important institution. You have described the benefits. Mrs Kappel has taken up the most important points. The PPE-DE will vote in favour of this report. We have also pushed through our essential points in our discussions with the rapporteur. That is a good thing. I believe that, when it is stressed that the EIB is the only international bank that is exclusively owned by the EU Member States and is fully guided by EU policies and standards, that is an enormous advantage. If we had the Brexit decision yesterday – I would like to make one comment: I personally do not believe in Brexit, it will still be prevented – but it is certainly good that the EIB has made progress in the provision of equity. Your priorities with SMEs, sustainability, the fact that you are lending rather than giving grants, that you are larger in balance sheet than the World Bank, these are all things that would have required the annual report to be discussed in a wider parliamentary public. Unfortunately, that is not the case, and I hope that, at least tomorrow, support will be greater than in the committee responsible.

Because I agree with you that it is certainly a great global player in the European Union which has extraordinary importance in the implementation of policies, priorities, the objectives of European Union policy. And, in that sense, my first reflection is on the importance of action in third countries. There are actually many countries in which it is being operated; it's true, but I wonder if we couldn't see an increase in our loans and our banking operations in more countries. Europe is, it is often said, a soft power, a country whose foreign policy is largely weakened because its military presence or foreign policy is too weak. I believe that our financial action—the importance of this bank, so great in many respects—must be reassessed. Secondly, speaking of the third countries, my second thought is precisely to nuance in the report that third countries are not only the neighbours of the East or that third countries are not all in the East. I believe that there is excessive detailedness about the neighbourhood in the East and a weak reference to Africa and Latin America. In Africa we play a lot; We know. And I think the European Investment Bank, although it has started to operate, especially in relation to what climate change has to do more. And Latin America is very important.

I particularly commend the EIB's cooperation with national authorities to prevent tax fraud, money laundering and aggressive tax planning. These actions are fully complementary – and I will emphasise this in particular – to the actions of the Government of the Republic over the last three years. On the other hand, with regard to the InvestEU programme, I would like to stress that the EIB, as the de facto sole bank, should remain the obvious and first partner responsible for banking projects under this programme, and I hope that this will be the case.

Madam President, Mr President Hoyer, Madam rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed undeniable that the European Investment Bank is contributing to the financing of economic activity in the European Union, and even beyond - I have noted your remark on the perverse effects of a Brexit as it could take place. Of course, this report underlines this very positive role, but I would like to draw the EIB's attention to a number of points, including drawing your attention to the fact that you should not behave like a private bank, but act where there is a lack of funding. You must, and this has been pointed out, reduce your dollar-funded projects for very obvious reasons concerning the United States, fight, perhaps beyond what we want in Parliament, against poverty and, in fact, fight climate change, so as to go in the direction of what Europe wants. Finally, you must continue your efforts to reform governance and your efforts at transparency, both for you and for your intermediaries.  In the area of tax evasion and money laundering, we call on the EIB to be particularly vigilant about the new manoeuvres and techniques used by criminals. Finally, in conclusion, as an alternate member of the Committee on Development, I would like to encourage you to play your part in financing developing countries, and particularly that of our African partners. I therefore invite you to finance these projects as a priority, in particular so that they benefit local actors, but also to enable states to generate tax revenues which then enable them to finance their economic policy.

And why is that? Because we had quite a few critical amendments on the performance of the EIB which were not taken up in the compromises, so we don’t feel that our criticism has been reflected in the compromises, and therefore we will vote against. But I would like to focus here today on the discussion concerning climate and climate proofing and the consistency of our European policies. Already in November the European Commission published its long-term strategy, making it very clear that Europe can be and should be zero carbon by 2050. This means that the energy sector needs to be zero carbon by 2040, because that sector needs to go first before you have the more difficult sectors to go to. So by 2040 the energy infrastructure must be fully complied with zero emissions. That means that the investments that we are making today need to think of how to be zero carbon in 20 years. So the investments now need to be zero carbon. It must be taken away from fossil fuels entirely, and that’s not the case now – there is still a lot of money from the EIB going into fossil fuel infrastructure, quite often with the argument of security. However, you cannot use that argument, which contradicts our long-term strategy. And I know that the EIB has now said that we will look at our climate strategy again, but I really would like to hear more urgency. What does that mean? How is the EIB going to make sure that no further investments will go into fossil fuel infrastructure, because every euro spent on fossil fuel infrastructure today will make it impossible to be zero carbon by 2050, which is our target – as the Commission says – and this inconsistency needs to be solved fast.

These three elements are also very important when looking at what the Bank should do in the future to be an active partner in all these areas. There were some critical voices – only a few – but I want to remind everybody that the EIB is a demand-driven bank. The EIB doesn’t force anybody to borrow, but it serves clients who go to the bank and ask for financial instruments. So the EIB is not the magic medicine for all the diseases we can imagine. The EIB is just a financer, also providing technical assistance. And when it comes to Greece, thanks to the EIB Greek small and medium-sized enterprises have managed to get financing for their projects.  Everybody knows that SMEs play a significant role in the Greek economy and for good reasons – or for the reasons we all know – the Greek banks have not been able to provide for the needs of SMEs. But the EIB, through EFSI, as well as through other operators, has been doing so.  So the EIB is doing a lot in the fields of addressing climate change and environmental projects, but the Bank must also be aware of the portfolio risks.

It would be a political debate, for instance on the question of the trajectory towards zero carbon, which is a very important issue for the Bank, and I think we are on the right track.  However, the Bank is not the policy setter in the European Union. We can contribute to reaching objectives. We are doing this by investing more than 23 billion over the last five years in renewables, by pledging to go all the way up to 100 billion since Paris for climate change and we are ready to do more, not only on the projects side but also on the financing side. The invention of green bonds by the EIB was one of the major steps in the preparation of the international finance community in order to address climate change issues.  However, I must be quite clear that we have a big problem internationally on standards and criteria. When you talk about a green bond for instance, you don’t simply take a piece of paper painted green and say this is a green bond now. You need to have clear standards, you need to have a taxonomy and so far we don’t have that. If I listen at international conferences to the presentation of other institutions and admire their enormous figures on climate change-related projects, and I then go a little bit more deeply into what is in there, what is behind that, then I find out that we don’t read from the same textbook and we don’t have the same criteria, and we must arrive at that. We must arrive at a taxonomy that is relevant for all multilateral financial institutions and also national promotional institutions.  I think a great job needs to be done. It has been done for green bonds to a large extent, there has been an international accord on this. We need similar things for sustainability awareness bonds because there we have the same issue, the same challenge, and we have developed the first sustainability awareness bonds for water projects because the markets are particularly far advanced there, so comparability can be achieved, but the next issues will have to be health-related and education-related and there it will be very difficult again. So I ask for your support when going for international agreements on these issues.  Second point, one of the big changes over the last couple of years is that with the Juncker Plan we were able to address the challenges of this decade. But the countercyclical role of the Bank which we adopted at that time is to a large extent done. We not there yet completely but a lot has been done. I think we now have the obligation to look a little bit closer, and with more resolve to the position of the European Union and its Member States in the globalisation process and in international competition, and we are losing ground from day to day. For 15 years now the Member States of the European Union have been investing 1.5% of GDP less per year in innovation, research, development and education than our main competitors in Asia and North America. Nobody should believe that this goes without a loss of competitiveness and therefore I see a particular challenge for the EIB to contribute to better financing of innovation in the next couple of years, and I say innovation in the widest sense, that begins, so to speak, in kindergarten and elementary school. I’d like to say one word about our activities outside the European Union and I thank you very much for your support there. We are a tool of the European Union also outside the European Union and I think we can be very effective.  Somebody spoke about soft power, but then we must be given a mandate for that. The external lending mandate of the European Union for the EIB is under great threat if you expect us to do more, and I would be happy to do more, not only in Africa but also in our strategic relationship, for instance with Latin America and ASEAN. I could give other examples as well. We would be happy to do that but that requires a strengthening of the external lending mandate of the European Union for its Bank.  Finally Africa. I think we Europeans have to think about how it came that it took the migration crisis to make us aware of the challenges of Africa. Africa is not just a continent that is important for us in terms of a source of migration. It is a strategic partner for the next couple of years and we must develop our development policies from a donor-recipient thinking to a partnership thinking with Africa, that, thank God, has now started and we want to play a significant role in that context.

Madam President, I would like to thank the I would like to thank all the gentlemen for their speeches. I would like to say to my Spanish S&amp;D colleague that, as President Hoyer has already said, an increase in loans for third countries would certainly be desirable, but there is currently no mandate, but I have pointed out that the resilience initiative for the Southern Neighbourhood and also for the Western Balkans has been increased by 6 billion by 2021 and that I am sure that there will also be an external lending mandate for a specific Africa strategy in the next period.  I would like to say to my colleagues from the Greens and the GUE that they will certainly know that a total of 25% of the Bank's lending will be used for climate-related projects and that it will become even more in the future. I hope that we can agree that this is a positive thing. If you want to change the bank's behaviour, you also need to get a new mandate for it. President Hoyer, you have said one thing quite correctly: the Bank represents added value for the EU Member States. The Member States have paid EUR 14 billion for the bank's shares and a further EUR 3.4 billion for the reserves. In return, the EIB has lent EUR 1 100 billion over the last 60 years, triggering investments totalling EUR 3 000 billion. I would write to all my critical colleagues to consider whether this is a real deal.  I would like to say to Mr Coburn that the EIB will not lose its clout even after a possible Brexit – perhaps it will not come, as Mr Langen has said. The remaining 27 Member States have committed themselves to replacing the paid-in share capital of the British with their own reserves and to increase the available capital. Some Member States have even offered to increase the share capital. That is very positive.

I have had the privilege of closely following the activities of the bank from this perspective, both as rapporteur for the Committee on Budgetary Control and as shadow rapporteur, for getting on for five years. I am glad to present today a report which builds on Parliament’s positions from previous years and which has received very strong support in the committee. I would also like to highlight that the report points out that the bank’s lending activities for 2017 amounted to EUR 69.9 billion and the conclusion of the audit committee was that the financial statements adopted by the EIB Board of Directors present a true and fair view of the financial position of the bank as of 31 December 2017 and of the results of its operation and cash flows for 2017 in accordance with the applicable accounting framework. At the same time, the report refers to a continuing concern having to do with the geographical distribution of the signatures of the bank, a theme which we have been returning to over the past years. For this year the data shows, and the report underlines, the highly worrying fact that in 2017 half of the Member States received 80% of the total EIB investment inside the EU, while the other 14 Member States received only 10% of this investment. I highlight this point in the light of what Commissioner Katainen, and to a certain extent President Hoyer, pointed out in the previous discussion, namely that the EIB is a passive recipient of project demands and, on the basis of its commercial assessment, finances some of these projects and not others. This does not correspond to the statutory obligation of the bank to play an active role for the balanced development of the internal market, and for the social, economic and territorial cohesion. Certainly nobody questions the need for sound investments, but clearly the role of the bank cannot be reduced to a passive recipient of requests for financing. There is a key requirement of the bank to perform, and this is pointed out in the recitals of the report, regular and thorough needs assessments in various sectors, and this is key for determining investment gaps and barriers in different investment regions, and identifying a pool of opportunities for potential for growth in job investment. Regarding the governance of the bank, which is strictly within the Committee on Budgetary Control’s remit, I would like to point out that there has been progressive response by the bank in line with Parliamentary resolutions in making better access to minutes of the meetings of the various bodies of the bank, in improving the complaints procedures, which are applied by the bank. And in this regard, I would like to welcome the efforts made. In conclusion, however, I would like to point out that there are still significant problems in respect of preventing conflicts of interests among the members of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) investment committee and the enacting of more stringent rules and provisions to prevent conflicts of interests on the management board and board of directors, as well as regarding transparency and disclosure of information and intermediaries and final recipients, in relation to prevention of tax avoidance, fraud and corruption. I realise I have overrun by 30-40 seconds. I will economise on my final remarks.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 270, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Werner Hoyer", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the European Investment Bank. – Madam President, it’s a great pleasure to address the plenary for a second time this evening and to discuss what the EIB Group, that is the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund, have done and will continue to do to help support Europe’s economy. In particular, I’d like to highlight how we are controlling our financial activities and address some of the points in the excellent report of the Budgetary Control Committee, for which I thank the rapporteur and the other Members of the European Parliament who have contributed to this.  Ladies and gentlemen, on 18 July 2018 we celebrated the completion of our pledge to deliver over EUR 315 billion of additional investment through EFSI - the Juncker plan. In fact, by mid-July we had surpassed this goal, providing support to investments through the mobilisation of EUR 335 billion, and we’re well on track on delivering the target of EUR 500 billion by 2020. While this particular success story continues, the tasks and challenges for the Bank are not diminishing – and some of them have been raised earlier in the debate. We have just discussed some of them, for instance the ramifications stemming from Brexit, but these are only the most obvious ones. As the report of the Budgetary Control Committee indicates, there are also internal challenges for the Bank. I’d like to highlight two of these: reforming the governance, measuring additionality and fostering cohesion.  Honourable Members, the EIB remains at the forefront of international financial institutions when it comes to transparency standards and the quality of its governance. We follow international best practice and are aligned with other IFIs.  This holds true, for example, for the Bank’s transparency policy, which we revised in 2015 and will revise again next year. It also applies to our policies to combat fraud and corruption, as well as to enhance accountability.  In view of our dual role of delivering EU policy while also serving as a bank with high standards, we have intensified our cooperation with OLAF and the European Ombudsman, as well as continuing our ongoing exchange with NGOs. We take their demands and recommendations very seriously, and we just had a celebration of 10 years of the complaints mechanism at the Bank, together with European Ombudsman, the Secretary—General of the European Ombudsman, and that was a very encouraging event.  In February 2018, the Bank put into practice its new exclusion policy, which is fully aligned with the European Commission.  Last November, our governing bodies adopted a revised complaints mechanism policy. Actors such as the European Ombudsman and Transparency International, as well as the input from public consultations, were a crucial part of this process.  We are readying ourselves for future challenges and thereby strengthening the governance. We’re rolling out reforms to strengthen internal financing. In July, the EIB Board of Directors agreed on a roadmap of several governance changes. A total of 14 different actions have been set in motion and will be implemented during the first half of this year.  Without going into too much detail, let me highlight one particular aspect that is also the focus of this year’s committee report. We will enhance our internal control and risk management environment and strengthen the three lines of defence model across the Bank, both at the level of the EIB management committee, as well as among the Bank’s services. We will also make sure that one MC member oversees risk management and therefore will not be responsible directly for any first line activities.  Moreover, I would like to stress that the Bank is close to finalising the revision of its code of conduct. This is an important point raised not only by previous EP resolutions, but also by our own EIB audit committee.  Another example of how to strengthen our governance is the discussion we were having about introducing a group chief risk officer. It would be part of a revision of the EIB Group management charter. Additional actions aim to strengthen the decision-making capacity of the board, as well as the EIB supervisory framework. And finally, we are constantly revising and assessing the actual value-added that we create.  Let me therefore briefly touch upon my second point: additionality and cohesion. The concept of additionality is central to EFSI; however, it is already central to the EIB itself. If we are not needed, if the private sector can do the job, then we are redundant. So additionality is nothing new for us, but regarding EFSI, we are particularly keen to show that what we do is additional indeed.  As you are well aware, eligible projects must point to market failures or sub-optimal investment situations. Eligibility is only the precondition, whereas additionality ensures that within such eligible operations our EIB support provides a tangible contribution, and that it makes a difference. EIB support must compliment support from other sources. The test of additionality is whether the intervention by the Bank facilitates or strengthens an eligible project from the public welfare perspective in a way that the market alone would not deliver, at least not to the same extent or in the same timeframe. The EIB is at the forefront among IFIs in measuring additionality, and we are always looking to improve. The EIB services have begun to recalibrate our current three pillar assessment.  Ladies and gentlemen, as the EU Bank, we look at structural investment needs and continue to support the EU’s transition to sustainable finance and sustainable climate. Therefore, our ambition to enhance growth, support employment and act as a catalyst for increased public and private sector investment remains key. We recognise that supporting innovation on the one hand, and deepening integration and cohesion on the other, are not a contradiction as they must be undertaken at the same time.  Only an integrated and inclusive financial and economic area can offer the required market dimensions to support innovation across Europe, and only an innovative and competitive Europe can provide the economic and political foundations for deeper integration and cohesion. Supporting cohesion and increasing convergence remains paramount to the Bank.  We will continue our activities to support cohesion via a mix of products, including structured programme loans, sector-specific programme loans and transport infrastructure loans. This made up 26% of our activities in 2015 and 2016. In 2017, we channelled 29.6% of all our lending to cohesion priority regions, just short of our ambitious target of 30%. In 2018, I’m happy to announce that we exceeded this target, with 31.8% of our lending for the year in cohesion priority regions. I’m also happy to announce that the Climate Action signatures have reached 30.3%, far ahead of the 26% objective.  Some worry that we cared too little about regional coverage. Admittedly, and deliberately, we do not apply regional or national quotas, but we also look at our activities through a regional lens. The example of EFSI shows that geographical diversification is improving. The share of the top three Member States – Italy, Germany and France – of the infrastructure window decreased, from 55% in October 2016 to below 40% in 2018. Indeed, measured as a share of GDP, which presents a much more accurate picture, the figure is very different. For instance, it’s Greece, Estonia, Portugal, Bulgaria and Lithuania which are the top five recipients of EFSI financing by GDP in 2018, and that I think is a remarkably good result. Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude by assuring you that the EU Bank has delivered, and we will continue to deliver on its objectives. Through its financial firepower, including the Juncker plan, we provide a very significant contribution to jobs and growth in the EU and external action outside the European Union. We are the Bank of the EU, and that means we are more than the sum of our national interests and an excellent example of Europe in action. We are in, a certain way, the good news institution of the European Union. As the EU Bank, I can assure you that we will stay unwavering in our support for the mobilisation of investment across the entire Union, and we will tackle the structural investment and cohesion challenges facing Europe and Europe’s single market, in particular when it comes to the role of Europe in the world, which is changing dramatically.

Increased investment, especially renewable energy, energy efficiency and the circular economy, focusing on high impact activities and products is key in achieving this objective. Also, advisory services to the companies operating in relatively new areas, like the circular economy or artificial intelligence, is very much needed and there is a need to look at how well financial needs match the palate or the services which are available. The Bank has the continuous challenge of checking whether the product is fit for purpose, because the economy around us is changing. In the context of Brexit, we welcome the Bank’s utmost efforts to ensure that its ability to achieve its financing objectives is not affected. As for the Bank’s external lending activities, as we discussed under the previous point, the Commission and the EIB is working very closely together to find a workable solution to ensure operational predictability for the EIB post 2020.

Even with the problems and shortcomings identified in this report, the functioning of the European Investment Bank can be said to be appropriate. I would like to briefly mention two important issues: on the one hand, what my colleague Pirinski has already mentioned. Of course, the European Investment Bank is a bank, and of course there are explanations for the imbalances in its lending, support and money-lending policies within the EU, but even a good explanation does not solve the problem. There cannot be a situation in which the European Investment Bank's outsourcing policy is concentrated in the 15 countries of the European Union that already have membership before 2004.

And, of course, I thank and congratulate Mr Pirinski on his discharge into this report of all his wisdom and the follow-up of years and deepening the intricate activities of the European Investment Bank, especially given that we continue to raise the need for the Court of Auditors to also be able to audit these activities. I would just like to quickly go through three points that are repeated.  First, the urgent rebalancing of territorial impact. You tell us, Mr Hoyer, and I think I have understood correctly, that 2018 is - we are talking about 2017 – an important step forward, and you have appointed a number of countries, on which you said that they were the fifth in the 2018 activities. I would like to know if they are all together or if they are all in fifth place in the rankings, because I think in the fourth was Spain , it seems to me – or Italy, therefore it would be a considerable advance. If they're all together, I think it's worse now. Secondly, the migratory phenomenon. Again we are faced with problems that in Africa, as you said—not to mention the Middle East, but especially in Africa—we find that, in relation to credits, microcredits or micro-enterprises, your bank has asserted multiple contracts, for which we are very happy. But when we go to implementation, we find that most are zero; and that worries us a lot, because somehow we have to make the European Investment Bank also a bank for the development policies of our main partners. Third, innovation. Again we find that start-ups ask us for funding and end up going to the United States. I'd like to know why. And finally, madam president, I have come across the surprise that the jobs created by the projects are not measured. There is no formula for seeing the employment effects of your projects.

It's like that on a good day. Secondly, of course, it is worth saying that the EIB operates on the basis of its own policies, the last was the climate policy established more than 3 years ago, but also on the basis of the mandates given by the legislators, the FC, the Juncker Plan. And there are, of course, differences, because the limit is 25% for our own policies and 40% for the Juncker Plan.  One caveat That I wanted to make very clear is that it is controversial to call for the EIB to finance only those projects that have shown real added value for the local population, because climate issues can make investment more difficult.

The pivotal role of the Bank is to ensure value-adding strategic public investment supporting sustainable growth and creating high value jobs within the EU. As an example, the overall financing as approved by the EIB Group within the EU in 2015-2016 will support EUR 544 billion of investment up 2.3% to GDP and create 2.25 million jobs by 2020. In 2017 the EIB successfully achieved its objectives, implementing EU policy in line with its mission, as detailed in its operational plan. The bank lending signature reached almost EUR 70 billion, of which 90% was within the Union. This financial resource was dedicated to four strategic areas: innovation and skills; infrastructure; environmental projects; and SMEs and midcaps. SMEs received more than 40% of the whole sum, which corresponds to their role as a backbone of the European economy. Results will be better with proactive policy and increasing the funding to these enterprises. We are satisfied with the conclusion of the audit committee that the financial statement, adopted by the EIB Board of Directors, presents a true and fair view of the financial position of the Bank and of the results of its operational and cash flows. Better corporate governance would be achieved paying greater attention to meet the long-term effects when defining investment actions in its funding decisions. In order to speed up the economic recovery in the Union and to help certain economic sectors and geographical areas to catch up, a major role is played in the European funding for strategic investments. With mobilised investment at the end of 2017 exceeding EUR 207 billion, EFSI is on the way to reach its goal.

The EIB could be well described as one of the EU’s success stories and in recent years especially it is good to see it investing in a growing number of small and medium enterprises, an area which has been badly let down by the conventional banking system, not just in my own country but right across the EU. I know from speaking to constituents how difficult it is for SMEs to get access to finance in Ireland, even for the most viable of small companies, our banks, every one of which was bailed out by the people, have abdicated the most basic responsibility for that sector, injecting finance into the real economy. Of course we wouldn’t need that injection were it not for the actions of another, by far more devious EU institution, the ECB. Page 96 of its 2017 report, which we debated yesterday, contains the following paragraph: ‘The reduction of IBRC-related assets by the Central Bank of Ireland during 2017, mainly through sales of long-duration floating rate notes, is a significant step in the direction of the necessary full disposal of these assets. A more ambitious sales schedule would further mitigate the persisting serious monetary financing concerns’. I’ll translate that for you. The weaponisation of the euro by the ECB in Ireland continues, with more success recorded in 2017 when the Central Bank of Ireland destroyed another EUR 4 billion. This ongoing destruction of borrowed billions is the result of a bailout of two insolvent non-systemic banks that the latter became IBRC, a bailout that we, the ECB, forced on the Irish government through blackmail and threats. Ireland has already destroyed EUR 19 billion with plans to destroy a further EUR 12 billion in coming years. All this has been achieved without a shot being fired, and without a word of protest from the Irish Government. Once again I compliment Mr Pirinski on his report and complement the EIB on its work.

Moreover, the Commission itself has not even achieved its own modest budget target of 20% in this respect. For example, the Committee on Budgetary Control also wants the European Investment Bank to invest more in disadvantaged regions: often regions with institutional problems, poor infrastructure, brain drain, unreliable institutions.  However, modernising market infrastructure is not the role of the European Investment Bank, but rather investing in the market context within the bank's four core themes: small and medium-sized enterprises, energy, infrastructure and transport.

I am pleased that, indeed, the European Investment Bank is supporting economic development, growth, but also development, and I very much expect that the combination of ESI Funds and the European Investment Bank, which may also attract private sources, namely blended financing, can cause our investment capacity in the Union as a whole to grow. I am looking at a greater improvement in this geographical balance in 2017, but I am appealing to you, Mr President, not only in the context of advice and advisory services, also perhaps to develop the ability to use new financial instruments, especially in those countries that are not yet so experienced in using them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 282, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Νότης Μαριάς (ECR).", "mepid": "125069", "text": "   Madam President, Mr Hoyer, the saying goes that silence is gold.

These have been a huge success, as you pointed out. I am pleased that I was a rapporteur for his successor for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.

I agree with the rapporteur when they said that we should have in particular more advisory capacities for SMEs so they can see the opportunities.  So, overall, a good job has been done.

We need to tell our citizens – our companies – what is available, how they can benefit from the European Investment Bank and what EFSI can offer, because otherwise there is a risk that people don’t know.  EU institutions and even our financial instruments are not as simple to understand as a normal bank loan from a local bank and that’s why we have to spread the word.  The reason why some Member States have benefited more than others and some regions have benefited more than others, for instance from EFSI, is mostly because there have been active politicians or public authorities which have told citizens and companies what is available. My second point is just to thank Members for a substantial, civilised and rather consensual discussion on this issue. It’s a good basis to continue cooperation.

I’ve just been criticised for overdrawing my time account and I have roughly 20 questions that deserve precise answers, so please forgive me if I don’t address them all, but I promise again that you will get the answers in an appropriate way and as soon as possible.  A few general remarks.  The question of regional distribution begins to touch my nerves, because I think that everybody who has a feeling that his or her own country has maybe one per mil less than their neighbour is complaining about regional distribution. I told you the facts and figures about EFSI projects. In general, for all EIB projects the GDP-based distribution of the lending shows Greece number 1, Cyprus number 2, Portugal number 3, Croatia number 4 and Poland number 5. Is that so wrong? I think this is exactly the priority setting that you’re expecting from us. So I think we are making real progress on that question.  Second issue, I just wanted to throw into the debate the word infrastructure, as I heard it several times. The European Union has a significant problem with infrastructure, the quality of the infrastructure. We are not investing enough in the maintenance of our infrastructures, which leads to a structural degradation of the quality. We need to address this issue. It is much more sexy to build new things than to maintain old ones, but this is an issue we have to address. A very interesting question that somebody raised about start-ups. We have a serious problem here in corporate financing in Europe in general, but in start-up financing in particular. The fact is that roughly 75% of all corporate financing in Europe is via banks and not via capital markets. In the US it’s exactly the other way round, and this is the reason why sometimes, when an intelligent inventor develops something new, opens a market, develops a new product, then he or she might be very, very successful in the start-up phase but then comes growth financing and for growth financing we don’t have enough instruments.  I would love to see EIB activities developing further in this field because I hate seeing sometimes the most promising products leaving Europe and then being developed with huge money in other continents.  By the way, we measure the employment effects of our activities as precisely as we can, so maybe we can give you a couple of figures afterwards. But I just saw that, for instance, our analysis shows that in 2018 the number of SMEs supported was 285 000 and the number of jobs maintained in SMEs and midcaps was 3.9 million. We probably need to publish these figures more loudly and with more self-esteem. Financing, well long-term financing.  Ladies and gentlemen, some of you want to see us as a commercial bank and some want to see us as a political instrument. We are both. We need to perform in several areas like a commercial bank because we are refinancing completely on the capital markets. We must have the trust and the confidence of the investors, otherwise they don’t give us 60, 70, 80 billion per year in EIB bond purchases. On the other hand, we serve a public goal. Our objectives are set by you and the Council and the Commission, and that means that we have to reconcile the role of a public institution with commercial behaviour and expertise on the markets, and I think we are quite successful in doing that. On the question of transparency, Ms Gräßle, I share your view and I think we are making progress, but we still can get better. But there are two small issues I would like to address.  Number one, please bear in mind that the EIB is a very lean institution. We have 3 500 people in the Bank. It sounds a lot, but we are doing twice the volume of the World Bank with this, and eight times the volume of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The World Bank has 18 000 people and the EBRD in London 2 500 people. So we are a lean institution. Sometimes we are criticised for not being represented visually with official offices in all Member States of the European Union. Yes, we try to be as efficient as possible. Please take this as a serious effort to be visible and available everywhere, but at a cost reduction or a containment strategy that we pursue.  And the last word, Ms Gräßle, on gender. Well, you run into open doors with me and whenever a Member State comes with a new proposal for the management committee and the Member State proposes a lady I will embrace that immediately. Spain has just done so and I’m very grateful for that, but we could definitely have more. But this is not in the hands of the management of the Bank. This is exclusively in the hands of the Member States. When it comes to our top managerial personnel we have made progress in the seven years that I am at the Bank now from 18% to 26% in the top positions. So we are moving in the right direction, but it cannot come overnight because you need a couple of years of career at the Bank in order to get there, but I promise you I’ll have that in view in each and every personnel decision we take as long as we don’t discriminate against the other gender.

In this mandate we have discussed several times about violations of rights in the European Union and we have also seen how existing instruments are slow and ineffective.  The European Union is a community based on common values that we must defend and respect as citizens and as Member States of the Union. This is not an a la carte Europe, in which we can keep the rights and not the duties.  When a State wants to join the Union, it has to meet a number of requirements in economic, political, fiscal, judicial matters... These requirements are many and very strict, and so it takes years for candidate countries to enter—if they succeed.\" And, once inside, what happens? Once we've passed that test, can we do whatever we want? Obviously not. This review has to be continuous, and if deficiencies are found, they must be corrected, and if not, an effective and proportionate system of sanctions must be established.  I must confess that I would have preferred direct sanctions, but I understand that the Treaty, in these cases, does not provide for it. So I think the Commission has made a very clever proposal, using the tools at its disposal, in this case the European budget.  But, as I said in the Committee on Budgets, I believe that the European Commission has also missed a golden opportunity, because if we put together the two ideas I have just developed — that is, respect for the values of the European Union, but also the protection of the budget — we fall short if we only stick to the rule of law. Because the values we are talking about are the values enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on Union: respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, human rights, solidarity, justice, tolerance... All of those are in Article 2. Those are the ones that define our Union and those are the ones we have to protect.  But we also need to protect the European budget, and there is no greater attack on public accounts, solidarity and European values than evasion, fraud and unfair tax competition. And that is why it seemed to me essential that this was also one of the values, of the criteria to be controlled, examined and sanctioned, if necessary. We cannot speak of equality, of justice, of solidarity if we look the other way at fiscal injustice.  In our meetings preparing Parliament's position, in addition to discussing — as you know perfectly well — the subject-matter of the Rules of Procedure, we have also discussed and negotiated fundamentally three aspects.  One: the protection of final beneficiaries. In imposing sanctions through the European budget, we need to be very scrupulous about the mechanisms and make sure that these sanctions go directly to the offenders and not to the final beneficiaries. And that is why I believe that with the amendments made — thanks to the Commission's technical services we have been able to work on this — the safety net we have defined is much more guaranteeing for the final beneficiaries.  The second aspect on which we have also worked is the panel of experts, because decision-making under this Regulation is going to be a very sensitive issue. The European Commission must have at its disposal all the information possible in order to be able to make a reasoned, objective decision and, above all, away from any partisan temptation, and this is the objective of establishing a panel of experts: that they can advise the European Commission on this task.  And finally, the role of the European Parliament. In the Commission's proposal, our role was mere observer and this is not acceptable, because we are talking about values, but a budget, and, in the budget, this House is also a budgetary authority, as is the Council, and we must therefore have a say.  I end, Madam President, with a sentence you said this morning, during the debate, the President of the Government, Pedro Sánchez: it is time to defend and protect the values that make our project a unique project.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 294, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Petri Sarvamaa", "mepid": "112611", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Madam President, democracy is never self—evident. Never. This we should keep in mind. One of the most crucial things, if not the most crucial thing to sustain democracy in any state is the rule of law. Once the rule of law is questioned, the path to the keys of Pandora’s Box is open to all, because, my dear colleagues, democracy is never perfect.  Democracy, through elections, can produce governments and leaders who are tempted to take that walk to Pandora’s Box and see if they can control it. On their way, they might tamper with the judicial system of the state, or they could find it handy to influence the media so that journalists would not see it in their best interest to criticise those in power. Or maybe these political leaders would like to introduce laws that make it more and more difficult for civic organisations to go about their activities, to express their ideas and worries. In doing all this, these governments and their leaders would clearly be undermining the rule of law, which is the central pillar of democracy. This, unfortunately, is nothing but a factual description of what is going on inside the European Union today. If we want to safeguard democracy itself, we need to safeguard the rule of law.  It has been painfully clear for years already that the presently available legal mechanisms in the Union do not stop governments on this dangerous path, and this is why we have this extremely important regulation in front of us. We need a mechanism that will introduce concrete consequences for the Member States in question, and that is why the Commission wisely followed the will of this Parliament – Parliament’s Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) resolution – and proposed a budgetary law for co—decision.  According to the Commission proposal and our final report, in order for the Union to protect its financial interests from the risk of financial loss caused by generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law, the Union should be able to impose appropriate measures that include restricting, reducing or even suspending access to EU funding in a manner proportionate to the nature, gravity and scope of the deficiencies.  Let me finally underline the five things that are most crucial to understand about this legislative report. One: the legal basis for this proposal is in financial regulation, not in Article 7. This is about protecting the EU’s budget – taxpayers’ money. Two: we want to write a law that is the same for all Member States. The rule of law could be in jeopardy in any Member State. Three: we want to protect the final beneficiaries of EU funds – researchers, civic organisations and ordinary citizens must not suffer due to the freezing or cutting of funds. Four: we are talking about generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law. There would have to be clear and widespread undermining of the rule of law before the budgetary consequences could be launched. And finally, five: our report puts Parliament on an equal footing with the Council, through a co—decision procedure of a transfer to a budgetary reserve.  With these words, I sincerely hope that every Member of this Chamber takes a close look at this report. When you do, I trust that you will consider it of the utmost importance to support this proposal and give us a strong mandate for the trilogues, since nothing in today’s Europe is as important as the rule of law. Last, but certainly not least, let me wholeheartedly thank and praise my co-rapporteur, Ms Gardiazabal Rubial, for her excellent work on this report.

It is our job to protect European citizens from governments that violate the rights of those individual citizens.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. I would like to begin by thanking all the committed Members of the Commission, the rapporteurs Mrs Gardiazabal Rubial and Mr Sarvamaa, but also you, Mrs Sargentini, for the very, very knowledgeable and thorough, good consideration of our proposal, which you want to accept in principle but want to improve further. For that ours, my thanks and respect. The Commission's proposal for a regulation on the protection of the Union's budget in the event of general shortcomings in the rule of law is about developing an instrument for the next budgetary framework, and therefore for the budgetary policy of the future, in order to protect Europe and its budget in the best possible way, and hence our citizens and taxpayers, from abuse, corruption, deficiencies, fraud and infidelity. Strong support from Parliament is crucial for further discussions with the Council. We should have had the instrument for a long time. The fact that we are now proposing it is a purely logical approach. Because if our budget programmes, where we promote projects, where we process and approve applications, where we provide money, can also lead to disputes with partners, with beneficiaries, with Member States, regions, municipalities and disputes, we must be able to rely in every Member State on the courts being independent, being obliged to the rule of law, and being free of instructions. that the rule of law applies fully everywhere. Member States already have to demonstrate that their rules and procedures for the use of EU funds are effective and that there is sufficient protection against abuse or fraud. With this proposal, we are strengthening our instruments and we are increasing our authority as the European Union. For there is no mechanism in any Member State to protect the money of our citizens and taxpayers in the event of general shortcomings in the rule of law. The focus on protecting the EU's financial interests is important to me. In my opinion, the current definition of the scope of our proposal ensures a meaningful balance, it serves to protect the Union's budget and other existing EU mechanisms, such as Article 7 of our Treaty. It is not a question of sanctions, it is about protecting European funds and, therefore, about the economic and correctness of the implementation of the budget at European level. We propose a transparent and objective mechanism. All possible measures under this new procedure must always be proportionate to the nature and severity of the rule of law deficit. In other words, cuts in funds or cancellations of funds must always be related to the abuse, to the rule of law deficit. It has been mentioned that the citizen, the beneficiary, the student, the researcher, the promoter of social projects must not be the stupid one. That is why the citizens and the project should get what the project and the citizens can expect. Burden-sharing is at the expense of our civil society, our students, our scientists, our beneficiaries as a whole. If the Commission has reason to believe that there is a rule of law deficit and could therefore affect the financial interests of the European Union and its citizens, then we will initiate a procedure that could lead to the adoption of appropriate remedial measures. We have to take into account: decisions of the Court of Justice, reports from the Court of Auditors, conclusions of relevant competent organisations. Before we take a decision, we will and must consult the Member State concerned and give it the opportunity to give a comprehensive opinion. And the fact that Parliament wants to be involved here alongside the Council on an equal footing, that it wants to be part of the decision-making process, I think is more than obvious, I think is consistent, and I also support that. Nevertheless, the decision-making process must be immediate, rapid and efficient, constitutional and unbureaucratic. In addition, we, as the Commission, have to account for every measure, for every step, before you, Parliament, the House. At this stage, after the exchange with the Council and Parliament has reached the report to be debated here today, we should discuss in depth the following issues for the forthcoming discussions between the Council and Parliament: the link between the shortcomings and the protection of the Union's financial interests. The demarcation between this proposal and the instrument and other mechanisms, such as Article 7 of our Treaty, remains clear and must be be clear. There must be no grey area between different instruments and possibilities for action. To this end, we have used the expert advice of our legal services and will continue to ensure that the whole thing really clearly describes which instrument can be used in which case. In the Council, some Member States are calling for the list of possible shortcomings to be specified, extended or even comprehensiveand, and thus exhaustive, drawn up. This would create legal certainty. I think that is true. We are ready to expand the list. However, it must remain open in order to allow the mechanism to be applied, even in unforeseeable cases, and thus to give Europe every opportunity to respond appropriately to any situation that may arise in the future. An indicative time limit is discussed within which the Commission must act after receiving a reply from the Member State concerned, i.e. a reasonable and limited period of time. We think this is obvious, but I think that thoroughness over speed applies here. In the case of complex issues, it is more important to me that the Commission should be able to examine it fully, and therefore the deadline must not be too short, but should only begin after the Member State has been consulted and its opinion has been delivered. They want to see the sources of information on which the Commission builds its work more precisely. I think this too is quite obvious. The list of case-law to which the Commission can refer and the sources of information that we use can be clarified and defined in concrete terms, as requested by Parliament. I also think that the question of how to further strengthen the protection of the final beneficiary is worth discussing. The rule of law mechanism that you are discussing today and which is in good hands with you is an important building block of our Commission proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027. If you agree with it, it should and will make an important contribution to the sound and regularity of the financial management, thereby strengthening the protection of taxpayers' money and thus of citizens and taxpayers accordingly. We are thus filling a gap in European law. I would ask you to fill the gap in the best possible way and, in the course of our deliberations this year, to take a decision that can be an important complementary basis for the financial management of the future and the next decade.

The independence and impartiality of the judiciary are essential to ensure respect for the rule of law.

We want the Commission to ensure that the legitimate interests of the final beneficiaries or beneficiaries of the programme or funds, who may be affected by measures taken, are fully safeguarded.  That is why we want to oblige the Commission to carry out procedural assessments of the impact of proposed measures on national budgets.

I welcome the Commission's proposal and thank colleagues for the report. The regulation starts at the EU's major weakness, namely Member States with corrupt structures. We see a new development in some Member States, namely state corruption. We see government officials using their influence as heads of government to get EU money for themselves or their friends and relatives, and then prevent investigations into it. The regulation should find solutions in this case. An Article 7 procedure would not solve such problems, because that article establishes a general judicial procedure. But we are dealing with selective failures by a few who fill their pockets and silence the police and the judiciary.  That is why, Commissioner, a long-held desire for budgetary control is being fulfilled this evening, namely that something happens when we have the Member States' failure to act in the event of fraud and money laundering with EU funds, because the perpetrators are prominent. That is what it is all about, and there is nothing to gloss over.

Of course, there may be phenomena in the functioning of the European Union that threaten the rule of law, but whatever threatens the rule of law, the European Union cannot take a decision when it wants to counter the supposed threats to the rule of law by means that threaten the rule of law.  However, the Commission's proposal is weak, it has deteriorated even further in parliamentary preparation, lacking normativity, the most important idea on which the rule of law is based. It is not possible to clearly explain what violations of the rules are the subject of proceedings which may result in extremely important financial penalties. This proposal is a dismantling or jeopardising of the rule of law, and it cannot be supported.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 318, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Arndt Kohn (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "186884", "text": "   Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has Why are we once again talking about the rule of law today?

Unfortunately, in the Council, EU governments have been blocking key legislative files that would help ensure fair competition in the common market and make big corporations and rich individuals pay their fair share, from tax transparency in country-by-country reporting, to a common tax base to the digital tax.  Yesterday, the Commission presented the proposal to shift from unanimity to qualified majority and to give this Parliament co—decision powers on tax matters. We think that the Commission has chosen the wrong instrument to achieve their objective. It is doomed to failure to take recourse to the ineffective passerelle clause, which requires unanimity itself, instead of using Article 116. However, it is not the Commission, but the Member States, that are responsible for stalling crucial legislative tax files.  Against this backdrop, I present on behalf of Sven Giegold the report on the Fiscalis programme, which witnesses that Member States are able to overcome their national egoism to the benefit of their citizens. The Fiscalis programme is a success story showing the positive results stemming from cooperation between national tax authorities. Since its inception, the Fiscalis programme has facilitated and enhanced cooperation between tax authorities within the Union. It has helped national tax authorities to accomplish their core task of collecting taxes. So we are happy that the Rapporteur’s draft report received broad support from different political groups. We are glad that the majority in this House acknowledges the need for intensified tax cooperation, an increase of the budget and enhanced transparency of the programme itself.  There is only one amendment tabled for tomorrow’s plenary vote, and we want to use this opportunity to ask for your support for that amendment. The instrument of cross-border joint audits is the latest frontier for enhanced administrative cooperation between tax authorities across the different Member States. Joint audits are particularly useful in the case of transfer price agreements, residency or permanent establishment issues and aggressive tax planning schemes. We therefore urge you to vote in favour of the joint S&amp;D-Greens amendment, which makes joint audits eligible for funding under the Fiscalis programme. We are convinced that this will foster fair taxation to the benefit of all citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 331, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Günther Oettinger", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Mr. The Commission. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Tonight I am representing my colleague Mr Moscovici, who is in Athens for talks with the Greek Government. I would ask you, Mrs Scott Cato, to greet Mr Giegold and to thank him for his excellent work on this dossier. Our national tax authorities and the European Union continue to suffer from insufficient capacity and inextensive cooperation. Cooperation between Member States can still be developed. This applies within the European Union and also applies to the relations of our tax authorities with third countries. As a result, the efficiency and effectiveness of their work suffers. That is why answers to the questions of how to further curb tax fraud, tax evasion, tax avoidance and avoidance and how to provide answers to digitalisation and new business models remain important. At the same time, we must free our citizens and businesses from unnecessary administrative burdens. These factors constantly bring new tasks for the functioning and performance of national tax authorities. They should be able to concentrate on their core task, tax collection. This feeds the national budget, and indirectly the European budget. That is why we propose to continue the tried and tested Fiscalis programme with the aim of supporting tax policy and tax authorities through operational cooperation measures. A significant part of the support will be the establishment and operation of IT systems and the exchange of tax-related information between Member States and with citizens and our businesses. By creating a framework for measures that support the internal market, promote the competitiveness of the Union and serve to protect the financial and economic interests of the Union and its Member States, the new Fiscalis programme, which is also included in the Commission's proposal in the post-2020 budget framework, aims to help prevent and combat tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance, thereby strengthening tax justice. In addition, the programme has an important further objective: to facilitate and modernise the work of tax administrations. To this end, Fiscalis provides practical tools that could lead to better service and reduced administrative burdens for taxpayers, citizens and businesses. How does Fiscalis intend to achieve this? I would like to mention four main programme components. Firstly, further strengthening cooperation between tax administrations through optimal exchange of experience and best practices. Secondly, a focus on innovation and answers to new tasks, as well as the use of opportunities that may arise from new technologies such as blockchain. Thirdly, optimum coordination and an overview of all IT developments, systems, networks and platforms financed under the programme and, last but not least, investment in the tax authorities themselves, in staff: training, seminars, conferences, training materials. It is precisely these measures that are of great importance and are intended to provide staff in tax administrations with good information and preparation for the EU's tax policies. Fiscalis is not new. The existing programme has already made important improvements in the past and present, providing added value that is also highly valued and recognised by the tax authorities and finance ministers in the Member States. Joint audits, project groups, expert teams – all of this is part of this and is financed from it. We are proposing a total of EUR 270 million for the seven years of the next budgetary framework in order to use this money and this instrument to further strengthen the fight against tax fraud and evasion. All in all, we believe that a modernised Fiscalis programme serves the European interests and those of the Member States. We are pleased that, both in Parliament and in the Council, Mr Giegold has made progress on this dossier in the ECON Committee through thorough work. Thank you for this progress! We are counting on a constructive discussion. And when the honourable Member asked at the beginning why we do not use Article 116 – in what the Commission decided yesterday as a proposal for the majority principle in tax law, on some tax law issues – the answer is: we are guided by the objective or by the consideration: what way, what action could be capable of winning a majority in the Council? And after a thorough Mr Moscovici's view is that Article 116 would be less promising in the Council than the Commission's action. I am sure that my colleagues, Mr Dombrovskis and Mr Moscovici, will be ready to hold direct talks with Mr Giegold and other Members of this House in the coming weeks on how to proceed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 332, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Manuel dos Santos", "mepid": "21918", "text": "  draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. – Mr President, allow me, first of all, to address the rapporteur's representative, who has done an excellent job. I offer my compliments here and this work has also been valued by the Committee on Budgets with the significant vote on the report on it. Then also to address the Commissioner to thank him for his systematically cooperation with the Committee on Budgets, for the positive cooperation that many praise and which we take great advantage of. I am convinced that, also in relation to this programme, the Commissioner will not fail to develop it, as is the wish and interest of the European Union in the context of the ongoing dialogue he has with Parliament and the Committee on Budgets.  The Fiscalis Program, as you know, aims at cooperation between tax and tax administrations through collaboration and exchange of information. This cooperation can be central to greater effectiveness in the fight against tax evasion and avoidance and money laundering.  Together with my Group, I have tabled some proposals to amend the text from which I would point out these three ideas: the process of selecting external experts should take gender equality into account, in line with the UN's sustainable development objectives, in particular paragraph 5; the Fiscalis Programme should try to exploit synergies with other Union measures in fields related to the Customs Programme, the European Anti-Fraud Programme, the Single Market Programme and structural reform support programmes for better cost-effectiveness; and the increase in total funding of the programme should reach around EUR 300 million in 2018 prices, as a decision of the Committee on Budgets. I think the Commission can make an effort to do so.  The text adopted in committee, which is expected to receive massive support in plenary, then allows us to create a programme that will support the tax authorities of the Member States in pursuing the best tax policies, cooperation between them and the development of European human resources capacities and electronic systems. In this regard, it is important to recall that the European Commission is committed to finding tax commitments between Member States that can progressively translate into the elimination of the current model of unanimity. This rule of unanimity in fiscal policy has been justified historically, but it is now outdated and, when a good consensus can be found on this issue, a firm step will be taken in the development of economic and monetary union.

Profits made in one European Member State are funnelled through not even so difficult constructions to tax havens. Albeit through VAT carousels or other constructions, fraudsters make convenient use of these cross-border systems precisely because they escape the eye of the various national administrations. And the problem is becoming more and more urgent.  Globalisation and digitisation are blurring our borders. Companies easily set up branches on the other side of the world and sell their products worldwide, but our tax authorities still operate on an island. The income of a local SME is very easy to tax and control because they remain within our national borders. But checking the tax returns of multinationals and internet companies is a very different pair of sleeves. Cooperation at European level is therefore really crucial. I am convinced that our tax authorities have more than enough information to get the bad apples out. We must therefore take even more out of their isolation from the various administrations and invest in bridges between these national islands.  As far as I am concerned, the smooth and efficient exchange of information and data is the smartest way to tackle cross-border tax fraud.

This is primarily about the procurement and maintenance of ICT, hardware and software, information and communication technologies.  But we definitely want to fight for the amount; it should not be subject to a reduction in order to ensure the best possible continuation of cooperation between tax authorities in order to prevent and combat fraud and evasion at European and national level.

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr I would like to begin by thanking all the shadows, the other rapporteurs, all the organisations I have met, political officials, assistants and the secretariat for their good cooperation. It is an important piece of work that we have done together, and I am glad that this has led to a broad consensus in committee. We are living in a tough time in Europe, where respect for our own principles and rules is rocking. We have governments that legislate or otherwise act against freedom of expression, freedom of the press, minority rights. Governments that believe that democracy is only voting at a certain interval. However, a democracy that does not respect fundamental rights or the rule of law cannot be called a full democracy, and a legally secure society is characterised by independent courts and the rulings of the courts are respected. Equality before the law shall be guaranteed; individuals should not be arbitrarily affected. The other day, the popular mayor Paweł Adamowicz from Gdansk, Poland, was murdered. According to the perpetrator, the attack was revenge against the mayor's former party. But the thing is that the mayor had already been threatened, that he had reported the threats, but that the authority has chosen to close the case. The mayor of Gdansk was known for his welcoming attitude towards refugees and for his support for civil society organisations. In just one year, three journalists who have uncovered widespread corruption cases have been murdered in EU countries – Bulgaria, Slovakia, Malta. In Hungary, Prime Minister Orbán has been accused of restricting free speech, of damaging the independence of the judiciary, of corruption, of restricting academic freedom in the country and of eroding the human rights of minorities. Poland has tabled 13 legislative proposals which the Commission believes risk leading to political governance of the judiciary. The draft law gives, among other things, poland's Minister of Justice the power to appoint and dismiss the country's judges without criteria. Unfortunately, the list is long on examples, which is why we need a strong programme of rights and values. In April 2018, Parliament proposed the creation of a european civil society support programme, just as we support MRI organisations outside the EU's borders. And we therefore welcome the Commission's proposal, but we cannot accept that a completely new area, that is, rights and values, should be embedded in existing programmes and also with a lower budget when the situation is that existing programmes are already underfunded. That is why we are calling for a greatly increased budget and for rights and values to be their own programme, to stand on their own two feet. We are directing a greater share of support to civil society and making it easier to apply for smaller grassroots organisations as well. The aim is to protect and promote democracy and the rule of law, equality and equality, rights, non-discrimination and to strengthen gender mainstreaming, gender mainstreaming, to raise citizens' knowledge of the Union, to promote freedom of expression, diversity, civic engagement and to combat violence and violence against women. Problems should be prevented in the first place, and that is precisely what this programme is all about. It is aimed at all Member States, civil society, municipalities, regions, other institutions. However, we need both carrots and whips to address the problems we face, and that is why we are also proposing that there should be a possibility that in certain specific cases the Commission can go in and transfer other EU funds in the country concerned to the programme when proceedings are initiated against the country in question, and that a percentage of aid should be allocated when we see a rapid and serious deterioration in the compliance of a Member State with the country concerned. our common values. Being an EU member obliges. Article 2 of the Treaty states: \"The Union shall be based on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. These values shall be common to the Member States in a society characterised by diversity, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and the principle of equality between men and women.' That is the basis of the new programme.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 344, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Sylvie Guillaume", "mepid": "96952", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. Mr President, the European Union is experiencing a sharp rise in intolerance, nationalist and Eurosceptic movements of all stripes, and also unparalleled misinformation.

In order to support dialogue between Europeans and to strengthen mutual understanding, it is essential to defend this programme and to see it with a budget that is up to the challenges ahead. I would like to thank the rapporteur and the various shadow rapporteurs for their commitment to defending an ambitious 'Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values' programme. It is in this spirit that the Committee on Culture and Education has supported the doubling of the budget dedicated to active citizenship, i.e. EUR 500 million for the period 2021-2027. These funds will be used for local organisations and citizens' groups working for inclusive and participatory citizenship, with the continuation of memory work and the promotion of a sense of belonging to a common Europe.

For this reason, the Commission has proposed a new Justice, Rights and Values Fund, whose overarching aim is to sustain open, democratic and inclusive societies. The Rights and Values programme is part of the new Fund, together with the Justice programme. With the adoption of the report and the mandate for the future negotiations, Parliament shows once again its strong support for the promotion of rights and values and its commitment to advance the negotiations. I welcome this ambition and support it. The new programme will continue funding key activities, such as the promotion of gender equality, anti—discrimination, the rights of the child, fighting violence against women, anti-racism and other values and priorities. It will continue the successful activities of the Europe for Citizens Programme, in particular town twinning, remembrance activities and civil society projects, allowing citizens a direct engagement with Europe. The new programme should also encourage and facilitate active participation in the construction of a more democratic union, as well as awareness of rights and values.  The Commission shares the views expressed by Parliament on the important role of civil society organisations in promoting and defending rights and values, and this role is recognised at the highest possible level in the general objective. Non-governmental organisations will continue to have a key role in the implementation of the future programme. At the same time, the Rights and Values programme shall also continue to fund a broad range of beneficiaries besides the civil society organisations, for instance, equality bodies, expert networks, public administrations, local and regional authorities, museums, academic stakeholders and so on. An equilibrium is needed to respect the variety of the programme and the policies it serves. The Rights and Values programme is also interlinked to the Justice programme and, more generally, to the rule of law mechanism. The Commission has carefully drafted them in such a way as to clearly define their scope, to develop synergies and to avoid duplications. This is a key point of our future discussion.  I do of course agree that there should be more money. There is never enough money. As you know, the negotiations on the budget had to cope with the fact that there is less money for more priorities. This is the reality. But, at the same time, I want to say that the programmes which I have just mentioned and whose main goals I have described can be combined with the money which should be put into the European Social Fund, where there is money, and there will be money, for social integration, very probably also involving the new Horizon programme, where there will be money for research and data collection related to the values and goals which we have in mind in this discussion.

A reserve of 5% of the annual plan has been created to further support NGOs where democracy and the rule of law are being violated, so as to have a democratic dialogue with those who see problems differently. A concrete solution has been found to develop European values: democracy as a process of citizens' participation in decision-making, the rule of law as the foundation of the order of the state, non-discrimination as the basis for social order.

It was a very interesting debate, also at that moment when we heard different interpretations of the word equality. I will confess to you about one moment in my history in this position as Commissioner responsible for fundamental rights in Europe. When I came to the Commission I heard that we have to promote equality. I lived half my life under a regime which imposed equality. Equality in the sense that Ms Šojdrová spoke about – in the sense of uniformity.  I lived in a society where we didn’t see people in wheelchairs. I lived in a society where I don’t remember seeing mentally handicapped people. They were hidden. They were hidden somewhere so that they were not seen because they were not equal, ideal, socialist people. That’s why I had to clarify for myself and with my colleagues that we speak about equality before the law. We speak about the principle that we all have the same rights and obligations and that we also have a duty to protect the weak ones in the sense of fighting against any kind of discrimination. At the same time I find it very important that we are promoting diversity, plurality, dialogue and active citizens. What I mean by dialogue – you know that I’m also responsible for the gender equality agenda, I fight for the ratification of the Istanbul Convention, and there is a very strong rejection from the side of the churches – I invited the churches for a dialogue. I wanted to hear their arguments. I think that this is also our duty, to listen to other opinions and I don’t see anyone here who would like to use this funding for silencing somebody who has a different opinion.  Yes, we have some limits on the freedom of speech. You might say we are silencing some people. Yes, I will always fight for silencing people who call for violence and the killing of people, especially where it is obvious and very well seen, i.e. on the Internet and social media.  That’s why we are pushing for digital companies to delete hate speech which contains this definition, that is to say hate speech which has the potential to incite violence in real life, that they delete it from the networks.  I will never defend the freedom of expression of people who call for killing, and we have started to relativise these things, and this is dangerous. That’s why we need to promote civil society and dialogue so that the people themselves define what’s still okay and what should not be tolerated. It should not be the politicians only who define these things. We need active society.  That’s why I am glad that we have this programme, which I believe will be used as a smart funding programme to promote reasonable good projects to help society to increase tolerance and common understanding – diversity, plurality, dialogue and so on – and I am afraid that we will also have to find other ways of helping society to flourish and democracy to develop as a dialogue of people.  I mentioned the IT sphere. The Internet is also a fantastic instrument for developing democracy and dialogue. I will always be for promoting technologies for the benefit of society, but as we all know this is the sphere which is also abused for fuelling hatred, for increasing intolerance, for attacks against people. At the end of January I will get a report from IT companies which will inform me about something which I call a ‘map of hatred in the EU’. On the list there is the menu of usual suspects. There are minorities. There are, yes, also the churches, the religious people who openly express their religious views, including Christians. There are gays and lesbians, there are journalists, there are politicians, in some countries there are judges, and I think that this is also one of the reasons why we have every day to think about names like Jo Cox, Pavel Adamovich, Daphne Caruana Galizia and Ján Kuciak. How many others will become victims of this increased hatred? I am afraid that if we do not stop it this will go further.  So how to face this new situation? We spoke about funding. I am convinced that if we manage to promote the idea of a digital tax, we should use part of this money for education – not propaganda but education – objective informing about our history, for working with the young generation so that they are able to apply critical thinking to be able to work with the information. I am sure that if we are promoting the technologies on one side we have to use the benefit of it and maybe the future possible own source of the EU, which might be a digital tax, for better education and for better developing the values which we speak about. I think that this is the way we will have to go anyway.

I would also like to thank the Commission for the good cooperation that we have had throughout this time that we have developed this programme. We have received very good technical help to find solutions to the problems we have seen. I am a little concerned when I first hear – which is very positive – that the Commissioner says: 'Yes, a lot of money is needed for this', but then concludes by saying: 'With less we can do more'. For us, it is important that there is actually a budget for everyone, for the whole programme. Firstly, for the existing programmes – which we also want to raise; we will not be able to agree to the reduction of existing programmes, firstly – on the one hand, properly with the new pillar, the one that deals specifically with rights and values, more closely linked to Article 2. If we try to get everything under the same programme, under the same pillar, we will not have the impact that we hope we will have with this programme. It is extremely important; it is a strong signal from us that we need, on the one hand, a lot of money and, on the other hand, we need to have the new pillar separately, not embedded in the others. When it comes to money, it is also the case that you talked about whether you can take it from maybe other parts or something in the Social Fund and something else. When it comes to issues such as this – rights and values, or social issues – it is often very difficult to add this money, for the Member States to agree to the funds. When it comes to the European Defence Fund, there has been no problem in getting EUR 13 billion. That is a considerable sum that will be borne by taxpayers. However, if we are not prepared to actually invest in what is also part of Europe's own security, our internal security, I find that very strange. We need this money, these funds for the programmes, existing programmes, and for the new pillar. That is my very clear message to the Commissioner, and I hope that we will be able to have good discussions. We will soon begin the trilogy meetings and there are some that I think we will have no problem agreeing on. For example, when it comes to making it easier for organizations to apply for funds, etc. There should be no problem.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, shadow rapporteur, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. I would also like to welcome lithuanian citizens, especially the citizens of Visaginas, in case what we are discussing here in Lithuania – and I assume this is to be welcomed. During my visits to Lithuania – in Visaginas and at the Ignalina nuclear power plant – which I have made time and again over the last 15 years, I realised what a difficult decision this had been to agree to the European Union's recommendation to close down Lithuania in the accession negotiations with the European Union. However, I would also like to say that, to date, I find this decision extremely right and reasonable, because the safety deficiencies inherent in these Soviet RBMK reactors – the graphite-moderated reactors – were not well managed, unlike by decommissioning. As correct as this decommissioning decision has been for me, it was also right that the decision to close it off prematurely, which was initiated by pressure from Brussels, was linked to the European Union's commitment not to pass on the burden of decommissioning to Lithuania – to the small country of Lithuania – that these largest RBMK reactors ever built. , under pressure from Moscow on what the Lithuanians say was occupied territory at the time. Today we are talking about the reliability of the European Union's promise to bear these burdens of decommissioning. I am very pleased that the majority of the European Parliament has agreed to my proposal to raise the originally proposed sum for the next MFF, the next seven-year budget of the European Union, not to the proposed level, but to EUR 780 million. The aim of this financing is to ensure that the dismantling of block 1 and block 2 of the two reactors can begin in 2026 and 2027 respectively. It is also important in our decision today, which we will vote on tomorrow, that the relationship between Lithuania's own contribution and the participation of the European Union should be anchored at the level it is today. In my opinion, the management of the decommissioning is in very good hands in Ignalina – I have visited the plant regularly. In my opinion, the prerequisites for dealing re-encumbeourfully with the risks of this decommissioning, but also for a responsible and transparent approach to finances, are really guaranteed. Lithuania has now made a full decision to phase out nuclear energy. That, too, should be clear to us. I believe that this must not only be acknowledged, but I believe that the decisions we are taking today on Ignalina and on decommissioning must be combined with a consistent commitment against the construction of the new Ostrowets nuclear power station on the territory of Belarus. Almost within sight of Vilnius, a high-risk construction of a nuclear power plant is being pursued there, in my opinion. It's almost done. The European stress test carried out for Ostrowets has identified risks that we do not know how we will actually get to grips with them. Retrofitting, for example, is hard to imagine in a plant that says it is not designed for earthquake risks in the region. In the context of the decision on reliability in the financing of decommissioning, I also call for reliability in defending Lithuania's security interests against nuclear risks to Belarus.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 372, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, let me thank the rapporteur, Ms Harms, for her introductory remarks and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) for its report, which was adopted on 21 November 2018. The Commission is grateful for the debate today and welcomes the vote on the other decommissioning report which took place earlier today. Let me say a few words on the most important points. The safety of European citizens is of the utmost importance to us all, and the contributions of the Members of this Parliament show your attachment to this principle. It requires the application of the highest safety standards, of transparency on risks and costs, and of the immediate decommissioning of nuclear liabilities so as not to transfer this burden to the next generations. The Ignalina programme is contributing to a substantial decrease in the level of radiological hazard and risk to the general public, as the nuclear fuel is now being transferred out of the reactor and the cooling pools into a safe dry storage facility. Remarkable progress has been achieved in the dismantling of huge installations and the processing of radioactive waste. This would not have been possible without longstanding financial support from the European Union that started already in 2001, and in the pre—accession stage in Lithuania. At that time, the European Union required Lithuania to close its only nuclear power plant – a bigger version of the Chernobyl model – and made a commitment to provide financial assistance to mitigate the consequences. Funding the decommissioning of Ignalina is a matter of solidarity with Lithuania, and the Commission is strongly attached to this principle. By the end of 2020, the Union will have provided nearly EUR 1.9 billion of financial assistance, and the Commission proposal provides for the continuation of appropriate support in the future. Based on the Ignalina detailed decommissioning plan, the Commission proposal makes it possible to start dismantling the nuclear reactor core element. More importantly, and in line with recommendations made by the Court of Auditors, it sets a maximum level of EU co—financing, which will remove uncertainties and increase ownership of the project by the beneficiary. This project is a first—of—a—kind endeavour on an unprecedented scale and will require the involvement of the best and brightest nuclear specialists. This is reflected by the higher priority given to the financing of those activities. It will generate highly relevant experience and know—how that can be of benefit to other projects in the Union and will result in increased levels of safety within the EU. It is in sharing what we know and showing solidarity that the Union brings the highest added value to its citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 373, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Werner Langen", "mepid": "1928", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur.

But Lithuania needs help, that is quite clear. As part of the accession negotiations, they had to commit themselves to decommissioning these two nuclear power stations. The Commissioner has just said that 1.9 billion has already been spent. We are now talking about a further EUR 780 million, and the funding gap, particularly with regard to final disposal, has been estimated by the Court of Auditors at a further EUR 1.6 billion. It is therefore a project of more than EUR 5 to 6 billion that the EU must shoulder. We have agreed that we want to help Lithuania, under economically justifiable conditions, of course. But, Commissioner, I have to reprimand the Commission. The Commission has proposed 552 million for the same programme, Lithuania has asked for 780 million.

Tai̶ obvious, and help for Lithuania is essential if we are to maintain the highest security standards. The closure of a nuclear power plant is a particular challenge for Europe's nuclear safety, in particular with regard to the size of the installation and the technical characteristics of the reactors. The Ignalina power plant operates two reactors of the same kind as Chernobyl. The decommissioning programme is approaching the climax of the plant, i.e. the liquidation of graphite reactors. This is an irreversible operation. The lack of sufficient funds would put an end to the dismantling process, which would greatly increase the costs of the whole project and jeopardise Europe's nuclear security. The task of safe and effective closure of this instrument far exceeds Lithuania's financial capabilities. It is also due to the fact that the country incurs additional costs associated with the closure of the power plant, which was the largest employer in the region. As a result, the income of the population in Visaginas has decreased, and the unemployment rate is highest in the country. How to accept that burden on the municipal budget?

In particular, I am pleased that the ITRE Committee did not support the Commission's proposal that the European contribution to the Ignalina programme would decrease and Lithuania would increase. The Accession Treaty does not provide for Lithuania's compulsory financing contribution. Today, the country contributes 14% voluntarily to the closures, which is a huge financial burden for Lithuania. It is also to be welcomed that the ITRE Committee has approved the closure of the Ignalina nuclear power plant by more than two hundred million euro in the amount covered by the Commission's proposal.

The question is: where will the radioactive materials from the dismantling of the plant in Lithuania be stored? Maybe in Kosovo, maybe in Skopje? We want an answer, because it is also important where radioactive waste is stored. From then on, I agree with Mrs Harms' comments on existing nuclear power plants. To say that the nuclear power plant in Akkuyu, Turkey, is now dangerous, and the European Union must do something about it. Let us not show up again after years here and the European Union will pay the cost of dismantling the nuclear power plant in Akkuyu.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 383, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Members very much for their valuable comments. Since 2001, the European Union has consistently contributed support for the decommissioning of Ignalina. The European Union is committed to meeting its commitment towards Lithuania, as provided for in Lithuania’s accession treaty. The decommissioning plan established by Lithuania, and agreed by the Commission, has scheduled activities until 2038, when all pre-existing installations will have been removed and the radioactive waste safely stored or disposed of. Based on that schedule, the Commission proposal covers all the needs for the key dismantling projects to be started up to 2027. As for your calls for increasing the budget, I cannot of course promise you anything. I don’t have the power to do so from my colleagues, but I will inform them of the core outcomes of this debate.  Finally, I want to thank Parliament for the great commitment to advancing this Multiannual Financial Framework package as much as possible.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Perhaps a few words briefly to my colleague Mrs Gräßle: the safe inclusion of nuclear power stations in decommissioning can be an alternative to the objective of restoring the green field as quickly as possible. But I would not advise against promoting rapid dismantling and greenfield everywhere in Germany, then proposing, so to speak, the method of shifting on the timeline for other countries. I believe that there are really good reasons for dismantling in Lithuania. I would like to thank the Commissioner for saying that, in fact, as Mr Langen said, there has now been an arbitrary change of strategy on the part of the Commission in the current debate with regard to funding. For me, it became very clear in the visits to Lithuania that the issue is also a question of real reliability, of trust between Lithuania and the European Commission. I make this appeal not only to you, but also to the Council. After all, it will not be the Commission alone, but it will also be the Council that will have to prove its reliability to the Lithuanians.

The programme of assistance with nuclear decommissioning aims to support Lithuania in the decommissioning of a nuclear power plant in Ignalina. The assistance specifically covers all radio safety issues related to decommissioning, which are fundamental from the point of view of the nuclear safety of the region. The programme is expected to be completed by 2038 and substantial sums are still needed to address the remaining radiosecurity problems related to the decommissioning of the plant. This is why the rapporteur has proposed an increase in the programme's budget totalling EUR 780 million, compared with the EUR 552 million set by the Commission for the period 2021-2027. The Union's financial support for this process will help to ensure effective and safe decommissioning, while increasing the Union's credibility in promoting nuclear safety. Furthermore, the funding and know-how acquired by Lithuania and all the parties involved could be useful and preparatory for the development of expertise in the field of future decommissioning.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 387, "date": "2019-01-16.json", "name": "Carolina Punset (ALDE)", "mepid": "90110", "text": "  in writing. – Nothing should be objected to the significant sum of money, close to EUR 800 million, which will cost the EU the dismantling of nuclear reactors at the Ignalina plant, covered by Lithuania's accession treaty to the Union. However, it seems to us that this report is a great opportunity to reflect on the dismantling costs arising from the use of nuclear energy. In the EU, there are more than 90 fully stationary and un dismantled reactors and our nuclear park is one of the oldest in the world, with 75% of its power plants with more than 30 years of operation and 15% with more than 40. With so many power stations closed and given the inaction of States to eliminate facilities stopped, the Commission should take action on the matter and force States to require the owners of the plants to dismantle these pockets of potential radioactive contamination.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}]
