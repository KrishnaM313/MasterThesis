Before giving the floor to President Juncker, whom I greet and thank together with all the members of the European Commission for being here today, I would like to give you some information concerning the course of today's debate. Yesterday, I told you that I consider the European Parliament to be the beating heart of the European Union, the place where the debate on the future of the Union will take place; I recalled the importance of the speech that President Juncker will give today and I invited all the Heads of State to come back and speak in this House. I believe that we too will have an open debate on the future of the Union, because we are convinced that this Parliament can truly make a decisive contribution to the growth of the Union and its improvement, to change the things that need to be changed, but also to work together with other institutions, to carry out all the necessary reforms, the institutional ones, those concerning action against terrorism, against illegal immigration and against the exploitation of human beings, but also to work on the creation of new jobs. From what we have read, there is a strong commitment from the Commission to support industrial policy, which the European Parliament has emphasized. We will work alongside the Commission to resolve all problems affecting citizens. That is why today we will listen with great attention to President Juncker's proposals: there will be an in-depth debate, at the end of which President Juncker will formulate his observations and, subsequently, the presidents of the groups will sum up this very important morning. So, just after President Juncker has intervened, the presidents of the groups will intervene, followed by the debate, the reply from President Juncker and the conclusions of the group presidents. I recommend that you respect the times allotted to you, because this will allow everyone to express themselves and then to President Juncker to give a complete and detailed response to the comments that will be made to him by the representatives who sit in this Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 1, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "President of the Commission. - Mr President, when I stood before you this time last year I had a somewhat easier speech to give. It was plain for all to see that our Union was not in a good state. Europe was battered and bruised by a year that had shaken our very foundation. We only had two choices: either come together around a positive European agenda, or each retreat into our own corners. Faced with this choice, I argued for unity. I proposed a positive agenda to help create, as I said last year, a Europe that protects, a Europe that empowers, a Europe that defends. Over the past 12 months, this Parliament has helped bring this agenda to life. We continue to make progress with each passing day. Just last night you worked to find an agreement on a trade defense instrument and on doubling our European investment capacity, and you succeeded. Thank you for that. I also want to thank the 27 leaders of our Member States. Days after my speech last year, they welcomed my agenda at their summit in Bratislava. In doing so, they thing unity. They chose to rally around our common ground. Together, we showed that Europe can deliver for its citizens when and where it matters. Ever since, we have been slowly, but surely, gathering momentum. It helped that the economic outlook swung in our favor. We are now in the fifth year of an economic recovery that really reaches each and every single Member State. Growth in the European Union has outstripped that of the United States over the last two years. It now stands above 2% for the Union as a whole and at 2.2% for the monetary area. Unemployment is at a nine-year low. Almost eight million jobs have been created during this mandate so far. With 235 million people in work, more people are in employment in the European Union than ever before. The Commission cannot take the credit for this alone, though I am sure that had eight million jobs been lost we would have taken the blame. But Europe's institutions played their part in helping the wind change. We can take credit for our European investment plan which has triggered EUR 225 billion worth of investment so far. It has granted loans to over 450,000 small firms and more than 270 infrastructure projects. We can take credit for the fact that thanks to determined action, European banks once again have the capital fire power to lend to companies so that they can grow and create jobs. And we can take credit for having brought public deficits down from 6.6% to 1.6%. This is thanks to an intelligent application of the Stability and Growth Pact. We ask for fiscal discipline but are careful not to kill growth. This is in fact working very well across the Union, despite some criticism. Ten years since the crisis struck, Europe's economy is finally bouncing back and with it, our confidence. Our 27 leaders, this Parliament and the Commission are putting ‘Europe’ back into our Union, and together we are putting ‘Union’ back into our Union. In the last year we saw all 27 leaders walk up to the Capitoline Hill in Rome, one by one, to renew their vows to each other and to our Union. All of this leads me to believe the wind is back in Europe's sails. We now have a window of opportunity, but it will not stay open forever. Let us make the most of the momentum, catch the wind in our sails. For this, we must do two things. First, we should stay the course set out last year. We still have 16 months in which real progress can be made by Parliament, Council and Commission. We must use this time to finish what we started in Bratislava and deliver on our own positive agenda. Secondly, we should chart the direction for the future. As Mark Twain wrote, and I quote: ‘years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did do’. Now is the time to build a more united, a stronger, and a more democratic Europe for 2025. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we look to the future, we do not cannot allow ourselves to be diverted from our course. Together, we have set ourselves the goal of completing an Energy Union, a Security Union, a Capital Markets Union, a Banking Union and a Digital Single Market. Together, we have come a long way. As advised by your Parliament, the Commission has already presented 80% of the proposals promised at the start of the mandate. We must now work together to ensure that these proposals become legislative acts and that these acts materialize in practice. As always, some concessions will have to be made. The proposals presented by the Commission to reform our common asylum system or to establish new and stronger rules on the posting of workers are - I know - controversial subjects. We will get good results if everyone builds their part of the bridge so that the positions can come together. I would like to say that the Commission will be open to compromise, as long as the end result is good for the Union and fair for all its Member States. We are now ready to submit the remaining 20% ​​of initiatives by May 2018. This morning, I addressed the President of the Parliament and the Estonian Prime Minister - whose strong action in the European field I would like to salute here - a letter of intent outlining the priorities for the coming year. I will not and cannot enumerate all these proposals for you, but let me mention five that are particularly important. First, I would like us to strengthen our European trade program. Europe is open to trade, yes, but there has to be reciprocity. We will have to get as much as we give. Trade is not an abstract concept. Trade is jobs, new opportunities for European companies, large or small. Every billion more exports represents 14,000 additional jobs in Europe. Trade is the export of our social and environmental standards and of our data protection or food safety standards. Europe has always been an attractive economic space, but since last year I have seen our partners from all over the world flock to our doorstep to conclude trade deals with us. With the help of your Parliament, we have just concluded a trade agreement with Canada which will apply on a provisional basis from next week. We have reached a political agreement with Japan on a future economic partnership, and by the end of the year we have a good chance of doing the same with Mexico and the countries of South America. Today, we propose to open trade negotiations with Australia and New Zealand. I would like all these agreements to be finalized by the end of this mandate and I would like them to be negotiated with the greatest transparency. Openness to trade must go hand in hand with increased transparency in our decision-making processes. The European Parliament will have the final say on all trade agreements and therefore its members, as well as national and regional parliaments, must be kept fully informed from day one of negotiations. The Commission will ensure this. From now on, the Commission will publish the full draft negotiating mandates that it presents to the Council. Citizens have the right to know what the Commission is proposing. No more lack of transparency, no more rumors and lawsuits that the Commission is constantly subject to. I invite the Council to do the same. (Applause) I would like to say once and for all that we are not naïve supporters of free trade. Europe must always defend its strategic interests. This is the reason why we are now proposing a new European Union framework for investment screening, Investment Screening, in English. If a foreign public company wants to acquire a strategic European port, part of our energy infrastructure or one of our companies in the field of defense technologies, this can only be done in transparency, through in-depth examination and debate. It is our political responsibility to know what is going on at home so that we can, if necessary, protect our collective security. (Applause) Secondly, the Commission would like to make our industry stronger and more competitive. This is particularly true of our industrial base and the 32 million workers who form its backbone. They're the ones who make the first-class products - our cars, for example - to which we owe our lead over others. I am proud of our auto industry, but I am shocked when customers and consumers are knowingly and intentionally deceived. (Applause) I call on the auto industry to make amends and put things right. Instead of trying to deceive and mislead, manufacturers should invest in the clean cars of tomorrow. Ladies and gentlemen, today we are presenting a new industrial strategy for Europe, which will allow our industry to remain or become number one in innovation, digitization and decarbonization. Thirdly, I would like Europe to be at the forefront of the fight against climate change. Last year, we set global climate standards with the ratification of the Paris Agreement, right here in this House. Faced with the weakening of the ambitions shown by the United States, Europe must ensure that it large the planet and the indivisible part of all mankind. The Commission will shortly present a proposal to reduce carbon emissions in the transport sector. Fourth, I would like us to better protect Europeans in the digital age. Over the past few years, we have made notable progress in securing the internet. New rules proposed by the Commission will protect our intellectual property rights, our cultural diversity and our personal data. We have stepped up the fight against terrorist propaganda and online radicalization. But Europe remains ill-equipped to deal with cyber attacks. Cyber ​​attacks are sometimes more dangerous for the stability of democracies and economies than guns and tanks. In the last year alone, we have recorded over 4,000 ransomware attacks and 80% of European businesses have experienced at least one cybersecurity incident. Cyber ​​attacks know no borders. They spare no one. This is why the Commission is now proposing new tools and in particular a European Cybersecurity Agency to better defend ourselves against these attacks. Fifth, migration must remain on our radar. Although the issues revolving around migration have often sparked debate and controversy, we have managed to make real progress on many fronts. Today we are protecting our external borders more effectively. More than 1,700 officers from the new European Border and Coast Guard now support the 100,000 national border guards of the Member States and patrol in particular Greece, Italy, Bulgaria and Spain. We have common borders, but the Member States which are on the front line due to their geographical location should not be solely responsible for their protection. Common borders and common protections must go together. We have succeeded in stemming the flow of irregular migrants, a source of great concern in many countries. We have reduced the number of irregular arrivals in the Eastern Mediterranean by 97% thanks to our agreement with Turkey. And, this summer, we were able to better control the central Mediterranean route. Arrivals there fell 81% in August compared to the same month last year. In this way, we have significantly reduced the number of lives lost in the Mediterranean. I cannot speak of migration without paying tribute to Italy for its perseverance and generosity. (Applause) During the summer months, the Commission worked in harmony with the Italian Prime Minister, my friend Paolo Gentiloni, and his government. We have done it and we will continue to do so because, in the Mediterranean, Italy saves the honor of Europe. We must also urgently improve the living conditions of refugees in Libya. I am appalled by the inhumane conditions that prevail in the detention centers or reception centers. Here, Europe has a responsibility but a collective responsibility, and the Commission will act in concert with the United Nations to put an end to this scandalous situation which cannot last. (Applause) Although it saddens me that not all of our Member States show the same level of solidarity, Europe, taken as a whole, has continued to show solidarity. In the past year alone, our Member States have granted asylum to over 720,000 refugees or provided for their resettlement. This is three times as many as Australia, Canada and the United States taken together. Europe, contrary to what is said, is not a fortress and should never be. Europe is and will remain the continent of solidarity where we must be able to find refuge those who are prosecuted for unacceptable reasons. (Applause) I am particularly proud of the young Europeans who volunteer to give language courses to Syrian refugees or of all these young people who, by the thousands, have put themselves at the service of our new European Solidarity Corps. These young people give life and color to European solidarity. (Applause) But we have to redouble our efforts. At the end of the month, the Commission will present a new set of proposals focusing on returns, solidarity with Africa and opening channels for legal migration. Regarding returns in particular, I would like to repeat that people who are not entitled to stay in Europe must return to their country of origin. While only 36% of irregular migrants are returned, it is evident that we must considerably step up our effort and action in this area. Only in this way will Europe be able to show solidarity with refugees who are in real need of protection. (Applause) Solidarity cannot be an exclusively intra-European affair. It is also about building greater solidarity with Africa. Africa, cradle of humanity, noble continent, young continent. Our Trust Fund for Africa, with a budget of 2.7 billion euros, is opening up job opportunities across the African continent. But, while the EU budget has provided the bulk of the funding, the contribution of all our Member States combined is only 150 million euros. The fund is now reaching its limits. We know, or should know, the risks of a funding shortage. In 2015, many migrants wanted to join Europe when and because the UN's World Food Program funds ran out. I therefore invite the Member States to join in speak up and ensure that the Africa Trust Fund does not suffer the same fate. The risk is great. (Applause) We will also work to open up avenues for legal migration. Irregular migration will only end when migrants have no option but to embark on a perilous journey. (Applause) We are about to resettle 22,000 refugees from Turkey, Jordan or Lebanon, and I join in the appeal by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to resettle another 40,000 refugees from from Libya and neighboring countries. Otherwise, Europe is an aging continent, all the more reason to endow it with a legal migration system, which is an essential necessity. This is the reason why the Commission has made proposals to facilitate migrants' access to the EU Blue Card and I thank Parliament for its support in this regard. Sehr verehrter Herr President, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren Abgeordnete! Ich habe nur einige wenige der Initiativen angesprochen, die wir in den kommenden 16 Monaten zum Abschluss bringen wollen und zum Abschluss bringen müssen. Doch dies allein reicht nicht aus, wenn wir die Herzen, ja, auch die Köpfe der Europäer zurückgewinnen wollen. Jetzt ist es an der Zeit, die Strecke in Richtung Zukunft abzustecken. Im März hat die Kommission ihr Weißbuch zur Zukunft Europas mit fünf Szenarien vorgelegt, wie Europa im Jahr 2025 aussehen könnte. Diese Szenarien wurden diskutiert - manchmal oberflächlich, sehr oft heftig -, sie wurden analysiert und mitunter teilweise zerrissen. Das ist auch gut so, denn genau dafür waren sie gedacht. Ich wollte einen Prozess in Gang bringen, in dem die Europäer selbst über ihren Weg in die Zukunft bestimmen. Die Zukunft Europas kann man nicht - gewissermaßen von oben herab –diktieren. Solche Entscheidungen müssen auf einer demokratischen Debatte und letztlich auf breitem Konsens fußen. Dieses Haus hat aktive Beiträge zu dieser Debatte geleistet, wofür ich mich besonders bei den Berichterstattern bedanken möchte. Auch möchte ich mich bei den Kollegen bedanken, die an den mehr als 2 000 öffentlichen Konsultationsveranstaltungen teilgenommen haben, welche die Kommission seit März überall in Europa organize hat. Jetzt ist es an der Zeit, die ersten Schlussfolgerungen aus dieser Debatte zu ziehen. Es ist an der Zeit, den nächsten Schritt zu machen: vom Nachdenken zum Handeln, von der Debatte zur Entscheidung. Heute möchte ich Ihnen meine Sicht der Dinge vorstellen: mein - wenn Sie so wollen - persönliches „Szenario 6“. Dieses Szenario beruht auf jahrzehntelangen persönlichen Erfahrungen. Mein ganzes Leben lang habe ich das europäische Projekt gelebt, dafür gekämpft und dafür gearbeitet. Ich habe gute Zeiten gesehen, aber auch schlechte Zeiten erlebt. Ich habe an vielen Seiten des Verhandlungstisches gesessen - als Minister, als Premierminister, als Präsident der Euro-Gruppe und nun als Kommissionspäsident. Ich war in Maastricht, Amsterdam, Nizza und Lissabon dabei, als sich unsere Union weiterentwickelt und erweitert hat. Ich habe stets für Europa gekämpft, habe manchmal auch an Europa gelitten und bin an Europa verzweifelt. Ich bin mit der Europäischen Union durch dick und dünn gegangen - und nie habe ich meine Liebe zu Europa verloren. Es gibt - wie wir wissen - keine Liebe ohne Enttäuschungen, jedenfalls sehr selten. Ja, Liebe zu Europa, weil Europa und die Europäische Union in dieser zerklüfteten Welt Einmaliges erreicht hat: Frieden nach innen und Frieden nach außen. Wohlstand, wenn auch nicht für alle, so doch für viele. Daran sollten wir 2018 aus Anlass des Europäischen Jahres des Kulturerbes denken. 2018 muss ein Fest der kulturellen Vielfalt werden. (Beifall) Die Wertegebundenheit Europas gibt uns ein sicheres Zuhause. Für mich ist Europa mehr als Binnenmarkt, Geld, Währung, Euro. Es geht immer vorrangig um Werte. Mein Szenario 6 geht deshalb von drei Grundprinzipien aus - drei unverrückbaren Grundprinzipien: Freiheit, Gleichberechtigung, Rechtsstaatlichkeit. Europa ist zunächst eine Union der Freiheit. Damit meine ich die Freiheit von Unterdrückung und Diktatur - Phänomene, die unser Kontinent, vor Allem die Länder Mittel- und Osteuropas, leider nur allzu gut kennt. Ich meine die Freiheit, die eigene Meinung zu sagen, als Bürger und als Journalist…. (Beifall) - eine Freiheit, die wir allzu oft als Selbstverständlichkeit empfinden. Auf diesen Freiheitswerten wurde unsere Union aufgebaut. Doch Freiheit fällt nicht vom Himmel. Wir müssen für sie kämpfen. In Europa und in der Welt. (Beifall) Europa muss eine Union der Gleichberechtigung und der Gleichberechtigten sein. Das bedeutet Gleichberechtigung ihrer Mitglieder - ob groß oder klein, ob im Osten oder im Westen, ob im Norden oder im Süden. Europa reicht von Vigo bis Varna, von Spanien bis nach Bulgarien. (Beifall) Europa muss mit beiden Lungenflügeln atmen, mit dem östlichen und dem westlichen. Ansonsten gerät unser Kontinent in Atemnot. In einer Union der Gleichen kann es keine Bürger zweiter Klasse geben. Es ist nicht hinnehmbar, dass auch 2017 noch Kinder an Krankheiten sterben, die in Europa schon längst ausgerottet sein müssten. (Beifall) Kinder in Rumänien oder Italien sollten gleichermaßen Zugang zu Masernimpfstoffen haben wie Kinder in anderen Ländern Europas. Ohne Wenn und Aber. (Beifall) Deshalb arbeiten wir mit allen Mitgliedstaaten zusammen, um ihre nationalen Impfmaßnahmen zu unterstützen. Vermeidbare Todesfälle darf es in Europa nicht geben. (Beifall) In einer Union der Gleichen kann es keine Arbeitnehmer zweiter Klasse geben. Menschen, die die gleiche Arbeit am gleichen Ort verrichten, sollen das gleiche Gehalt bekommen. (Beifall) Diesem Ziel dienen die Kommissionsvorschläge zur Entsendung von Arbeitskräften. Wir sollten sicherstellen, dass alle EU-Vorschriften zur Mobilität von Arbeitskräften auf gerechte, einfache und wirksame Art und Weise durchgesetzt werden - und zwar mit Hilfe einer neuen europäischen Aufsichts- und Umsetzungsbehörde. Es ist absurd, dass eine Bankenaufsichtsbehörde darüber wacht, ob Bankenstandards eingehalten werden, dass es aber keine gemeinsame Arbeitsmarktbehörde gibt, die für Fairness innerhalb des Binnenmarkts sorgt. Wir werden diese Behörde schaffen. (Beifall) In einer Union der Gleichen kann es keine Verbraucher zweiter Klasse geben. Ich kann nicht akzeptieren, dass den Menschen in manchen Teilen Europas, vornehmlich in Mittel- und Osteuropa, qualitativ schlechtere Lebensmittel verkauft werden als in anderen, obwohl Verpackung und Markenkennzeichnung identisch sind. (Beifall) Slowaken haben nicht weniger Fisch in Fischstäbchen verdient, Ungarn nicht weniger Fleisch in Fleischgerichten oder Tschechen weniger Kakao in der Schokolade. Das EU-Recht verbietet solche Praktiken schon jetzt. Nun müssen wir die nationalen Behörden mit umfassenden Befugnissen ausstatten, sodass diese flächendeckend gegen diese illegalen Praktiken vorgehen können. (Beifall) Drittens: In Europa gilt die Macht des Rechts, und die Macht des Rechts ist an die Stelle des Rechts des Stärkeren getreten. Das bedeutet, dass Recht und Gesetz durch eine unabhängige Justiz gewahrt werden. Teil einer Union zu sein, die auf Rechtsstaatlichkeit beruht, heißt auch, rechtskräftige Urteile zu akzeptieren und zu respektieren. (Beifall) Unsere Mitgliedstaaten haben dem Europäischen Gerichtshof die Befugnis übertragen, in letzter Instanz zu entscheiden. Die Urteile des Europäischen Gerichtshofs sind in allen Fällen zu respektieren. Sie nicht zu respektieren oder die Unabhängigkeit nationaler Gerichte zu untergraben, heißt, Bürgerinnen und Bürger ihrer Grundrechte zu berauben. Rechtsstaatlichkeit ist in der Europäischen Union keine Option. Sie ist Pflicht. Unsere Union ist kein Staat, aber sie muss ein Rechtsstaat sein. (Beifall) Diese drei Grundsätze - Freiheit, Gleichberechtigung und Rechtsstaatlichkeit - müssen das Fundament bleiben, auf dem wir eine stärkere und demokratischere Union aufbauen. Wenn wir über diese Zukunft reden, dann sagt mir meine Erfahrung, dass neue Verträge und neue Institutionen für die Menschen nicht die Antwort sind, nach der sie suchen. Sie sind lediglich Mittel zum Zweck, nicht mehr und nicht weniger. Für uns hier in Straßburg oder in Brüssel haben sie Bedeutung. Andernorts bedeuten sie nicht viel. Ich bin an institutional Reformen nur interessiert, wenn sie zu mehr Effizienz der Europäischen Union führen. Statt Zuflucht in künftigen Vertragsänderungen - die irgendwann kommen müssen - zu suchen, müssen wir uns zunächst von der Vorstellung verabschieden, dass einige verlieren müssen, damit andere gewinnen können. In der Demokratie geht es um Kompromiss. Und die richtigen Kompromisse machen auf Dauer alle zu Gewinnern. In der Europäischen Union sind Kompromisse weder negativ noch obszön, Sondern die Kunst, Gegensätze zu überbrücken und zueinander zu finden. Wer nicht kompromissfähig ist, ist weder demokratiefähig noch europatauglich. (Beifall) Um ihre Einheit zu stärken, muss die Europäische Union auch inklusiver werden. Wenn wir den Schutz unserer Außengrenzen zu Recht verstärken und noch mehr verstärken wollen, dann müssen wir Rumänien und Bulgarien unverzüglich den Schengen-Raum öffnen. (Starker Beifall) Im Übrigen sollten wir auch Kroatien die volle Schengen-Mitgliedschaft ermöglichen, sobald alle Kriterien erfüllt sind. Wenn wir wollen, dass der Euro unseren Kontinent mehr eint als spaltet, dann sollte er mehr sein als die Währung einiger ausgewählter Länder. Der Euro ist dazu bestimmt, die einheitliche Währung der Europäischen Union als Ganzes zu sein. Alle außer zwei Mitgliedstaaten sind verpflichtet und berechtigt, dem Euroraum beizutreten, sobald sie die Bedingungen erfüllen. Doch die Mitgliedstaaten, die dem Euroraum beitreten möchten, müssen dies auch tun können. Deshalb schlage ich die Schaffung eines Euro-Vorbeitrittsinstrumentes vor, das ihnen technische, manchmal auch finanzielle Heranführungshilfen bietet. (Beifall) Wenn wir wollen, dass Banken überall auf unserem Kontinent nach denselben Regeln und unter derselben Aufsicht arbeiten, dann sollten wir alle Mitgliedstaaten ermutigen, der Bankenunion beizutreten. Dazu müssen wir die verbleibenden Risiken in den Bankensystemen mancher Mitgliedstaaten verringern. Die Bankenunion funktioniert nur, wenn die Begrenzung und das Teilen von Risiken Hand in Hand gehen. Um dies tun zu können - das weiß jeder -, müssen Vorbedingungen erfüllt werden, so wie es die Kommission im November 2015 vorgeschlagen hat. Eine gemeinsame Einlagensicherung kann es erst dann geben, wenn jeder seine nationalen Hausaufgaben gemacht haben wird. Wenn wir der sozialen Fragmentierung und dem Sozialdumping in Europa ein Ende setzen wollen, sollten die Mitgliedstaaten sich so schnell wie möglich, spätestens beim Göteborg-Gipfel im November, auf die europäische Säule sozialer Rechte einigen. Nationale Sozialsysteme werden noch lange unterschiedlich und eigenständig bleiben. Doch wir sollten uns zumindest auf eine Europäische Union der Sozialstandards verständigen, in denen es einen Konsens darüber gibt, was in unserem Binnenmarkt sozial fair und was in unserem Binnenmarkt sozial unfair ist. (Beifall) Ich bleibe davon überzeugt: Damit Europa gelingt, darf es den Arbeitnehmern nicht die kalte Schulter zeigen. Wenn wir mehr Stabilität in unserer Nachbarschaft wollen, müssen wir auch eine glaubhafte Erweiterungsperspektive für den westlichen Balkan aufrechterhalten. (Beifall) Während dieses Kommissions- und Parlamentsmandats wird es keine neuen Mitglieder geben, weil die Beitrittsbedingungen nicht erfüllt werden können. Doch die Europäische Union wird in den darauffolgenden Jahren mehr als 27 Mitglieder zählen. Bei allen Beitrittsländern haben Rechtsstaatlichkeit, Justiz und Grundwerte oberste Verhandlungspriorität. Das schließt eine EU- Mitgliedschaft der Türkei in absehbarer Zeit aus. (Beifall) Die Türkei entfernt sich seit geraumer Zeit mit Riesenschritten von der Europäischen Union. Journalisten gehören in Redaktionsstuben, in denen freie Meinungsäußerung gilt. Sie gehören nicht ins Gefängnis. (Beifall) Ich appelliere heute an die Verantwortlichen in der Türkei: Lassen Sie unsere Journalisten frei, und nicht nur unsere! Hören Sie auf, unsere Mitgliedstaaten, Staats-und Regierungschefs als Faschisten und Nazis zu beschimpfen! (Beifall) Europa ist ein Kontinent reifer Demokratien. Wer aber bewusst beleidigt, verbaut sich Wege zu ihnen. Manchmal habe ich den Eindruck, einige in der Türkei möchten sich bewusst Wege verbauen, um dann später die Europäische Union für das eventuelle Scheitern der Beitrittsgespräche haftbar machen zu können. Von unserer Seite wird immer eine Hand ausgestreckt bleiben für das große türkische Volk und all diejenigen, die bereit sind, auf der Grundlage unserer Werte mit ihr zusammenzuarbeiten. (Beifall) Meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren! Ich hätte gerne, dass unsere Union stärker wird, und deshalb müssen wir auch den Binnenmarkt stärken. Ich möchte, dass wir in wichtigen Binnenmarktfragen öfter und einfacher im Rat mit qualifizierter Mehrheit entscheiden unter gleichberechtigter Mitwirkung des Europäischen Parlaments. Dazu brauchen wir keine Vertragsänderungen. Die derzeitigen Verträge enthalten sogenannte „Brückenklauseln“, die es ermöglichen, in bestimmten Fällen - vorausgesetzt, der Europäische Rat entscheidet dies einstimmig - mit qualifizierter Mehrheit, statt einstimmig zu entsiden. Ich bin dafür, bei Beschlüssen über die gemeinsame konsolidierte Körperschaftsteuer-Bemessungsgrundlage, über die Mehrwertsteuer, über eine faire Besteuerung der Digitalwirtschaft und über die Finanztransaktionssteuer diezhrithitizfssier qualifying. (Beifall) Europa muss nämlich schneller und effizienter entscheiden können. Dies gilt auch in dem Bereich, der darauf abstellt, die Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion handlungsfähiger zu machen. Der Euro-Raum ist heute widerstandsfähiger als noch vor Jahren. So haben wir unter anderem den Europäischen Stabilitätsmechanismus (ESM) geschaffen. Ich denke, der ESM sollte nun schrittweise zu einem Europäischen Währungsfonds ausgebaut werden, der Allerdings fest im Regel- und Kompetenzwerk der Europäischen Union verankert sein muss. Die Kommission wird hierzu im Dezember konkrete Vorschläge vorlegen. Wir brauchen einen Europäischen Wirtschafts- und Finanzminister, einen europäischen Minister, der positive Strukturreformen in unseren Mitgliedstaaten fördert und unterstützt. Er wird dabei auf der Arbeit aufbauen können, die die Kommission seit 2015 mit unserer Sondereinheit zur Unterstützung von Strukturreformen leistet. Der Europäische Wirtschafts- und Finanzminister soll alle Finanzierungsinstrumente der EU koordinieren, die in Bewegung gebracht werden müssen, wenn ein Mitgliedstaat von einer Rezession oder einer Fundamentalkrise betroffen wird. Ich plädiere nicht für die Schaffung eines neuen Amtes. Ich plädiere aus Effizienzgründen dafür, dass der für Wirtschaft und Finanzen zuständige EU-Kommissar - idealerweise ein Vizepräsident der Europäischen Kommission - mit dieser Aufgabe betraut und Vorsitzender der Eurogruppe wird. (Beifall) Der Europäische Wirtschafts- und Finanzminister muss selbstverständlich dem Europäischen Parlament gegenüber Rechenschaft ablegen. Wir brauchen keine Parallelstrukturen. Wir benötigen deshalb keinen separaten Euro-Haushalt, probem eine starke Eurozonen-Budgetlinie im Rahmen unseres EU-Haushalts. (Beifall) Ich kann auch der Idee eines gesonderten Europa-Parlaments und eines gesonderten Euro-Parlaments wenig Reiz abgewinnen. Das Parlament des Euroraums ist dieses Europäische Parlament. (Starker Beifall) Die Europäische Union muss auch stärker bei der gemeinsamen Terrorbekämpfung werden. In den letzten drei Jahren sind wir zwar auch diesbezüglich ein großes Stück weitergekommen. Doch im Falle grenzübergreifender terroristischer Bedrohungen reagieren wir nicht schnell genug. Ich plädiere deshalb für die Schaffung einer europäischen Aufklärungseinheit, die sicherstellt, dass Daten über Terroristen und Auslandskämpfer automatisch zwischen unseren Nachrichten- und Polizeidiensten ausgetauscht werden. (Beifall) Aus meiner Sicht spricht auch vieles dafür, die neu geschaffene Europäische Staatsanwaltschaft mit der Verfolgung von grenzübergreifenden terroristischen Straftaten zu betrauen. Die Europäische Union muss sich auch um mehr Gewicht auf der Weltbühne bemühen. Um mehr Gewicht zu erlangen, muss sie außenpolitische Beschlüsse schneller fassen können. Deshalb bitte ich die Mitgliedstaaten zu prüfen, welche außenpolitischen Beschlüsse nicht mehr einstimmig, Sondern mit qualifizierter Mehrheit gefasst werden können. Der Vertrag ließe dies zu, wenn denn der Europäische Rat dies einstimmig beschließt. Wir brauchen auch in der Außenpolitik Mehrheitsentscheidungen, um effizient arbeiten zu können. (Beifall) Im Verteidigungsbereich sind weitere Anstrengungen vonnöten. Die Schaffung eines europäischen Verteidigungsfonds steht auf der Tagesordnung; die Permanente Strukturierte Zusammenarbeit im Verteidigungsbereich ist auf gutem Weg. Bis 2025 brauchen wir eine funktionierende Europäische Verteidigungsunion. Wir brauchen sie. Und die NATO hätte sie gerne. Nicht zuletzt möchte ich - in Weiterführung der Kommissionsbemühungen der letzten Jahre -, dass sich unsere Union stärker auf die wirklich wichtigen Dinge konzentriert. Wir sollten die Bürger Europas nicht mit Regelungs-Klein-Klein nerven, Sondern in großen Dingen Größe zeigen, nicht pausenlos neue Initiativen vom Zaun brechen und Befugnisse, dort wo es sinnvoll ist, an die Nationalstaaten zurückgeben. (Beifall) Deshalb hat diese Kommission versucht, in großen Dingen Größe zu zeigen und sich - und das hat sie getan - in kleinen Dingen zurückzuhalten. Sie hat weniger als 25 neue Initiativen pro Jahr vorgelegt, während es bei den Vorgänger-Kommissionen noch weit über 100 waren. Um die begonnene Arbeit sinnvoll zu Ende zu führen, setzen wir noch in diesem Monat eine Task Force Subsidiarität und Verhältnismäßigkeit ein. Der erste Vizepräsident, mein Freund Frans Timmermans, der sich jetzt schon erfolgreich um bessere Rechtssetzung verdient gemacht hat, wird diese Task Force leiten. Dieser Timmermans-Task-Force werden auch Mitglieder dieses Parlaments und der nationalen Parlamente angehören. In einem Jahr ist Bericht zu erstatten. Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen, our Union needs a democratic leap. I would like the European political parties to launch their campaign for the next European elections earlier than in the past. Too often, European election campaigns have been reduced to a mere addition of national election proposals. European democracy deserves better. Today the Commission proposes to adopt new rules on the funding of political parties and foundations. It is not about replenishing the coffers of extremists who are against Europe, it is about allowing European parties to better articulate themselves. (Applause) I am aware that the idea is contested by more than a few, but I must tell you that I have sympathy for the idea of ​​presenting transnational lists in the European elections. (Applause) And I will try to convince the chairman of my parliamentary group to follow me in this ambition, which adds democracy and clarity to Europe. (Applause) I also believe that in the coming months we should involve national parliaments and civil society at national, regional and local level in the work on the future of Europe. Over the past three years, members of the Commission, as we had promised, have visited the national parliaments more than 650 times, they have participated in more than 300 citizens' dialogues in more than 80 cities in 27 Member States. This is why I support President Macron's idea of ​​holding democratic conventions across Europe in 2018. As the debate develops, I will pay particular attention to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. 2018 is the year these four countries will celebrate their 100th anniversary. Those who have the ambition to shape the future of our continent must know and honor our common history and therefore the history of the four countries mentioned, countries without which the European Union would not be complete. (Applause) The need to strengthen democracy and transparency obviously has consequences for the European Commission. Today I am sending the European Parliament a new code of conduct for Commissioners. First of all, this new code specifies that commissioners can stand under normal conditions as candidates in European elections. It is evident that the new code will strengthen the integrity obligations of commissioners during and after their mandate. Anyone who wants to strengthen European democracy cannot accept that the small democratic progress that the innovation of the top \"Spitzenkandidaten\" leaders constituted is not renewed. I would like the experiment to continue. (Applause) And I will not be a candidate. More democracy means more efficiency. European efficiency would gain in strength if we could merge the presidencies of the European Council and the European Commission. (Applause) This proposal is in no way aimed at my excellent friend Donald, with whom I have worked harmoniously and in complete complicity since the start of our mandate. This proposal does not target Donald or myself. The European landscape would simply be more legible, more understandable if the European ship was piloted by a single captain. Having a single president would better reflect the true nature of our European Union, both as a union of states and as a union of citizens. (Applause) Ladies and gentlemen, the vision of a more united, stronger, more democratic Europe that I present today combines elements of all the scenarios that I outlined to you last March. But our future cannot remain a simple scenario, a sketch, an idea among many, it is today that we must prepare the Union of tomorrow. This morning I sent President Tajani, President Tusk, and future rotating Council presidencies by March 2019, a roadmap indicating the direction we should take. Important in this respect are the budgetary proposals that the Commission will present in May 2018. Here again, we have a choice: either we confine the ambitions of the European Union to the strict framework of the current budget, or we increase the budgetary capacity of the European Union. European Union so that it can better meet its ambitions. I am for the second solution. (Applause) On March 29, 2019, the UK will leave the European Union. It will be both a sad and a tragic moment. We will always regret it and you will regret it soon. (Applause) But we have to respect the will of the British people, but we will move forward. We are going to move forward because Brexit is not everything, because Brexit is not the future of Europe. On March 30, 2019, we will be a Union of 27. I suggest that we prepare well for it. The elections to the European Parliament will take place just a few weeks later, in May 2019. It will be an important meeting with European democracy. European citizens will have to go to the polls with a clear vision of how the European Union will develop in the years to come. It is why I invite President Tusk and Romania, who will exercise the Presidency in the first half of 2019, to organize a special summit in Romania on March 30, 2019. My wish would be that this summit be held in the beautiful city of Sibiu, also known as Hermannstadt. This should be the time to come together to take the decisions necessary to build a more united, stronger and more democratic Europe. My hope is that, on March 30, 2019, Europeans will wake up to a Union where we will defend all our values, where all Member States will unreservedly respect the rule of law, where to be a full member of the euro area, to banking union, the Schengen area will have become the norm for everyone, where we will have consolidated the foundations of our Economic and Monetary Union in order to be able to defend our single currency in all circumstances, good or bad, without having to resort to external aid and where our single market will be fairer for workers in both East and West. I would like Europeans to be able to wake up in a Europe where we have managed to agree on a solid base of social standards, where profits will be taxed where they are made, where terrorists will find no loophole to exploit and where we will agree on the creation of a genuine European Defense Union, where a single President will lead the work of the Commission and the European Council to completion, after being elected after a campaign pan-European democratic election. Mr. President, if our citizens wake up in this Union on March 30, 2019, the European Union will be a Union that has met their justified expectations. Ladies and Gentlemen, Members of Parliament, Helmut Kohl and Jacques Delors, whom I have had the honor of working with, have taught me that Europe only moves forward when it is bold. The single market, the Schengen area, the single currency: these are ideas and projects that were considered from their birth as mere imaginations. Yet these three major achievements are part of our daily lives today. Now that Europe is better, I am told that we must not overload the European boat, but we must not, at this time, err on the side of caution. We are mending the roof of Europe, but today and tomorrow we must patiently, floor by floor, moment by moment, inspiration after inspiration, keep adding new floors to the Europe house. The Europe house must be completed now that the weather is nice and while the weather is nice, because when the clouds form on the horizon - and they will form one day - it will be too late. So let's cast off, \"Leinen los\" as the Germans say, set sail and take advantage of the favorable winds. Thank you for your attention.

Europe needs courage and Europe needs optimism and creativity. We heard that today in Jean-Claude Juncker's speech. I thank you for this new beginning and I also thank the entire EU Commission for the hard work it is doing for our continent. Trust comes from action, so we have to talk about our successes - as Jean-Claude Juncker did. The Paris Climate Agreement, CETA, effective border protection, more money for Africa, growth in Europe, reducing unemployment: the people, many people in Europe, are doing better today than in previous years. We deliver, and when I say “we deliver”, I would like to say explicitly that the European Parliament - the people's chamber of Europe - delivers. There is only a Juncker Commission at all because of the European Parliament's assertiveness. The first political commission is a child of this House, is a child of parliamentarians, is a child of European democracy, and that is why we can be proud of what we have achieved together: Parliament and the Commission are going in the same direction. What is it now? On behalf of the EPP Group, I welcome our Commission President's ideas on deepening our European Union. The world is not waiting for us - we must go ahead now. But I don't want to talk about treaties and institutions today, I want to argue for the EPP Group from the people's point of view. And that's where people see the rough wind of globalization. They are afraid of social dumping, of unemployment. We Europeans oppose this with our idea of ​​the social market economy: justice, secure jobs and fair wages. The idea that ownership obliges. The idea that strong unions can stand up to large corporations. We say yes to trade, to world trade, but we also say yes to the protection of our core industry and protection of social standards in the European Union. The European way of live is social, and the weak are the focus for us as an EPP. Many people are afraid - to open up a second perspective - in view of the pictures of the many people who arrive as illegal immigrants and arrive at our external border. They no longer believe politicians who say this is good for us. They fear for their culture and for their identity, and that is why we have to do everything to secure and control our borders. Not to build a wall around Europe, but to ensure that illegal migration - the breach of law - is stopped. The European Way of Live helps people in need, but at the same time it secures the borders with all severity against illegal migration and the gangs of smugglers. Both are necessary, and we have to make it clear that integration means that our guiding culture, our values ​​and our laws are respected and practiced. Citizenships in Europe should be linked to these basic values, everyone else must leave Europe again. A third concern expressed by the people is the view of Turkey. Many people are shocked when they look there: People are being arrested and imprisoned in an apparently arbitrary manner, the constitution has been changed, the rule of law is being dismantled. Turkey is moving away from Europe. People don't understand why Europe isn't acting now. We as the European Parliament have made it clear that we have to suspend the accession talks in order to send out a signal that there can be no “business as usual” in the current situation, and I wonder why the European Council and, dear Jean- Claude Juncker, the EU Commission reacted so hesitantly. We in Parliament believe that a clear signal is needed. Our European way of live demands honesty in our relations with our neighbors. Many people are afraid of terrorism - Barcelona and Turku this summer - and many say that Islam is a danger. During the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris two years ago, a French policeman was executed by the terrorists. His name was Ahmed Merabet. He was a Muslim who gave his life to defend the freedom of journalists. It is not a conflict between Christians and Muslims. It is a conflict between humanity and barbarism, between values ​​and terrorism, between our European way of life and the madness of the terrorists. (Applause) We must exchange our information now - immediately - and data protection must not be turned into protection of terrorists. The European way of life protects the freedom of religion. It does not know national egoism when fighting together against the terrible acts of terrorists. Many people - as a last perspective from the people’s point of view - are afraid when they look eastwards. In some days, a maneuver of the Russian and Belarussian armies will start at the borders to our Baltic states, about 100,000 soldiers directly on our border. Many people are afraid. After the wars in Georgia, Ukraine and Syria, what is Putin planning now? The European way is to defend ourselves and that is why the ideas of the European Defense Union are going in a good direction. We need them now. (Applause) This is also why we should stop Nord Stream 2. Our security has priority over making money. (Applause) Finally, there are a few other perspectives from the people’s point of view - what they are asking us to do - and we have to give proper answers. Let's act now. But with regard to all these points, I think there is a need to combine them and to bring them together. That is, from an EPP point of view, to defend - and to defend in the future - the European way of life. In the past our founding fathers of the European Union achieved peace. They were successful because they believed in themselves. Today we must defend the identity of Europe. Today we must defend the European way of life in a world that is changing rapidly and we will also be successful.Let's start now.(Applause)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Gianni Pittella", "mepid": "4436", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President Juncker, it is true: a wind of new hope is blowing and citizens are growing the idea that without Europe we are more alone and more defenseless. You did not use triumphal tones and did well, because serious problems remain and we have a shot in the barrel of our gun and we cannot miss the mark. You have made interesting proposals, many of which come from the Socialist Group, and we are grateful to you for that. But we need to transform the proposals into results and we need to be bold, as you said, hitting all the multinationals that have defrauded the tax authorities, forcing them to return what they have hidden with the cheat. We must launch a great initiative against the precariousness and exploitation of young people: some of the young people, even with a master's degree, receive 500 euros a month! This is a scandal we must oppose! We must be inflexible, as the European Commission, Vice-President Timmermans, is doing on the issues of freedom, equality, the rule of law and democracy. You have said that these are the pillars of your policy. I would say: these are the pillars, the DNA of the European Union. We need to strengthen our decision-making process: the unanimity rule is a virus for democracy in the Council; we must have a European Treasury Ministry, but one that is not an obscure guardian of the treaties, of public accounts, but a democratic institution, with fiscal capacity. I say this clearly, President Juncker: we do not want a minister who acts as a gendarme! We want a ministry for growth and work. We need to get out of the \"triple A\" rhetoric on social issues - welcome, Hon. Weber, in social Europe; we like it; tell your popular colleagues to push, as we have been pushing for years, on these issues and on these dossiers in the competent committees; we must have a child guarantee for European girls and boys! Not a child should be left without food, without education, without home; this also applies to unaccompanied minor migrants. We need more courage on investments, sustainability, climate, industrial policy, on which Parliament has done a great job. We show Trump that disasters can be prevented if Europe takes the lead in these battles. And then, as regards immigration: thank you for the recognition of Italy - I say this as a European, not as an Italian - but more needs to be done, we need to have a revision of the Dublin Treaty. But beware: the Socialist Group will not vote on any revision without eliminating the aberrant rule of the country of first landing; be clear. We must have legal channels for migrants, President Juncker. The blue card is an old, outdated and reductive tool. We must have the courage to open legal channels: we cannot just close the clandestine routes. That's right, but if you close routes and don't open other legal channels, you haven't solved the problem. And then we need a partnership with Africa, which I would call the partnership of dignity. You said: more money, where do we get it? And who do we give them to? It is very important: who do we give them to? I would say: let's give them to young entrepreneurs, who create jobs and wealth and create development in Africa. Finally, an adequate budget, an effective and strong cohesion policy, a budget with its own resources. We also think about the web tax, let's think about it, in addition to the taxes on financial transactions. And then, President Juncker, yes to transparency on trade treaties, but we must defend the interests of citizens first and foremost. We want to go further than CETA. Let me be clear: the socialists want to go further than CETA on the issue of the interests of citizens and consumers. We have a blank page that we can write together. You referred to innovation, great progress, to artificial intelligence.Often we here discuss the sex of angels and we do not realize that the world goes on, that soon we will have an artificial intelligence that will decide on our own whether to wage wars or not to wars, whether to go nuclear or not.We need to keep up with these great transformations.We have an example, an important reference: the 2030 agenda for sustainable development.Let us take that example and work with that love which is in His heart but which is also in our socialist heart.Let's work together, with tenacity and loyalty!", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Syed Kamall", "mepid": "33569", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, I would like to say to Mr Juncker that when it comes to jobs, security and freedom, a Europe that protects cannot be a Europe that is protectionist. The ECR Group believes that the EU needs to create more opportunities, not more regulations and more agencies. Many of our citizens tell us that they feel as if they have little say in the decisions we make about their lives, their countries and their futures. When it comes to their concerns over migration, security and jobs, they prefer an EU that complements their national and local governments, not seek to overrule them. Speaking as both a future neighbour who wishes to see a prosperous EU trading and cooperating with a prosperous UK, and speaking today as one of the leaders of the ECR Group with MEPs from across the EU, being critical of the policies of the EU should not be seen as an attack on the EU, but a genuine desire to see an EU which regains the trust and confidence of its citizens. As a liberal Conservative and a passionate believer in free trade, I welcome the emphasis on open trade in your speech. But modern open trade needs countries to shed the cloak of protectionism. Modern open trade needs to be open to the latest investment in technology to allow frictionless borders. Modern open trade needs faster broadband networks to allow SMEs to trade securely online with the rest of the world. And for our businesses and economies to thrive, let us prioritise the REFIT agenda. Let us improve access to finance for businesses, small and large, via peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding. Let us train our workers with the skills demanded by modern digital economies. But also, let us unleash the spirit of free enterprise in our young people to create their own businesses, and let them be allowed to try and try again if at first they do not succeed. Because, just as Soviet five-year plans did not create creative economies, EU growth plans do not create jobs: it is businesses that create jobs. We must also remember that our economic prosperity depends upon global stability, and we cannot show disunity in our dealings with Russia or other unpleasant regimes. We must maintain sanctions and show in words and in action at the Eastern Partnership Summit that, for countries like Ukraine, NATO, the EU and the West can offer them a better, stronger and more stable future than turning to face the east. Mr Juncker, no one expects there to be a quick fix to all the challenges, or for you to have all the answers by the next time we meet. But the people outside of this building want to know that the people inside this building will continue to steady the ship and not set sail into yet more storms. So no matter what side of the argument, or what side of the Channel, all our countries need to prepare to face the global challenges from a position of optimism, from a position of strength, and from a position of honesty with our voters.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Guy Verhofstadt", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, first of all I would like to say to Jean-Claude: what a difference to last year. I liked his speech on the State of the Union. I think it was full of vision, ambition, for 2019, and quite a difference to last year, but let’s be honest between us, a lot has in fact changed in the meanwhile in the Union since last year. In August 2016, for example, it was Mr Hofer who said that he wanted to take Austria out of the euro and the Union, and five months later, after his defeat, he said exactly the opposite. He changed his mind and he said no, no, we want to stay in the euro and in the Union.  And then in March of this year, in the Netherlands, it was Mr Wilders who promised a spring of populism and in what he created, he reaped the opposite. It was the pro-European parties which won the election. And in France, exactly the same, it was Emmanuel Macron who won the campaign with a pro-European programme, and since then even the Front National does not want to exit the euro and the Union anymore. Even in Hungary Viktor Orbán is piping down. He accepts now the authority of the European Court of Justice and he said, two days ago I think, on a radio interview that there is no way that Hungary would ever leave the Union.  So on the occasion of this State of the Union address, I want to say to Mr Hofer, to Ms Le Pen, to Viktor Orbán, welcome to the side of reason, even when we all know that it is not that they have changed their mind, it is not through conviction that they have changed their mind, but it is through fear of losing votes that they have changed their minds now.  The only one for the moment who still does not get it is, I think, Mr Farage. He is still going on. Last weekend he called on the German AfD to campaign on Brexit. I think it is fantastic advice to campaign on Brexit. You have to keep up the good work, Nigel. I hope they take your advice, but unfortunately I do not think they are as stupid as to do that in Germany in the AfD. Because let’s be honest, it is clear what our citizens want: they do not want to destroy Europe, they want to reform Europe – but to destroy it, no bloody way. That is the message from our citizens. And that is what I liked so much in the State of the Union address this year by Jean-Claude Juncker. Let’s not make the mistake of thinking, okay, the war is over, we have won a few elections in a number of countries and now the wind is blowing in the right direction. No, what the people want is not to continue with this Europe. They want a reformed European Union; 73% of our citizens want more European action on the side of migration; 75% want more European action against climate change. The same number want a European army and, at the same time, even more Europeans want European capacities and capabilities in the fight against terrorism.  So it is true, Jean-Claude, that the last three years were not easy, it was mainly crisis management, but I completely agree with you that now is the moment – now or never I should say, as in the song – to build up the European Union that the people are asking for and that we together have already been dreaming of for a number of years.  And what does this mean? It means that we create a European asylum system so that we can finally get rid of this broken Dublin system, because that is the real origin of the problem. Dublin is not European. It is national egoism: that is Dublin. Not Dublin as a city naturally, sorry, please do not misunderstand me because otherwise I will have my Irish friends against me if I continue like that! A European border and coastguard and a system of legal – indeed, Gianni – migration so that people no longer die on our shores, because every dead body that we find in the Mediterranean is a scandal for us, for Europe; even one person dead in the Mediterranean.  A European defence union so that it is not the Americans and the Russians who decide, Ms Mogherini, in our backyard; which is still the case today. A European FBI – why? Because terrorists do not recognise borders. That is the reality, so why do we continue to do so? And then a real government for the euro area so that we can steer the European economy and we can create what, in fact, we are missing – European champions. Our competition rules are far too narrow. The fact that we have no unified markets with single regulators is why we have no European champions that can become world champions and compete at world level.  But there is one thing on which I have a little difference in point of view with you, and it is the institutional problem. I always think that good institutions produce good policies and that bad institutions create a standstill, stagnation and crisis. And there are a number of examples of that. That is the reason why we in this Parliament, and I thank you for your support because it is really very helpful, want also to create transnational lists and a real European constituency. And why do we want to do that? Because it is time to lift democracy to a continental scale – Europe is more than the sum of 27 national democracies; we are more than that, we are in fact a democracy on a European scale – and also to defend our values and our principles outside the Union, but also inside the Union.  This European democracy is necessary, for example, to withstand alt-right governments such as we see today – also inside, in Poland and in Hungary – who think that Trump with his white supremacy is the example, or that Putin and Orbán, who jail opponents, are the example. That will never be the example in whatever Member State in the European Union. And for that reason we have to create this European democracy with a transnational responsibility because, as Emmanuel Macron said, standing near the Acropolis, we need to be the counterweight to all these developments and yes, to autocratic leaders worldwide – a beacon of openness, a beacon of freedom and a beacon of hope in the 21st century.

Indeed, no statistics tell the exact perception of this Union by workers thrown into the street because we do not fight offshoring, the feeling of the small peasant who is dying of low prices and the end of milk quotas, of the unemployed. who has nothing to do with the unemployment rate that is constantly brandished under his nose in order to better suggest that he become a precarious and poor worker, and even less with the growth rate which is in fact a growth in profits and pollution. We can deposit all the billions we want on this desk, how can that be perceived when there are so many people who do not have enough to end the month to the nearest 10 euros? It is from there that the crisis of the European idea is born, which traverses the continent like a wisp. Because we do not listen to the populations, because the European Union does not carry an ideal of social and ecological humanism. The terrible cyclone that has just ravaged the West Indies, Cuba and part of the United States commands us to act energetically against climate disruption caused by transport and carbon energies, free trade treaties, such as the one with Canada. that you have just praised Mr. President, but which is contrary to the options of the Paris Agreement. There is an urgent need for a European construction combining social progress and environmental progress in transport, energy, housing, the renovation of cities, agriculture and to help the transformation of production systems. This would create millions of jobs in Europe, it would require new training, new research. This could be possible, not by creating a European Monetary Fund as you have just done, but by transforming the fund that carries your name, the Juncker Fund, in a large social and environmental development fund linked to the European Central Bank, to deleverage States and launch innovative investment projects, creating work, by developing public services, by launching new projects securing the professional careers of all Europeans, starting with young people. From this point of view, comply with the request of the Greek government, which wants training and apprenticeship programs for people deprived of employment to be eligible for European regional social funds and the fund called Juncker. It is urgent to get out of this Europe of competition and division in order to launch without delay the foundations of a social Europe, including minimum wages, the elimination of job insecurity for job security, defense social protection and pensions, the eradication of poverty by distributing wealth differently, a fair directive for posted workers, equality between men and women, more power for employees in their companies. A social Europe also means tax harmonization and the fight against tax evasion and tax havens. Instead of the nauseating debates on refugees and this shameful agreement with Turkey, and now Libya, let's make a Europe of solidarity, launch a co-development pact with Africa, with the Maghreb and act for a Middle East free from the violence and wars, where people can become masters of their own destiny. It is urgent to listen and to hear the peoples. Democracy is knocking on the door, we all say it, but we must act. Let us ask citizens which Europe they want. Let us launch consultations, forums, from the municipalities and regions to the European institutions, within the framework of general states of democratic, social and ecological overhaul of European construction. The The voice of the European Union must also be heard to help resolve tensions and conflicts; it must be an actor in nuclear disarmament in particular, and for peace.For this, it must not itself take the path of militarization, as has just been proposed, but the one which defends the works of life, that of education and culture.We want the debate, a real debate, Mr President, to make the European Union a force for social and ecological progress, a force for peace in democracy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Philippe Lamberts", "mepid": "96648", "text": "on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group. - Mr President, Mr Juncker, listening to you very attentively, I have tried to put myself in the shoes of all our fellow citizens who can no longer take it; who can no longer pay the price for a financial crisis that they did not cause and from which those responsible continue to profit; who are tired of having to contribute more than their share to the financing of our public services and our social protection, while the richest among us still largely escape taxes; who can no longer eat, drink, breathe poisons, on the grounds that banning these poisons would be harmful to business; who can no longer have to accept as workers, with or without a job, ever more flexibility to ensure ever more security for the holders of capital; who can no longer see their individual freedoms cut off and their personal data captured en masse in the name of the fight against terrorism, or more prosaically so that they are flooded with advertisements; who can no longer, finally, see the future of their children, their grandchildren, compromised by the mad rush for the benefit of a few. Often these citizens attribute to Europe these scourges which they support less and less, and yet we all know that the governments of the 28 Member States bear an overwhelming responsibility in these political choices. But too often, the Commission that you chair pushes in the same direction. Of course, we can be happy that the Le Pen and the Wilders still do not make the majority around them, but we would be wrong to rejoice too quickly, because the anger and the spite of many of our fellow citizens did not disappeared however, and I would even say that national chauvinist ideas, Mr Juncker, are even progressing in your political family - look at Austria. During your inauguration, you told us being the President of the Faint Hope Commission and, sometimes, watching your action, one might get the impression that this is the last chance to anchor the neoliberal agenda. Nevertheless, I know you and I want to believe that you had something else in mind, namely to reconcile European citizens with the very idea of ​​European integration by putting this project at their service. Seizing that last chance requires a change of course and it's true that a lot of the things we've heard today are music to our ears. I am thinking in particular of your proposals on the euro zone, I am obviously thinking of this idea of ​​transnational lists that the Greens have been carrying for more than a decade. I am not, however, sure that what you are proposing here is likely to give the boost we need and so let me suggest to you perhaps what you could have said today. My dear fellow citizens, many of you legitimately wonder if your democracy is working for you. So, I am now committed to aligning all the action of my Commission around the dual objective of reducing inequalities and bringing our ecological impact within the limits that nature sets for us. Our goal will now be to ensure that everyone has the possibility of a life worth living. And how will we get there? I pledge that, here, any action, any legislation, any recommendation issued by my Commission will be scrutinized for its effect on inequalities and on our ecological footprint, and that only those which will reduce them will be pursued. A few examples to illustrate my point: my Commission will spare no effort to put an end to tax and social competition between Member States. Cooperation and upward convergence will become the watchwords of our action. We will initiate a complete reorientation of our trade policy, which will now have to make access to our market conditional on compliance with social, environmental and health standards that we have freely chosen. We will therefore propose to freeze the provisional application of CETA and to review the negotiating mandates of all other agreements under discussion. We will restore the precautionary principle as the foundation of the internal market and, so that you have no doubts about our determination, we will phase out glyphosate. We will take it off the market and we will strengthen the definition of endocrine disruptors. But I do not only offer you a Europe that protects, I also suggest that Europe be the instrument through which we build our common future and, for me, the only chance for Europeans to find their place in a globalized economy. , it is to become the pioneers of energy, industrial, agricultural and other solutions which will allow humanity to live sustainably on this planet. Therefore, rather than the defenders of the established economic order, my Commission will henceforth support all the initiatives which engage us in this great transformation. And I am convinced that a Europe reconciled with itself, a Europe in which no one will feel left behind will know better than ever how to assume its responsibilities towards those who knock on our door and cry out. help. The transition must also take place towards a more democratic society and - let's say it - our democracies are injured. When governments drunk on power bring justice, parliaments, the media and universities to heel. They are threatened when the executives allow themselves to put citizens under surveillance or place them under house arrest, without any judicial control. They are undermined when, both for security reasons and to put social benefit recipients under control, governments collect and conserve massively data, except of course those relating to holders of large fortunes. They are perverted when the making of our laws is subject to the less and less discreet influence of the money powers. No, my dear friends, democracy is not an irreversible achievement. We must anchor the European Union - and you said this, Mr Juncker - as the guarantor of freedoms, the rule of law and the general interest. My dear fellow citizens, collectively the European Union is rich in assets and, in fact, much richer than it was when the project was started 60 years ago, much richer, believe I. We are capable of meeting the challenges we face, but I am telling you bluntly: the only way to regain control over our future is together. Dear Mr Juncker, by implementing such an agenda, I think you would seize your last chance to make history, not as the former boss of a tax haven who joined the gravedigger battalion of Europe, but on the contrary as one of those who will have restarted it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 9, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Nigel Farage", "mepid": "4525", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, I would like to say to Mr Juncker that this was the most open, honest and truly worrying speech I have heard in my long years in this place. The message is very clear: Brexit has happened, full steam ahead. So new plans: there is to be one powerful President for the whole of the European Union; a Finance Minister with fresh powers to – as you say yourself – intervene as and when he sees necessary; a stronger European army in a militarised European Union with a stronger, and perhaps more aggressive, foreign policy too; and more Europe in every single direction, and all of it to be done without the consent of the people. Your plan to fight the next European elections with pan-European lists, funded by the European Union, but not, as you said, to fund extremists, means that what we will find is that genuine democratic parties of opposition will not be able to compete in elections on the same playing field. It is reminiscent of regimes of old. Indeed, the way you are treating Hungary and Poland must already remind them of living under the Soviet communists when you attempt to tell them how they should run their own countries. All I can say is thank God we’re leaving, but you have learned nothing from Brexit. If you had given Cameron concessions, particularly on immigration, the Brexit vote – I have to admit – would never ever have happened, and yet the lesson you take is that you are going to centralise and you are going to move on to this new – I think very worrying –undemocratic union. You are deluding yourself, Mr Verhofstadt, if you think that the ‘populist wave’, as you define it, is over. If these plans of Mr Juncker’s come to fruition, far from the populist wave being over, I doubt it has even begun.

First of all, addressed to all apologists for this euro-centralism: Europe is not the European Union and the European Union is not Europe. The European Union is nothing more and nothing less than an association that has rules, and these rules can be changed and you do not determine the direction in which we should make changes here! I also do not claim to be able to determine them. It is the peoples of Europe who, in free and uninfluenced choice, set this direction here. What Commission President Juncker said today goes in the completely opposite direction. Juncker wants de facto for the introduction of the euro in all countries of the European Union. We all know that the euro is anything but a success story, it is a huge failure. Debt has grown immeasurably. We have record unemployment and record bankruptcies, and it is hardly possible to get the euro fairly stable after many waves. The second thing Juncker would like: he would de facto want to dissolve all internal borders - knowing that tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of Africans and Arabs are rushing to our continent, that soldiers of fortune and terrorists are among them. You know very well that the Bataclan assassins came to Europe this way. To belittle that is a real security threat to all citizens of this continent. The third thing that is called for here: a defense union, which is in fact a military union. No, we don't want that. We Austrians in particular, who are a neutral country, cannot and do not want to participate. The right way for a good future for Europe can only be to allow more democracy, to let the peoples vote on whether Schengen should be maintained - with borders, yes or no, that a vote is held on whether or not the free movement of workers should be maintained during a period of record unemployment.If you care about this Europe, then allow more democracy again.Allow pluralism.Grant the states a little more sovereignty and Europe will work.It's not working now, and you know that well as well.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 11, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Κωνσταντίνος Παπαδάκης (NI).", "mepid": "125093", "text": "- Mr President, the sixth scenario we have heard about the future of Europe - the European Union, not Europe - is another compromise in the fierce competition within the European Union and the eurozone, given Germany's lead. at the expense of the rest.

European Union empowerment marks the European Union's great opposition to the United States, China, Russia and Britain.

Speaking on behalf of the Estonian Presidency of the Council, I thank President Juncker for his ambitious, clear and, most importantly, thoughtful speech. At this moment, with the wind in our sails, we should bear in mind a couple of lessons that the last couple of years have taught us. First, that we who care for our Union must have the courage to make the positive case for the EU. It is not only the right thing to do, but it also may pay off in elections. Secondly, we should not be afraid of speaking of the cost of non-EU: of the consequences of (so far, thank God) only hypothetical rolling back some advantages of European integration. Thirdly, we must keep looking for issues, initiatives and ways that unite us, and not those that pose a risk of dividing Member States. We should look for initiatives that balance things and build bridges. For instance, it is much easier to talk about the EU social pillar – something that the Estonian Presidency will duly take forward – when we simultaneously take real steps in deepening the single market, in particular in the field of services. So not only better paid jobs but also better access to these jobs. Fourthly, of course we must keep developing the EU further, but doing this, we must not forget that this time around, in 2017, it is not the institutional setup that is most important – it is important, of course – but reshaping the institutions must go hand in hand with providing concrete benefits for our citizens. Our citizens must be at the centre of our attention, and delivering concrete benefits for citizens is what the guiding principle of the Estonian Presidency is. For the last few years, we have all been working on building a digital single market. The free movement of data is one of its cornerstones. We need to ensure that European citizens and businesses are able to benefit from data and that we create no new barriers to the single market. As with the EU’s other freedoms, free movement does not mean freedom from rules. Next year, new EU personal data protection rules come into force, and we look forward to starting work on the Commission’s new proposal on the free flow of data. Thank you, President Juncker, for this proposal. Member States have repeatedly emphasised that legislation in this area is necessary. The Estonian Presidency will now move swiftly, attempting to consolidate Member States’ positions on the concrete proposal. As we grow Europe’s data economy and enter the era of the Internet of Things, cyber security becomes a matter for everyone. We welcome the renewal of the EU Cybersecurity Strategy proposed by the Commission. Cybersecurity is a challenge that cannot be tackled by any Member State on its own. We all need to fulfil our responsibilities by fully implementing the existing EU legislation and must deploy all parts of our toolbox, working on the new legislation and engaging with the private sector. The EU also has an important role to play, setting international norms, pursuing cybercriminals, standing up for European values such as freedom and privacy, guiding the development of the global market for secure products and services, and reacting to states that sponsor and support malicious cyber activity. The EU Heads of State and Government will address these key issues at the Tallinn Digital Summit on 29 September. I earlier listed some recent lessons for the EU. We have also learned that, while strengthening the EU internally is, of course, key for the health and functioning of the Union itself, at the same time, to be and to appear strong, the EU also needs to remain engaged and open to the outside world. We are a model to a number of countries in our neighbourhood, and we should not forget it. The EU’s transformative power is still very much there. The Eastern Partnership Summit in November is an opportunity to reconfirm our commitment to our neighbours’ positive transformation. In the field of trade, the EU must perform a tough balancing act. President Juncker laid out very eloquently the elements of it. We, of course, welcome the message that we can now proceed with the free trade agreements with Australia and New Zealand and to expand the network of liberal trade relations in this globalised world. The Commission has gone a long way with its reflection paper on harnessing globalisation and deserves to be commended for that. With regard to the proposals on investments and the Multilateral Investment Court, as the Presidency we will make our best efforts to proceed in the best possible way to build a consensus among the Member States, in a manner that will enable the EU to continue its leading role in trade policy. With regard to migration: the crisis which shook the fundamentals of the EU and showed that the EU does not the really have a headquarters to manage an acute operational crisis. The EU does not have a general, if you will. This is not to say that we have not achieved a lot in the field of migration. Work on the external dimension is going well, and, maybe for the first time, the Union is using all the tools in its foreign policy toolbox at the same time: assistance, development, trade, military operation, and even enlargement policy. The Estonian Presidency is working hard on migration issues, not least while carrying forward work on a common asylum system. On legal migration, we eagerly started working with the European Parliament on the Blue Card Directive. On security, we are ready to engage with the Parliament on ETS and, hopefully, on SIS initiatives. And of course, we are confident that an inclusive and ambitious permanent structured cooperation in the field of defence can be launched by the end of this year. Ladies and gentlemen, the speech by President Juncker and the debate we have had so far shows us once more that in our Union there is much more of what unites us than what creates tensions. Estonia, a country that was deprived of the advantages of European integration during its first 40 years, feels that particularly deeply. That is the compass while we act as a Member State; that is our compass, especially while we are performing the duties of the Presidency of the Council of the EU, with the wind in our sails.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 13, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Presidente. –", "mepid": "2187", "text": "Given the times, I inform you that the Presidency, during this discussion, will not authorize \"blue card\" questions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 14, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Daniel Caspary (PPE).", "mepid": "28219", "text": "- Mister President!

Please let us use the opportunities for our employees and citizens in the next few weeks, for example through quick, transparent negotiations with Australia and New Zealand. But please also help ensure that we can better protect our employees. We urgently need to complete the reform of our trade defense instruments, and we must also adopt the instrument against strategic foreign investment proposed today as quickly as possible in order to avert further damage to our industrial base. Second: Many people are worried about jobs - in Germany at the moment several hundred thousand in the automotive industry. We are all annoyed about the breach of trust, but on the other hand it also applies: When it comes to climate change, we also have to keep an eye on jobs. Yes, we need climate protection and cars and jobs - we don't need climate protection instead of cars and jobs, and here too I call on all of us to pay attention to this in our legislative projects over the next few weeks and months. Please allow me to make one more point on transnational lists, Mr President. Many citizens have the impression that we are too aloof here in Europe, that some here in Parliament are remote from the citizens. We urgently need more proximity to the citizen, and we are convinced that such a transnational list will not be closer to the citizen, but more remote from the citizen, and that is why we clearly reject such a list.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 15, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Maria João Rodrigues (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124737", "text": "   – Mr President, this is the moment for us, as a last shot, to have real vision and ambition. What is at stake for this legislature? It is indeed to develop the European house and to move to the next stage, a new floor. It is to make Europe not only a single market or a eurozone, but also a political entity able to respond to the new world in front of us. We need the European Union to be a big democratic power, supporting our way of life and making sure that we have the means to deliver our values and our way of life. We need new means for peace and security, to manage migration and to support development. But to have this, we need a brand new Community budget for the future, based on new own resources; we need to turn to the future and not the past. This means, when it comes to own resources, that big corporations should pay their taxes because while they should benefit from the single market, they should pay what they owe.  If we have in mind a new democratic political entity, this can only be based on stronger European citizenship, above all fully respecting the fundamental political rights of our citizens, but also making sure that we can count on updated social standards with regard to access to social protection and to skills, but also making sure that everybody in employment, whatever kind of job they have, can count on a decent labour contract and access to social protection. This should be the ambition of the upcoming European Social Pillar, but can we say that this Europe, as a land of equal opportunity, of fairness, is being delivered to all European citizens? We do not think so. Europe is still working as a machine for divergence and inequality and we need to reverse this very undermining trend. So we call on the Commission to come up with an ambitious proposal for the European budget, turning the European project into a project for equality and convergence. This should apply to the European Union as a whole and also to the eurozone. This is our request for the upcoming work of the Commission.

Dumping, hostile investments, takeovers of strategic companies, increasingly strict rules for our companies abroad, unfair competition and the total lack of reciprocity are all involved. There was no agreement yesterday during the trilogue on the question of dumping. But the risk with such a tight schedule is that a mere delay may be seen as a failure. If it comes at the cost of the precision of our political message, especially on the burden of proof, then it is not expensive. Europe must protect itself without falling into protectionism. This message is clear. The uncertainty in our policies stems from our treaty which makes us walk on eggshells on our legal obligations. The ambitious draft regulations, which I have already read, should above all prevent us from stepping on our heads. We have wasted time and, in reality, we are losing jobs, our know-how and our technological advance in the hands of a country which, as we know, organizes the investments of its public and private companies.

I must admit that I am a bit surprised that President Juncker has said little about the Brexit conclusions. Whoever, like me, believes that the British exit is a great failure and a great loss for the Union would expect the President to tell us that some of the causes of Brexit have been eliminated. Meanwhile, nothing was said about it, and it was even given the impression that Britain's exit from the EU was a success. I think this is not a success but a failure. President Juncker said he had proposed several scenarios, and there was a discussion or debate. I have to ask: what kind of debate? We can talk about a debate when we do not know yet what conclusions will be drawn. Here, however, these conclusions had already been expressed, and even before they were pronounced, it was known what they were supposed to be. These conclusions are \"even more of the same\" or, in European jargon, \"more Europe\". Is this the right solution? Are we taken seriously? If we participate in a debate, we listen to arguments and respond to them. Please note the words that have been said here today about those with a different point of view. There was talk of idiots, the virus, extremists, and even the threat of their money being taken from them. Is this a serious conversation?

One of my colleagues rightly said that it is not true that breaking the rules of law and order concerns the latter, others. It is happening here, it is happening within the Union European.The rules are repeatedly broken by the great institutions of the European Union, including the European Commission, and the application of the principle of double standards has become compulsive.This means that there are groups, institutions or parties that are allowed to do virtually everything and get away with it with impunity, and others, obviously weaker and smaller, who are allowed very little.So let's start with tidying up our own yard.President Juncker spoke about the renovation.So let's start with the renovation.Let the Commission start with the renovation of the Commission, and only then we will build some other super institutions, because we must first cure the disease that affects the European institutions.May it happen as soon as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 66, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Presidente. –", "mepid": "2187", "text": "Since this is an extremely important debate and we have been flexible in the course of it, the Verts / EFA Group would, as a rule, have used up all of its speaking time.However, in the reply phase, if Mr Ska Keller and Mr Philippe Lamberts wish to speak for a minute, they have the right.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 67, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Philippe Lamberts", "mepid": "96648", "text": "on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group. - Mr President, I get a free minute, it is sales day today, I was not even aware, thank you Mr President, you are too kind!

Exactly the opposite of what we want: we want a visionary project for a Europe that works and gives citizens answers. First: a Parliament with legislative power. Tell me all of you which parliament in the world does not have the possibility to propose to make a law? No parliament in the world, except the European Parliament. First innovation: it serves the citizens, it serves democracy. Second: transnational lists. Mr Weber, the card is ready for you and all your colleagues in the popular group to join the club of transnational lists, a form of European democracy.

That is the nature of a parliament. I just want to react to three points. One is about the debate on legal migration. Everybody is in favour of high—skilled workers being able to arrive in Europe with a blue card. There is no debate about this. But we have to be frank. Do we really think that more legal migration to the European Union will solve the illegal migration problem? How many Africans do we invite to come to Europe? Do we really think that this will solve the problem? On behalf of my Group, I think that, first of all, we have to bear in mind the millions of young Europeans who at the moment have no jobs. We cannot say to them that we are opening the door for more legal migration when they themselves have no jobs.   The second point is about the transnational list. Everybody wants to strengthen European democracy and I have to be clear to Jean-Claude Juncker that the PPE is not in favour of this transnational list because we are not convinced – Guy – about the main argument because, yes, the European Parliament is more than 27 individual votes. That is clear. But, sorry, the overwhelming majority of all the Members of this Parliament show every day that we are not only national MEPs, but we are doing a transnational job today. We think in all our interests and that is why an additional list is not necessary for this. I am from Germany. I cannot elect Angela Merkel in my constituency in Bavaria because in Germany we only have regional lists. So if that works even in Germany, it can also work in Europe.  Finally, on the social union, so for Gianni. First of all, very seriously, when we talk about climate change, the Socialists are in favour of fighting against climate change, as are the Greens and the PPE. When we talk about trade, then we have a good understanding that we are in favour of trade and when we talk about a social union, then please admit that other Groups are also defending social principles in this European Union. Social policy is not occupied by the Socialists, frankly speaking, it is an issue for all of us.  When you ask us, as the PPE, to look into the social union, look first at reality. In countries where the Socialists govern or governed – France or Italy for example – we have a big unemployment problem, and in a lot of countries where the PPE is governing – in Germany and in Ireland – we have a good economic situation.

Having in mind the deepening divide between the East and the West, the old Member States and the new ones, I find the commitment to the united and cooperating Europe as a fundament for a positive future development of the EU. Jean-Claude Juncker also mentioned the topics regarding double standards of food and the posting of workers in the single market, reacting to a problem of different wages for the same job. I believe that the rules to tackle those urgent issues are in place, thus we should focus on their effective application, as President Juncker also implied.

This means recognizing that a multi-speed Europe is causing serious damage not only to those who are lagging behind, but also to 'core Europe': the former are not only affected by the depletion of EU funds, the failure to shape policies that benefit them, and the need for coherent foreign policy action. lack of it can cause serious damage. The risks for the core countries are to allow the creation of a 'peripheral region' that carries political, economic and social insecurities, exposing the EU, including Russia, to influence. It is therefore important that President Juncker's 'Sixth Plan' addresses not only pan-European problems, but also those in the southern and eastern peripheries: social problems, helping non-eurozone countries, food quality, demonstrating the Commission's sensitivity to EU-wide problems.

It is unacceptable that some Member States are unwilling to accept the judgment of the European Court of Justice. The danger is great not only because this ideology based on primitive images of enemies is easy to sell, but also because the EU does not have real means against these Member States.

There has been no open political debate on this issue in Finland, although there has been no problem with joining the euro, which is problematic for us. President Macron's speech on September 8, 2017 in Athens heralds a grandiose federal plan. The Commission has proposed three different funds: one to secure investment in a recession, another to help Member States with their unemployment spending, and a third to deal with bad times. The proposals for the three funds are not clear and are not sufficiently substantiated to make their operation easy to understand. It is equally difficult to understand the rationale for a common finance minister or the eurozone's own budget. Federal construction is probably the most significant factor behind it. Europe is made up of sovereign nation states, all linguistically and culturally unique. From Finland's point of view, the development is worrying, as we have been given the role of payer.

The diesel scandal we are talking about today is a triple scandal: it is a health scandal, it is a consumer protection scandal and it is also a political scandal. The diesel scandal is a health scandal because the situation in many cities in Europe is dire. Every year 72,000 people die in the European Union from nitrogen oxide in the air. That is almost three times more people than there are road casualties. Diesel cars are one of the main polluters of the air in our big cities. So they have to be retrofitted consistently. Cheap software updates, as agreed by the federal government with the auto industry, are simply not enough. The auto industry has to get to the hardware and finally clean up its pollutants - that applies to all of Europe. Dirty VWs, Audis or Renaults drive on Austrian, Spanish and everywhere on all roads, just like on German. That is why I would like very much, Mr Katainen and Mrs Bienkoswka, if the European Commission were to present measures for the Europe-wide retrofitting of diesel cars this autumn. Because we finally need uniform standards for retrofitting the diesel fleet so that it is fully in line with European law. Because that's not happening at the moment, the car manufacturers are clearly violating European law, and it is your job to ensure that European law is complied with. So here we have a prime example. I would ask you: make sure that diesel vehicles all over Europe finally comply with the limit values! Second, as I said, the diesel scandal is a massive consumer protection scandal. Because anyone who bought a diesel car, perhaps still assuming that it was a particularly economical car, is now the jerk and must also expect driving bans. The automaker get away with it completely unscathed. There are no fines, no mandatory return actions, no general compensation payments. This is a huge mess, something like that shakes people's belief in the rule of law. It is absolutely correct that the Commission has now started infringement proceedings against Germany and also against other Member States who are completely cuddling with the car industry and have not even provided for effective sanctions. But these infringement procedures are not enough. We finally also need better rights of action for NGOs and class actions. If governments fail, then at least environmental groups and consumers must be able to ensure that they can effectively enforce their rights themselves. Third, the diesel scandal is a political scandal. The German federal government has put a political protective fence around the auto industry here. The German Diesel summit was the summit of chum. The federal government has de facto approved the breach of European law by the German auto industry. She lets the auto industry get away with collusion and trickery. If governments and authorities turn a blind eye to the manipulation, then a European solution is needed. We finally need European tests, the Commission must carry out its own random checks and consistently monitor the auto industry so that there are no more loopholes, so that there are no more fake tests. If the Member States really wanted clean air and the health of their citizens, then they would finally have to accept these strong, independent tests. The cronyism with the auto industry has done enough damage. Now is the time to join forces with European citizens and consumers in Europe.

The shock wave resulting from this large-scale deception is still felt everywhere. At the same time, we seem to discover more and more repercussions. Doubts persist as to the proper testing of car models of other brands as well.  Many actions have been taken at national, but also at Union, level, first of all to investigate the proceedings. In this regard, let me highlight the meticulous and intensive work of the Committee on Emissions Measurements in the Automotive Sector, which finalised its report in March of this year. The report concluded that the responsibilities of the Member States and the Commission as regards the binding emission limits were not respected. It concluded that the fact that there were large discrepancies between NOx emissions in diesel cars measured in the laboratories and on the road had been known to many stakeholders since at least 2005.  But the Dieselgate scandal is just one aspect of a much wider problem. In Europe, we have 400 000 premature deaths due to bad air quality. That is one of the reasons why we need very ambitious laws and the political will to put them into practice.  In this context, regulatory standards are one important element. Decisive action has been taken here, for instance by reaching an agreement between the two co-legislators on the National Emissions Ceiling Directive, which entered into force on 31 December 2016 and must be transposed by 30 June 2018. This Directive sets stricter national limits for the period 2020-2029, and from 2030 onwards, for the emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, non-methane volatile organic compounds, ammonia and fine particulate matter.  On procedures to test emissions from cars, major steps have been taken by the Commission. Under the provisions that entered into force this month, new car models will have to pass new and more reliable emission tests in real driving conditions before they can be driven on European roads. This test will complement and improve laboratory tests for all emissions, including CO2 and fuel consumption, as well as NOx and other air pollutants. Both tests will be phased in for all new cars between 2018 and 2019.  Furthermore, work on an overhaul of the European vehicle type-approval framework is under way. On the basis of the general approach adopted by the Council on 29 May this year, the Presidency is firmly committed to taking forward negotiations on the proposal on the approval and market surveillance of motor vehicles and their trailers, and we are working constructively with Parliament.  My impression from the first trilogue that took place on 6 September is that both co-legislators are eager to agree in the forthcoming trilogues on a robust legislation that reinforces type-approval procedures, enhances market surveillance and makes the system more transparent. Of similar importance is that the strategies that have been developed to accelerate the effective emission reductions move from the stage of policy incentives to large-scale market activity. This concerns in particular the low emission strategies, including the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure.  One of the openers will be urban bus fleets, which are mostly diesel-based today and have the power to make a difference on the market. The commitments undertaken by European cities and agglomerations during this summer to progressively convert their bus fleets into alternative fuel fleets are more than impressive, as the launch of the Clean Bus Deployment Initiative by the Commission and the Committee of the Regions on 13 July this year clearly shows.  These initiatives are being strongly supported by the European Union institutions, including the Commission, the European Investment Bank and the Committee of the Regions, and the Presidency welcomes all efforts by public transport companies that will join in these actions. In terms of policy action, the most important long-term effort rests with the modal shift, converting road transport into train and waterway transport. For instance, it has to be noted that, under the EU funding sources for implementing the strategy for trans-European networks in transport, around 87% of the Connecting Europe Facility co-funding of EUR 21.4 billion for transport has been thus far dedicated to rail and inland waterways projects. However, these efforts require perseverance, as we cannot deny that certain trends work in favour of road transport, for instance, the increase in deliveries directly to the consumers. More remains to be done. The emissions scandal has shown that we need in particular better car testing and good market surveillance. The Presidency is putting its best efforts forward to achieve progress in these areas. Together with the EU Member States and the EU institutions, we need to decisively pursue EU-wide efforts to foster low emissions mobility.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 134, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Jyrki Katainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, let me first thank honourable Members for this opportunity to provide them with an update on recent developments on the emissions scandal.  When Elżbieta Bieńkowska met you last time in April to discuss this case, she pledged, on behalf of the Commission, that we would fully follow up on the conclusions of the Committee on Emissions in the Automotive Sector in the final report and its recommendations. Today I can assure you that our commitment remains strong and that the Commission is acting simultaneously on three fronts: first, better enforcement, second, better market surveillance, and, third, better rules for the future. Let me first say a few words on better enforcement. In April we informed you that the Commission is pursuing several infringement procedures against Member States. These Member States had either omitted to lay down sanctions for breaches of the obligations on the car manufacturers or had not effectively applied such sanctions, even after the manipulations were discovered. Since then, a further infringement procedure was launched in May 2017 against Italy for failure to take action against Fiat for the use of prohibited defeat devices.  Let me be very clear: we are determined to pursue these infringement procedures so as to ensure proper enforcement of the current type—approval legislation and to avoid additional non—compliant cars entering the European market, which would aggravate the existing air quality problem. Second, regarding better market surveillance, in addition to these enforcement actions the Commission also urges Member States to do their part and ensure compliance of the existing diesel fleet with the type—approval rules. In this context, we are happy to see that, after the first round of national negotiations in the emissions scandal in 2016, a second round was launched in early 2017.  There are some enforcement actions underway. French authorities have been investigating possible irregularities in diesel vehicles from Renault and PSA since January. German authorities have been following up on irregularities in diesel vehicles produced by Daimler, Audi and Porsche since June, and, more recently, by Ford. The Dutch authorities also continue their investigations and notably withdrew two vehicle types from Jeep and Suzuki respectively with the intention of public prosecution.  As for the vehicles of the Volkswagen Group which were at the origin of the emissions scandal and as such were already identified as non—compliant with current emission rules, a recall campaign by the manufacturer is underway across the EU. According to the information available to the Commission, at the end of July 2017, more than half of the 8.4 million vehicles of the VW Group affected across the EU had already been recalled. Together with the Member States, the Commission will continue to monitor the repair of the remaining vehicles of the VW Group so that all affected vehicles will eventually be brought to conformity by autumn 2017. In this context, we welcome the decision of four Member States – Austria, Germany, Finland and Portugal – which have made their recall campaigns mandatory. On 17 July, Elżbieta Bieńkowska sent a letter to all Ministers urging them to follow the mandatory and voluntary measures already taken in Germany, France and the Netherlands. So far 16 of the Member States have replied. We will provide you with a complete overview of Member States’ positions once we have a full picture.  However, concerns have been expressed by consumer associations and individual car owners about the full compliance of the remedial measures with the type—approval legislation and their impact on vehicles’ durability and fuel consumption. In this context, on 7 September 2017, the EU consumer authorities, together with the Commission, urged Volkswagen to properly retrofit all affected cars and to inform consumers in a fully transparent and detailed manner about what has been achieved and what remains to be done. I can assure you that we will continue to monitor VW’s action plan on the affected vehicles.  The Commission also welcomes the initiative of Germany and Austria, which organised national diesel summits on 2 August and 22 August respectively. This is a step forward and others should follow. But we have to keep in mind that the measures proposed by the industry have to lead to an effective reduction of emissions on the road and not only in the laboratory. That is the only way to avoid so-called diesel bans that are being discussed in some Member States as a reaction to the scandal.  Thirdly, regarding better rules, let me start by reminding you that, as from 1 September 2017, improved testing procedures, both in laboratory conditions and in real driving conditions, have become mandatory for all new vehicle types. We are also working to increase the transparency and control of emissions from vehicles by allowing independent parties to test used vehicles. This will come with the new real driving emission regulation foreseen for spring 2018. As foreseen by law, we pursue work to review, and possibly to bring down, the conformity factors used to translate the measurements on the road to those in the lab. We expect to be able to lower them already with the upcoming new real driving emission regulation. Last but not least, we welcome the start of the first trilogue on the revised type—approval framework, which took place on 6 September. We salute the co-legislators’ ambition to finalise this revision by the end of the year. The new framework will reinforce the independence of testing, which will remain a national responsibility, but at the same time reinforce its European oversight. I hope that we can work together and use the political momentum to establish a strong set of rules and control mechanisms in order to regain consumers’ confidence and improve the quality of the air they breathe.  Finally, despite current turbulence, our ambition remains the same: that Europe continues to be a leader in clean, competitive and connected mobility. To put it simply, we want to make sure that it is Europe that produces the best low—emission, connected and automated mobility solutions, equipment and vehicles. To this end, the Commission has already presented the first part of the mobility package. The second part will be delivered later this year.  With this package we will present an integrated and future—oriented approach to mobility. This will be our guide on how to face disruptive developments which are ahead of the transport sector, how to modernise it and how to exploit its potential to modernise the entire EU economy. I trust we have a shared responsibility to make this agenda for a socially fair transition towards clean, competitive and connected mobility a reality.

In my opinion, this emissions scandal can also be explained and understood as a guide. A guide and reminder not to put all your eggs in one basket. What are you talking about? For years in Europe, we have had one top priority. That is our climate goal - to reduce CO2 emissions. That is a good and correct goal. But as a result of this goal, we have promoted the creation of a diesel industry in Europe through various laws and tax policies. The industry has followed politicians and taxes, consumers have followed the same, and we have created the world's best diesel technology, employing millions of people, a giant industry. Then, unfortunately, it turned out that the same industry had been misleading society as a whole for years about how much their emissions actually were. And it turns out that there are questions not only about CO2, but especially about nitrogen oxides, the so-called bites, which are dangerous to our health. Not maybe for the environment, but for our health. Reactions? One reaction is to say, “Horror! All these diesel cars must be eliminated, this industry must be eliminated! This is something terrible! ” But let's think realistically! It employs millions of people. It is one of Europe's major economic engines, so to speak. It is much wiser, instead of banning these technologies, to encourage the industry itself to change. And we need to remember one thing in the future: when we make policies, we are not in favor of one technology alone, because we do not know what the unexpected and possibly negative side effects might be.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lv", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 136, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Kathleen Van Brempt (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "5729", "text": "   – Mr President, first of all I have to say that I am a little astonished to hear from my good PPE colleague that it is actually climate policy that is responsible for the cheating of the cars in Europe. Unfortunately, that is not the case.  But let me turn to the speech by the Commission, and I hope it is not due to the replacement of Ms Bieńkowska by Mr Katainen that today the Commission is so weak and not serious enough about the reaction that it should give to what is happening. I am sorry to say this; we have had good cooperation with Ms Bieńkowska in the past and I hope that can continue and that we can be very firm because, let us be honest and look at what happened, for instance, with the Volkswagen recall programme.  The Commission expected it to be completed by autumn 2017; well, that is today. Three million cars have not been recalled yet! And it is not only that, it is also the other cars that have been cheating and the differences in the different Member States, such as: some of them are mandatory, others are voluntary, some are only for the national car market and others are different. How will the Commission make sure that all consumers in Europe have the same rights? How will you do that? I have not seen an answer.  Nor is it about the past alone. We also have to look to the future and yes, we have to care about our car industry but a new era is coming. It will be electrified, it will be sharing mobility, and if we do not make sure that we do that for our industry, if we do not make sure that we have a zero emissions mandate, then cars will be imported from China and elsewhere in the world and our car industry will have big problems, as will these millions of people. Let me finish by quoting a former Commissioner, a Liberal Commissioner, who was very good, Mr Potočnik, in our Committee on Emissions Measurements in the Automotive Sector. He said that we must stop killing industry with kindness by giving into the calls for less ambition, a longer time to achieve it, and allowing loopholes. Let us make sure that we have a future for our car industry and that it is sustainable.

The Volkswagen scandal confirmed those fears were right. In fact things were far worse than most consumers had suspected, so it is fair for people to ask: what are we doing about it?  Two years on, there are concrete changes we can point to, but a lot more work to be done as well. Firstly, real driving emissions testing legislation became mandatory for new car models at the start of this month. That is a huge step forward in ending the golden lab culture, and a big deterrent to cheat. But two years on, there is still a lot more to do. The emission scandal exposed failures well beyond just testing rules. Most fundamentally, it exposed a failure of culture at some carmakers, and a cosy club between manufacturers and governments’ approval authorities and technical services, but also that there was virtually no ongoing market surveillance. Opening up that club to greater transparency and restoring public trust is at the heart of the new type approval and market surveillance regime that we are now negotiating with the Council. The Parliament report proposed a system that would do just that: proper market surveillance obligations on Member States, and the Commission mandated to check for failings in national market surveillance; reviews and audits of all parts of the testing and approval process, to shine a light on weaknesses at every stage.  So I would urge the Council to take on board Parliament’s very sensible views in our negotiations. Once we have new rules in place, all the key components in preventing another scandal will be in place, but until we do that, the broken system remains in place.

We must realise that and recognise that. But the core of the problem still remains. Despite legal obligations, EU governments have barely taken any action and that is the core of the problem. I will give a few examples. The German authorities have still not really taken action against Volkswagen. They did not fine Volkswagen. The recall programme is extremely weak and consumers are not at all compensated for the loss. The UK has refused so far to take action against Skoda. They haven’t done anything despite all the evidence that is on the table. The Netherlands has taken some very careful steps towards action, but it is very limited and careful.  The Commission has done a few things. It has launched infringements proceedings, for instance against Italy in May, and other countries before, but a lot of countries are, well, still not really being chased after. So after what President Juncker said this morning that he called upon industry to plead guilty in the Dieselgate scandal, my question is: what is the Commission doing against the Member States further on, because, as the speakers before me said, it is far too weak at the moment. I thank the Commission for its reaction to the EMIS inquiry committee recommendations, but I am still looking forward to their reaction on the conclusions, because we did find some contravention and maladministration. Then finally the Council – a nice statement here; but the real pain, also after the EMIS committee did its work, is in the Member States. When can we expect an official reaction, as there should be in a democracy, from the Member States, from the Council, and when can we expect real enforcement of EU legislation?

I come from an automotive supplier region in eastern Germany, where 40% of everything that is produced industrially has something to do with car manufacturing. No matter where you go and who you talk to in terms of employees, there is a fear everywhere that they will eventually have to pay and atone for the stubbornness of the vain cocks of the automotive industry. Two years after the exhaust scandal was uncovered, it is clear that despite evidence of damage to the environment and people caused by exhaust gases, despite billions in lawsuits against exhaust fraudsters, threats of driving bans, highly critical results from the EU committees in Brussels, but also in Berlin, the muddle continues becomes. It just goes on and on. And millions of research funds are even supposed to be spent on a clean diesel, as I recently read, although its death knell has long been heard. The clean diesel - ladies and gentlemen, we all know that - is as clean as coal with CCS. This is an illusion of the yesterday. That is why it is all the more necessary that the Commission does not cuddle up to the German government and take really tough action against the production of polluters. We need more stringent regulations for emissions, we need uniform type approvals - we have discussed this for a long time - the strictest controls and, please, no pardon in cartel agreements, which are essentially nothing more than organized crime. We need market transparency, enforceable property rights for deceived car buyers, across Europe. As leftists, we acknowledge the need to turn to e-mobility, and that is not easy. We call on the unions to do the same, to finally face these normal developments.

This is mainly about the existing cars on the roads. We know that there are policies going on to improve the type approval framework; we know that the new testing will be there (by the way, with very strange conformity factors) – we all know that. But the big question is: what are we going to do with the millions of cars driving on the street right now, polluting our streets every day? I would like to quote the Commission, when Madam Bieńkowska still had full responsibility, on 17 July, when she said: ‘We have to remove non-compliant cars from the markets and circulation as soon as possible’. I did not hear that now. I would have hoped that we would have heard that kind of language now, in this public arena. We have to do something about the millions of cars that are not complying with European law – and that is the task of the Commission. Sorry, Mr Katainen, but if you say, ‘we heard some diesel summits in Germany and Austria that should be an example for other countries’: sorry, this is the worst example. What came out of that diesel summit was that maybe there might be some software updates that lower the emission results by 25% to 30%. The latest study of ICCT shows that Euro 6 cars are emitting 4.5 more than allowed on average, so reducing by 25% to 30% is nothing. And if the Commission is going to allow that, then those cars will be de facto legalised on the streets. And they will not be sold in Germany; they will be sold in Poland, in Estonia, because there the people will still buy it and it will not be sold in Germany because there the selling is going down, so they will all go to the Central European regions. Is that the solidarity that Mr Juncker was talking about this morning? The Commission needs to step up to the plate, and there is one simple question: when is the Commission going to come forward with guidelines? Guidelines that very clearly show what needs to happen, software and hardware updates to existing cars, and that you know, and that the national authorities know, when they can be satisfied, because if you leave it to the national authorities, you will get results like the diesel summit in Germany, and that is then de facto legalising non-compliant cars and polluting cars for our citizens, and that is not an example in Europe, Mr Katainen.

Volkswagen recalls the vehicles to update the illegal software and says the repaired car complies with the homologation limits. But is it really so? Nowadays there are more and more tests, scientific reports and news that prove the opposite, that is, that cars continue to pollute beyond limits. Consumers are therefore deceived twice. Not to mention, of course, the compensation that is non-existent. The Commission, in recent days, together with the consumer protection authorities, wrote to Volkswagen to ask it to repair all the affected vehicles by the end of the year, as it had promised. But I have the feeling that this is yet another facade action. I think it is clear to everyone that the problem will not be solved with simple updates of the control units, because the problem - we have now understood it - as well as being quite obvious from a technical point of view, is above all political and does not only concern a car manufacturer, but 35 millions of \"dirty\" diesel vehicles around Europe. The EMIS commission of inquiry has ascertained that there has been a fraud, i.e. the European Commission and the Member States have allowed the homologation of vehicles that far exceeded the emission limits, despite the fact that there were already technologies suitable for their abatement emissions. So fraud and profit. Furthermore, companies were allowed an unjustified extension of the limits in force since 2015, thus effectively legalizing emissions by 110% more until 2020: another scandal within the scandal. To date we have not achieved concrete results and we are unfortunately used to the inaction of the European institutions in the face of large multinationals. And Volkswagen's sales are growing: they have grown by 16% this year.

Dear Greens, it happens that we don't know where this electricity is produced - there is nuclear electricity, there is coal - wherever this electricity may come from.

I therefore consider retrofitting the affected vehicles to be the right thing to do, but I oppose driving bans in cities, as the Greens in particular are calling for. I think that's wrong, because it punishes precisely those who are dependent on the car, who have to drive into the city centers every day - this is not an intelligent solution.

I should also like to point out that 23 out of 28 Member States do not comply with nitrogen oxide levels.

I'd like to start with the positives, if I may. Firstly, the reference in the State of the Union speech this morning by President Juncker was very welcome in that he acknowledged that consumers had been ‘intentionally tricked’ and that the automobile industry must make amends for that. And secondly you snuck in an announcement there on the conformity factor review which is due now in a report. I welcome that, obviously, and wait to see it with bated breath, but let's be clear: we will only accept a conformity factor of one. If we here set the margins, set the rules on the limits on what cars can emit, we can't then have other deals being made that allow cars to emit far more than we here in these institutions agree is legally acceptable.  I have to agree with the comments that have been made. Okay, there are some welcoming comments, but they are really around the margins of what we're talking about here. We do need a comprehensive strategy across the board. We're already seeing a variety of different approaches in different Member States. Some are happy with voluntary recalls, others are perfectly okay with cars still on their streets polluting many, many more times the limits, even over and above the conformity factors after they've been applied.

Where is the programme in place to ensure that that variety of responses that we're seeing from Member States can be collected in one place?

We are talking about millions of jobs across this continent, and nobody in their right mind would want to see those jobs go elsewhere. But as we know, there is a first mover disadvantage here. Other parts of the world will innovate far more quickly. They will learn from our mistakes. They will adapt their technology and then they will be the ones that own the future.

The auto industry has made enormous efforts and investments over the past fifteen years to reduce pollution from vehicles and we are all aware of the need for these changes, especially for health. However, she organized herself to sidestep the standards you set. Let us ask ourselves the question of why. Has the Union not overestimated the ability of manufacturers to adapt to the standards it imposes? The Union must be careful not to impose unachievable binding standards which end up being circumvented with the very consent of the Commission.

Sadly, five months later, we are gathered again to discuss a scandal which, far from being extinguished, has only continued to grow. The European Parliament has not been heard enough and that is regrettable. Consumers are still the big thing, we hear here and there about repairs that malfunction, degrade vehicle performance, or worse, damage engine parts, and additional repairs are at the expense of owners. The builders do not even consider compensating them up to the amount of damage suffered and it is up to consumers to pay for the builders' wrongdoing. President Juncker wants equality in the application of consumer rights across Europe and that is good. We therefore expect a proposal from the Commission to harmonize the reparations and compensation of those who have been harmed by dieselgate, as we have voted. The scandal continues above all because the rules are still not properly enforced and the only way to achieve this is to have dissuasive sanctions. The ball is now in the court of the Member States, as negotiations continue on the new European framework for vehicle approval and market surveillance.

The scandal is that the entities responsible for this scam in Europe refuse to cooperate with consumers and make it difficult for them to pursue claims, and even more scandalous is that so far no hair has fallen off anyone's head. Secondly, we must honestly admit that the reasons for such a policy of car manufacturers were growing environmental standards and stringent emission standards, which were far ahead of technological possibilities and generated huge costs. This does not explain the fraud, of course, but it was certainly the reason for the manipulations used. Thirdly, the \"dieselgate\" is evidence of the enormous gaps in the European vehicle approval and inspection system.

Because this is old technology. The goal is the same. My goal is the same. I want to protect the industry. I want to protect jobs. I do not want to protect the old technology. We have been discussing this for two years and I think that perhaps even more discussion is needed to really understand that we are in the 21st century and the future of the automotive industry is the non-emission car or a low-emission car, not diesel cars. I know that this will not happen – I have said this many times and also in this room – from one day to the next. I know, and I understand, that every other car in Europe is powered with a diesel engine, but this does not mean that we in this room – you as a Parliament and us as a Commission – should close our eyes and say that nothing has changed since two years ago when the emissions scandal broke. The scandal is not over yet because the industry, as many of you repeated, harmed the health of our citizens and our environment and then, afterwards – as many of you also mentioned – it compensated EU consumers less favourably than consumers elsewhere, forgetting that compensation should be for citizens and for consumers, not for CEOs. This is also our role. We are working on this with Commissioner Jourová. I sometimes have a feeling that we have to protect and save the industry from themselves because this is all about a strong European car industry. This is all about the credibility and reputation of the European industry, which is now very weak. Repeating that we love diesel engines will definitely not change that after what many of you have said. For more than two years both we in the Commission and the Parliament – thank you very much for this – have been working very hard to put an end to the scandals and enforce the rules. But of course, as we are also noticing, almost every week new allegations appear. As I have said many times before, Member States are only sharing information at our strong request. Some Member States even claim that they somehow cannot enforce the current law because it is not clear enough. For me it is crystal clear that even our existing rules have been broken and are probably still being broken. On top of that, we already proposed a year and a half ago the new type-approval framework that should help in the future and should prevent such a situation. I have to say that I am disappointed that only this month have we finally managed to open a trialogue. This is much too slow, but we will have it. Now that the trialogues have started, let us agree a high—quality new European framework by the end of this year. Let us do our best, both in the Council – I really count on the Estonian Presidency for this – and of course in the Commission and the Parliament. As we started the discussion in the EMIS Committee, many of you asked for an EU agency. As you also know, I opposed the idea, but I have to admit – and I very much agree with you, Mr Eickhout – that maybe we should be more open on this because the most dangerous and biggest problems now are on—road cars. We will have a type-approval system. It is of course going very slowly, but finally we will have it, but what about the cars that are currently on the road? We really cannot force Member States to take proper action. All the tools – as some of you have also said – are in their hands but they are not using them. They hesitate to do so. Again let me stress that I am open about the European Agency. I have to admit that I might have been wrong about this and that maybe I was too slow in my thinking. So let me stress what needs to be done now. First, I am determined to pursue the infringement procedures. We took a lot of those steps in May and in December, but we need to ensure the proper enforcement of the current type-approval legislation. Second, as we all know, we have to finalise our work on the effective type-approval system as quickly as possible. Some of you asked about the conformity factor. I can commit for now that I will also reduce the conformity factor of the second RDE package by the spring, maybe also after discussing it with you. I will let you know by how much. Many politicians, some in this room, claim to be shocked and disappointed with the industry, but these are empty phrases. In the European Union for now words are not followed by actions and this is our problem. It is very easy to repeat that this is a lack of confidence in the industry, that this was a huge problem and that it was cheating, but we need to do something, as I have said before. Member States themselves can bring down the emissions of the existing diesel fleet. They can properly enforce the existing law and, of course, the measures that are taken by the industry have to actually bring down emissions on the road and not only in laboratories. To do so we have to consider again software and hardware measures. That is why I am not fully satisfied with the results of the diesel summits in Austria and Germany because they are very limited to some parts – differently in Austria and Germany – but I think there is an urgent need to discuss it at the Council. I will ask the Estonian Presidency to put this point on the agenda of one of the upcoming Council meetings. I do not of course want the most polluting cars to end up in Central and Eastern Europe, and you are right that this is the situation right now. For now only Member States can prevent this. Do not allow – this is my appeal to some Member States – non-retrofitted cars to be registered on your territories. This is harmful for your citizens, for your environment and for your future. Finally, let me close with what I think is a very important message because one of the most important things in this very complicated picture is the future of the automotive industry. In November we will present the next mobility package. This will aim to prepare the industry for the future. All of this future work must involve close and very fruitful engagement from the industry side. Without the industry we cannot do it, but they have understood that the way they are going now is not a good way forward. This is not the way to the future. This is the way of the past. That is all from my side. I think both sides and all of us must work to get these changes right. I think we will meet more than once in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 173, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Matti Maasikas", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, let me conclude by recalling that improving air quality means reducing a number of factors that are relevant in this respect. I would like to mention for instance CO2 emissions that are of major importance for the protection of the climate, whereas NOx emissions have direct effects on human health, and there is an inverse correlation between the two. As one decreases, the other one increases. We welcome the fact that work on CO2 standards for cars and vans is ongoing to foster zero- and low-emission vehicles in a technology-neutral way.  The infringement procedures recently opened by the Commission against eight Member States for breach of EU-type approval legislation are a testimony of the importance of monitoring whether EU law in this area is being properly enforced. Furthermore, Member States are called on to take all necessary measures to ensure that non-compliant cars are fixed or withdrawn from circulation.  This shows again that we need to work hand in hand if we want to reduce emissions of air quality pollutants from road vehicles and thereby strengthen the health of European citizens and the environment.

The report of the commission of inquiry accuses both Brussels and the Member States of a lack of control over the practices of car manufacturers. However, most manufacturers would abuse the rule which allows them to reduce the efficiency of pollution control systems in the event that the latter risk damaging the engine (Article 5 of Community Regulation No 715/2007). Moreover, while there is free competition between national certification bodies, the report deplores the fact that the EU does not have a supranational certification body. Finally, the report of the commission of inquiry praised the respect by American manufacturers of antipollution standards comparable to European standards.

I therefore want to use this opportunity and the occasion of this plenary to clarify the responsibilities of the Commission and the Member States in this extremely important matter. Fire safety is, of course, a complex issue, which is not determined only by the choice of the construction products or how those are tested. Factors playing an equally crucial role are, for example, the general design of the building, the effectiveness of the installed fire detection, fire alarm and fire-fighting systems, the location of the building, potential fire accelerators inside or around the buildings, good maintenance – not mentioned here – of the fire-protection system, and of course, human behaviour. What is perhaps even more important, fire safety is crucially dependent on the effective enforcement of fire safety regulations at different levels, national, regional and local. Today, under the subsidiarity principles, fire safety in buildings is regulated at the level of the Member States. This is due to important differences in local conditions between Member States. For example, certain Member States do not allow flammable construction products to be used in buildings, while others have no such requirements. The EU should only undertake actions if the objectives of fire safety cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States. Today, the Commission has no compelling proof that national regulations are not reaching this goal. For this reason we consider that it is not justified for the Commission to regulate at EU level in order to ensure the fire safety of buildings. What are our Commission’s competences? Under the current rules the EU’s role is to make sure that construction products which have the necessary performance requested in given EU Member States are not rejected. To enable this the EU sets common testing methods for specific products, not their safety requirements. Thanks to this, Member States set their own safety requirements for buildings. The Commission is entrusted with the implementation of the Construction Products Regulation. I will call it the CPR. The CPR is based on Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. Under the CPR, the European performance tests include the examination of how construction products behave in fire in terms of reaction to fire, resistance to fire and the fire performance of roofs. Furthermore, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive requires Member States to set minimum requirements for the thermal energy performance of buildings. This legislation does not limit the responsibility of Member States to define requirements on construction products in the field of fire safety – quite the contrary. The various pieces of EU legislation should be applied coherently. Therefore, Member States may equally have requirements on fire safety regarding, for example, the spread of the flame or the emissions of smoke. Over the last few years, the need for more energy-performing buildings has resulted in a large choice of new construction products being offered in the market for buildings, and their facades, which is equally important. These modern ways of construction like, for example, the external cladding system, creating a modern facade, and the need to renovate older buildings, have changed significantly the exterior of our buildings. They are thus a challenge to the regulatory authorities of the Member States. Moreover, new emerging issues of the fire performance of construction products which are not yet covered by the CPR are the smoke toxicity from construction products in fire and the fire performance of facades. So they are not yet covered by the CPR. For these two items, the Commission already asked for independent studies long before the Grenfell Tower fire, and the results will provide very useful information I hope for the Commission, for the Member State authorities, and the construction industry alike. While fire safety is within Member States’ responsibility, the Commission offers to take a facilitating role and add value by bringing the relevant actors together. Therefore, I can commit that we will set up a fire information exchange platform. This forum will facilitate, I hope, the exchange of information between the national authorities and the stakeholders. The platform is expected to examine the issues regarding the various fire safety practices of Member States, lessons learned from the fire accidents in the EU and abroad, experience obtained from new products and technologies, as well as use of fire engineering principles for setting regulatory requirements. By learning from each other and by sharing information, Member States’ authorities will have the full knowledge of the advantages and disadvantages of the regulatory choices they have to make. For this we need the broad participation of Member States, open discussion of the issues encountered, independence and, of course, objectivity. We are therefore working in close cooperation with the Presidency to organise the first meeting currently scheduled for 16 October, so in one month’s time. To conclude, let me say that the Commission shares everyone’s concerns to ensure that our buildings are fireproof. As I said, the EU Member States remain responsible for setting the level of fire safety in buildings on their territory, and to enforce their building regulations. We have no proof for now that national rules are not achieving this today. The Commission is examining emerging new issues such as smoke toxicity and the fire behaviour of facades, and it evaluates the functioning of the internal market for construction products. We will act if EU intervention is needed, but not more than is necessary to ensure the single market of construction products. We are fully aware of the regulatory challenges posed to the Member States’ authorities, therefore we believe that the exchange of knowledge and experience among authorities and stakeholders is very important, and we consider it a necessity. Under the current framework, I believe that this is the best way to contribute to the protection of European citizens. I see the Commission as a facilitator rather than the regulator in this area.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 179, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Matti Maasikas", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, first of all, let me express my deep sadness over the horrible tragedy of Grenfell Tower on 14 June in London. I would like to pay tribute to all the victims and their families. We have to bear them in mind while having today this very important discussion on fire safety. I commend Commissioner Bieńkowska for having given a thorough overview of the legislative regulatory arrangements that are in place in the field of fire safety in Europe today. Let me just add that the work of the Commission on fire resistance needs to be continued and possibly intensified. Both the European Parliament and Council, as co-legislators and as bodies controlling the legislative power of the Commission have exercised their responsibilities and we are ready to continue to do so. I am convinced that the Member States can follow up on that and that effective enforcement on product markets is possible, without any new shift in the competences or legal responsibilities. However, should the Commission decide that a new proposal on the performance of construction products as part of harmonisation legislation is appropriate, the Council will of course be examine such a proposal, in collaboration with the Parliament.

Firstly, I think that the Commission should urgently change the approach to facade testing and mandate the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) to develop one harmonised, large-scale test for facades. This large-scale test needs to be designed to reflect real fire conditions in order to properly evaluate the performance of facades in fire.  Secondly, I believe that the Commission should propose new requirements to test the toxicity of smoke from construction products under fire, and to label those products with the results, so that the construction industry and consumers can make informed choices.  Thirdly, the Commission should ensure a much deeper cooperation among Member States to improve fire safety in buildings across the EU. This means collecting comparable data on fire incidents in all Member States, using data to identify best practice in national fire-safety regulations, and sharing and spreading best practice to achieve a tangible improvement in fire safety in buildings. The proposed actions are fully in line with the principle of subsidiarity.

That was my rationale behind proposing to have this debate on fire safety. Twenty years ago I worked in social housing. Our ethos was simple: social housing provides homes for the most vulnerable so it needs to be of the best quality. Clearly, over the years, this message has been diluted, especially in the UK. Had it not, we would not have had the tragedies, such as Grenfell Tower in June. My heartfelt condolences to the families of those affected.  The issue of fire safety should always be at the forefront of our minds. It should not take losing 80 people in an inferno that could have been prevented. But it is not just about what has happened, but also about what could happen in the future. Across the EU there are too many buildings – hospitals, student accommodation and office buildings – that are vulnerable, and a key lesson from Grenfell is that it is not always the fire, but also the toxic fumes that kill people. EU regulations already require that construction work is done to limit the spreading of smoke and fire, but what we need to do is ensure there are fire sprinklers in all buildings, residential and commercial. These rules also need to be enforced and expanded to inform consumers about the toxicity of materials through harmonised labelling.  We also need to secure better fire testing methods for façades that reflect the reality. It concerns me that shortly after Grenfell, instead of trying to strengthen these regulations, the UK Government supported the ‘Red Tape Initiative’ that classified it as an ‘expensive and burdensome’ ‘red tape folly’ that should be abandoned after Brexit. I think it is far too easy to dismiss regulation as red tape, but these regulations save lives and should be strengthened.  Finally, this initiative is supported by firefighters across the EU who put their lives at risk, but very rarely get the kind of hearing they deserve.

Following the grief, the anger and, sadly, the shameful attempts by some British opposition politicians to exploit the tragedy to score cheap political points, our priority should now be to continue to help the survivors, to help rebuild their lives. My hope is that the full public inquiry that the British Prime Minister has rightly ordered will reveal: why did it happen, what can we learn, how do we prevent a repeat of this terrible tragedy? When MEPs met firefighters from across the EU last week, they told us that this tragedy could easily have occurred in any of their cities. A British firefighter told me that in the UK, an apartment in a high-rise building with the door shut should be able to contain a fire for 40 minutes to allow time for evacuation and to put out the fire. But at Grenfell, the initial reports suggest that the door to a flat may have been open and that the fire escaped through the window and spread by the flammable cladding in a matter of minutes. These are, of course, just initial reports and have yet to be verified. A Belgian firefighter explained that plastics containing petroleum release oils and toxic smoke, making their job more dangerous and suffocating victims. They shared concerns over single staircases in some high-rise buildings, which means that those fleeing fires may block emergency services entering the building. They told me that they are now assessing which buildings in their cities contain similar dangerous cladding. So many issues were exposed by this tragedy that I hope that the Commission’s exchange or proposed exchange will address. But whichever city or country you are from, we need to make sure that at best, such a tragedy does not occur again and at worst, emergency services are able to put out the fires and evacuate residents safely. We owe this to all our citizens and the emergency services that keep us safe.

For too long, we have said this is an issue of national competence. But while the devastation of fires might be local,  the sources of what is burning is not. Every part of your house, from the walls to the furniture inside, are products of the single market, and therefore national actions alone will not increase fire safety in the EU. Commissioner, the time has come for the creation of a fire safety strategy for Europe. We need an EU-wide action plan which includes a single EU system to collect comparable fire data and statistics among Member States in order to identify recurring issues and risks; a cooperative forum between Member States to share best practices; and reform of how we test products for fire safety, including for toxic smoke.

However, most European countries have not updated their fire regulations adequately to keep up with the rapid renewal of building materials flowing into the market.

It is necessary to define a new test methodology that will realistically represent the behavior of the materials in practice and will not be just a sterile or even under ideal conditions laboratory test. We must also keep in mind that the largest percentage of deaths in fires is due to inhalation of toxic fumes, in fact 60%. With regard to this great danger, I believe that we have done virtually nothing and it is imperative that we impose the use of materials that will greatly reduce it. The same does not apply to the risk of fire transmission through the generation of flammable particles where the current regulatory framework lags behind.

This is a European problem and must be addressed at European level. Fire safety standards vary between Member States. Some are better than others, but all are failing.

A Danish firefighter linked to the Fire Safe Europe movement, which is outside this Chamber, drew my attention to the fact that, while he and his colleagues are confident in dealing with fires inside a room, when it comes to facades cannot control the rapid spread of the flames. This is due to the introduction of highly flammable materials into our buildings and the fact that the Member States have not updated the regulations on fires, new materials coming to the market and also the toxicity of the combustion fumes.

We in this House cannot allow a disaster like Grenfell to happen again. The evidence and enquiry into Grenfell had ramifications across the EU and the British Government, while still a Member of the European Union, has a responsibility to work with its European partners and share information to prevent another tragedy like this from happening. The European Commission are to be commended for having the foresight before the Grenfell Tower tragedy to undertake a study on the need to assess the smoke toxicity of construction products. As a standing rapporteur of this House on construction products, I want to emphasise that smoke toxicity from burning construction products and their testing is an important subject, particularly concerning the health and safety of our emergency services personnel, as well as the victims of fires. In the case of Grenfell, as others have acknowledged, it is generally accepted that the material and structure of the facade enabled the fire to spread as it did. My understanding is that there are currently two facade tests, a large one and a small one, with Member States choosing which one. In the UK, it is the large scale that it is chosen. In the light of the differences across Member States in facade testing, will the Commission adopt a harmonised European method to assess the fire performance of facades, which would guarantee a sufficient level of fire safety to EU citizens? Given the complexity and the nature of the question of fire safety, it is important that national authorities communicate and exchange best practice and it is brilliant today that we have seen action about the platform that has been announced by the Commission. But as currently all Member States regulate fire safety individually, one simple way forward where action could make a difference, is if Member States have a common approach towards the collection and sharing of data.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 190, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Anneleen Van Bossuyt (ECR).", "mepid": "117491", "text": "- The images of the Grenfell tower are etched in the collective memory.Unfortunately, the human suffering caused by fire is a daily reality in the European Union.About 70,000 Europeans are hospitalized with burns every year and there are 5,000 incidents every day.We cannot solve all problems in the European Union, but we can ensure that we tackle the problems in our area of competence.I propose two things that have also been mentioned here.First, we need to improve testing procedures.Building materials must be tested in realistic conditions and we must also focus more on toxicity testing, because it is often the toxic substances released during combustion that pose an additional threat to people's health.Secondly - and I am pleased that the Commission is announcing this - there must be a platform where Member States can exchange best practices.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 191, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Gerard Batten (EFDD).", "mepid": "28497", "text": "   – Mr President, as a London MEP, I must also speak about the Grenfell Tower tragedy in which at least 80 people died horrifically.

Since then, specification regulation has passed from national governments to the European Union. EU regulations required a 20% reduction in energy consumption in buildings such as Grenfell under the 2020 energy policy. To achieve this, the local authority may have used combustible material in the cladding when the building was refurbished last year.  The questions for the inquiry to answer are: firstly, exactly what regulations were applicable; secondly, were they strictly adhered to; and thirdly, if they were, then how can they be changed quickly in order to prevent any similar future tragedies in the UK or indeed Europe.

I think that the European Commission can have studies carried out here that can increase the safety of materials that are sold in the European Union in the future and then used in construction. On the other hand, I say, I am not in favor of any other regulations that would affect the citizens themselves. Here, we should also respect the already mentioned subsidiarity, which clearly states that the basis of fire protection falls within the competence of individual nation states.

For this reason, I believe that the starting point is the modification of the regulation on building materials, starting with those concerning the facades and cladding of buildings: the individual materials, but also the effects that are produced by their mixing, from the fact that they are often used together with very serious consequences, as we have seen in more than one circumstance.

Unfortunately, a BBC news agency earlier told us that Grenfell Tower insulation, the one that burns off cyanide, was found in 34 buildings in an east London borough, Havering, including nine residential homes. We have read that the type of fires in the last decades has changed, because the materials have changed. We have not been quick enough, in some countries less than in others, in adapting the legislation to these changes in construction techniques and materials. My country has made many steps forward since the 1990s. But I don't think enough is ever done. My country could already give some good practices because, for example, we could never have clad a building as tall as Grenfell Tower the way it was clad, which, the technicians said, is one of the reasons why the fire has developed so much.

Chairman! Commissioner! coworkers! We are only a single day away from having to make a very important decision here in this House. A decision that will have far-reaching consequences for 70-80 million of our fellow citizens here in Europe. It is the 70-80 million who are disabled in one way or another, and therefore cannot live their lives to the fullest, because it has been made difficult by this disability, and we must of course help them with that. It is time that we, with hopefully one vote, give the little extra momentum that is needed for these 70-80 million people to have a better life, and so we have the chance for now. Many have missed common rules for accessibility in products and services. It is actually a battle that has been going on for decades, and now the opportunity is there, so it is now we have the chance, but it also requires that we stand together here in the house. A divided Parliament will be a gift to the Council. A united Parliament, a strong mandate will be absolutely crucial for us to get through with just some of the excellent proposals that we intend to make in this report, which the Council - and it is no secret - like many Member States have been very skeptical for one reason or another. That is why we need a strong mandate. The struggle for better conditions for the disabled is, after all, a struggle that is basically a social policy struggle. It is a battle for which the EU therefore has no direct competence, and therefore it can be said that the Commission's proposal in this area is quite smart, in that it enters the area of ​​the internal market and moves into the social policy area. via the internal market. This is a good way to move forward, you can say, when you now do not have the competence in the other area. It also means that, as rapporteur, I, those of us who have been dealing with it for some time now, have to go through a difficult and delicate balancing act. After all, there are suddenly two considerations to take. The one consideration is quite obvious, it is to these many millions of disabled citizens, so they get better opportunities and better accessibility. But on the other hand, we as Parliament must also make sure that we preserve the crown jewel, if I may say so, 'the internal market' unharmed, that we do not, with all these well-meaning and excellent proposals, help to damage an internal market, as we otherwise do everything we can to make it work better. So in other words, it's a balancing act, and I think we have tried - or at least I have tried - to keep that balance. The task is to find a balance, so that companies are not burdened with unnecessary administration, that we do not create even more bureaucratic monsters, while we ensure that we through framework legislation ensure that companies are also encouraged to innovate, are encouraged to create better products that will ultimately benefit these many disabled people. I think that the report that accompanies the accompanying amendments has struck that balance. I think we have a good result and I really hope that there will be great support for it. I am aware - and I hope everyone who has been involved will agree with me - that it has not been easy, it is not easy. It's an area that has great interests at stake and it's also more than interest, it's actually a lot of emotions as well, and I want to emphasize on this occasion that those emotions I understand quite well. I think we all know someone who is affected by disabilities in one way or another and therefore has to live their lives in a different way, so I fully understand that we just need to strike the balance. I think, as I said, it succeeded, and I would like to thank the groups that have contributed to us actually getting a vote tomorrow, because it was actually becoming a problem, too, because this report has become so long with all these amendments so that we start to have a problem getting through tomorrow, but then we succeeded in the end.Thanks for the help.And, of course, thanks to all the rapporteurs who have struggled along the way and who have also had struggles with the undersigned.I think we have reached a good result.Also thanks to the IMCO Secretariat with Thierry, who has fought well, and not least to my tireless assistant Anne.I hope for a good result tomorrow.Thank you.", "language": "en", "original_language": "da", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 213, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Ádám Kósa", "mepid": "96829", "text": "Rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - Mr President, the legislative report before us is very important, because we all know that there is a close link between mobility, disability and social inclusion.

The Commission has been working hard to foster social inclusion in Europe and this Parliament has been one of our strongest supporters. But we will never achieve our goals as long as everyday life remains as inaccessible as it is today for 80 million Europeans with a disability.  The solutions exist to make accessibility happen and demand for accessible products and services will only increase as Europe’s population is ageing. But the gap between what is possible and what has actually been achieved in reality remains large.  The European Union is committed to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its obligations on accessibility. We celebrated the Convention’s 10th anniversary last year. People with a disability are expecting us to act – now. Last year’s adoption of the Web Accessibility Directive constituted an important step forward and I welcome that Parliament is now ready to set out its position on the Commission proposal for a European Accessibility Act.  The Accessibility Act aims at using the full potential of our single market to trigger real change in people’s lives. It puts forward a common European approach to accessibility, instead of having 28 national ones. This common approach will maximise opportunities and minimise costs for European businesses and consumers. The experience from the US has shown very well how accessibility policies can be a catalyst for economic growth and inclusion. I welcome the fact that Parliament’s report supports the Commission’s objective to improve accessibility. It brings a number of useful clarifications, also concerning the relation with existing EU legislation. But I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the Commission’s position on some of the main points under debate.  First, preservation of the integrity of the internal market. About 95% of EU companies are either microenterprises or SMEs. Many of them have to deal with new accessibility requirements, for instance due to the new ‘buy accessible’ obligations in public procurement legislation. But, they do not have the same resources or capacities to deal with changing regulatory requirements. The Commission has therefore introduced strong safeguard clauses and light rules in terms of conformity assessment, in particular for microenterprises.  However, a blanket exclusion of microenterprises would not only put at risk the objective of the proposal, it would seriously distort the functioning of the internal market. For instance, a microenterprise might be allowed to import non-accessible products from third countries, such as smartphones, while EU producers have to comply with accessibility requirements.  Secondly, public procurement and EU funds. We want public money to be invested in accessible products, services and buildings. Buying accessible is already a general obligation in the EU Public Procurement Directives, but more is needed to ensure a proper internal market in this area. The Accessibility Act puts forward a list of functional requirements so that industry knows what to deliver, users know what to expect and public authorities know what to ask for.  This brings me to the last point. The accessibility requirements will determine the level of accessibility of our products and services in the internal market for the coming decades. So, indeed, we need to be flexible as technological possibilities are constantly changing. That is why the Accessibility Act puts forward functional accessibility requirements instead of prescribing the detailed technical solutions to achieve them. But we also need to ensure that our laws are effective and enforceable, and provide legal certainty both for industry and consumers.  In light of the still ongoing work in the Council, the Commission will stand ready to support the co-legislators in clarifying and further detailing the accessibility requirements. We have a chance here to make a real difference, both for citizens and for business. The Commission counts on your support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 216, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Petra Kammerevert", "mepid": "96837", "text": "Draftsman for the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - Mister President!

We are well on the way here in the negotiations with the Council. In this respect, I am grateful to Mr Løkkegaard for the clarifications in both the article and the recital. We need clear boundaries in order to create legal certainty for everyone involved. I would also have liked to see reading devices standardized in relation to e-books, but not the reading software, because I am convinced that the software would then follow the existing standard in the devices. I also see that the European Accessibility Act is a compromise that was difficult to balance. You can ask for more, I personally do that too. At the same time, however, one also has to recognize which majorities we have. Let us agree to the compromise and yet let us not tire of fighting on and on for better accessibility.

Our President Juncker said it today in the debate on the state of the European Union. We are, in essence, the defense of freedom, equality and the rule of law. We have the opportunity, with the approval of this European Accessibility Act, to show that Europe has a soul and to show that Europe believes in equality.

That is why tomorrow's vote is important. We have to be more ambitious than the text that has been approved in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and we have to bet on the line proposed by the Commission: support the amendments of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Commission of Transport and Tourism so that all micro-companies and SMEs also make a bet.

The Internal Market Committee has drawn up a good and balanced text for this. On the one hand, we are expanding the scope of the Commission proposal to include payment terminals. On the other hand, in contrast to the Commission, we provide for a mandatory inclusion of the built environment, which means that in the future, accessibility must be planned for new buildings and fundamental renovations. But we also need rules that are realistic, feasible and future-proof and that do not create unnecessary bureaucracy. That is why we advocate less bureaucratic solutions for SMEs and an exception for micro enterprises. We want to give space to new technologies and developments, which is why we are committed to an innovation-friendly approach in the annex. The Accessibility Act is thus another big and important step towards complete accessibility, and I very much hope that we can work out an agreement with the Council and the Commission as soon as possible so that the situation for people with disabilities finally continues and in a timely manner improved.

This proposal can significantly improve the quality of life not only for people with disabilities, but also, for example, senior citizens, and contribute to their full participation in society. As part of the digitalisation of European society, which we actively support through a number of measures, it is particularly important to set up a non-discriminatory environment vis-à-vis vulnerable groups from the outset. In view of the aging population, one hundred and twenty million people to whom this legislation is addressed are expected to live in Europe in just a few years. I would like to remind you that it is the European Parliament that has in the past called on the Commission to come up with an ambitious proposal and called for it to cover all policy areas concerning the accessibility of goods and services for all citizens of the European Union. It is therefore necessary to ask whether the text presented by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is sufficiently ambitious. For us Social Democrats, no. Weakening the Commission's original proposal in its current form is unacceptable to us and it would be a defeat for the European Parliament to enter into negotiations with Member States with a weakened mandate. We are therefore proposing a number of amendments. For the public, the act of accessibility should be a regulation that will facilitate the use of ordinary services and goods not only by people with disabilities, but also, for example, by the already mentioned elderly people or pregnant women. The proposed measures should therefore take into account the needs of persons with disabilities. We see great potential in setting common requirements for making the built environment accessible. Our aim is to help the Member States and the European Union as a whole to meet their obligations under the United Nations Convention on Accessibility. I also consider it essential to clarify the relationship between the act and other legislation that addresses the issue of accessibility by sector. It is important to avoid overlapping or even duplication requirements.However, even existing legislation, for example in the field of transport, does not contain a number of accessibility requirements, and here the act should play its irreplaceable role.I will also comment on the proposed exceptions, taking into account the interests of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.Please keep in mind that the Commission's proposal has already allowed entrepreneurs to opt out of accessibility requirements on the basis of meeting the defined criteria, and we have still specified these criteria.In my view, the principle of better regulation does not consist in granting a number of general exceptions, thanks to which the act will remain only a wish on paper.We are facing a vote on legislation that will allow European citizens to use everyday services and goods without distinction, on an equal footing.Please take this unique opportunity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 221, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Anneleen Van Bossuyt", "mepid": "117491", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. - It is now or never: it is imperative that we send out a clear signal from Europe.

The new rules also leave sufficient flexibility for manufacturers and producers. They will be able to choose how they want to make their products more accessible.

So when the rapporteur opened his speech today by saying that there are many interests at stake, I can confirm that this is true: the interests of some 120 million European citizens are at stake. This is the impact of this legislation. So, we must have the courage to dare, to draw a road towards the future that today scares someone but that opens the door to accessibility, opens the door to services, the job market, education, transport, entertainment. , including the use of smartphones. And so, as a 5 Star Movement, we too have presented amendments to improve this legislation and to make it more ambitious. First of all, is the one on the accessibility of the built environment: we cannot accept the fact, in some way, of making fun of the citizen, telling him that we offer him a service, for example an accessible ATM, but then to this ATM you can't get there, because the building that contains it is not accessible. We must go beyond what these limitations are also of the locals. We want to dare because we want to extend this legislation to those who have functional limitations, as we have said before, therefore an injury, pregnancy, age, because it will affect everyone a little. So we have to design a welcoming world, also for the future.

Mr Juncker's largesse and generosity to migrants should make those who support him blush with shame, when we see the little attention our elites pay to the suffering of our people. The issue of accessibility in the broad sense must be a civilizational leap of solidarity towards our weakest and most vulnerable citizens: our children, our elders, the disabled.

But we must go further. A person with a disability does not have to incur additional costs due to the fact that he or she needs adapted telephones, televisions, computers. The additional cost of a disability that has not been voluntarily chosen is simply discrimination. That is why all these devices must be made from the outset to suit a person with a disability.

Disabled people and the elderly are a huge group of consumers interested in spending money on available services and goods. It is also a group with serious social and economic potential. We should also remember that the act of accessibility is a natural consequence of our EU international obligations, and the consequence of the civilization development of Europe is the creation of an accessible environment in which everyone can lead an active life and contribute to common social and economic development.

It is up to the companies to decide whether they want to make their products and services available to everyone or not.

An embarrassment - yes, in fact an abuse of all people with disabilities! This shows a clear difference between left-wing and right-wing politics. However, I hope we will win this battle tomorrow. However, I am amazed at the total inability of the right-wing groups to realize the consequences of their actions. If companies are constantly meeting, more and more people will be excluded from the internal market. That people with disabilities, for example, are not allowed to take part in transport, withdraw money from an ATM - if anything, one should understand that it threatens the entire core of the internal market where citizens should be in focus.

I would just like to emphasize to those who have had to be in doubt about it - and I was actually told to start with - that I think we all here in this room share the ambition that something should happen in this area. .

The European Parliament has always been supportive of the European Statistical System and has highlighted the need for European statistics to be as comprehensive, comparable, accurate and timely as possible. In this sense, the extension of the European Statistical Programme 2018-2020 is an important achievement. It is not the pure extension of its deadline; but it aims to revamp the European Statistical Programme 2013-2017, securing the good functioning of the European Statistical System, taking into account new high standards and expanding demands of data and information by policymakers and citizens. In the regulation, we envisage advances in areas such as migration, social and environmental statistics, as well as energy and transport statistics. All these data should allow the monitoring of objectives and targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to be set at Union and Member State level and, in this way, to contribute to the achievement of such goals. Let me stress the main issues we take on this regulation: migration is certainly a key topic. The new regulation encourages the further development of existing data collection as well as new data collection in order to better cover asylum and manage migration. This should give a better picture of the migration phenomenon, thanks to the valuation of other variables like education level and integration in the labour market. With respect to the statistical measurement of the situation of refugees, further cooperation with the EU and international organisations is foreseen in order to provide increased availability of data. As regards the social and economic area, with the extension of the European Statistical Programme, we have large and better specified indicators that should be available to monitor the implementation of Europe 2020. The regulation foresees more detailed information on employment indicators distinguishing between fixed-term and permanent contracts. Moreover, indicators should also include data on gender divides and wage gaps, as well as the measurement of pockets of high unemployment, including high unemployment in cross-border regions. As regards international trade, this regulation provides for the strengthening of indicators on economic globalisation and global value chains in order to allow an analysis of the positive and negative consequences for the European market, in particular for the Union’s labour market. Special attention has been devoted also to the production of indicators on income, consumption and wealth distribution in particular, indicators such as the Gini index, as well as data on inequality of access to basic goods and services. Improvement of the quality of information on national accounts has also been encouraged in order to allow better estimates of tax gaps and tax avoidance. The user friendliness of European statistics and easy access to the data are key priorities allowing European citizens to use such data for their education and decision-making. I recognise the important effort that Eurostat has made in the last number of years regarding better communicated statistics and improving its website, for example, by including interactive visualisation maps and infographics. This regulation supports further action in this direction, which we consider necessary in order to contribute effectively to the announcement of the dissemination of statistical information throughout European society. Finally, the extension of the European Statistical Programme for the period 2018-2020 has reinforced the resources at the disposal of the European Statistical System. This recent increase of the budget for European statistics will bring significant added value in terms of outputs and will also benefit the statistical system in Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 253, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Christos Stylianides", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, in these turbulent times, it is more important than ever that public debate and political decisions are based on reliable facts, not ‘fake news’. The European statistical programme ensures just that, by providing trusted statistics on Europe through Eurostat, the statistical authority of the Union. The evidence provided by the European statistical programme underpins all of the political priorities of the Union. As priorities change and in order to address new challenges, the statistical programme now needs to be adapted to remain relevant and to provide the information needed to take informed decisions for the future of Europe. The Commission welcomes the compromise achieved between the three institutions on the extension of the current European statistical programme to 2020. The compromise addresses the growing demand for relevant and timely statistics to support the key Union priorities. In particular, the extension of the programme contains measures for the production of new and better statistics in support of a more social Europe. For example, it will provide better data on income and inequalities, as well as equal opportunities on the labour market. Furthermore, the integration of migrants into the labour market will be better monitored. The programme will also deliver more detailed and faster statistics for other important policy areas such as the Energy Union and will support the monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals at Union level. The Commission considers this extension of the programme to 2020 to be a most important step forward in further strengthening the European Statistical System’s capacity to deliver more timely data and to better respond to policy needs. The foreseen enhanced budgetary support is urgently needed for these developments. I am grateful that Parliament has been a most active and cooperative ally by providing political guidance and support in this regard.

The design, implementation and monitoring of European Union policies can only be achieved on a solid, impartial, reliable statistical basis, containing concrete and relevant data. I therefore believe that the European Statistical Program should be extended until 2020, and that financial support should be provided to ensure that it is improved. At the same time, the European institutions must pay the necessary attention to the statistics provided, precisely in order to be able to react promptly when possible crises are identified in multiple areas, while at the same time preventing their occurrence.

Deepening could encourage further centrifugal effects on a systemic basis. To be able to detect such developments, we need statistics that are close to the bone and relevant to the issues. On that basis, one should be able to distinguish what is causal and what is contingent on developments between regions, nations, the North, South and East of the Union. This applies, not least to the situation of peripheral and island regions, which is my special interest. Overridingly, there is a problem of how to reverse the growing divergences between parts of the Union. An essential step in that direction is a proper measurement of divergences.

For a job well done. And I want to welcome this proposal to extend the European Statistical Program to the period 2018-2020. Reliable and relevant evidence based on European statistics is absolutely essential for measuring progress and evaluating the efficiency of Union policies and programs, especially in the context of the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Jobs, Growth, and Employment Agenda. equity and democratic change. European unity faces challenges in many policy areas and the demand for European statistics remains very high. The need for a political response to the deep economic crisis and its social impact has driven the demand for better economic and social policies based on robust and comparable evidence. The European Commission listed among its ten policy priorities the importance of meeting the growing demand for statistics and the need to make them available much more quickly. The implementation and monitoring of European Union policies are based on comparable and high quality statistical information on the economic, social and environmental situation in the European Union and its components at national and regional level. After the agreement reached, we have ensured that we meet three of the fundamental objectives. First, high-quality statistical information, ensuring that there are no statistical gaps left and focusing on a number of priority areas that reflect the ten priorities of the Commission's policy. Second, to be able to respond more quickly to the statistical needs of the Union, adapting the statistical infrastructure to take advantage of the potential of new data sources. And third, improve the productivity of the European statistical system and guarantee its global prominence.European statistics are also essential for the general public to understand Europe and for citizens to participate in the democratic process and the debate on the present and future of the European Union.Thanks to this new system, it will be able to satisfy the growing demand for statistics and the need to make them available more quickly, guaranteeing reliable, objective, comparable and consistent European statistics despite what some have said here.(He agreed to answer a question asked under the 'blue card' procedure (Rule 162 (8) of the Rules of Procedure))", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 260, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "David Coburn (EFDD)", "mepid": "124967", "text": "  blue-card question. – The Soviet Union used to have some of the finest statistics the world has ever known.

The compromise that has been reached in very fruitful discussions between the three institutions is a major step forward in making the European statistical programme fit for the future. I believe the measures foreseen address the views you have expressed today. As priorities and information needs evolve, further developments in statistics will be needed at both Union and Member State level. The Commission has therefore already started a reflection and stakeholder dialogue about further enhancements of European statistics within the framework of the next multiannual financial framework.

This problem is particularly acute in the need for financing for SMEs, which are still the biggest bottlenecks and stumbling blocks. This is, of course, particularly true of funding new, innovative and, therefore, high-risk ideas, projects and companies, whether, as is often the case, small SMEs where the idea is set in motion, or larger projects. We desperately need more business angels and venture capital across the internal market, this venture capital funding. The EU venture capital market continues to lag far behind our closest comparator, the United States. The EU market is about five times smaller than the Atlantic and, moreover, fragmented into national ones, which also limits the growth of the funds operating here and their ability to focus their own expertise on, for example, technology, environmental expertise or medicine. Learning from well-functioning venture capital markets should also be sought from Asia or Israel. The problem becomes especially bad especially when the fund has reached its goal, i.e. found a working idea and company. A startup that is in a strong growth phase would need fast-growing additional funding and expertise. Then our relatively very small funds may not be able to provide the company with know-how, support or financing. When follow-up funding is not available in Europe, the idea either withers away or alternatives must be sought elsewhere outside Europe. This problem is, of course, neither new nor unconscious, which is why, as early as 2013, the EU adopted a regulation on a common European venture capital passport, the EuVECA passport, which will create common ground for venture capital fund markets and fundraising across Europe. However, it has not worked as expected as in April 2016, only 70 EuVECA funds and only four EuSEF funds had registered. Now, as part of the Capital Markets Union, with the Commission's proposal, we are working to remedy this problem. The aim is to ensure that each national authority does not unjustifiably charge national registration or supervision fees to the Fund or create technical barriers to market entry. Today, the general practice is completely contrary to the idea of ​​a European passport and to the capital markets. A key part of the proposal is a total ban on additional charges and obligations. In addition, larger funds are often opened up to the management of EuVECA and EuSEF funds, which increases the possibility for funds to provide more follow-up funding. The opportunity to invest in SMEs will also be improved. This Commission proposal is accompanied by a broader package aimed at increasing risk capital financing in the Union as a whole. There is EU budget support, a fund of funds to which capital can be attracted, leveraged by large institutional investors. National tax treatment, which is outside the EU's remit, remains a problem. Small steps have been taken to ensure that these beautiful principles are also implemented through joint European supervision, which guarantees that all Member States treat European funds equally and in the same way.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fi", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 271, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Karmenu Vella", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, your vote will be an important step in finalising yet another element of the capital markets union, reviewed rules for European venture capital funds and new European social entrepreneurship funds. Venture capital is an important source of funding for businesses in the start-up and expansion phase. By providing capital-intensive financing and specialised support, venture capital fills an important gap in the funding escalator that other financial actors may not be able to fill. Unfortunately, Europe is currently lagging behind other markets in this area. European venture capital funds are fragmented, concentrated in only a few Member States, and often lacking in scale. The original regulations aimed to address this funding by creating deeper and more integrated venture capital markets in Europe. By setting up EU-wide labels, EuVECA and EuSEF were designed as a means for qualifying funds to market themselves easily across the EU. EuVECA had some success, with about 126 EuVECA funds having been notified to ESMA as of last month, but this is not enough to meet the financing challenge. For EuSEF progress has been slow, with only seven funds notified so far. Under the CMU project, the European Commission therefore made reviewing EuVECA and EuSEF regulations a matter of priority in order to turn these labels into truly effective vehicles for venture and social capital financing in Europe. More specifically, we introduced three main changes to improve and speed up the growth and spread of these funds. First, we extended the range of managers eligible to market and manage EuVECA and EuSEF funds to include large fund managers. In other words, those with assets under management of more than EUR 500 million. These managers can provide economies of scale and trusted brands, thereby passing benefits on to investors. Second, we expanded the ability of EuVECA funds to invest in small midcaps and SMEs listed on SME growth markets. This should increase the diversification possibilities offered by EuVECA funds and therefore make them more attractive to investors. Third, we decreased costs by explicitly prohibiting fees imposed by Member States’ authorities where no supervisory activities were performed. We also simplified registration processes. The new rules for EuVECA funds are part of a range of measures we are putting forward in order to support innovation by strengthening European venture capital markets. Throughout the legislative process, the legislators have shown a clear commitment to developing the rules and finding necessary compromises. The final text provides certainty and simplicity about requirements for the level of own funds to be held by managers. Legislators have also taken practical steps to clarify and enhance the role of ESMA in ensuring consistent and convergent practices among national competent authorities across the EU. The Commission welcomes these changes which will further help revitalise the EuVECA and EuSEF labels. Colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, by endorsing the political agreement you will move Europe one step closer to a high-growth, innovation-led economy by breaking down the barriers currently impeding venture and social investment at EU level.

I myself witness many experiences, especially in my country, in Italy, of companies that have been able to use these funds and have carried out extraordinary activities. We mainly intervened in four dimensions. The first is to extend the audience of those who can use these tools, including managers of larger funds; in this way we will encourage economies of scale for investments; we have also expanded the range of companies in which UeVECA funds can invest and we have decreased the regulatory costs currently existing. The second choice we made: we made these funds truly European. In fact, we intervened by standardizing the registration and supervision procedures among all the Member States, through a role of greater coordination of ESMA. Third: we have made these funds safer, making sure that they have more guarantees regarding their quality and management. Finally, there is a reporting obligation for EuSEF, in order to include a description of how environmental and climate risks are taken into account in the investment approach. I believe we can all consider ourselves, and we are, satisfied with the work we have done, because with this new regulation we encourage technologically advanced social entrepreneurship, we give greater strength to investments, public and private, we create finance at the service of the real economy , we pay more attention to the environment and, finally, we offer job protection and safeguarding.It seems to me that this is a very important result, which we have achieved thanks to the work we have all done together.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 274, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Δημήτριος Παπαδημούλης", "mepid": "28586", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Mr President, we need to strengthen start-ups, youth entrepreneurship, innovation.

First of all, I must admit that we have deep doubts about the need displayed by the Commission to develop with all force the financing of European companies via the financial, bond and stock markets. This is organized to the detriment of traditional bank financing, of European economies and to the detriment of the competitiveness of European banks. Indeed, a review of the regulations on venture capital investment funds and social entrepreneurship funds, adopted only four years ago, still seems premature to us. Time should have been given to these two new European labels to gradually take off, like UCITS funds before. But no, there is an urgent need, according to the Commission, which considers that the funds grouped under this label are not pan-European enough and would be too small. In venture capital, however, managing a small number of projects is often the key to success. Small is Beautiful. Likewise, perfect knowledge of local economic, social and regulatory conditions is often a prerequisite for successful capital investment. Managers of transnational funds are less effective than venture capitalists with a national specialty. But we have another concern. This change in regulations opens up the possibility of granting the label \"European venture capital fund\" to managers of hedge funds, ie alternative funds within the meaning of the AIFM Directive. This is even the main contribution of this text. This change distorts the original spirit of the 2013 regulations. Capital investment funds will thus find themselves drowned in the various strategies of the behemoths of transnational alternative management. We fear also that, within the large alternative managers, the obligatory Chinese walls between the various lines of investment and creation of securitized financial products are not respected.For these reasons, despite our support in principle for the development of venture capital, we will abstain from this text.(The speaker agrees to answer a \"blue card\" question (Rule 162 (8) of the Rules of Procedure))", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 278, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "David Coburn (EFDD)", "mepid": "124967", "text": "  blue-card question. – I would like to ask this question of you.

A strengthened supervisory role for the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is needed, but effective regulation must remain light touch. Initially, small-scale start-ups are quite likely to concentrate around digital, entertainment and social projects. Attention should, however, be paid to appropriate incentives to encourage projects in fields such as light engineering, electronics and environmental technologies. Projects by young people had better be given priority and promotional ties should be built between venture capital structures and relevant departments of universities and technical institutes. In this context, special programmes for peripheral and island regions should seek to tap there the existing potential for small-scale enterprise that is diminished by the high cost of risk capital in such regions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 283, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Doru-Claudian Frunzulică (S&amp;D).", "mepid": "124790", "text": "   – Mr President, even though considered the main cornerstones of the capital markets union (CMU) action plan, both the European venture capital funds and the European social entrepreneurship funds are, at this moment, small and concentrated only in a few Member States.

It brought with it considerable catastrophe. So far, we know of 46 deaths. Many more injured. Thousands of people will have to rebuild their lives from scratch. On behalf of the European Commission, I would like to express again my sincere condolences to the families and loved ones of the victims. I would also like to pay tribute to the first responders. We stand in full solidarity with all those who have suffered, for as long as it takes. Let us not forget that some of the affected territories are part of our European Union; others are closely associated to the Union. My sympathy particularly goes out to France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The EU is a global player in emergency response. We were fully alert and pro-active, from the very beginning of these disasters. Nevertheless, this is our job; this is our moral duty. Even before hurricane Irma hit the Caribbean islands and the United States, we were pro-active. We prepared for the worst. We mobilised all our response tools in order to help the people there. These tools are the following: first, the Copernicus satellite maps programme. As a first step, the EU’s Copernicus satellite mapping system was activated by France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and, of course, by the Commission. Numerous maps have been produced and have been helpful in assessing damage and planning emergency response actions. The second tool is funding. We have immediately mobilised emergency funding: almost EUR 160 000 were rapidly mobilised for the Red Cross in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, as well as in Antigua and Barbuda. In addition, we have released an initial amount of humanitarian assistance of EUR 2 million for the most affected islands in the Caribbean. This will help respond to the most pressing needs in key sectors: shelter, water, sanitation and health. Further EU funding for longer-term reconstruction efforts will also be available. The third tool: experts on the ground. A team of Commission humanitarian experts from different fields of expertise are on the ground now, working alongside national authorities and international partners across the region. The experts have been deployed in the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba. They will also carry out assessments and support the relief efforts in Antigua and Barbuda, Turks and Caicos, St Martin, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands, together with local authorities. Unfortunately, access remains difficult on some of these islands. We are ready to adapt our response based on their needs and identified assistance gaps. Fourth tool: monitoring and coordination. The European Commission’s Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) has been monitoring the situation around the clock. It is in constant contact with all participating states in the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, especially France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The EU’s actions are complementary to the Member States’ own emergency responses that are currently implemented on the ground. The Commission’s crisis centre also coordinates with EU delegations and all our partners in the field: governments, local authorities, international organisations and NGOs. The Commission’s regional humanitarian aid office in Managua is fully operational and ready to coordinate any further assistance. Fifth tool: Civil Protection Mechanism activation. Finally, the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (EUCPM) is on standby to coordinate the delivery of in-kind assistance if requested by any affected state. Water purification, shelters, medical assistance and other vital assistance could be delivered. An EU civil protection team was also on standby for three days, in anticipation of a request for assistance. On 11 September, Germany activated the mechanism, requesting consular support to assist German citizens and other EU nationals located in Florida. In this context, the European Commission will co-finance the transport costs of a crisis response support team. This team will be deployed to the US for one week to help EU citizens on the ground. Sixth tool: help for reconstruction. The European Commission is accelerating its support to affected countries and territories under ongoing development aid programmes. In this context, the EU can release immediately EUR 3.6 million to the national budget of Anguilla and EUR 4 million to the national budget of Turks &amp; Caicos. In addition, the EU has recently committed a new bilateral programme of EUR 3 million to Antigua &amp; Barbuda under the 11th European Development Fund (EDF). On Cuba, the same approach is followed by the Commission under the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI). In the medium term, the Commission is also ready to examine how on-going and future development support programmes under the European Development Fund can be redirected to address the reconstruction efforts as well as mobilising additional funds from the non-allocated reserves – if, of course, justified by specific needs assessment. Dear colleagues, let me conclude by saying that all these actions are a concrete demonstration of European solidarity and of efficient collective action. Let me make it clear that we stand ready to provide any further assistance to the affected countries. This is our role, this is our obligation, this our moral duty. This is why I insisted on this tangible European solidarity through our response tools.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 291, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Lambert van Nistelrooij", "mepid": "28165", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Immediately afterwards, on Thursday, we discussed with the members of the Committee on Regional Policy what we can do.

President Tajani wrote a letter to Juncker today about this situation. This concerns, for example, St. Maarten, where people have the right to vote in the Union.

There has never been a cyclone of such violence in the world, and yet these northern islands have already suffered many more. This is proof that these territories suffer from structural handicaps, recognized by Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

Commissioner, this emergency fund amounting to two million euros for the period 2014-2020 has been halved compared to the previous budgetary programming. However, it is feared that climate change will increase the intensity, if not the frequency, of disasters that could trigger recourse to this fund. Hurricane Irma is just a case in point.

So we have to make residents more resilient and that can be achieved through better planning, better buildings, building emergency supplies and the like.

First and foremost, acute emergency aid must now be provided. But very soon we have to start thinking about the recovery and reconstruction of the islands. Together with my French colleague Thierry Cornillet, I wrote a letter to Commission President Juncker and we call on the Commission to clarify what financial support the European Commission can provide for reconstruction. It is in addition to what the Commissioner has reported and I think it is good to make that more precise. Because whether it concerns the French Saint-Martin on the one hand, or on the other hand St. Martin, St. Eustatius, Saba or, for example, Anguilla and the other affected areas, whether it concerns the outermost region of Saint-Martin or the other countries and regions overseas, the legal status of the affected areas is different but the great need for reconstruction aid is the same.

Yet as the eye of the storm moved through the Caribbean and Florida, politicians, the media and others closed their eyes in order to protect their interests. Their priority: maintaining the status quo of turbo-capitalism, a system that requires perpetual growth and, in varying degrees, climate change denial. Indeed, when my colleague, Caroline Lucas MP made the link between Hurricane Irma and climate change to UK minister Alan Duncan, he said she lacked humanity. When we learned that Mr Duncan had previously pocketed thousands of pounds working for an oil company, it all of a sudden became clear why he had made such an absurd snipe. After all, Caroline Lucas was simply respecting the science that a warmer world with warmer oceans leads to greater evaporation, which in turn fuels more destructive storms. That’s no more than others have done from Gaston Brown, leader of the devastated Antigua and Barbuda, through to President Macron of France and Pope Francis. I say it is politicians, who defend the interests of fossil fuel industries, who lack humanity. Equally inhumane is the fact that 5 trillion dollars is thrown at the fossil fuel industry each year in subsidies; that’s 6.5% of global GDP supporting the dirty economy of the past when we should be investing it in the clean, green economy of the future. The humane thing to do is to act in the interests of those whose lives are now being torn apart by climate breakdown, especially those living in low-lying territories and in the path of storms; as well as millions of others across the globe, especially those from the poorest communities.

Both parts could therefore receive different forms of aid for reconstruction, while all residents of both parts simply have EU citizenship.

I truly share your sadness and your concerns. We are indeed confronted with an extraordinary disaster and definitely, our thoughts are with the people in the affected areas. Of course, I completely agree with you regarding the climate change role in this new phenomenon with devastating situations, hurricanes, many other completely new phenomena of the world’s conditions. We have to learn from this large-scale emergency and to respond in the best way possible. So prevention, preparedness and response are all essential and reinforce each other. I would also like to thank everyone who has cooperated in preparing for this unprecedented natural disaster and responding to it, inside the Commission, but also in Member States, in other European institutions and in the field on the ground. The European Union is working on a continuous basis, 24/7, through our emergency response coordination centre in Brussels. To help the countries affected by hurricane Irma. Our solidarity, in this emergency phase, very critical phase, starts from Brussels. I am really proud – as a European citizen, not only as a Commissioner – of this centre. I take this opportunity to extend an invitation to all of you – some colleagues have done so already – to visit this centre. It is very critical and good to see the people there deal with this devastating situation. Going back to Irma: once more information from the field becomes available, further action will be taken. For the moment, we have mobilised all available instruments for immediate relief, humanitarian assistance, but also civil protection assistance. But definitely, we also look to the future: to reconstruction efforts. The European Union is also mobilised to assist affected countries on the longer-term. We have funding and expertise available. EU regions are eligible for EU solidarity funds based on damage assessments and their economic impact.  It is difficult for me to say something more, but I believe that in our Union, many times we realise that the rules are going through a way and are going to reflect the real conditions. Let us not forget that natural disasters have no national borders. As Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management I would like to focus on this – working together, we are better able to assist affected populations. Europe is about solidarity. I am proud that it is able to collectively help at the time of great need.

Tomorrow we shall vote in plenary on the North Sea multiannual plan for demersal stocks. After the Baltic Sea Plan, this is the second multi-year plan that we want to adopt. First of all, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and all staff for the good cooperation so far. The matter is not an easy thing. It's about a lot. And it's about now. We want to advance the plan as quickly as possible, because “Brexit” is hovering over the North Sea. In the PECH vote in July, a clear majority voted in favor of my report but against the mandate for negotiations. The reasons for this are reflected in the amendments tabled for plenary. I can see the following primary lines of conflict here: Firstly, the question of whether and how recreational fishing is included in the plan. Secondly, which demersal stocks are covered by the plan and, thirdly, in which area and under what conditions fishing opportunities may be set. In the previous discussion of these subject areas, I never tire of referring to the basic regulation as the basis for all provisions. And even today I would not like to do without this reference, for example with regard to the precautionary approach. The precautionary approach from the basic regulation must apply here. In the Baltic Sea Plan, I see a blueprint for the further multi-year plans, including this North Sea plan. However, I am aware that certain special features of the sea basin must be addressed. I think that the PECH report agreed in July is a good basis for a multi-year plan in the North Sea. The amendments that have now been tabled on the role of recreational fishing aim at the following: Firstly, a condition for consideration recreational fishing should be an impact assessment. Any measures should be proportionate to the objectives. Second: The legislator should be able to enact measures for recreational fishing, should these be necessary for the sustainability of stocks. And in my opinion, the PECH report already contains a few good, because they are targeted and clear, precautions with regard to recreational fishing. Amendment 66 is based on the experience we had in the Baltic Sea last year. Which stocks should the multi-year plan include? Do we really want to reduce the plan to a few demersal stocks, as envisaged by some of the amendments? In my opinion, the plan should include clear targets and targets for all demersal stocks. In order to be able to comply with the requirements and target values, clear conditions for fishing opportunities must exist. Here we have value ranges in the appendices for certain stocks. Amendments were also made to these value ranges. I therefore ask my colleagues to support the PECH report's approach to recreational fishing.

The multi-annual plans are a cornerstone in implementing the objectives of the common fisheries policy at sea basin level, in order to ensure fit-for-purpose fisheries management in our mixed fisheries. They are also important because they pave the way for the direct involvement of stakeholders in fisheries management. This is the second multi-annual plan that the Commission has proposed after the Baltic plan which was adopted last year, in 2016, but it will certainly not be the last. The Adriatic plan has already been presented to you and I aim to propose a multi-annual plan for the mixed demersal fisheries in western waters by the end of the year.  We all have to work together in order to ensure that multi-annual plans are in place for our key mixed fisheries when the landing obligation comes fully into force in the year 2019. I hope that trilogues can start as soon as possible. This is very important. Multi-annual plans will give us the tools to manage these fisheries in a modern and sustainable way. I have read your amendments with great interest and welcome the amendments that further align this plan to the Baltic Sea plan. Following the Baltic plan helps to avoid having to negotiate once again those points that were already discussed in detail and settled during the trilogue negotiations back in 2016, such as the use of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) ranges.  There are also elements that were not dealt with to the extent needed in the Baltic plan and where we need to find a way forward. Specifically, we have to find a way to deal with mixed demersal fisheries. Such an approach must ensure that we continue to fish sustainably, while also ensuring a flexible management approach. Whatever the political context may be, we will need to have a multi-annual plan in any case, to enable us to put in place a modern management framework for sustainable fisheries.  The Council adopted a general approach in April as a starting point for the negotiations with Parliament. There is a lot of support on the Council side for reaching a mutually acceptable outcome on the North Sea plan before the end of the year.

In the new North Sea Plan, the stocks of the various fish species are summarized in a management plan for the first time, with the aim of sustainably managing the fish stocks in the North Sea and ensuring constant fishing opportunities for fishermen. The theory sounds good, but I see two problems. First: Imagine you are a hobby angler - that is, recreational fisherman. If some colleagues here have plans, you would have to register your catches in the future. The hobby anglers would therefore be burdened with bureaucratic hurdles, even though recreational fishing in the North Sea has hardly any impact on the fish stocks. That is excessive and unnecessary. I therefore think it is wrong to include recreational fishing in the North Sea plan as a matter of principle. In the event that the fish stocks in the North Sea are poor, recreational fishing can be restricted by regulations that are already in place, and I think that makes sense. We as the EPP have tabled amendments here to the plenary tomorrow, the ECR too, I think that these compromises or these proposals are entirely acceptable. In addition, the legal basis for including recreational fishing is questionable. Neither the basic ordinance - the fishing bible, so to speak - nor the Baltic Sea plan and thus the blueprint for the North Sea plan expressly stipulate this. There is no impact assessment by the Commission and therefore no basis for proper legislation. We shouldn't overshoot here. Second, commercial fishing in the North Sea must not be subject to stricter regulations than fishing in the Baltic Sea. Many families close to the coast have jobs and their livelihoods there. We must not restrict fishing in an ideological way, we have to Find realistic and unbureaucratic solutions that do not burden the mostly small businesses unduly.Here we need a right balance between protecting marine resources on the one hand and protecting an entire profession on the other.I think we can come to a good solution here.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 313, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Ricardo Serrão Santos", "mepid": "124741", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - Mr President, dear Commissioner, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Ulrike Rodust, on the work she has done and, thanks to the good work she has done, there are few amendments to vote on, but most of them are still very important. In this plenary we hear about sustainability many times. It is almost an indispensable word for any politically correct speech, especially when it comes to environmental issues or those related to the exploitation of natural resources. However, when the time comes to decide, we can see that the votes now have to please voters, forgetting that sustainability, not even for tomorrow, is for the day after tomorrow, or another day, should be forever . We have to end this vicious, populist cycle and become consistent. The Common Fisheries Policy approved in this House in 2013 is very clear. Overfishing should have become part of the European Union's past by now. For the springs for which it was not possible to end overfishing by 2015, it must be done at the latest by 2020. And how is it done? It's easy: sustainable fishing limits apply. Multi-annual plans and, in this case, the multi-annual plan for the North Sea, must include operating limits that do not exceed the maximum sustainable yield. If we want to be truly sustainable, this is the way. If we do not follow this path then, in support of the truth, let us stop saying that we want sustainability. It is now essential that this report be approved and that the trialogue proceed.

If there is a sea on this planet where there are numerous regulations in force, it is the North Sea. As a result, all fish stocks in the North Sea are well maintained. All major fish stocks show positive trends. Great sacrifices have been made by the fishermen themselves. The size of all North Sea fleets has shrunk in recent decades. Many fishermen were forced to stop and end their life's work, which was particularly painful in family businesses. But the fishermen have also made a significant contribution to making the North Sea stocks more sustainable and to restore them. We see most clearly that in the development of the innovative pulse technique, a fishing method that saves fuel, that does not break up the seabed and that above all brings up the fish that one wants to catch, selection in optimum form. Unfortunately, there are still groups and NGOs that claim that the North Sea is overfished. Even stricter rules and unacceptably high standards are demanded. That makes the situation really unworkable. And unfortunately there are also colleagues who do not want pulse fishing. I find it incomprehensible and irresponsible. Because it is innovation, but would people want to go back to the time of the beam trawl? Please don't!

The first is, of course, for Ulrike Rodust. It is a pleasure to work with a rapporteur who has ‘Ordnung’. ‘Ordnung muss sein’, as the Germans say. That was a very good start and it guarantees a good result. The second point is recreational fisheries. That is going to be a bigger and bigger problem in all fisheries and it is coming up also in technical measures. If we do not do something, then it will grow and grow, and overgrow our possibilities. The third issue is the FMSY. There is pressure to accept FMSY upper. I do not think that is an acceptable way of handling this issue. The common fisheries policy (CFP) was clear on this issue and therefore, I hope for support for my amendment on FMSY as a limit. The fourth problem comes up also in very many files. We are for regionalisation, but we need a backstop. If the regions do not understand how to make their decisions, then we will run into a very problematic situation. This is coming up in several files and therefore, even if you do not like the Commission to step in, we think it is necessary to have a backstop for the future.

But the closer we get to a deadline, the more looking ahead turns into moving forward. The fishing plan for the North Sea threatens to become a symbol of advancement. If this plan goes ahead, overfishing will continue to be possible, even after 2020. That can be done differently and it must be done differently. Let us use the maximum sustainable yield as the absolute upper limit when setting the quotas. This leaves no room for differences of interpretation or flexibility. We agreed on this a long time ago, when 2020 still seemed far away. 2048: that is a year that still seems a long way away, but it is the year in which the world's seas will be empty if we do not take measures quickly.

First of all, I would like to start by thanking Ulrike Rodust for her work with this management plan. She also led the work on the reform of the EU's new fisheries policy. The most central issue in the whole reform is how we can fish sustainably. Together with the Council of Ministers, we decided in the basic regulation that fish stocks should be restored and preserved above levels that ensure a maximum sustainable return. This is the only solution for us to have sustainable stocks in the long term. Then it is not enough to fish at a level that allows a mortality rate well above that which is maximally sustainable. Then we will never reach our goal. It goes without saying that it is impossible. The common fisheries policy set a limit, and that limit is called FMSY. We can not fish more than that. I therefore support the amendment tabled by the ALDE Group to remove intervals that exceed FMSY and call on everyone else to do the same. That is what we all decided jointly in the common fisheries policy. We all have an interest in sustainable fish stocks. It is a prerequisite for healthy seas, for employment and income in commercial fishing but also for recreational fishing. We are many to use the resource, and in some cases it is the case that recreational fishing has a very large impact on fish stocks. We have a common interest in conserving the stocks so that they continue to provide returns for future generations as well.

The first is, of course, the multiannual nature, which will make it possible to give more visibility to fishermen. It is important, in fact, that the variation in fishing possibilities for a particular stock is not sudden from one year to the next. The second advantage is that the purpose of this plan is to remedy the problems caused by stocks with limiting quotas. Indeed, demersal stocks, that is to say stocks of species living on the seabed, are often exploited in mixed fisheries. Concretely, this means that, when the fillets are raised, there may be different species caught: cod, haddock, saithe, whiting, sole, plaice or even langoustine. For fishermen, the problem is that they should in principle stop their campaign as soon as they have reached their quota on one species, even if they still have quotas on other species. Indeed, the landing obligation now makes it illegal to reject any catch exceeding a quota. This plan should therefore remedy this problem by introducing the possibility of trading quotas between Member States, but also with third countries. Likewise, the fishing possibilities will be allocated by range in order to be more flexible. All these measures therefore converge towards greater flexibility and greater visibility for the benefit of fishermen.

So we bet on multi-year plans and regionalization, and we work with fishermen, convincing them that regionalized measures through multi-year plans would bring them very close to decision-making. However, when enthusiasm turns to frustration, it is very difficult to restore confidence. The fishermen are frustrated today, just like me. They expected something else from this plan. They hoped that the ranges within which the Council can set the total allowable catches would be set on sound scientific grounds. This is precisely what the basic Regulation establishes in its Article 9 (1), but, in this plan, ranges have been proposed without any scientific basis. The fishermen were also confident that the measures would take into account their socio-economic impact, as provided for in the CFP in Article 9 (4). Here again they were misled.

Another condition for this viability of fishing activity is the sustainable management of the resource. The implementation of the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in line with the level of TACs (total allowable catches) has already produced spectacular results on fish stocks, since 52% of the North Sea stocks are managed from sustainably and have achieved MSY - and we do not say this enough, Commissioner - and the results are even better in the North East Atlantic.

While supporting the basic principle of multiannual planning, and in particular the devolved nature of decision-making, I do have concerns about the inclusion of recreational fisheries by this Parliament. That goes in the opposite direction, and I cannot support such an idea. Surely the fishing nations of the North Sea can decide for themselves whether that is a problem and, if so, how to deal with it.

I do not trust the UK government in EU negotiations. I do not trust a UK government to sensibly and effectively manage Scotland’s fisheries itself either.

But we should always keep an eye on one principle in this regard, and that means: Quality has to come before speed, whether Brexit is on our backs or other speed-increasing criteria, we owe it to our fishermen. And if the plan does not keep what it promises, then the sector and the population will be more dissatisfied with the EU. That is why we as the EPP are in favor of having very clear and simple definitions here. In the North Sea Plan we need a simple application for grouping. That means: only those species that are actually quoted, that have totally allowed catch. And we need applicable corridors for the quotas on a scientific basis. When I keep hearing “Well, there must be no overfishing, etc.”…: When a stock is in such good shape that it threatens others, so to speak - we have this, for example, with the interaction between whiting and the crab - you have to take more out of the stock so that the crabs can recover. With a flexible corridor solution, the area for the regulation of the limiting species, the choke species, is also very, very important. Just think of cod and plaice. If the quota for the plaice has been intercepted, so to speak, then I have to be careful and have a clear understanding of how I can continue to deal with the cod. I just want to say one more thing in a nutshell: For 50 years, the number of edible fish in the North Sea has not been better than it is now. We have a million tons more biomass for the herring.

It must be said that the introduction of multi-annual plans is one of the key instruments in the common fisheries policy to manage resources in a sustainable way. It is essential not to lose sight of the fact that these multiannual plans, both for the North Sea and the Baltic one, already approved, set a precedent for future management proposals in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. And, as we move towards more southern waters, the fisheries are mixed, that is, the interaction of species is greater, so it is essential to provide these areas with reasonable management plans in the future. Multi-year plans also have to be endowed with flexibility, and that flexibility has to allow moving within the ranges established by fishing mortality, both to make decisions when stocks are in danger and implement the necessary corrective measures, and to increase the possibilities fishing when stocks are in good condition. It is essential to note that, through this plan, waters that belong to the United Kingdom will be managed, and it is very important to note here that, despite Brexit - the United Kingdom leaving the European Union - it is essential to make a responsible management of fisheries, because fish do not understand borders, gentlemen.

I would like to make some comments and let me start with leisure fisheries because this was mentioned by a number of speakers. I think that recreational fishing must be taken into account when setting fishing opportunities, without unnecessary intervention. The way that we do this is: we always ask the Institute for Systems, Informatics and Safety (ISIS) to provide us with information on recreational angling when it plays a significant role. With regard to Brexit – a number of Members spoke about Brexit – I agree and it has already been said that stocks have no boundaries. As long as we have shared stocks, we also have a shared responsibility. We have to have the best management framework to work for sustainable fisheries, with or without Brexit. Others spoke about the issue of choke and this is indeed one of the main purposes of the plan. The ranges of fishing mortality will provide us with an additional instrument for addressing choke situations as well. Our colleague, Mr Serrão Santos, spoke about sustainability and I totally agree with him that we have to be serious about sustainability and to do away, phase out and stop overfishing because overfishing could be as harmful as illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU).  Mr Torvalds and Mr Mato spoke about regionalisation. It is true that some serious regions have taken regionalisation on board and it is working very well for them. It is also true that in some cases, the Commission has to come in and take decisions to act. But everyone is recognising that regionalisation is in the best interest of the stakeholders, and especially of the fishermen themselves. I do not agree with Ms Hazekamp when it was said that overfishing is continuing and we are not getting results. On the contrary, the common fisheries policy (CFP) is providing us with some positive results and as has already been mentioned, the number of stocks at maximum sustainable yield (MSY) has increased from 9 up to 36 and that is, for me, a very good result. I also agree with Linnéa Engström that with healthy stocks everyone benefits, whether this is the leisure or the commercial industries, so both have to take on responsibilities when it comes to sustainable management. Mr Mato knows that the worst thing that could impact negatively on fishermen is a lack of sustainable management and this is exactly what we do not want to have and is exactly what the multi-annual plan is giving us. I agree with Ms Thomas about the essentials of the plan, especially the sustainable management of resources not only to reach but to maintain the stocks at maximum sustainable yield (MSY). Mr Hudghton also reminded us that apart from the CFP, there are also international obligations to be complied with by everyone, including the UK after Brexit. I also agree with Mr Kuhn when he mentioned as well that we need to start looking at the interaction and the impact of one species over other species and we will be moving in that direction when we start taking into consideration and taking the ecosystem approach, because I agree that this is a very important remark. I also agree with Ms Aguilera García that we have to make multi-annual plans (MAPs) work so we can then move to other areas and to other stocks, especially in the South. Let me reiterate that it is of utmost importance that the multi-annual plans are made fit for purpose and to ensure this, they must focus on the tools to ensure a practical and a sustainable management framework for our mixed demersal fisheries. Multi-annual plans should be adopted as a matter of priority as well, and the Commission will make every effort to assist the co-legislators in the coming trilogues.

We have now heard some arguments in the debate on the subject of recreational fishing, value ranges and grouping. In this context I would like to remind you of the situation in the Baltic Sea. Recreational fishing has a major impact on the cod stocks there. In Amendment No 66 on recreational fishing in the PECH report, we therefore take up the structure of the ICES advice, which distinguishes between total catches, commercial catches and recreational fishing. The difference between total catch and recreational fishing gives the recommendation for commercial fishing. The total catch is limited by the value ranges of the multi-year plans. In my opinion, if recreational fishing is not taken into account when setting fishing opportunities, the CFP objectives cannot be met. The way in which the demersal fish stocks covered by the plan are dealt with has become very clear in the debate. A majority in plenary will have to decide that tomorrow. The same applies to the value ranges. I said earlier that I still hope that we will act quickly.

This year Erasmus, one of the most successful programs in the EU, celebrates its 30th birthday. Over the course of these 30 years, the program has expanded significantly and has had a decisive impact on the personal and professional lives of around 9 million students, trainees, volunteers, teachers, educators and youth workers. Erasmus +, as it is called today, offers the ideal opportunity to experience Europe first hand and thus to consistently counteract the persistent Euroscepticism. This is because young people - be it as students, trainees or schoolchildren or adult specialists and teachers from different educational areas - see Europe as an opportunity through international exchange. Through Erasmus, Europe is made tangible for the individual. It offers the opportunity to participate directly in Europe. As a European citizen-oriented program, Erasmus promotes values ​​such as tolerance and freedom, understanding of other cultures and awareness of democracy. However, too few people still benefit from Erasmus +. According to the Commission, only around 5% of young EU citizens have participated in the program so far. The 30th anniversary of Erasmus + should therefore be used as an opportunity to improve and significantly expand the program. The Culture Committee put a question to the Commission for an oral answer and submitted a resolution in order to start the discussion on a follow-up program after 2020. In the context of the parliamentary resolution on the future of Erasmus +, the committee emphasizes the importance of the program as a flagship of the European Union and as an essential instrument to support activities in the fields of education, youth, training and sport. Nevertheless, it must be evaluated for the successor program how to make the access more open and can make it more inclusive so that disadvantaged young people also get the chance to have such an experience abroad. A large majority of the Committee has always viewed Erasmus as an important investment in the future of Europe and has therefore always advocated strong funding. In my opinion, the medium-term goal must be to give everyone under the age of 27 the opportunity to participate in at least one of the program parts. This requires a multiplication of the financial means already in the next program period. I very much welcome the fact that the Italian government, for example, has called for a tenfold increase in funds in the context of the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework and that many other political actors are already sympathizing with a specific figure as a factor in the multiplication. You can all be sure that you will run open doors at least in the Committee on Culture and Education and hopefully in the whole house. The overall budget of Erasmus + was increased significantly for the current funding period and was celebrated as a great success by the Commission and the European Parliament. This had aroused many expectations among applicants for better equipment for their projects. However, this increase took a long time to arrive. Many projects that were definitely eligible for funding had to and still have to be rejected. As a result, sponsors and institutions with no experience of European projects and programs in particular refrain from submitting an application or, if they are rejected, sit back in frustration and say: “I'll never do that again.” There is still a lack of clarity and a general one Determine the user unfriendliness of the guide. The application procedures are far too complex and the application forms, with almost 40 pages, far too extensive. We must also ensure that, for the future, in particular young people from disadvantaged backgrounds experience better support through Erasmus +. Mobility and education must not remain a privilege for the few. Particularly in the case of individual stays abroad as part of studies and training, there is a clear need for improvement, and everyone who has ever lived abroad knows that this is associated with many costs that can only be partially covered by the Erasmus funding. Erasmus is and was not an employment policy instrument, even if stays abroad naturally look good on your CV and so-called soft skills are acquired, which every employer would like to see. A follow-up program should focus on the principle of lifelong learning, lifelong mobility, and promote formal and non-formal learning equally. We have to be careful not to overload Erasmus + with labor market policy. With Erasmus + we achieve a high funding effect with little money and make a real contribution to strengthening the feeling of togetherness among people in the EU. Erasmus is a good investment in the future of our children and, like no other European Union program, it represents the success of the European idea. Let's set out together to make this program even more successful! I am counting on the support of the Commission and I hope that the Council will understand that the money is really well spent here.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 338, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Tibor Navracsics", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, Erasmus+ is the European Union’s most powerful tool to connect with citizens and create a community of values, knowledge, skills and competences. It brings people together in ways that no other programme can. Since its launch in 1987, Erasmus and its successor programmes have given nine million people the chance to study, train, volunteer or gain professional experience abroad. In 2014 the Erasmus+ programme integrated all previous initiatives in the fields of education, training, youth and sport. Since then, in less than three years, two million citizens from 33 European countries have experienced the positive impact of Erasmus+. This year we are proudly celebrating the programme’s 30th anniversary, involving European citizens – and especially young Europeans – through social media, conferences, debates and exhibitions across Europe. Thank you all for your support in celebrating the 30th anniversary on 13 June in this very hemicycle. Erasmus+ is undoubtedly a success story. It also enjoys support outside the political world across countries and institutions, with more and more calls for considerable budgetary increases for the next programme in order to reach even more Europeans. I would like to thank you for your oral questions and today’s debate, which underlines the two most crucial issues regarding the future programme, the programme’s structure and the money we will invest in it. The feedback we have received from national authorities and various stakeholders in the context of the mid—term evaluation indicates that there is a strong call for stability in the structure of the programme to meet the unmet demand and for further simplification to reduce the administrative burden for all. In particular, preliminary results of the Erasmus+ mid—term evaluation show the high level of appreciation by national authorities, stakeholders and project participants, notably of the integrated nature of the programme, covering learning in all its contexts, whether formal or non-formal, and at all levels of the lifelong learning continuum, from early childhood education and schools, vocational education and training through to higher education and adult learning; the adaptability of the programme, able to re-adjust priorities to EU-level emerging challenges and needs, for example the much-reinforced emphasis on social inclusion and prevention of violent radicalisation, following the Paris Declaration of March 2015, and the mobility experiences with high levels of satisfaction expressed both by learners and staff and across all fields and types of mobility. I strongly believe that Erasmus+ should be available to all young Europeans, and I share your ambition in this respect. We also need to focus on where the programme adds value. For example, the programme should support young people going into forward—looking study fields where Europe needs expertise and must have the ambition to be a world leader, such as climate change, clean energy, robotics, digitalisation, etc. The Commission will continue to put forward two sorts of action to support innovation and development. On the one hand, we focus on skills for life from an early age and with regard to all forms of learning. On the other hand, we encourage stronger links between schools, including vocational education and training schools and higher education institutions, as well as between education and the world of work. This will help young people develop a broad set of competences to do well in life and at work in increasingly multicultural societies. We must also respond to the calls for a more inclusive and outreaching programme. Thus we need to significantly increase the number of opportunities offered to school pupils, vocational education and training students and apprentices. The programme needs to help young people access high-quality education, irrespective of their social background. Mobility should therefore be common practice in school education and vocational education and training, similar to what has become the norm in higher education over the last decades. It is of paramount importance to the development of most-needed transfers of skills. Moreover, we should be more inclusive and better-suited to young people’s needs, and for this we need to provide a European experience even to those who are not mobile. In this context, making better use of digital approaches, virtual tools and online platforms plays a prominent role. Web—enhanced learning programmes, such as blended learning that combines digital media with traditional classroom methods, can complement physical mobility to widen access to the programme. It is in this vein that in June we launched a new Erasmus+ mobile application designed for students, vocational learners and participants in youth exchanges to facilitate the mobility experience for generations to come. This app will bring the Erasmus+ programme even closer to citizens, making it more user—friendly, accessible and inclusive and adapting it to the digital era. I welcome your support for strengthening Erasmus+ in order to allow it to reach many more Europeans and to continue building a stronger and better Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 339, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Michaela Šojdrová", "mepid": "124710", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his understanding approach. I agree with you, Commissioner, that Erasmus+ is the most successful European programme. It is an investment in our future. We would like to ask the Commission about two very relevant points. What should be done to make the programme more accessible to more EU citizens? Secondly, what financial and budgetary reforms are needed to enable this flagship EU programme to reach its ambitious goals? This debate is very topical. Less than 5% of young Europeans benefit from the programme due to socioeconomic factors and limited funding. Erasmus+ is now facing increasing financial risks from other initiatives, such as the European Solidarity Corps. For this programme not to have any fresh money would be unacceptable for us.  I welcome the fact that volunteering is emphasised in our resolution because this value has to be enhanced. Erasmus+ has to be given priority and has to be more ambitious and reach more teachers, students, apprentices and volunteers, including people from disadvantaged groups. The question today is whether we are ready to fundamentally increase the budget of Erasmus+ in the upcoming financial period. I am convinced we should do that. Only then will the Erasmus+ programme be more inclusive and become a real investment in our future.  My last point is on the European Student Card, which is in the resolution.

But, curiously, he did not recall that the strongest wind comes from the new generations, those who live Europe as their home, reject the walls, are disappointed by Brexit and ask for more Europe, more opportunities to grow, to share, to have a future of European citizens. Thirty years after the launch of the Erasmus program, it was said, nine million young people, and not just young people, have experienced educational and training mobility, the practice of active citizenship, volunteering, sport: but they represent, in fact, only 5% of young Europeans. For this reason, the Committee on Culture and Education has asked for a strong signal in the next multiannual programming, to really put young people at the center of European policies. The S & amp; D group, as already requested by the Italian government - President Kammerevert reminded it the first - will fight to obtain the multiplication of the resources currently allocated, because we take seriously the commitment made, also in the White Paper of President Juncker to have at least 20% of the young people involved. However, we need to make the program more accessible, facilitate the credit recognition system and non-formal competences, invite universities to fully apply learning agreements as a mandatory part of mobility, including on platforms, increase the size of grants and introduce concessions. like the European student card we offer to access facilities and services throughout Europe.

Many studies of the participants themselves have confirmed that an international environment is the best way to learn about different cultures, improve a multi-cultural understanding and knowledge of language, establish international contacts, develop new skills and grow as a person and as a professional. Undoubtedly, Erasmus is a tremendous success, but we should now focus on how further to develop, modernise and simplify the programme and make it more accessible and inclusive. The Commission, together with the Member States, should overcome the existing complexity of the application process and often slow administrative management.

Erasmus is a magnificent project but it is still elitist and we must strive to guarantee more funds and more aid to students from the poorest families. The key is greater accessibility, rightly recalled by the Kammerevert resolution. But you have to be consistent. The loan system does not serve to guarantee greater accessibility: it has failed in this sense in the United States and there is no need to open up to this system, as has been done, albeit with limits, fortunately. So I invite you to vote on our amendment which aims to cancel this path and focus on scholarships, which remain a real key to inclusiveness. And then we must agree on values: from Socrates to Montessori, the task of the school has always been, in European culture, to spread knowledge and train citizens, not to classify young people in organizational charts.

While I share some of my colleagues’s concerns, in particular about threatening the effectiveness of Erasmus by making it cover more and more political objectives, I would nevertheless like to broaden the field of questioning. Indeed, as the newspaper Le Monde recalled in an article of August 29, in fact, despite its relative success, Erasmus still mainly benefits socially advantaged young people. While this social divide is now known, I am also concerned about the tendency of the Commission to see mobility as the only solution to the unemployment problem. This view seems wrong to me. Mobility for mobility does not lead to anything. Still according to the article in Le Monde, only mobility geared towards prestigious institutions, for example, will benefit young people when they enter the professional world. Mobility as an end in itself ultimately only leads to the brain drain and uprooting, which is the source of identity anxiety. It therefore seems to me that the reflection on the future of Erasmus + should focus on these two questions: the development of opportunities for the less privileged deserving students, particularly those in rural and peripheral areas, and finally a necessary reflection on the question. brain drain and the challenge of continuing to make our territories attractive to young Europeans so that mobility does not become the hangman of rurality.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 346, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Diane Dodds (NI).", "mepid": "96951", "text": "   – Mr President, the Erasmus+ programme allows students, teachers and young people to study, work, volunteer, teach and train throughout Europe.

It could explain at length and broadly the benefits it brings to participants, universities, businesses, local communities and, consequently, to Europe in general.

But even the best design has a margin of improvement. First issue: Erasmus must be accessible to everyone, including people from poorer backgrounds and people with disabilities. I repeat once again - the amount of scholarships must be adjusted to the living costs of the host country. The next issue: the recognition of periods of study abroad and the credit points obtained there must be respected in 100%, this cannot be a problem for students. The third issue: cooperation between national agencies is necessary to, on the one hand, develop high-quality information materials, simplify procedures, and, on the other hand, develop a minimum criteria for objective evaluation.

Because nothing like the tangible experience of the European human, cultural and spiritual heritage, of what unites us and what differentiates us, can break down prejudices and mistrust and contribute to European identity.

Secondly, I think that the program should not be intended mainly for university students. Let's do everything we can to ensure that other young people make more real use of this program - apprentices, high school students, mostly university students. Thirdly, let us do more so that not only young people from the so-called new Member States travel to the 'old Member States', but also to make it more attractive for young people from Western Europe to study in Central Europe and in the new Member States. bilateral.

I think it was a really fruitful debate, and while we are drawing our conclusions from this debate and planning the future of Erasmus+, I think we can easily agree that Erasmus is one of the biggest successes of European integration. However, this must not make me complacent, and we always have to seek new ways of broadening and widening the social appeal, the geographical appeal and also the age appeal of Erasmus+.  A lot of people raised the need for a special programme for secondary schools, for instance, or to include younger people – not only students but also students from secondary schools – in Erasmus+ in the future. We just heard a lot of interventions on the need to make Erasmus+ more socially sensitive, and I totally agree with your observations and your interventions. Of course, it is mostly a question of funding. When we are preparing our positions for the next MFF negotiations we have to bear in mind that it is not only spending money for a special purpose, but it is an investment in the future. So this is the moment when we can fund the future of Europe and the future of the next generations.  I absolutely agree with the opinion that Erasmus+ is not an employment policy instrument. It is a complex way of developing education, culture, sport, youth policy, and also employment policy and the future of the world of labour and the intercultural co-existence of future societies. That is why I think accessibility is a crucial issue for Erasmus+ in the future. However, we are not without success at the moment. More than 35 000 students from disadvantaged backgrounds have already benefited from Erasmus+, and additional funding is foreseen. I know there is not enough. That is why I was very happy to hear your encouragement to go forward in this way and to make Erasmus+ more socially sensitive. Let me address some concerns regarding the European Solidarity Corps. For me, and I hope for you too, the European Solidarity Corps is a great opportunity to show our solidarity with the young people of Europe. The first deployment proved this hypothesis. In Norcia and Spoleto, where I was two weeks ago, I saw great evidence of European solidarity. It is based on volunteering. That is why the first phase of the existence of the European Solidarity Corps can be funded by Erasmus+ by volunteering sources, because it is the same activity. These funds came from Erasmus+. It has so far covered European Voluntary Service activities and now it covers European Solidarity Corps activities. In the future, the European Solidarity Corps is going to have its own separate budget, with fresh money. Up to 25% of the new budget will be fresh money and it will be a separate budget, funding those activities which have volunteers – not only young volunteers but also people who are seeking better opportunities on the labour market –with apprenticeships and, in the future, with better job offers, I hope. That is why I think we have to support the European Solidarity Corps’ activities in the future as well, because it simply does not endanger the existence of Erasmus+ and the funding of Erasmus+. Last, but not least, the European Student eCard. We are now working to put together three separate Erasmus+ funded projects: the European Student Card, the Erasmus Without Paper (EWP) and Emrex. We are trying to identify the synergies of these three projects and develop more comprehensive projects which make Erasmus+ students’ lives easier, bringing together the results of those three projects and developing a European Student Card in the future which can embrace all the achievements of these three projects.

We support this Agreement, Commissioner, but I ask you to commit to properly informing this Parliament of its implementation, and I also ask you to carry out an evaluation before the end of the implementation period and, if necessary, every three years thereafter. Regarding Croatia's accession to the current Association Agreement, I just want to point out that it responds to the ordinary adaptation procedure after a new accession, following the World Trade Organization procedure. Finally, I will refer to the most relevant report, the future modernization of the Association Agreement with Chile. It is true that the current Agreement has worked very well since its entry into force in 2003. However, its modernization is necessary because it is outdated, because it does not respond to the new demands of trade policy and because both parties have concluded more ambitious agreements with third countries. Without a doubt, the European Union-Chile trade relations framework cannot be left behind. The modernization of the Chile Agreement is also a great opportunity to implement a more ambitious trade policy favorable to sustainable development. We share the same principles and values. And in this report - which, by the way, has been approved by a very large majority in the Committee on International Trade, the largest ever achieved in a trade agreement in this legislature - what are the recommendations that this Parliament makes? First, we require more transparency and parliamentary and civil society participation, and we demand the immediate publication of the negotiating mandate as soon as it takes place. We call for ambitious improvements to market access, but protecting sensitive agricultural and industrial products and prioritizing the defense and well-being of people. We request the right and ability of the parties to regulate in favor of the general interest, including, of course, public services, and that this be explicitly and unequivocally ensured throughout the Agreement. We demand a modern investment policy, which must consider both the protection and the obligations of investors; preserve the right of governments to regulate; avoid unfounded litigation and, of course, replace the private arbitration system with a public, transparent and guarantee system that seeks the commitment of the parties to give priority to recourse to the competent courts while progressing in the creation of the multilateral investment court . And, of course, we demand an ambitious chapter of sustainable development with binding, enforceable provisions, subject to dispute resolution mechanisms and that considers the imposition of sanctions while promoting corporate social responsibility.We want firm commitments in the fight against tax evasion, against corruption and, of course, we ask for a specific chapter on SMEs and on something that I know you are firmly committed to, as is Chile, which is that, forFinally, the European Union will sign a trade agreement with a specific gender chapter.Therefore, I ask all the Members of this Parliament to support this report in a majority tomorrow and I ask the Commission and the Council to take these recommendations into account because they are good, they are necessary and because, furthermore, this Parliament will be the one who has to say itslast word.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 367, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Cecilia Malmström", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   miembro de la Comisión. – Señor presidente, quiero empezar por agradecer a la ponente, Inmaculada Rodríguez Piñero, así como a todos los otros ponentes de los otros grupos, por su trabajo, muy ambicioso, sobre estos tres informes que afectan a nuestras relaciones comerciales con Chile. Chile, together with Mexico, is our longest standing preferential partner in Latin America. It is a key ally in multilateral fora. We have had an association agreement in place since 2003. It has worked well and has allowed for substantial increase in our bilateral trade, but now that it is 2017, it is more than correct that we address what has happened during these years and that we modernise the agreement. This is why the Trade for All communication identified Chile as one of the countries with which we should aim to upgrade our trade relations. This initiative is framed by our strategy to promote openness, based on values and standards, and to build bridges with partners across the world – and not walls. We have here an opportunity to conclude an agreement of the highest calibre on all issues, including on matters reflecting shared societal values, trade and sustainable development, SMEs, anti—corruption and – as the rapporteur pointed out – for the first time in an EU agreement provisions on trade and gender, where Chile has done a lot of work already. This modernised agreement should allow the development of a more modern and effective working method and contribute to the creation and enhancement of the role of contact networks and people—to—people links between us and Chile. We have done our part in the Commission. You have done your part here in Parliament. In May, together with the High Representative, we adopted in the Commission a recommendation to start negotiating and recommended directives to modernise the agreement. These proposed texts are now under discussion in the Council, and on our side we are ready to start negotiations a soon as we receive the authorisation and the negotiating directives from the Council. In this context, we very much welcome your resolution. It is a highly valuable contribution and will give us a steer during the following negotiations. Regarding the Croatian Accession Protocol, this is another example of excellent cooperation and our good relations with Chile. Chile is one of the few trading partners that applied unilaterally the provisions and benefits of the Association Agreement to Croatia without waiting for the formal adoption of the Protocol. We are very grateful for Chile’s helpful attitude in this process and we look forward to receiving Parliament’s consent on the Accession Protocol. Finally, regarding the agreement on trade in organic products, by signing this agreement the European Union and Chile mutually recognise the equivalence of our respective organic production rules and control system in order to ensure a high level of respect for the principles of organic production. This agreement is broad in scope and will allow for products produced and controlled according to EU rules to be directly placed in the Chilean market and vice—versa. I would again like to thank the rapporteur and the Committee on International Trade for the excellent work they have done on all three of these files and particularly for the resolution on the modernisation of the agreement. It captures Parliament’s concerns well and we will carefully bear these in mind during the negotiation process.

I think she has done an excellent job and it is only fair to acknowledge it today in this debate. I want to convey the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture specifically on the Recommendation of the proposed Decision regarding the Agreement on trade in organic / organic products - which was approved by the majority in the Committee on Agriculture, where we are always somewhat more protectionist with our products, but that here gave majority support and I want to transfer it like that. It is an Agreement that, in addition, we see positively, because we are talking about ecological standards and they are the standards that we consider superior. Therefore, that this is specifically reflected in the first agreement of its kind signed by the European Union, I think it is a good thing and that is why it has been very positive in the Committee on Agriculture. The only thing that we would also have liked in the committee is that the Organic Agriculture Regulation, on which we have been working for three and a half years and which is still in the trilogue negotiations, would have also been ready now, but it has not been possible. That has nothing to do with the Agreement. And to say that we liked the incorporation of those amendments that ask for an initial evaluation to be carried out after the first two years of their application. They are good sensitivities for European agricultural productions.

You have heard me say many times that, in these agreements, the bill is usually paid by the agricultural sector. And so it usually is. In any case, I welcome the modernization of the trade pillar of this agreement, which has led to significant growth in bilateral trade. We have a privileged commercial relationship with Chile and that is globally very positive, and it should continue to be that way. Regarding the Agreement on trade in organic / organic products, I still have some doubts that our farmers have expressed. The European Union will recognize as equivalent products - and, on this occasion, I am not going to mention the banana as I usually do in defense of the Canarian banana - that are produced under different conditions. I am not going to get into environmental conditions, not even social standards, but I am concerned about the possible use of substances whose use is not allowed in the European Union. In any case, I want to congratulate the rapporteur. She has made an enormous effort to reach a majority agreement - I believe almost unanimous - and that is very positive.

The European Union can and must be a key regulator of the ongoing globalization process. We defend a European Union open to the world and not a European Union closed in old protectionisms, which are economically negative and politically unacceptable. This agreement with Chile is of the utmost importance. Chile is a partner and is a friend of the European Union. We have every reason to seek to encourage relations with the countries of Latin America. We share values, principles, references, models of political, economic and social organization with most countries in Latin America. We have very close relations with Chile, with whom we share, in a very evident way, these values, these principles and these models and, perhaps, for this reason, it was easier in this case to move towards the modernization of this trade agreement, integrating news as important as some that have already been mentioned here. I allow myself to highlight the one that has precisely to do with the issue of gender, which, for the first time, is now materialized in a commercial agreement. So it goes in the right direction. It is clear that trade agreements require commitments. A trade agreement, in essence, if it is well negotiated, is won, but there are always some gains and some losses. I believe that the ongoing process allows foreseeing a very favorable final resolution for the European Union. In conclusion, I would naturally like to welcome the rapporteur of this opinion or this report, this resolution, because it seems to me that, once again, she revealed with her intelligence and her commitment, her great dedication, what I know is a cause your which is precisely to promote relations with Latin America, in general, in this case we are talking about Chile, I hope that soon we can also modernize the agreement with Mexico and we can guarantee the implementation of a trade agreement with the Mercosur countries.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google"}, {"id": 371, "date": "2017-09-13.json", "name": "Dita Charanzová", "mepid": "124708", "text": "on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, in these times of increasing protectionism, the European Union should, now more than ever, persevere in its mission to promote a free trade agenda with like-minded partners, and I can think of few better examples than Chile. Chile and the European Union share many common values, including in the field of trade. Our shared vision has allowed both parties to take full advantage of the Association Agreement between the European Union and Chile. Since the Agreement entered into force in 2003, our trade has more than doubled. There is no doubt that the Association Agreement has brought us many opportunities and benefits for our companies and citizens, but this Agreement is now obsolete and it is now that we have to reflect today's reality. There are several elements of our trade that we can and must improve. It is very important to progress in the area of ​​services, for example, but also in others such as non-tariff barriers, sanitary and phytosanitary standards, access to public procurement, agricultural products and digital commerce. We should also introduce new individual chapters dedicated to topics important to our current trade. Specifically, chapters related to investment, intellectual property rights, energy and SMEs. It is time to move forward in our relations with Chile.

I think it is important to remember this, at a time when the attempts to destabilize progressive experiences in Latin America are far from having ceased. I sincerely want to thank the rapporteur for these reports, the Hon. Rodríguez-Piñero Fernández, because I believe it is important to recognize the elements of dialogue, efforts and listening skills in politics. So, I sincerely thank you, because I believe you have done an important job and, in particular, I thank you because I believe that, having included a chapter on gender for the first time in a resolution on a trade agreement, is really an element of novelty that I will not fail to underline in my report on the theme \"gender and commercial exchanges\", which is currently under discussion between the INTA and FEMM commissions. The reason why we will abstain on this report: I think that in this report there are important chapters on sustainable development, on social and environmental standards and on the fact that the possibility of introducing sanctions is finally considered if the standards are not respected . I believe that the sanction mechanism is a real step forward and I hope that the Commission will take these recommendations into consideration. But there is a red line for us, which is called the \"public judicial system for investments\", which we consider only a small modification of the old ISDS.

I am really looking forward to it. I am going to focus on just one aspect of the EU-Chile trade arrangements. Here I have just part of the existing EU-Chile Trade Agreement. This runs over 1 400 pages of densely written text. In all that text there is no clause – none – that requires the so-called free movement of people. It is also highly unlikely that the modernised Chile trade agreement which we are discussing now will have a free movement of people clause.  Further, the European Union has over 100 trade agreements. I make it 141, actually. Only two of those agreements – the EFTA and the EEA agreements – have a requirement for free movement of people.  Nevertheless, in the context of Brexit, so much of the media tells us that free movement is a precondition for any country having a free trade agreement with the EU, and this is simply untrue. Fake news is something that the EU crusades against. Free movement: the manipulation and denial of the facts concerning free movement of people in EU trade agreements, against the clear evidence, is fake news personified.

However, I would like to reiterate that a dispute with an investor must be resolved through due legal process. Courts decide on the basis of a constitution, while investment tribunals only use a trade agreement as a basis. My group cannot agree to agreements with special courts for investors. With a view to President Juncker's speech today, Mrs Malmström, I look forward to the publication of the draft negotiating mandate, which will certainly be followed by further discussions.

The Association Agreement with this country has allowed the development of an important commercial relationship that has resulted in a 100% increase in bilateral trade. Its future dynamism now also depends on the modernization of the Agreement, which dates, as I said before, fifteen years ago. I want to underline that, in many countries of the European Union, the export sector has been key to getting out of the crisis. Now, with a declining demographic, very limited levels of public spending and weak domestic demand, we Europeans need to continue turning to the outside, and for this I congratulate you, Commissioner, for this work of continuing to weave a commercial network more and more wide.
