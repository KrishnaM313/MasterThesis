I would point out to Members that there are no spontaneous speeches in this debate and that no blue cards are accepted.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2020-05-14.json", "name": "Nikolina Brnjac", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, I would like to begin by underlining that the rule of law plays a crucial role in all our democracies. As recalled by the European Union’s strategic agenda for 2019-2024, rule of law is a key guarantee that our common values are well protected and complied with. Croatia’s Presidency programme also puts the focus on further establishing the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, founded on common values, democracy and rule of law.  This is even more essential in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unprecedented circumstances have led many Member States to adopt far-reaching measures, which have been key to acting rapidly and effectively to protect the public health of citizens.  However, some of the measures do have a significant impact on fundamental rights, democracy and the rule of law. It is therefore essential that they are necessary, that they are proportionate to the objective, limited in time, subject to regular scrutiny and respects fundamental rights and the rule of law.  The European Commission President reaffirmed these principles in a statement on 31 March, and they were subsequently supported in statements by a significant number of states.  The Article 7 procedure, concerning Hungary, was on the agenda of the General Affairs Council of 25 March 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 emergency, that meeting had to be cancelled. Unfortunately, this is not over for the time being, and it is not possible to hold formal Council meetings. Instead, informal meetings of ministers are arranged through videoconference calls to allow the exchange of information and to discuss urgent information.  The Croatian Presidency believes it is important to facilitate the dialogue and exchange of best practices. In that regard, we organised an informal videoconference of ministers of justice on 6 April 2020, which addressed the impact of extraordinary measures on our justice system. Support was expressed by the Commission’s initiative to monitor the extraordinary measures and their application across the Union on an equal basis for all Member States.  We are well aware of the European Parliament’s resolution of 17 April 2020, which also echoed these essential elements. On 22 April, emergency measures adopted during the COVID-19 crisis were discussed at an informal meeting through a videoconference of European Affairs Ministers. Once more, a broad majority of Member States supported that approach that I’ve just highlighted.  The European Commission is closely monitoring the measures adopted by the Member States, including Hungary, and their compatibility with all the mentioned principles. We welcome the Commission’s extensive and continued monitoring of the application of emergency measures adopted by all Member States.  We are also confident that all governments will withdraw emergency measures as soon as positive developments in the COVID-19 pandemic makes this possible.  We trust that all Hungarian institutions will fully and rapidly cooperate with the EU institutions, and we all have a joint responsibility to ensure that the rule of law and fundamental rights remain the cornerstones of our common project. This is even more true during these difficult times if the Union is to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis even stronger.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2020-05-14.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, in these challenging times, the Commission stands in solidarity with all the citizens of Europe and fully supports all the Member States in their fight against the pandemic. As President von der Leyen said, we need to ensure that Europe does everything it can to save every life it can. At the same time, the Commission has made clear from the outset that the response to this crisis must fully respect our fundamental principles and values as set out in our treaties. The commitment of all EU institutions and Member States to upholding the rule of law and fundamental rights is essential. Emergency measures adopted and implemented by Member States must be limited to what is necessary and strictly proportionate. They must not last indefinitely. Moreover, governments must make sure that such measures are subject to regular scrutiny, fully respecting democratic checks and balances. The emergency measures cannot mean switching off constitutions or EU law. This is why the Commission is proactively monitoring the emergency measures for all Member States, including Hungary. We are looking in particular at how the emergency measures are being used in practice and what their impact is, in particular on the rule of law, on fundamental rights and on EU law. Firstly, as regards the impact on the rule of law, situations which require close attention are those where the state of emergency does not have a predefined duration, where its duration is considerably long, where parliaments do not have the possibility to terminate such state of emergency, where the powers granted to the government are open—ended or where judicial review or other national checks and balances are restricted. Secondly, the impact on fundamental rights. The angle here is to closely scrutinise the impact of limitations in practice, whether the standards imposed by international obligations and relevant guidance are being maintained, and what limitations might go beyond what is strictly proportionate. And thirdly, the impact on EU law. We are checking whether the measures adopted under the emergency arrangements comply with EU law or whether they lead to possible disapplication of national laws implementing EU law. As stressed by Commission President von der Leyen in her letter of 7 April to President Sassoli in this context, the case of Hungary raises particular concerns. In the case of Hungary, the emergency powers granted appear more extensive than in other Member States, considering the combined effect of broadly defined powers and the absence of a clear time limit. The criminalisation of stating or spreading false information related to the crisis is not clearly defined and is accompanied by strict sanctions. This raises potential concerns as regards legal certainty and may have a chilling effect on freedom of expression. These particular concerns come in a well—known context in Hungary as regards rule of law and respect for EU values. The Commission is, therefore, monitoring very closely the use of emergency powers in Hungary. Allow me to be more specific as regards the situation of media. Now it is more important than ever to pursue measures that are effective in curbing the spread of disinformation but do not limit free speech. The fight against disinformation should not and may not reduce our democratic values, including the possibility to have a fair democratic debate where different voices can be heard. In Hungary, the environment in which media and journalists operate has been deteriorating for a number of years. Organisations and associations representing civil society and journalists have been sounding warnings about the situation. These warnings grew louder following the adoption by Hungary of the provision criminalising the spreading of disinformation relating to COVID—19. Especially in moments like this, we need reliable journalism, employing professional standards to provide accurate information and to scrutinise the measures taken in response to the global health threat. Journalists should be able to work freely, have access to information, ask questions. Their job is to hold us politicians to account for our actions. In the EU, we are now entering a new phase where certain measures taken to protect public health will be gradually relaxed. This new phase means that the general states of emergency, with exceptional powers granted to governments, should gradually be removed or replaced by more targeted and less intrusive measures. For that reason, the Commission will be very vigilant on how emergency measures, which affect the rule of law, fundamental rights and democratic values, are phased out in the Member States. This is even more important for Hungary, given the lack of a clear time limit for the state of danger. I expect, first of all, that the Hungarian people will be the ones who will want to return to enjoying their rights in full. I also expect the Hungarian national parliament to exercise its scrutiny role. Civil society, free and independent media, regular scrutiny and national checks and balances are essential for overseeing the government’s exercise of power. We can only face up to the challenges stemming from this crisis by bringing our societies and democracies together in a spirit of understanding and good cooperation. The Commission is considering how to reflect as relevant the situation of the emergency measures in Member States in upcoming policy documents such as the rule of law report, the European democracy action plan and the renewed fundamental rights strategy, all due for adoption by the end of this year. Honourable Members, I look forward to hearing your views on this matter.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2020-05-14.json", "name": "Der Präsident. –", "mepid": "2323", "text": "  I would like to repeat the President's point yesterday that there is also a mask requirement here in plenary and that you can remove the mask for your speaking time.

Madam Vice-President, dear colleagues, At the end of the coronavirus situation, it is clear: now is the time to stand truly united in preserving people's health and boosting the economy. This is where real European cooperation is needed to ensure that Europe can remain relevant on the global stage. This is what the European Parliament should be assisting in the first place. But it seems that there are factions on the left that simply cannot afford not to attack Hungary again and again on a monthly basis. It is much easier to organise empty ideological debates than to talk about the substance and the facts and deal with what actually affects and interests people in the Member States. That is why we are Hungary on the agenda today in a debate where the organisers knew in advance that ninety per cent of MEPs could not attend and express their views. The Participation of the Hungarian Government was not facilitated by the President of the European Parliament, despite the fact that the rules of procedure did not prevent it, and online participation was completely excluded, while the leaders of the Socialist and Liberal factions were allowed to speak on the screens during the April plenary session. Why is this not possible for the Hungarian Government now? And the Commission has not found any infringements of the Empowerment Act, so for me this debate simply evokes a time of mockery of European values and fundamental legal principles and of old concept trials.

Ladies and gentlemen, this is an unprecedented fact: that a country of the European Union is no longer a complete democracy. Sadly, in 2005, this same NGO placed Hungary as one of Europe's most promising new democracies. And, despite the seriousness, the Union has not taken concrete measures to sanction the Government of Orbán for its actions. And so he, because he is growing in an endless escalation to centralize power, interfere in the electoral system, control the media, education, culture, harass organized civil society. Ladies and gentlemen, this is disgraceful: an attack on the fundamental values of our Union and a devastating attack on our international reputation. Moreover, during the pandemic, cases of gender-based violence have increased alarmingly in Hungary and, far from helping, Fidesz makes a statement in Parliament not to ratify the Istanbul Convention, so that stalkers, so that those who are exercising such violence are not punished. This can't go on like this. What is the Council waiting for? What does the Commission expect? It's time to wake up and react against what's going on. We have built this Union to preserve democracy, to preserve fundamental values, and it is totally unacceptable that this is happening. Ladies and gentlemen, silence is complicity and I therefore urge the Council to start talks immediately to activate Article 7 of the ESO.  Finally, I also urge our colleagues in the European People's Party to stop protecting Orbán and to expel Fidesz from his political family. How many letters, how many more excuses do you need to receive from Orbán to see that he's making fun of you? He's making fun of you! And don't get confused: we don't attack Hungary, we attack those who are making democracy disappear in a European country. Keep in mind that these friendships don't suit you at all.

It is literally about Hungary’s exit, in law, from the European Union and from European values. It is happening right now. This is not only my opinion, it is the opinion of 57% of Hungarian citizens, who in a recent poll said that what Orbán is doing is finishing off basically what he started. Mr Orbán should have been here in the room to answer some questions today, but he said he was busy fighting the pandemic.  Well, may I ask him, what is the connection between pandemics and rejection of the Istanbul Convention? Does violence against women help him fight pandemics? Are there any special fighting tactics that we have to learn? What is the connection between this and the indefinite state of emergency and fully silencing civil society and the independent media and criminalising independent journalists. And how about arresting people? How is he fighting the pandemic by arresting people who criticise the Hungarian Government?  I’m really sorry, Commissioner and dear colleagues, but this government should not receive one single cent, not one penny, from the EU, any longer – not today, not in the future MFF, not ever – until they follow rules and values.

They enrage and shudder, so they impose, once again, on us yet another debate in the midst of a health crisis, yet another debate on Hungary, which will be just as sterile, just as useless, just as inoperative as the previous ones. The state of danger provided for by the Constitution is implemented, in a similar form, in other European countries, it has been approved by the Hungarian parliament, no abuses have been found.

But one government, and only one, in Hungary, has framed its state of urgency with no ‘sunset’ clause. Today, in Hungary, the government has extensive powers with no clear definition and for an indefinite time. Let us not be mistaken. This has no necessity efficiency-wise. This has no sanitary basis.

We know that since his election in 2010, the European left has been constantly attacking Viktor Orban. Since then, Hungarian citizens have voted in seven national elections in confidence in him and fidesz. It is clear, then, that elections cannot be won by a witch hunt in Brussels. However, with debates that turn out to be false attacks, the European Parliament is losing its own credibility to citizens. Or let us have an hour-long debate on the rule of law for all Member States.

Refusing cries for dignity, a private life, to live free from discrimination and violence is refusing fundamental human rights and another backward step in democracy in Hungary.

We are speaking here about the emergency regime in Hungary and I think that it’s very important that the Commission is monitoring the emergency measures taken in Hungary, but also in all the other Member States.  We live in very challenging times, we live in an extraordinary situation which requires extraordinary and special measures to be taken. When we look at the extraordinary measures and the emergency regimes, we have to – and I’ve also repeated what I said at the beginning – look into how the regime is applied, and here there are very clear requirements that measures must be – only to the extent necessary – relevant for the solution or tackling the Corona crisis, proportionate measures and also time a limit. And the time limit is something where we have the biggest concerns regarding the Hungarian regime. The Commission is monitoring the situation in all states, but in the case of Hungary I can reveal to you today that I have daily reports. I have weekly reports from our permanent representations, but I am following very closely the Hungarian situation daily reports. I am very well informed about the cases now of two people who were detained in relation to the spread of so-called fake news. I am informed about the actions taken by the government in relation to self-government and so on.  On a daily basis we are assessing whether we can take legal action. And I said before, and I will repeat it here: we are not opening infringement proceedings on Hungary yet. We are closely monitoring all the measures, and we also have to take into consideration that in our toolbox is also Article 7 and that the debate in the Council is ongoing and I am sure we will come back to it when the Council holds the General Affairs Council session.  But on concrete measures, because we said that we are monitoring all the concrete measures taken under the emergency regime, I would like to be more concrete here to give you some examples. The Commission’s attention has been drawn to certain degrees which allow employers and employees to agree bilaterally to derogate from almost all provisions of the Hungarian labour code. As the labour code transposes several EU directives the Commission is currently analysing these measures as regards their compatibility with EU labour and social law. Also, the Commission is examining several decrees as regards their compatibility with the General Data Protection Regulation. Just these two examples of the concrete focus of the Commission in these days. And indeed, many of you mentioned here that there should be EU money should be provisional on the distribution conditioned by the basic principles of the rule of law in the countries. Well, when I came with this idea in 2017, it created a lot of noise, people said ‘we cannot go that far’. I think now, with the situation developing in a wrong direction in a couple of states, we see that making money conditional on compliance with the basic principles set out in Article 2 of the Treaty is the proper thing to do. Today, the Commission will have the debate about the Multiannual Financial Framework, about the budget for the next seven years. I will emphasise again and again in every fora at which I have a chance to speak about the new budget, that the conditionality has to be maintained and that the system of voting about the concrete cases must not be voted down. And I am happy that this is still in the negotiating box of the budget and it has to remain there and it has to keep its teeth because the Commission proposed something which might really create or bring about some real difference.  We have now the joint European roadmap towards lifting COVID-19 containment measures after 15 April and we underlined that the general state of emergency is exceptional emergency powers for governments should be progressively replaced by more targeted interventions in line with constitutional arrangements of each country. So this is what we expect Hungary to do, to go along with the rest of the other Member States and to release the confinement measures and to come back to what I already called before ‘old normal’, or at least the old normal. And again, the context relating to Hungary is that this is the country which is under the Article 7 procedure.  So we must build our new steps and next steps on the basis of common values. We must come back to normal checks and balances and the citizens must benefit fully from their rights.  If I can have a little bit longer I would like to add something a little bit personal and I will speak Czech. I remember very well the time – I said I would speak Czech ... you see, after six years of being here it’s deformation... Velmi dobře si pamatuju dobu, kdy bylo Československo okupovanou zemí od roku devatenáct set šedesát osm. Okupace a totalitní režim nás všechny velice ovlivnil. Žili jsme ve strachu a snili jsme o tom, že jednoho dne budeme žít ve svobodné společnosti, že jednoho dne přijde ke slovu a bude uskutečněna naše touha po svobodě, touha po aktivním občanství, že budeme mít možnost svobody slova, že budeme mít fungující samosprávy, které budou dostatečně finančně vybaveny, aby dělaly kvalitní veřejnou službu, že budeme mít svobodné volby, které zajistí střídání lidí u moci, že budeme mít mocné, ale ne všemocné, že nikdo nebude v té naší krásné zemi nad zákonem, že budeme mít otevřené hranice, že si budeme užívat otevřenosti, svobody a občanského sebevědomí. Dámy a pánové, dnes jsme okupováni koronavirem a mnoho státníků Evropské unie řeklo, že v této době je nezbytné omezení některých svobod a že se budeme muset smířit s tím, že po velice krátkou limitovanou dobu, po dobu nezbytnou, budeme muset tato omezení snést. Zároveň státníci řekli jasně lidem, že mohou očekávat návrat ke všem těm úžasným věcem, které jsem tady před chvílí vyjmenovala, těm věcem, o kterých jsme snili v totalitním Československu. Já tomu věřím, že se to stane. Věřím tomu, že v zemích, kde jsou pochybnosti – a dnes se bavíme o Maďarsku –, že i občané Maďarska budou toužit po tom, aby se Maďarsko vrátilo k demokratickým principům a že se toho dočkáme minimálně teď, po skončení té koronavirové okupace, ale že budeme muset dál s Maďarskem vést dialog, že bude muset Komise dělat svou práci a reagovat právním způsobem podle pravidel, pokud k tomu budou všechny právní podmínky, že bude muset i mezinárodní společenství vyvíjet tlak na Maďarsko, aby se vrátilo do klubu bezpochybně demokratických zemí. Přála bych si to, protože tady není v sázce jenom situace v Maďarsku, ale je to vlastně velká výzva pro celou Evropskou unii. Děkuji Vám i za tu možnost, že jsem mohla tady říct trošku ze svých osobních vzpomínek.

The Croatian Presidency recognises the crucial role that rule of law plays in all our democracies. It is a key guarantee that our common values are protected and a joint responsibility of Member States and all EU institutions. This is no less important when facing the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic where unprecedented circumstances led many Member States to adopt far-reaching measures in order to rapidly and effectively curb the spread of the virus. Member States have already given broad support to the Commission’s initiative to monitor the extraordinary measures and their application across the Union on an equal basis for all Member States. Similar efforts, based on equality of approach and monitoring developments across the Union, are underway by different European institutions, the Fundamental Rights Agency, but also the Council of Europe. Furthermore, the Commission is in the process of preparing the first annual report on the rule of law in the Union, to be published later this year, focusing on several rule of law areas. During the Croatian Presidency, this process remains in the preparatory phase. The Commission is leading the work and the Member States are involved in all the process. I mentioned earlier that Article 7 procedures concerning Poland and Hungary were on the agenda of the General Affairs Council on 25 March. However, due to the COVID-19 emergency, that meeting had to be cancelled. Unfortunately, the emergency is not over and for the time being, it is not possible to hold a formal Council meeting. As we already mentioned, on 6 and 22 April, emergency measures adopted in response to the COVID-19 crisis were discussed at informal video meetings by ministers of justice and European affairs. The ministers exchanged views on national and EU measures taken so far in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, including their duration, scope and effectiveness, as well as the impact of emergency measures on fundamental rights and the rule of law. Ministers shared their experience and best practices in the overall context of a collective EU response. The Council remains seized of the Article 7 procedures and the Croatian Presidency is ready to continue proceeding at the General Affairs Council as soon as the situation allows us to convene formal Council meetings. We continue to follow all developments closely.

In recent weeks, there has been a further serious deterioration in respect for the rule of law and the full functioning of democracy in Hungary. First, Orbán's decision to approve emergency measures that completely nullify parliament's role for an indefinite period of time and allow his government to govern by decree. Then there is the restriction on the freedom of the press, given that the government that has imposed severe and totally disproportionate sentences - such as imprisonment - on those accused of spreading misinformation, as denounced by various members of the press and opposition.

Since April 10, the Hungarian Government has begun introducing legislation aimed at limiting the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the national economy and labour market. Thus, for example, special economic zones, where there are investments most important for the national economy, were excluded from the board of local governments and subordinated to the state administration with the acquisition of paid taxes. These decisions were preceded by the introduction on 30th March of decrees suspending certain legal acts prohibiting supplementary elections and referendums, increasing penalties for breaching a quarantine order or disseminating false information about a pandemic.  The Hungarian government's actions enabled production to resume as early as April by the largest production plants, m.in. by Audi, Mercedes, Opel and Suzuki factories. Thanks to swift and firm government action, not only has the size of the economy's losses been reduced and stopped, but the number of infected in Hungary remains lower than, for example, the Czech Republic or Austria (five times smaller).

There's plenty of it. In recent days, for example, \"scaremongering\" has caused more people to be arrested by police for criticising the government's handling of the epidemic on their social media pages.  Fidesz's immorality is also demonstrated by the way it uses the epidemic to take down opposition mayors: a proposal was recently submitted, citing the emergency, which takes tax revenues and powers from the government-selected (opposition) municipalities and gives it to the Fidesz-led county governments. It is ignominious that even this epidemic situation is being used by the Hungarian Government for political vengeance and looting.

Societies in which these principles have already been wiped off the floor in the past are in danger of falling deeper and deeper into a spiral of authoritarianism. When you go deep enough in such a spiral, it is very difficult to get out of there anymore. Hungary is now very close to this border and its democracy is close to disintegration. As for Hungary, my concern relates not only to state of emergency legislation, but to the longer development of the country. In Hungary, the Orbán Government has systematically reduced the room for manoeuvre of the media, civil society and science, concentrating power on itself in a way that does not follow the rules of the game of a democratic society. The situation in Hungary has been woken up far too late in Europe. Those following the rule of law developments in different countries have been warning of developments in Hungary since the early 2010s, when Fidesz was planning the first major changes to its country's institutional structure. The situation has only been taken seriously when major damage has already been done. It is clear that, at the latest, all the measures that have previously been considered too difficult must be fully implemented. The Article 7 procedure must be speeded up and Hungary must be put in a situation where its right to vote in the Council is under threat. More importantly, the EU's money taps will be cut.

Today, we are faced with heart—breaking numbers: more than 100 000 people have died in the European Union. Let me from the outset express my sympathy with those who have lost their loved ones and my gratitude to the essential workers in hospitals and care homes, but also in shops, transportation and public services. Moreover, millions of citizens have faced unprecedented restrictions aimed at containing the spread of the virus. The pandemic is putting our societies under serious strain. But the crisis has shown that, with the right synergy and close cooperation between Member States and EU institutions in the spirit of the Schuman Declaration, we can provide efficient and effective solutions. The Commission and the ECB took exceptional steps. The Parliament and the Council adopted, without delay, emergency packages of legislation. The European Council has given overall direction. I will not go into details on the EU response. Let me just say that work continues with a sense of urgency and a determination. As Prime Minister Plenković said on Saturday, from the start of our Presidency, we have been dealing with complex and important issues for the future of Europe: from ensuring an orderly Brexit and agreeing on a mandate for negotiation with the United Kingdom to negotiation of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) package, discussions about the Green Deal and with a strong emphasis on enlargement policy and our strategic relations with the Western Balkans. The negotiations on the MFF for the period 2021—2027 will now intensify with a new approach in the changed circumstances. Of course, the COVID—19 pandemic poses an unprecedented and unexpected challenge for all of us, as well as unprecedented administrative and logistical challenges for our Presidency. We’ve had to react quickly and find solutions to be able to ensure continuity of decision—making and make sure that the Union can act. Within the Council, we have ensured effective discussions and rapid agreements on a number of European regulations and guidelines for more flexible use of European funds, easier procurement and production of medical equipment, and assuring the flow of goods across borders as well as the transport corridors. In addition, we have facilitated the repatriation of all European citizens from third countries, enabled coordinated monitoring of the development of the epidemiological situation and facilitated the decisions on reducing restrictions at a national level, which should also lead to a revival of tourism and business activities. Our response to the crisis is comprehensive and strong in order to preserve jobs, entrepreneurship and ensure a rapid and effective recovery while strengthening the solidarity and resilience of all Member States and our neighbours. Furthermore, I would like to highlight our work on enlargement; first with the new methodology, then with the Council decision to open negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia. I would also like to highlight the recent EU—Western Balkans Zagreb Summit and the adoption of the Zagreb Declaration, which reaffirms and consolidates a clear European perspective and future of our Western Balkan partners. It is a situation where the European Union is facing the greatest challenges since the World War 2. The Conference on the Future of Europe can serve as an important framework for reflection, open debate and a vision of our common European future in a dialogue between all Member States, European institutions and with full involvement of our citizens and other stakeholders. The Presidency will spare no efforts in working to reach a consensus in the Council as soon as possible and in securing an agreement with the other European institutions on the timing and manner of launching this conference, which is important for the long—term future of Europe. ‘World peace cannot be safeguarded without the making of creative efforts proportionate to the dangers which threaten it’, said Robert Schuman in the opening words of his Declaration 70 years ago. Today, the context is obviously different, but the dangers are no less real and deserve creative efforts proportionate to them. The motto of the Croatian Presidency: ‘a strong Europe in a world of challenges’ applies today even more than on the first day of our Presidency. I have travelled from Zagreb to this plenary for almost 10 hours to underline our Presidency’s determination to continue working closely with the European Parliament. Indeed, it is my firm belief and we remain united in solidarity, we can emerge from this crisis together.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 56, "date": "2020-05-14.json", "name": "Maroš Šefčovič", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, 75 years ago, the guns of the Second World War in Europe fell silent. The Nazi regime was defeated, but Europe lay in ruins. Just five years later, on 9 May 1950, Robert Schuman made a declaration that would profoundly change this continent and would put it on a path that no one could have anticipated. For me, this is a very special moment. Seventy years ago, Robert Schuman started a journey, step by step. He showed us the way and the direction. And today, here we are. Just seven days ago, at the EU—Western Balkans Summit, we laid the ground for reuniting the Western Balkans with our union, reuniting Europe’s history with its geography. Yes, today, our union faces its greatest challenge yet: a pandemic that knows no borders, a pandemic that threatens our lives and our way of life, a pandemic that has tested our union to its core. But, as so often in history, this crisis has also shown Europe’s greatest strengths: our commitment to unity, born of common values and shared history, and our solidarity with those in need. Schuman’s words resonate today more strongly than ever before: ‘it is no longer a time for vain words, but for a bold, constructive act’. The Schuman Declaration embodied the perfect balance, the delicate dance between idealism and pragmatism, without which there would be no European Union and no European solidarity as we know it today. He famously said, ‘Europe will not be made all at once according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity.’ This crisis has put that solidarity to the hardest of tests. In March, some even said that we would not pass these tests. But, if you look around the world today, Europe has become the beating heart of solidarity: French patients treated in German hospitals, Polish doctors and Romanian nurses working in Italy, and a huge recovery plan is in the making. The world is watching. Our European model will only mean something to the world if we show solidarity within our union’s borders, to each other, and beyond, with our partners globally.  Since the pandemic began, the European Union has been working on all fronts to contain the spread of the coronavirus, support health systems, protect and save lives, and counter the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic, with historically unprecedented measures at both national and EU level. The Commission will directly support the healthcare systems of EU countries with EUR 3 billion from the EU budget, matched with EUR 3 billion from the Member States to fund the Emergency Support Instrument and the rescEU common stockpile of equipment. The rescEU initiative helps secure vital equipment, from ventilators to personal protective equipment, and to mobilise medical teams for assistance to the most vulnerable, including in refugee camps. The first hosting state of this stockpile is Romania.  The production of the first ventilators has started, and some 330 000 protective masks were delivered to Spain, Italy and Croatia in the past weeks. Since the beginning of the outbreak, thanks to the EU Civil Protection Mechanism and consular protection coordination, the European Union has brought home over half a million citizens stranded all over the world. Thanks to the Emergency Support Instrument, the European Union has procured another 10 million masks, the first 1.5 million of which have already been delivered to 17 Member States.  I want to thank this House for having launched the ‘Europeans Against COVID—19’ campaign. This Europe Day, the Commission and the Council joined forces with you, and we all pay tribute to those who are making history today, the everyday heroes fighting the coronavirus in our hospitals, in research labs, or by delivering personal protective equipment to those in need, because we know that coronavirus knows no borders.  Tackling this pandemic is a global challenge and the EU is leading the global effort to develop and deploy effective diagnostics, treatments and a vaccine. Without this tool, every country in the world remains vulnerable. Countries and international organisations are joining forces to develop these tools and put the structures in place that ensure they are universally available and affordable. How wealthy a country is should not determine whether its people get to live without this virus.  That is why President von der Leyen launched an international pledging marathon on 4 May. So far, we have raised EUR 7.4 billion, and this includes a pledge of EUR 1.4 billion from the Commission. But we know that more is needed and I am confident it will come. The crisis gives us an opportunity to lead by example and to reach for our highest aspirations, even when, in the short term, it might be easier to give in to our lowest instincts.  We will be remembered tomorrow for how we act today. Therefore, this crisis forces us to reflect. The pandemic will have a lasting effect, not just on the global system, but also on our daily lives. It is vital that on our path to recovery, we reach out, engage and listen to citizens, at European, national, regional and local level.  The Conference on the Future of Europe is an ideal forum for that and should commence as soon as conditions allow it. The Conference, as a pan—European democratic exercise, can reinforce the link between European citizens and the institutions. It can help rebuild trust and solidarity, even in the new coronavirus reality. The context might have changed, but our determination has not. We want the Conference on the Future of Europe to give citizens a greater say in shaping future EU policies, and we want this to be a joint exercise, involving the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on an equal footing. That is also why any decision on when to launch the Conference must be a joint one taken by all three institutions. Given the circumstances, my colleague and friend, Vice—President Šuica, who is leading the Commission’s efforts on the Conference, is following this debate remotely from Croatia. She is very much looking forward to joining the debates in this House in a physical mode as soon as possible. In order to be ready for the launch of the Conference under the containment measures scenario, the Commission is exploring digital solutions to enable us to host virtual debates and dialogues. We are working on a multilingual digital platform, allowing citizens to share their results and promote interactive ways for public engagement as part of the Conference. Such a digital platform would be open to all EU institutions. But a digital solution alone cannot reach everyone and cannot compensate for the real deal: face—to—face town hall discussions and workshops across the continent, reaching people from all walks of life. To protect the health of our citizens, we need to be patient and plan accordingly, step by step. Once the Council has adopted its mandate, we will get there. I am confident that the next step, the joint declaration by the Parliament, the Commission and the Council, which is necessary to launch the Conference, is within reach.  A little more than 30 years ago, I was looking through the barbed wire of the infamous Iron Curtain to Austria. This fence was just two kilometres from our apartment and I passed it every single day. I could see the people, the houses and the lights on the other side of the Danube, but I was told by my father that I would never be able to cross the border. Therefore, for me, the Schuman Declaration celebration is also a celebration of the European dream and freedom. I am sure that Robert Schuman would be proud today of how much we have accomplished. But I am also convinced that he would push us higher and further. Therefore, let’s respond to his inspiration by building an even fairer, greener, freer and stronger Europe.

Our parents understood that either Europe was built, or dictatorship and war would return. Europe or war. The idea is so simple that Robert Schuman only needed 868 words to explain it. And it should be remembered today because, like a hundred years ago, nationalism has once again taken root in the hearts of Europeans. Nationalism is the coronavirus that infects our politics.  It is nationalist to give twenty-seven different national responses to a single pandemic. It is nationalist not to approve the criteria by which they are infected, killed or cured to have a better national position in the ranking of countries. It is nationalist to close borders without coordination. It is nationalist to insolidate with masks, medicines, hospital places or financial aid, It is nationalist to reach the European Council with the intention of taking as much money as possible. It is nationalist to value national successes for how long it took me to my country and not how much we get all the countries together. It is nationalist that for the recovery plan no prime minister is contemplating the European economy as a whole.  Aren't there any more European leaders left in Europe? Let's stop facing north and south and east and west just to get votes in our respective countries. If we sow tares among Europeans, we will collect discord among Europeans.

Let us once and for all share our national selfishness, our filias and our phobias. Let us abandon the \"I\" and the \"mine\" to think of the \"we\" and \"ours\".

Mr. Beck, make no mistake. I think I speak for all of them: if they're not here, it's not on a whim. They are saving lives, they are meeting the standards set by different national governments. I understand that the far right is not very used to this, but really Members who are not here do so in a responsible way, because they take into account that it is necessary to stop this virus among all. This May 9th, the Schuman Declaration was seventy years old. With this declaration and from the ashes of World War II the path of peace, freedom and solidarity of the European Union that we know today began. In these seventy years, Europe has given peace and prosperity to its citizens and has grown to twenty-seven countries. Despite the pitfalls that have appeared on this journey, the Union has always been strengthened, and today we can proudly vindicate our motto of 'United in Diversity'. In building the common European project, the Socialists and Democrats are proud of our contribution so that the Union was not just a common market. It was with Jacques Delors, in 1989, that the social dimension was introduced with the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, and it has been our goal, ever since, to build a community and not just a market. And it will continue to be.  Unfortunately, this year we celebrate a different May 9th, with the mourning for those who have died from this crisis and coming out of our lockdowns in the face of a future full of uncertainties.  As president of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, but also as a European citizen, I am convinced that we will come out of this crisis stronger. On this anniversary, our political family wants to demand a courageous way out of this crisis, and we really need the unity of all European Democrats.  Before the crisis, the Union had set up a European conference to rethink its future, and now we must also include recovery.  Let it be the conference for the recovery and the future of Europe, because it will be visible. And it will be important for this discussion to set political priorities by listening to citizenship, civil society; that this conference does not stay exclusively in the Brussels bubble, that we can open up and listen to those who have things to say to us.  Ladies and gentlemen, the European project has always been a project for the future and has not succumbed to pessimism. As Jean Monnet thought, every crisis is an opportunity to take a step forward. On this seventyth anniversary, let us turn this crisis into an opportunity ⸺with the memory of those who are not⸺ to renew the European Union by making it stronger, fairer and more supportive.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 59, "date": "2020-05-14.json", "name": "Pascal Durand", "mepid": "124693", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew Group.

They understood at the time that we would not be able to rebuild the necessary Europe without enshrining it in cooperation, peace, democracy and solidarity. Without solidarity between peoples and between states, they said, there will be no sustainable future for Europe. So, seventy years later, where are we? We are not starting from scratch, we have managed to build an extremely powerful economy, a market, free movement for people and goods. We have succeeded in securing democracy and integrating the countries that were on the other side of the wall. This is a step forward that we cannot deny. But that is not enough, it is no longer enough. We need to become a great political power. We need to consolidate our democracy. For this, we need, as you have reminded us, Mr 'Ef-ovi', of course, we need to succeed in this conference for the future of Europe. We need to move our democracy with citizens. We also need to put an end to the stupid rule of unanimity that blocks any evolution. We need to speak with one voice. We need models that go beyond the interests of each member country to bring a general European interest. Yes, we must live up to the challenges of the twenty-first century, define the new rules of a community based on cooperation, on trade and new rules, on fair exchange, on peace, the environment and social. I must say that without this ability to build, without this ability to cooperate, without getting out of this tax competition that enriches some and impoverishes others, we will not succeed.

It marked the beginning of the german-French reconciliation, the beginning of the European peace project, which has continued to this day. He provided for peace and prosperity through economic cooperation. That was wise, and it worked – to this day. For decades, this has become the EU's internal market today.  So far, so good, so successful. At that time, there was no provision for the abolition of national sovereignty. There were no plans to dissolve France, Germany and other states in an art entity called the United States of Europe. That would not have been wise, and it is not today. Nevertheless, armies of today's politicians are also pursuing this project in this House, thereby producing the stark opposite of what Schuman intends: divergence instead of convergence, aggression instead of peace, disintegration instead of cooperation.

Lasting peace on a warring continent is a paramount achievement. But still, our Union has come even further, has been even more successful by working together. We expanded to overcome big parts of the Iron Curtain division and integrated in an ever closer Union to the benefit of the people living within. Crises, like the one we are crossing today, prove how much we have come to take for granted all the achievements of our Union. Just think about the freedom of movement.  However, it is hardly the time to pat ourselves on the back. The world today is very different from that of Schuman. We have digitalisation, globalisation, a growing nationalism, climate change. All those have fundamentally affected our realities, and the COVID-19 crisis today leaves millions without jobs, a stable income or future perspectives.  Today, our Union needs an immense leap forward. Europe needs again a Schuman-type future-proof solution oriented action. So what can this leap forward be? First of all, it should be a people and planet centred recovery from the multiple crises that Europe is currently facing – the social inequalities, the climate and biodiversity crises, the public health crisis. It is high time we used all the instruments at our disposal to create the most ambitious social, economic and environmental transformation the world has ever seen, and this must ensure that no one is left behind.  Secondly, this leap forward must re-anchor our European Union in the respect of citizens’ rights, democracy and fundamental rights, because these have too often been sidelined in recent years.  Thirdly, a strong and future-proofed Union must also look beyond its immediate borders. Our Union must always offer shelter to those seeking protection. It must be open to countries that want to join and meet our rules.  We are living through challenging times for our Union. We must now prove that we can live up to those challenges.

The great advocate of this idea is Mr Verhofstadt, who unfortunately is not here now, but we found a booklet of his from the past, at least ten years ago, in which he advocates a European empire. He's talking about a New Age of Empires. You have a Russian empire, a Chinese empire, an American empire, and now you have to add a European empire, a European Empire. Well, we, the European Conservatives and Reformists, want to go in a different direction, namely a community of sovereign European states, with a common market for trade and industry, for example. No centralization like this, no bureaucracy. We do want flexibility and let each country decide for itself which currency it wants. We also want respect for the constitutions of the various countries and a modest budget for emergency aid.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is always ready to romanticize its own history, but rarely to learn from it. Taking seriously the exercise of memory that is proposed to us today would, however, allow us to learn from past policies in the face of exceptional circumstances. To cope with crises, states often taxed the wealthy: a tax on war-profit enterprises in France in 1916, an exceptional contribution from the great fortunes in 1945 in Germany.  The current level of inequality and fiscal injustice is not the natural course of events. As we now face one of the worst crises in our history, how can we not put those who continue to get disproportionately rich back? Today, those who benefit from coronavirus are called Amazon, Netflix, Carrefour or Sanofi. Let us tax their exceptional profits rather than making the peoples of Europe pay for the crisis. History also shows us that paying down an unsustainable debt cannot be the horizon of a people. This is why more than half of the war debt of the Federal Republic of Germany was erased in 1953. Greece should have received the same treatment from the European Union. Corona-debt is neither legitimate nor repayable. Organising its pooling and cancellation via the European Central Bank is the only viable solution, except to impose unprecedented austerity on all European peoples.

Your statements have been very clear. On one side, most of us acknowledge that we have accomplished a lot together since the Schuman Declaration and there is a lot of which we are rightly so proud of. But, at the same time, you called for more solidarity, more action and, what I would call, result—oriented policies from our Union, which, as Ms Keller has said, must be more planet- and people-centred. All of you called for the big debate with our European citizens under the Conference on the Future of Europe to take place as soon as possible. Because at a time like this we all feel that we need to listen more to the people – I would say even more than before – to include them in our decision-making and then, of course, to draw lessons about how we can fulfil their proposals, wishes and dreams in the best possible way. I think we have to remind ourselves that, when Robert Schuman made his declaration for this bold and constructive action in 1950, his words did not fall on deaf ears. There was immediate follow-up. Less than one year later, the founding six countries would go on to sign the Treaty of Paris, establishing what would later become the European Union. This is how they materialised his call for peace in Europe and for legal protection against the different views of those who were more powerful at that moment, as Ms Beer has just reminded us. It was done in a big rush and what is often overlooked is the fact that, with the negotiations being done so quickly, the piece of paper that ministers signed was, in fact, left blank. I like this because it is both a symbol of Europe’s unwritten potential and that of integration being quite difficult and uncertain, but also the trust among those who were signing this blank sheet of paper that what they were doing together would be good for the future. They trusted each other because they wanted the best for our people and for our countries. Many of you referred to Robert Schuman’s famous statement that we would not build a common Europe, this important common project, all at once and in one go, but through consecutive victories on a long and hard path, and that this would be the moment when we would forge European solidarity. I think that, if the founding fathers were with us today, on one side they would be very much impressed at how we have filled that piece of paper with successes. But I am confident that they would also have a lot of inspiration about how to proceed further. I think that very soon they would realise, as Mr González Pons has pointed out, that it should be absolutely normal and natural to be a strong patriot and a strong European at the same time. We just want the best for our people, the best for our country and the best for our Europe. Sometimes I’m puzzled by how much proof we need to realise that, even in such a crisis as this, we do not have a single European country that can do a better job than if we do it all together as Europeans. Ms García Pérez, Mr Durand and Mr Benifei have underlined the importance of making the debate on the Conference on the Future of Europe as relevant as possible. I would like to thank you very much for the proposals which I heard that we should include the topics of recovery and the renewed need for solidarity, and that we should debate honestly about all subjects which matter to our citizens, even such pertinent questions as fair taxation and how we can improve our common fight against tax fraud and tax evasion, which was put Mr Durand and Ms Aubry. I agree with Ms García Pérez that the holidays look very different from what we are going through this spring. I think that we should thank all those who are working very hard, including you, honourable Members of the European Parliament, because, without your quick action, we wouldn’t have been able to adopt so many measures, which I believe saved many lives and will save millions of jobs. So now I think that the major lessons learned from the Schuman Declaration in our debate today are that we need to focus on immediate steps. We have to have an ambitious multiannual financial perspective. We have to have a recovery fund with strong firepower. We need to tackle the crisis, relaunch the economy and give a new boost to our European project through this intimate and in-depth debate with our citizens. I believe that this would be something that Robert Schuman would suggest to us and I think that this will be the best way to respect his legacy.

Active and effective cooperation between our institutions will be crucial in that regard.  In all these very difficult circumstances, as you know, my capital city, Zagreb, was hit by a strong earthquake on 22 March, leaving many of our citizens homeless and further traumatised on top of the COVID-19 pandemic. I thank everyone warmly for all the help and support we received.

France saw the Euro-African Free Trade Area as a means of maintaining its hegemony in and over West Africa.

Let us remember on this anniversary the real words of the father of the founder of the European Community, perhaps they will once again touch the conscience of European politicians. Schuman has repeatedly warned of dangerous consequences for deviating from Christian values, the elimination of communities of nations, institutional and economic dominance over real relations between the people. Among many warnings, he said, \"Beware of those whose charm leads us to passivity. Those who want to put us to sleep in a false sense of security. Beware of empty guarantee providers who promise deceptive security measures. In stages and step by step they try to introduce what the healthy spirit of the nation rejects.

The work on COVID—19 contact tracing applications fits within the more general work to ensure a safe return to our normal social and economic activity as quickly as the circumstances allow. Contact tracing applications can help restore life in the European Union as we used to know and appreciate it – the unrestricted movement of people, goods and services – while upholding the highest health and safety standards. They would support the revival of our tourism, aviation and shipping industries. We have followed with interest the statements and declarations coming from the European Parliament, especially the resolution on EU coordinated action to combat the COVID—19 pandemic and its consequences. As you are aware, the Commission presented its recommendation on 8 April 2020 on a common Union toolbox for the use of technology and data to combat and exit from the COVID—19 crisis. All Member States welcomed the initiative and there was overall agreement that this technology is a key element in the mix of measures for the exit strategy. On 9 April, the European Data Protection Board also issued its guidance on this subject. When the Ministers responsible for telecommunications and digital issues held an informal videoconference on 5 May, they reached consensus on the need to ensure the interoperability of national applications. At this point in time, we have national solutions – some already working, some under development. To save time and effort, work on interoperability should take into account the progress already made at the national level. We must also make sure that, irrespective of the technical solutions adopted, these apps are trusted enough to be used by our citizens in large enough numbers. This will not happen unless the apps can be used on a voluntary basis, ensure adequate protection of personal data and privacy and avoid the stigmatisation or any potential misuse of the collected and stored data. There is a need for a joint shared approach and common standards in developing such apps. These apps should do nothing more than trace contacts. Malfunctioning of the app could potentially change the life of our users, so the efficiency of the application should always be checked. It is also important to mention that there are sizeable regional differences between digital services across and between the different Member States. We must ensure digital inclusion in every part of Europe. Bridging this gap will not happen without investments, interconnectivity, technological and human digital skills. In this respect, the Croatian Presidency is working on the Council conclusions as our answer to the Commission communication on shaping Europe’s digital future. The issues include the resilience of our digital infrastructure, the importance of reliable data availability at the European level, the urgency of implementing our e—health initiatives, the importance of improving the digital aspects of our education, our security, of our networks and data.

Les applications de traçage des contacts peuvent jouer un rôle dans cette entreprise. The Commission adopted the recommendation on 8 April setting out the principles and showing the respect of fundamental rights and, in particular, the right to privacy and personal data protection and the prevention of mass surveillance and stigmatisation. It was followed by a common EU toolbox developed by the Member States with the support of the Commission and complemented by Commission guidance on the respect of privacy and data protection.  Our guidance sets key principles. National health authorities or authorities responsible for the crisis management should be the controller. The installation of an app on a user’s device should be voluntary. If proximity data is used, it should be stored on an individual’s device and only shared at the initiative of the user.  For contact tracing there is no use of geo-localisation data, only proximity data based on Bluetooth. Only the personal data that is necessary to meet the purpose of the app can be processed. The identity of the user of the app will not be disclosed to other users. The personal data should not be kept for longer than necessary. Timelines should be based on medical relevance. In addition, the app should be only used during the crisis and be deactivated, at the latest, when the pandemic is over.  The deactivation should not depend on de-installation by the user. The data and the entire application should be protected through state-of-the-art security techniques, including encryption. And finally, data protection authorities should be fully involved and consulted in the development of an app and should keep its deployment under review.  Le but des applications de traçage des contacts est d’aider à briser les chaînes d’infection et à sauver des vies. Cependant, cela ne fonctionnera que si les citoyens savent qu’ils sont en sécurité et que leurs données et leur vie privée sont entièrement protégées. Les citoyens doivent avoir la certitude que les applications seront utilisées exclusivement pour lutter contre la pandémie. Ce sont là les conditions préalables au développement, à la reconnaissance et à l’utilisation de telles applications.  J’insiste sur ce point: il ne doit pas y avoir de doute. Ces applications ne peuvent pas être utilisées pour une surveillance de masse. Les individus garderont et devront garder le contrôle de leurs données. C’est le fondement de la précision et de l’efficacité de ces applications pour contenir la propagation du virus.  Il est donc essentiel d’identifier les solutions les moins intrusives et qui respectent pleinement les exigences de protection des données personnelles et de confidentialité telles que définies dans le droit de l’Union européenne. It is also essential that we have a coordinated European approach. This European approach is clear. These apps must be voluntary, transparent, temporary, cyber-secure, using temporary and arbitrary identifiers, rely on proximity data, Bluetooth technology and not on geo-localisation. That means no tracking. And they must be interoperable across borders, but also across operating systems.  As regards the two different approaches referred to as centralised and decentralised, both can be compatible with privacy and data-protection rules, and both need to follow high standards of data security. From a data-minimisation perspective, the decentralised approach is preferable since less data would be stored on the back-end server than under the centralised one. Regardless of the approach chosen, we should strive to have a common approach to ensure interoperability of the apps. The Commission is working with Member States on this issue as a top priority, and I am glad that guidelines on interoperability for approved contact tracing mobile applications in the EU were adopted yesterday by the e-Health networks of Member States and published on the Commission website. I cannot emphasise enough how important interoperability will be for the cross-border circulation of people in the Union and for many sectors, including tourism.  We should also make sure that national health authorities are able to adjust the epidemiologic barometers of the apps and to obtain the necessary aggregated information to monitor the efficiency of the measures taken.  The Commission also firmly believes that the process regarding the selection of the apps as well as their functioning, should be transparent. The technical specifications and the source code of the apps should therefore be published.  Some Member States are using manual tracing together or instead of tracing apps. Their tracing modalities need to be in line with personal data protection rules as well. We will also be attentive to this.  Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, comme nous le savons tous, les États membres ont commencé à introduire les premières étapes des mesures de déconfinement. C’est pourquoi nous avons besoin d’une approche européenne coordonnée. Nous devons agir ensemble avec responsabilité et solidarité pour arrêter ce virus.

This pandemic must not set a back of this pandemic for a free Europe of 100 years. What is important now, however, is that citizens use their slowly re-emerging freedom responsibly. And as a hygiene professor from Denmark told us this week, hygiene and distance are not everything in life. But without hygiene and without distance, everything we do now is nothing. That's why it's all about keeping your distance and washing your hands.  In this case, however, Europe can, of course, make it easier for citizens to enjoy their freedom and use by providing digital support if they have been at risk of contagion. That is why, Commissioner, you were quite right to point out the conditions which are of particular importance to my group.  We believe that this app will convince many citizens if it offers them something – if it provides them with security, when it provides them with information, and if it is useful for them. It must work everywhere in Europe. So it has to be operal. The Member States are called upon to do this, because the health systems of the Member States are still organised differently. And it must bring a few other things, namely no geolocation, anonymity, use must be voluntary. It must be protected against any kind of cyberattack. And it must be deleted as soon as it is no longer needed.  Health protection is a public task. In this case, however, it is precisely the citizens' own responsibility that we must take into account.

Today, there is no evidence that apps can contain a disease, but there are serious fundamental rights concerns, and therefore the app must be truly voluntary, with no incentives to use them and no discrimination against people not willing to use them or who cannot use them. Entry into a country should not depend on using the app. Freedom of movement is a fundamental right, not a prize for downloading an app.  Apps must only be used for contact tracing with no access for commercial players or law enforcement, and data should be stored in a decentralised way. This is important because, especially in exceptional times, interference with fundamental rights must remain proportionate, necessary and limited in time. Governments now have a chance to show that Europe can lead the way in countering this pandemic without compromising on fundamental rights.  So why is it that only a few Member States fully involved their data protection authorities? What are they afraid of? We can’t accept any ideas to install systems of surveillance via contact tracing apps or by using location data, drones, or by openly debating to discriminate on the basis of so-called immunity passes?  Let’s be honest: there is nothing like a silver bullet. Even a fundamental rights-friendly app can only be an addition to physical distancing, masks and more tests.

The use of the applications must be strictly and exclusively limited to the purpose of COVID-19 tracing. Tracing applications should assist manual tracing used for centuries to combat epidemics.

We must insist on mandatory standards and strong guarantees for their preservation, especially the right to privacy and data protection. We do not have to choose between our rights and our health. We must ensure ethical, transparent and secure use of these applications. Therefore, we need a European coordinated approach also ensuring European-wide interoperability.  Firstly, we must agree at a European level on privacy by design and data minimisation. Secondly, using such applications must be based on the explicit, freely given and informed consent.

We agree with the methods proposed by the Commission, they can help us in this, but it is not entirely clear how this tool will work. The commission should prioritise the protection of users' privacy and sensitive information should be stored in accordance with applicable data protection rules.

But we do need full transparency on the decision—making – and not just on the technical aspects, but also on why governments choose a particular model, why they choose particular providers. Where are the political and commercial interests?  Finally, I agree with everyone who said it must be strictly voluntary.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it was appropriate that we should have the opportunity to re-debate this issue here in the plenary. And this debate clearly demonstrates the central role of the common work that can be carried out between institutions during this crisis. I would stress first of all that the extraordinary measures we must take to combat the pandemic must not compromise the foundation of our European project, our values and fundamental rights. The use of an application is never, as Mr Schwab or Mrs Sippel have pointed out, as a complementary element that is added to a whole range of others: hygiene rules, rules of social distance or tests to be carried out in large numbers. All of these elements are part of a whole. I would like to stress a very special point that has been mentioned several times: interoperability. If we want an effective Community project, we need real interoperability, regardless of the number of applications in the states or regions. That is what we are working on with the various states. I believe that it is better to allow different applications to develop than to want a single application at European level at all costs, which would probably have hindered innovation in this project. I would also like to emphasize security. We are very focused on cybersecurity and regardless of which operators want to develop applications (Apple, Google or others), they will have to comply with European data protection, security and interoperability rules. It is not in this Parliament that I would need to reiterate the importance of the general data protection regulation. We have tools, control and implementation.  National data protection authorities exist, they are grouped in a European-level council, the European Data Protection Committee and I can tell you that already today, certain measures taken especially in emergency measures during the pandemic are being examined by this European network to verify their compatibility with the provisions of the General Regulation. , this is particularly the case for a number of decrees adopted in Hungary. I would like to stress that everything we announce in our guidelines can be controlled not only by the national authorities, but also by a European network that exchanges and will look for the best way to apply the rules that we recall rather than set them because these rules are in the general regulation. And we will remain particularly vigilant about the use that will be made of tracing applications. They can make an important contribution to the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, but we must ensure that our values and data protection rules are fully respected by all operators. I would also like to make it clear that transparency and communication are essential for the effective use of applications. That is why we intervened very early, with a recommendation on the toolbox and guidelines on the application of our data protection rules. I would like to say to Mr Lacapelle that if we intend to hand over the management of these applications to the health authorities, it is because they are particularly aware of the confidentiality of medical data and professional secrecy and that they also have the capacity to fully define the relevant epidemiological parameters of these applications. With a view to reopening borders and supporting the internal market, we must first pay attention to interoperability and observe a common approach.  Finally, we will focus on the voluntary nature of these applications and ensure that they are not indirectly tried to make them more or less mandatory, especially when it comes to crossing borders. This is something that I will be very attentive to and raise awareness among national data protection authorities.  I thank you once again for this debate, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, because it is important that we act early enough to ensure that this tool, among others, helps us to fight the pandemic and get out of the crisis in conditions that fully respect our values and data protection.

Mobile applications are developed and already used in some Member States to track people infected or at risk of being infected with the virus. Such applications can play an important and positive role in the process of loosening pandemic restrictions and gradually returning to normality. However, they also have a disproportionate impact on our fundamental rights, such as data protection and privacy. While the protection of human life and public health is of the utmost importance to all of us, both at EU and national level, it should be strongly emphasised that governments and the private sector must not promote the use of unproven technologies with the potential to violate our rights.  The long history of introducing emergency measures in crisis situations shows that, often when surveillance is introduced, it goes too far, does not achieve its objectives and is often prolonged without justification despite the crisis. Mobile tracking programmes, which can undoubtedly be temporary means of mastering a pandemic until the expected vaccine is widespread, must under no circumstances become a permanent part of an expanded surveillance system.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 119, "date": "2020-05-14.json", "name": "Marc Angel (S&amp;D)", "mepid": "202073", "text": "  in writing. – The European Union and the EU Member States must find coordinated common approach to support the gradual lifting of confinement measures.

This pandemic constitutes an unprecedented challenge for Europe and the world. It has brought huge human losses and suffering, as well as social and economic damage to millions of people. It has put our healthcare systems under exceptional pressure. It has wide-ranging implications for all of us in every part of the European Union. As we gradually start lifting confinement measures, we will have to learn to live with the coronavirus under strict conditions and constant monitoring. Only the development, production and deployment of effective and safe vaccines and treatments will hopefully provide us with a lasting solution to this global health crisis.  Vaccines and treatments will be crucial for Europe, but they will be even more critical for our most vulnerable partners with fragile health systems such as Africa. Our ultimate and common goal, therefore, is to accelerate the development, manufacture and delivery of vaccines and treatments for everyone, everywhere at an affordable price in the shortest possible time.  The EU and its Member States have embarked on a worldwide race to find a safe and effective vaccine and treatments to counter the spread of the coronavirus. Regarding activities at EU level, already on 10 March at their first meeting after the COVID—19 pandemic reached Europe, EU leaders committed to supporting research as part of our common response to the outbreak. The European Parliament has also raised issues relating to the development of vaccines and treatments in its resolution on EU coordinated action to combat the COVID—19 pandemic adopted on 17 April.  On April 7, the Croatian Presidency organised an informal videoconference where ministers responsible for research and innovation showed their determination to coordinate their actions and welcomed ten actions for immediate response to the crisis.  On 7 May, in an informal videoconference organised by the Commission, many Member States supported the idea of preparing a COVID—19 vaccination immunisation plan. To accelerate the coronavirus vaccine, the Commission has launched a dedicated COVID—19 data portal that enables researchers to upload, access and analyse research data. Currently, there are more than 90 vaccines in development around the globe, but only eight are so far subject to clinical trials.  Three candidates for vaccines are receiving support from EU funding through the research programme Horizon 2020. Member States are also investing in several candidates.  Moving to treatments, it is encouraging to note that there are so far more than 40 developers of potential treatments for COVID—19 who have contacted the European Medicines Agency and the Member States for scientific advice. Most of the treatments proposed are medicines currently authorised for other diseases. Clinical trials are currently ongoing to determine their efficiency for the treatment of COVID—19 patients. The EU has allocated resources via Horizon 2020 to Discovery, an EU—wide clinical trial to test treatments involving more than 3 000 European patients. The EU has already committed over EUR 500 million to different research and innovation initiatives, including approximately EUR 48 million to 18 projects on vaccines and treatments via Horizon 2020 research programmes, and EUR 72 million in public funds for a therapeutics and diagnostics innovative medicine initiative with an additional EUR 45 million in expected contributions from the industry.  Additionally, the EU has redirected EUR 150 million from SMEs and start—ups for innovative solutions to tackle the outbreak via the European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator programme and up to EUR 80 million to CureVac, a European vaccine developer, by a common Commission aid initiative. In order to respond to the urgency, the European Medicines Agency will speed up its regulatory procedures so that marketing authorisation of safe, effective and high-quality COVID—19 related medicines and vaccines can be guaranteed without unnecessary delay.  Turning now to activities at international level, on 24 April, the WHO launched global cooperation for the accelerated development, production and equitable access to diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. In response to this call, on 4 May, the European Union, several Member States and other G20 countries co—hosted the International Coronavirus Global Response Pledging Conference. The initiative has raised EUR 7.4 billion, including EUR 4 billion from the EU and its Member States. This is a very promising and important first step.  There are a number of key challenges. Once new therapies are identified, the challenge will be to scale up production and distribution to make them available to patients throughout the world at an affordable price.  As regards vaccines, the first challenge is the patient’s safety and to produce a vaccine in extremely high quantities, since demand is global.  At the European level, already in December 2018 the Council adopted a recommendation on strengthened cooperation against vaccine—preventable diseases, which has the double aim of reducing inequalities between Member States and increasing security of vaccine supply. EU instruments such as joint procurement could be used in that spirit to help ensure fair distribution and solidarity among all Member States. In order to tackle other important issues, such as securing sufficient and autonomous production capacity in the European Union, fair licensing and fair intellectual property rights conditions, it is necessary to involve all concerned actors, including industry and the public sector.  In this context, I find it very encouraging to see that several manufacturers have agreed to pool their resources. Public authorities, pharmaceutical companies and multilateral organisations must work together to reach the common goal of making vaccines and treatments available to as many as possible.  We will defeat the COVID—19 crisis and we will do it with a shared spirit of European and global solidarity and responsibility.

We need to take bold steps and we need to take them together.  Containment measures have proved efficient so far and have allowed us to diminish the spread of the virus. But they will not eradicate it. For this, we need further action on three areas: first, early diagnosis; second, targeted treatments for the ill; and, third, a vaccine that will ensure immunisation. We will also need all three to be widely accessible and affordable because, as long as the virus exists in the world, no one can be safe.  This is why the European Union is taking the lead in organising a coronavirus global response pledging initiative, which took place on 4 May. The aim was precisely to lead the world effort to develop diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics against the virus as soon as possible, not only to make it possible to get to these objectives, but also to ensure that they are accessible on a fair and equitable basis once they are discovered. I am delighted to have this opportunity, on behalf of the Commission, to discuss these issues with you in a bit more detail this afternoon.  First, vaccines. On vaccines, there is no doubt that this is the best way to truly exit the pandemic and avoid a resurgence of the disease. However, developing a vaccine is a complicated process that depends on close coordination, financial support and unity. Each of these considerations was evident during the pledging event of 4 May that the European Union led at global level. First, we managed to attain our overall objective with an ambitious level of funding raised. We mobilised EUR 7.4 billion (USD 8 billion) in pledges, of which EUR 5 billion came from Team Europe. The second – and equally important – aspect of this pledging conference was that we sent, as the European Union, a resounding message of unity and solidarity across the world, and we also proved that, in today’s turbulent times, the European Union remains a force for good for the planet.  This was only the beginning. The pledging marathon remains open until 23 May, so I take this opportunity to encourage all of you to engage in helping to find new donors, public or private, and to join forces in this unique worldwide effort.  Here comes the big question: where are we on the vaccines? As the Croatian Presidency has just indicated, the WHO has identified 8 vaccine candidates in clinical evaluation and 94 candidates in pre—clinical evaluation. Three candidates are receiving support from the Commission through our Horizon 2020 programme, and Member States are also investing in several candidates. We need to focus efforts on finding the most promising solutions. That’s why the Commission has proposed that an EU—wide network for clinical trials be set up. Such a network will ensure a critical mass of data from patients, help to identify the most promising vaccine candidates or therapeutics, and swiftly move them into the most appropriate clinical trials. Once developed, of course, a vaccine would need to pass a rigorous approval process, and we in the Commission will work very closely with the European Medicines Agency to ensure that this process moves as swiftly and as quickly as possible without, however, compromising on safety and efficacy.  Producing the vaccine is only half of the battle ahead of us. We should also ensure fair, widespread and equitable access to the vaccine as early as possible, not only to all Europeans, but also to the rest of the world. There are many tools that we could use to achieve this – from public—private partnerships to increased manufacturing capacity, to advance purchase agreements to ensure production. The Commission is currently in intensive discussions with both our Member States and vaccine producers to identify clearly how we can best support Member States in the purchase and deployment of vaccines. All options are on the table and we are not excluding any of them. Last week, health ministers discussed the possibility of a uniform COVID-19 immunisation strategy throughout the European Union. This would also help us to maximise access to the vaccine when it becomes available and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on these approaches this afternoon. Let me now turn to therapeutics. The Commission has reacted efficiently to support Member States in this regard. I don’t want to beautify the situation. We all know that the early stage of the crisis was not an example of optimal coordination. Many measures were taken rapidly under pressure at national level without the necessary coordination. But, once this first stage went through and our Member States saw the added value of cooperation and the interdependence that binds them together as the European Union, with the help of the Commission, we reacted efficiently to support them. Let me recall some of these actions.  Since day one, we have coordinated closely with all important actors – the European Medicines Agency, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the national agencies, industry – to avoid or tackle bottlenecks, to better anticipate future shortages and to assist in the adaptation of production. In parallel, we have issued concrete guidance on the rational supply of medicines, regulatory flexibility and clinical trials to avoid unavailability of treatments. We have activated the rescEU stockpile of medical equipment, including therapeutics and vaccines, and we have established a COVID clearing house mechanism that facilitates the matching of the needs for medical equipment with available supplies.  Thankfully, the situation is now beginning to stabilise in the EU, but we must also continue working on the supply side. With this in mind, we are supporting a dedicated industry cooperation project to increase the supply of critical intensive care unit medicines. Parallel to that, the European Medicines Agency and the Commission have put in place a mechanism to support the rapid development and authorisation of new COVID-19 medicines and vaccines and, as we speak, we are currently preparing a joint procurement for such intensive care unit (ICU) medicines. Let me conclude by saying that today we are, of course, discussing the short term, which is saving lives and winning the battle with the virus on the medical side, but I would like to finish with a few words about the medium and long term. The pandemic has revealed and amplified important issues with our supply chain for medicinal products. I’m very aware of how dependent we are on important pharmaceutical products or ingredients. So we need to come together quickly and identify solutions to the three emerging weaknesses from the crisis: how to strengthen our coordination mechanisms and supply chains, how to boost our preparedness, and how to improve our society’s overall strategic resilience. The Commission is preparing a new pharmaceutical strategy that will take account of the lessons learned during the pandemic and make the EU’s pharmaceutical system future proof and crisis resistant. Yesterday, President von der Leyen had the opportunity to give you a bit more detail about our very intensive work on the recovery initiative, which is to be expected in the next few days. I would say that part of building this resilience for cohesive and resistant European societies passed from a very rigorous health programme that would bridge this asymmetry between what Europeans expect from Europe in the area of public health and what Europe has in terms of legal competence to face up to this challenge.  Commissioner Kyriakides and I will look forward to working very closely with this House on this endeavour. But first, I am keen to hear your thoughts on the challenges and solutions and I am very willing to take them on board and report back to you at my earliest convenience.

Not only the economy suffers from the lockdown, but also many people personally. But the coronavirus is still among us, and it is still very dangerous. That is why we must be careful, careful, so that there is no second wave. And we also need to use digital solutions.  I was a little annoyed and disappointed that Commissioner Reynders actually just listed the concerns this morning. We have to be offensive. And we have to look to Italy, Spain, France and Belgium, to the countries that have suffered the most from the crisis. Strangely enough, hardly anyone complains about the lockdown. In my country, Germany, one gets the impression that there is a great deal of reason to complain, even though we have got through much better. I shout to my fellow citizens: \"Stop lamenting me, and show solidarity with those who have been hit much harder!\" The final solution, of course, comes with only one drug or a vaccine. Personally, after many discussions with experts, I am personally optimistic that we will get a drug and/or vaccine much faster than under normal circumstances. The conference held by the European Commission last Monday was a clear sign of cooperation and dialogue.  Unfortunately, however, we also need a Plan B. The United States did not attend the conference at government level, and that is why we should continue to engage in dialogue, but we should also be prepared, for example, to issue compulsory licences in Europe in a coordinated manner or to use trade policy instruments. When Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on European cars, Jean-Claude Juncker went to the White House and made a counter-threat. And the health of our citizens must be at least as important to us as the car industry.

A vaccine to treat and combat this pandemic is currently being intensively sought all over the world. This morning, Commissioner, Mr. Efsovic, spoke of solidarity. He said that the prosperity of a country should not determine whether the people there can live without this virus. He is right.

I wonder whether the money we, as Europeans, put into research and development is seen as a gift, rather than something to which a company is entitled. This is not solidarity, it is capitalism with people's lives. We cannot accept that.  That is why we clearly need equal access to a vaccine in the European Union and worldwide.

But today I want to talk to you about the treatment with hyperimmune plasma, a simple cure that has existed in medicine for almost a century, now tested on Covid-19 in Mantua and Pavia, Italy, with excellent results.

Think that in the United States, 116 universities are already experimenting. Let's talk about the costs: antiviral drugs cost 4, 5 or 6 times more than a simple plasma bag.  Yet both the Italian Government and you in Europe do not seem particularly interested in this. How come? Well it doesn't have behind the multinational drug companies, there are no big investments and the strong powers of the industry, there are no big contracts and millionaire earnings.

A lot of public money indeed has been pledged now to secure funding for the development of vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics. This money, however, should not come as a blank cheque to the pharmaceutical industry. Policymakers should take the necessary measures to make sure that vaccines and therapeutics will be accessible to all. First, I believe that the EU should support the W8 in setting up a transparent and inclusive governance structure that will decide on the development, production and equitable distribution of future vaccines and therapeutics globally. All relevant stakeholders, including civil society and the global south, should be represented in this governance structure. Second, the health of our citizens should not only depend on the goodwill, as we understood it, of the pharmaceutical sector – we cannot rely on voluntary measures only. If needed, EU Member States should be able to make use of compulsory licensing. While we Greens have always been supporting this, I was happy to hear that colleagues of other political groups like Mr Liese just now are also aboard for this idea. But to facilitate the use of compulsory licensing, it’s also crucial that the EU urgently makes its legislation on data and market exclusivity more flexible. I invite us all to collaborate on this.

When new treatments and vaccines are ready for market, the European Structural and Investment Funds should play a key role in increasing production capacity with particular care and ensuring a fair and appropriate allocation for each Member State. Nevertheless, the development of the vaccine entails significant costs and a high risk of failure. It will take a long time to develop safe and effective vaccines that will be authorised and we must be aware that there are no easy and quick solutions in this process. Finding a vaccine quickly is important, but it is more important that it is effective and safe for patients. In the case of rapid development of the vaccine, all side effects may not be known, so the question of liability requires a resolution.

That question is, how much are you willing to pay to save your life?

That is what explains why a Belgian family had to pay EUR 1.9 million euros for a life-saving treatment to Novartis. That also explains why the CEO of Sanofi dares to threaten to give the vaccine first to the United States. And that explains why today, Belgian health authorities fear that the vaccine will not be available to all. So that is why it is so, so important for us to make sure that no pharmaceutical company gets an exclusive right on the coming treatment or vaccine.

Most of these costs are expected to be covered by government funding to fund research by large multinationals. This money comes without sufficiently clear conditions and requirements, for example in the case of intellectual property rights. The EU has promised to contribute SEK 10 billion. That's good. But firstly, we cannot more or less give away SEK 10 billion without ensuring fair access to both patents and vaccines. If the world is now to jointly fund the development of a vaccine, then the world should also have free access to patents for the licensing of vaccines. And secondly, the precautionary principle applies – we must not make the same mistakes as when we stressed out a vaccine against swine flu, and in Sweden alone 500 people suffered from it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 159, "date": "2020-05-14.json", "name": "Fulvio Martusciello (PPE).", "mepid": "124828", "text": "   Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the whole world is waiting for the vaccine: but let us think about what happened with AIDS, the times it took to try to have it, and we still do not have it.

As it advanced in China, Europe discovered that it had no factories producing masks, because the work around those masks was not profitable and it was worth producing in China, and then found that it did not have gloves, which are produced only in Taiwan or Malaysia. And again he found that the production of alcohol was contingent. A series of errors that made us find totally uncovered. This virus was terrible, it completely ripped apart our lives. You see, for those who are Christian and Catholic, like me, it is a terrible experience not to be able to say goodbye to a loved one personally, but to have to say it by videoconference.

Thank you for that, and also thank you for this discussion and presentation by the Commission of the actions that have been taken at this stage.

First of all, it is extremely important that we work together to learn more about this disease, and also work together to find out how we cure and how we vaccinate. We've been told a lot about that, and that's really good. In addition, however, I also believe that it is important that the next step is handled in such a way that we learn from the fact that we must not be dependent on the world outside the European Union. We simply need to ensure that we also produce protective equipment at European level, produce important medicines and, of course, also produce the vaccine when it is ready at some point. We must do this by working together, we are funding it together and coordinating it much better across the Member States than we have done up to the corona crisis.

I identified two families of issues from your statements. One – let’s call it the quest for resilience – and the other one is what happens once we have the vaccine? How do we make sure that we avoid the problems that we saw in the early stage about access to the distribution of personal protective equipment?  Let me start on the quest for resilience. There is no doubt whatsoever that Europe has to draw the lessons of this pandemic. It’s evident, it’s written on the wall. This is something that society will impose on all policy-making at all levels. As far as the quest for resilience at the EU level is concerned, let me repeat what I said earlier. We have to bridge this asymmetry of expectations between what Europeans want from Europe in areas where Europe has nothing in terms of legal competence. This is a major issue. This contaminates public opinion and projects Europe in a negative light. I really hope that this will be, together with my colleagues, one of our main lines of action in the months and years to come. Also on the quest for resilience, we have to make sure that the recovery initiative sheds light and reinforces a self-standing health problem that is able to perform not only under regular, normal circumstances, but is also designed to face up to major sanitary crises and pandemics. This is also a major challenge in front of us. Finally, many of you also raised the issues of production, back to the EU, pricing, strategical autonomy, the place of Europe in the world and geopolitics. When it comes to pharmaceuticals and all these questions, I want to assure that they will be addressed in our pharmaceutical strategy communication, which I will be presenting to you, together with Commissioner Kyriakides, later this year. Let me now come to – and finish –the other cluster of issues of concern to you, which is what happens once we have the vaccine, how we make sure that access is fair, equitable and widespread distribution is available to all Europeans and the rest of the world. I think there are three options for us, a three—point strategy that will allow us to act effectively in this respect. First, we need to ensure immediate access to vaccine supplies. For this, we do have instruments to be deployed, namely we can create an EU stockpile of vaccines, serving as an immediate response through the European Union Civil Protection Mechanism, we can organise an EU joint procurement scheme, which will be secure purchase commitments in a stable framework, and the Commission could also procure directly, on behalf of Member States, vaccines making use of the Emergency Support Instrument. This was about immediate actions. Second, regarding secure production, we are already in close contact with industry and we are exploring together with them concrete measures such as public-private partnerships to increase manufacturing capacity or to advance purchase agreements to ensure production. Thirdly, delivery. In the beginning we might need some prioritisation. This is precisely the objective of the European immunisation strategy that I was referring to in my opening statement. Such an immunisation strategy could set priority strands for certain segments of the population, but we will also need to ensure access worldwide because, as long as the virus exists, no one is safe. This is again precisely the purpose of our global leadership in the framework of the pledging conference that should not end on 23 May, when we have this critical mass of financing to speed up the production of vaccines. But we will also have a role, after 23 May, to make sure that the rest of the world and especially those parts of the world that have more vulnerable health systems, like Africa or Latin America, will not be left out of this development.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 162, "date": "2020-05-14.json", "name": "Nikolina Brnjac", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, honourable Members, I wish to thank you for this important debate. We have one common goal around the world and that is to defeat the virus. As the Commissioner said, no country is able to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic alone. There is only one way to defeat it, namely with a combination of prevention through vaccination and treatment of people who have fallen ill. Unfortunately, we still have to wait for treatments and vaccines to be found. The European Union has mobilised important resources and it is fully involved in a coordinated global effort to develop, produce and employ vaccines and treatments for all. A positive dynamic has developed with the launching of the Coronavirus Global Response Pledging effort. The European Union is fully committed to support Member States’ efforts within and outside the Union. We know that we can now count on the cooperation of all EU institutions in this endeavour. In particular, we hope we can coordinate with the European Parliament.

We have at the moment more than 100 COVID19 vaccine development projects worldwide, 8 of them are already in clinical trial phase, of which 3 are supported by Horizon 2020. Once developed, it is important to ensure swift authorisation by our trusted partner, the European Medicine Agency and work in close collaboration with European pharma sector to provide the necessary production capacity. With great concern, I want to remind you that EU is the region of the world with the lowest confidence in the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. One of the strongest drivers for vaccine hesitancy are misunderstandings about the benefits and risks of vaccines, the severity of vaccine preventable infectious diseases and the fear of potential side effects derived from misleading information. Consequently, I stress the ongoing need to reinforce our actions, together with the Commission, Member States, EMA and ECDC to tackle vaccine hesitancy, improve vaccination coverage, promote sustainable vaccination policies, and contribute eventually to European and global health.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 165, "date": "2020-05-14.json", "name": "Margarita de la Pisa Carrión (ECR)", "mepid": "204414", "text": "  in writing. – This is not the first time we have faced shortages of goods internationally: today it is medicines, tomorrow it will be the vaccine.

We call on the Commission to assume its role of coordinating the Member States, prioritizing the essentials and forgetting ideological proclamations that only materialize grudges and accentuate division. We must anticipate health problems, we need a fair distribution based on patient needs, real demand, not storage forecasts. In the face of scarcity, give priority to those most in need. When the vaccine arrives, clarity in this regard will be essential. We ask the ECDC to share information on the situation in each country: test results, treatment protocols, conclusions...

This is witnessed, among other things, in the successful donor conference on 4 May, which raised EUR 7.4 billion worldwide. Further cooperation across borders will be needed. However, if a vaccine or treatment is found, it will also be essential to ensure equal access for all citizens. We must not allow the large private companies to make profiteering through patents with a vaccine that the whole world craves, and for which billions of euros have been used in public research funds. Research funded by public funds should also remain available in the public domain. The vaccine must be safe, affordable and universally accessible.

It is important that vaccines and treatments are universally available, because we can only overcome this crisis together. Cooperation is needed at both EU and global level to find the right vaccine. I consider the 'Global Action against the Coronavirus' donor event initiated by the Commission to be an important step, with the €7.4 billion raised as a solid basis for funding relevant research.  However, further and greater support is needed to improve the results of EU research and development. Similar thinking and action are needed to develop targeted therapy. I welcome the fact that the first round of applications for the innovative medicines initiative has been successfully completed. Further financial means should be used to support public and private expertise and resources in the fight against the virus.

We need global coordinated action to achieve innovative actions and launch a message of unity and solidarity.  There are currently eight vaccines in human clinical trials, three of which receive European funding through Horizon 2020.
