These are words by Ludwig van Beethoven, made real by his music, by his art. For him, music was the ground where the spirit lives, thinks, invents, dreams and playing it without passion was unforgivable. His music and passion symbolise the ideals of Europe. The ideals of solidarity, peace, freedom and our project in a better world.  On the occasion of the 250th anniversary of Beethoven's birth, I would like to share with you a moment of inspiration. The Ode to Joy of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony was adopted as the official anthem of the European Union and is performed in Parliament at the opening of our every constituent session and on solemn occasions. It's kind of our business card. It will be performed today by the Oxalys Ensemble in Brussels, with arrangements by composer Jago Moons.

Mr President, last week's European Council was a memorable one. We sealed the deal on two crucial agreements: the European budget and the Recovery Fund, and the new climate goal for 2030. We worked around the clock. The negotiations were intense, but we took our responsibility. We overcame the obstacles and came together for the good of Europe. In this process all the institutions, including your Assembly, played important roles and helped shape the final outcome.  These agreements represent major steps forward. We have the resources - EUR 1.8 trillion - we have solidified the rule of law with new and effective legislation, and we have agreed to step up our climate goals for 2030.  Let me briefly summarise these decisions. You all know the impasse we faced in recent weeks. Our EUR 1.8 trillion agreement came with conditionality for the protection of our budget. There was a collective decision by all 27 leaders taken last July, but two Member States could not approve the package. We found a way to unblock the situation, and here I want to pay tribute to Chancellor Merkel and her team for their tireless efforts. The adoption of the regulation and the conditionality mechanism is now under way.  Our second major decision was not only a win for Europe, it was also, and it is, a win for our planet. We agreed to reduce our carbon emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and we reaffirmed our goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. This demonstrates our credibility as the global leader in climate action. It was a difficult negotiation. Some Member States needed more safeguards for their businesses and workers, and some Member States have asked to address the possible imbalances of the modernization fund.  For our economies, going green doesn't mean going broke. Quite the opposite. Our climate action will spark economic growth and create jobs and speed up the transformation of our economies and give us a competitive edge. But greater ambition requires greater investment, and this is why we will work to develop common and global standards for green finance. This agreement is the start of a process. The implementation will be agreed later this year.  Dear Members of Parliament, when COVID struck we were taken off guard. It hammered our economies and disrupted our societies, but today Europe is rising to the challenge of COVID. We are recovering and we are getting stronger in four key areas.  First, we vaccinate. The global community has developed vaccines in record time. The EU has played a leading role in this venture and this global success could also be a European success story.  Second, the EU has taken the irreversible decision to collectively borrow, invest and reform - a clear sign of unity and confidence.  Third, we have solidly entered our prosperity and our social transformation into our climate ambition. But prosperity alone is not enough. We must focus more than ever on the individual and the collective well—being of our citizens.  Fourth, our long-term goals. COVID may have dominated 2020, but it will not monopolize our priorities and our vision for the future. Our vision for Europe's place in the world remains crystal clear: less dependence; more influence; a stronger Europe that better contributes to a fairer world.  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are mobilised to face the challenges ahead of us, especially those that will probably mark the year 2021 that is open to us. The first goal we all share: defeating COVID-19. Make 2021 the year when we take control of the virus and where we can really restart a process of recovery and economic transformation. The year, too, when we manage to make progress in terms of Europe's place in the world.  For COVID, of course, it will not be easy to continue cooperation in order to deploy vaccines when they are available and to continue efforts on testing and tracing.  Achieving economic transformation also means ensuring that, as was one of the points of the debate at the eurozone summit, progress can continue to be made for the banking union and the capital markets union in 2021. We have thereby commended the work that has been done recently by the finance ministers. We want to encourage further efforts in 2021 in order to make progress in line with these two objectives, which are extremely important to us, to support the international role of the euro, but also to ensure that economic development in the euro area is consolidated and strengthened, based on the two pillars: the climate pillar and the digital pillar.  And, finally, a long-term, difficult goal, which requires tenacity and commitments to build, day after day, more unity and solidarity at the European level: this ambition to express a stronger position at the international level.  This is the meaning of the debate that was undertaken at the last European Council in October in order to define our short-, medium- and long-term strategy in relation to the Eastern Mediterranean.  This is also the meaning of the debate we had last week and the decision that was taken to take sanctions against Turkey, but also to maintain a more positive capacity for an agenda when Turkey chooses to stop its hostile rhetoric and unilateral actions towards the European Union or Member States of the European Union. This is also the meaning of the debate that has been undertaken between the Member States on the relationship, which we want stronger, with the United States, a great and important ally for the European Union. It was therefore important, it seems to me, to start the work in order to be able to make an offer on possible points of partnership with this great country: certainly the battle to ensure that we can defeat COVID, certainly the commitment to more international cooperation and support to multilateralism, certainly also the issue of international trade and economic development related to it. , but also security and geopolitical issues.  As you can see, this year's last European Council - in principle at least - is an important moment, because it reflects the ambition to take a step forward in making progress on these issues that we hold dear.  I would like to thank you, Mr President, but also the members of your Assembly, for the intense and difficult work that has been carried out, especially in the context of the trilogue, under the responsibility and leadership of the German rotating presidency. I am totally convinced that the points that have been made in recent days are points which are important for the 450 million European citizens.  There is still a lot of work to be done, a lot of challenges ahead of us. We hope that the next few days may lead us to have more clarity also on another major issue: the future relationship with Great Britain. The mandate expressed by the European Council is clear, and it is in this context that our negotiators carry out this work with patience, seriousness and tenacity.  Thank you, in any case, for the cooperation throughout the year 2020. You can count on me personally, but also on the European Council, throughout the next year to continue working with the European Parliament in the service of the European project.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2020-12-16.json", "name": "Ursula von der Leyen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   présidente de la Commission. – Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, je voudrais commencer en rendant hommage à Valéry Giscard d’Estaing. Avec son décès, nous avons perdu un président, un patriote et un père fondateur de l’Europe. Né à Coblence, combattant à la libération de Paris, bâtisseur de la paix et de l’amitié, il incarne l’Europe pendant toute sa vie. Il a été à la fois l’artiste, l’architecte et l’artisan de notre démocratie européenne. Et c’est ici, dans cet hémicycle, qu’il nous rappelait en 2002 que l’Europe doit toujours amener au monde et à ses citoyens les – je cite – «trois apports fondamentaux de la raison, de l’humanisme et de la liberté». These three words - reason, humanism and freedom - are at the heart of so many of the historic decisions we have taken in this year quite unlike any other. With tomorrow’s vote on Next Generation EU, you are writing history.  It is worth just pausing for a moment and looking at the big picture here. I say that, because Next Generation EU can lead to the most ambitious overhaul of the European economy in decades. It will drive our green and jobs recovery, it will be investing in everything from renewables to renovations, to restoring our nature, it will speed up our Digital Decade by financing faster internet, safer infrastructure and newer technologies, it will make our economies more resilient, driving forward reforms, and, crucially, it will provide massive and quick investment where it is needed and to those who need it. It will give citizens, workers and business real support and real hope after the pain of the pandemic and the lockdowns. Well, this is Europe getting back on its feet and moving forward together and I want to thank this House for working with us to make this a reality.  Honourable Members, I also count on your support to finalise negotiations on sectoral programmes and the Recovery and Resilience Facility as soon as possible. I know you will be just as ambitious and determined as you were when you were securing crucial extra funds for research, health and external action, when you ensured a clear roadmap for the introduction of new own resources, when you enshrined ambition on climate and biodiversity spending, and when you protected the general conditionality framework.  It is against this background that I’m pleased that the Council has finally endorsed the general conditionality mechanism which you agreed with them.  The conditionality mechanism has not been reopened. This was a red line for me and I know that this was also a red line for you. It is path—breaking that, for the first time, the Union is equipping itself with a mechanism to protect the budget against breaches of the principle of the rule of law, not just individual breaches that have already occurred, but also, and more importantly, systemic or recurrent shortcomings that could in a direct way threaten the budget and the EU financial interests in the future. The Council conclusions ultimately do not change anything about the conditionality mechanism, neither in the law nor in its application.  Let me address some of the understandable concerns that these conclusions have raised in this House. In essence, as I understand it, there is a fear that the application of the regulation will be delayed and that justice delayed might be justice denied. This will not happen. The regulation will apply from 1 January 2021 onwards and any breach that occurs from that day onwards will be covered.  I can assure you that the Commission will always act in full autonomy, full respect of the law and full objectivity. We will start the necessary work of monitoring immediately. When concerns arise, discussions with Member States will also commence without undue delay. We will adopt guidelines on the regulation, as we were planning in any event, and these guidelines do not of course change the law. They just set out how we will make our role in implementing it. It is only natural that, if there is a court case on the underlying law, we take the European Court of Justice judgment into account in finalising the guidelines. Crucially, any case occurring after 1 January 2021 will be addressed; no case will be lost. Finally, I am sure that the Parliament will stand with the Commission in defending the regulation if it comes to a court case and ask for an expedited procedure.  I started by talking about how Europe is moving forward with reason, humanity and freedom, and nowhere is this clearer than when it comes to the future of our planet. The decision by leaders to back the Commission’s proposal for a 2030 emission reduction target of at least 55% was based on science and on reason. It was based on protecting humanity and on ensuring freedom for future generations. With this argument and this agreement we set ourselves on the path towards climate neutrality by 2050 and we show true leadership.  The good news is that we are far from being alone. Just last week, we saw 70 world leaders stand up at the UN Climate Ambition Summit and another 60 of Europe’s biggest companies stand behind the 2030 target. Building on this momentum, I count on the support of this House to rapidly conclude negotiations on the European Climate Law. This will be the first ever law that will bind a continent to become climate neutral. But let me be clear. Setting the target is the easy part in this difficult endeavour. Delivering on it must start now. It will take a major collective and systemic effort, but it is worth it.  Our Union has taken bigger steps forward this year than it probably did in the decade before and we did this in spite, and in some cases even because, of a fierce global pandemic. But any recovery starts with overcoming this virus and nobody should think that we are out of the woods yet. Not when more than 3 000 Europeans die of COVID—19 every single day or when infections and hospitalisations are still going up in some Member States. But there is finally some good news. We have agency and we have hope. This is the message I passed to the leaders at the European Council. The Commission has negotiated the broadest portfolio of vaccine candidates and finally, within a week, the first vaccine will be authorised so that vaccinations can start immediately and more will follow in the new year. In total we have bought more than enough doses for everyone in Europe and we will be able to support our neighbours and our partners around the world through COVAX so that no one is left behind. But to get to the end of the pandemic we will need up to 70% of the population to be vaccinated. This is a huge task, a big task. So let’s start as soon as possible with the vaccination together, as 27, with the start on the same day. As we’ve gone in unity through this pandemic, let’s start the eradication of this horrible virus together and united. Allow me to end with a brief update on the unfinished business of this year. This is our future partnership with the United Kingdom. As I speak, our teams are working to try to reach an agreement. They are working day and night, sometimes against all odds, and I want to pay tribute to all of them and I want to thank, in particular, our chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, for his dedication and resilience. As things stand, I cannot tell you whether there will be a deal or not, but I can tell you that there is a path to an agreement now. The path may be very narrow, but it is there and it is therefore our responsibility to continue trying. The good news is that we have found a way forward on most issues, but this is now a case of us being so close and yet being so far away from each other because two issues are still outstanding. You know them: the level playing field and the fisheries.  First, on the level playing field, our aim is simply to ensure fair competition on our own market. Very simple. And this is why we need to establish robust mechanisms. The architecture we are working on rests on two pillars, state aid and standards. On state aid, we have made progress based on common principles, guarantees of domestic enforcement and the possibility to autonomously remedy the situation where needed. On standards, we have agreed a strong mechanism of non—regression. That’s a big step forward. This is to ensure that our common high labour, social and environmental standards will not be undercut. And of course difficulties still remain on the question of how to really future—proof fair competition, but I’m also glad to report that issues linked to governance are by now largely being resolved. On fisheries, the discussion is still very difficult. We do not question the UK’s sovereignty over its own waters, but we ask for predictability and stability for our fishermen and our fisherwomen. In all honesty, it sometimes feels that we will not be able to resolve this question, but we must continue to try to find a solution. It is the only responsible and right course of action.  The next days are going to be decisive. I know I have said this before and I know deadlines have been missed time and again. The clock puts us all in a very difficult situation, not least this Parliament, and its right to exercise democratic scrutiny and ratification. That is why I want to sincerely thank you for your support and your understanding. I know that, if we do get there, I can count on you to ensure a good outcome. As in the past, we must all walk these last miles in the same shoes.  Thank you so much and long live Europe.

Mr President of Parliament, Mr President of the European Council, Madam President of the Commission, honourable Members, I would like to thank the President of the European Parliament for his excellent work and for his excellent work. When the budget negotiations began in 2018 with a proposal from the European Commission, the world was, Europe was still very different. We are currently experiencing one of the most serious health crises, with hundreds of thousands of deaths in Europe, millions of people infected and sick, and we do not yet know where all this will lead. Nobody knows. But the citizens of a united Europe already know one thing: that we have learned from the crises of recent years. This time, together and in solidarity, we are leaving this crisis. We don't leave anyone alone. That was the focus of the German EU Presidency, and I would also like to take this opportunity today – also on behalf of the Federal Chancellor, also on behalf of my colleagues in the government – to thank you all. I know that the institutional fabric in the European Union is very difficult and that there is always some competition between the Council and Parliament. But we need trust, and I had the impression that there was and there was a close bond of trust between the European Parliament and the Council, because we all knew equally about responsibility. Dispute was necessary in substance. We have tried to build bridges, to forge compromises with regard to the multiannual financial framework, but it is also an attitude. And you all know that there is a great dispute that has divided Europe for years, and that is the question of the rule of law. I would like to say very clearly that your clear position is important, because we cannot simply set this conflict aside, but because we have to resolve it – constructively – in order to regain a common understanding of what holds us together in Europe, because we are not just an internal market and not just a monetary community, but above all a community of values and the rule of law. Your clear stance has also encouraged us to continue along this path and, in the end, to forge a compromise – and President-in-Office of the Council Charles Michel has pointed out the difficulties of this negotiation – which could ultimately be supported by 27 Member States. And that is not self-evident, but it is necessary! And I am defending this compromise because, on the one hand, it has not changed a single word on what we have negotiated with you, and on the other hand it also opens up the opportunity for peace. The European Court of Justice will send out a signal as to whether what we have negotiated is in conformity with the Treaty, and perhaps then there will be an opportunity for those who are constantly talking about lack of conformity and saying that individual institutions want to be attacked here, that they are interfering too deeply with national cultures, national identities, national traditions, perhaps this will give rise to the opportunity – by a decision of the European Court of Justice – that we come back together and that we come back to a common understanding of who we are, and that values no longer divide us. That is why it was also important for us to agree on another instrument in the Council, also in close cooperation with the European Commission, which for the first time presented a report on the rule of law, namely a dialogue on the rule of law, a check on the rule of law, to which all the Member States of the European Union must undergo the same. We have made a promise: together and in solidarity from this crisis. We are not leaving anyone alone, and we have promised that the money will arrive as quickly as possible where it is most needed: the people who are sick; in the regions so badly affected by the pandemic; in the economic sectors. And we can, I hope at least, keep our word. The money will be available very quickly from next year. And that is important that we mitigate the economic and social consequences of this pandemic as best we can, with a large reconstruction programme of EUR 750 billion. But it is not reconstruction, honourable Members! It is the building of a new future, because we invest in climate protection, because we invest in digitalization. Because we encourage people, because we want to strengthen social cohesion. This is also reflected in the budget, in the multiannual financial framework. And we have made a mark on this with Mr Van Overtveldt and with the negotiating team – to whom I would like to express my sincere thanks, because it has always been a matter of substance, of a substantive orientation. There is something in the EU budget, in the multiannual financial framework, that is unlikely to exist in any national budget of the European Union – and I say this as a representative of the European Union. Council , namely that we are tying 30% of the budget, the multiannual financial framework, to climate protection. That we make gender equality a guiding principle of this multiannual financial framework. That we ensure that women and men are equally affected by the expenditure. That we are putting in place own resources, which have been the subject of controversy in the Member States for many years, where there is no consensus. We have achieved something here so that Europe can be put on a new footing. And I think that this is an infinitely important sign at this difficult time, when democracy is under pressure worldwide and where authoritarianism is growing, that we are making it clear that liberal democracies can be crisis! We can protect people from terrorism, from health risks, from the injustices of this world, from other threats. And here Europe has set standards, above all, in terms of climate protection, and this could only work because the three institutions worked together in a contentious manner. Europe is made of courage. We have all shown this courage. I thank you from the heart for this, and I hope that you will be able to give the following Portuguese Presidency the confidence you have given us, because we still have a lot of work to do. And I wish you all the best for your work, so that Europe becomes better, more sovereign, more united and stronger.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2020-12-16.json", "name": "Manfred Weber", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, EUR 1.8 trillion, a lot of money is now on our table and the European Parliament as the budget authority of the European Union has a huge responsibility. We all know it’s not about figures, it’s about content. What does this proposal now mean? EUR 1.8 trillion means first of all — solidarity. Europe is in a deep recession, in a health crisis, and with this approach, we show that together we can overcome this. Nowhere else in the world are 27 countries combining their strengths and their forces to overcome the crisis. Even the rich countries understood that they can recover only if we do it together.  EUR 1.8 trillion means a clear commitment to the young generation. No second lost generation. This money creates a future; this creates new products, new services, and new markets. Jobs jobs jobs. EUR 1.8 trillion means protecting our environment, creating a digital Europe. We are the front-runner in implementing the Paris Agreement. Yes, but now we are providing the necessary means, the necessary money.  Yes we lost the first wave of the digital revolution, but we are committed to winning the second one, about industrial data. EUR 1.8 trillion means certainty for the final beneficiaries of the EU money in the MFF, the mayors in rural areas, the farmers that can count on us in a globalised world, the researchers — yes go for innovation — we now have the money for you and for the students in Erasmus. Please look how beautiful Europe is. EUR 1.8 trillion means more money for a strong Europe, on a European level. The big deficit of the outcome in July and the Council conclusions on the MFF was that this was dominated by national egoism and we added again the European added value, and it was about Erasmus, when it was about research, when it was about Frontex, and about the health money. In the middle of the corona crisis the Council had cut the expenditures in the fight for a health union dramatically and we, as Parliament, we healed this. EUR 1.8 trillion means for us also, fairness towards the young generation, because if you borrow money, you have to tell people the truth about how to pay it back, and that’s why the decision on own resources is so fundamental — to be honest.  This EUR 1.8 trillion is then finally also linked to an historic achievement. To link for the first time money to the basic principles we believe in: the rule of law mechanism. It was a red line for us in the European Parliament, that we will not allow the trilogue outcome to be changed and this red line is now respected. For me and for my group, this is a game changer. In the last 20, 30 years we saw the process of strengthening the rule of law in the European Union, especially with the enlargement process and then we saw a process of weakening the rule of law in today’s European Union. This mechanism is now again a strong base for defending this rule of law. The last days gave us proof that the Plan B, to link the money to the rule of law, really works, because the COVID 25 consideration was then a powerful tool to create a readiness to find a conclusion on the Council side. We now need an independent Commission that is ready to use the new tool from the first day on and I thank Ursula, the Commission President, for the clear commitment in this regard. This mechanism is not against the country. This mechanism is in favour of Europe. I also want to underline that with this new mechanism, we now have a fact-based and an independent assessment. Not let me say a party political one. In the future, the European Parliament will no longer play a role in this process and it’s up to the Commission, and then finally up to the courts to decide on these things. I think that is important. If we want to have credibility for the process we need a fact-based assessment and independent activity from the Commission. So, Madam Commission President, if you use the new tool independently, I think that is the best service you can do to defend the European way of life in tomorrow’s world.  This agreement is a compromise and Charles Michel was referring to this. It’s not about winners and losers in today’s European Union. I am happy that we have the agreement now on the table, but I also respect other considerations, other views on the subject on the table and they have to be accepted. ‘Europe’ is that we all can live with an outcome. Again the message is that the red lines from the European Parliament were respected, but all countries are on board and that is good. I finally want to thank, first of all, Ursula von der Leyen, for the innovative idea of the Next Generation EU fund based on the Lisbon Treaty, for the Plan B consideration — EU commitment to defend the rule of law. I want to thank the German Presidency especially Angela Merkel, in my group colleagues called her the mother of compromises, I think that is a great title for her, I thank her for this. I thank our NEGO team, all colleagues who contributed to this big outcome, to this great success. The European Parliament showed that we are the parliament of the citizens. We defend their interests, that they can count on their parliament and the European People’s Party may tomorrow support all related dossiers.  Let’s now start to implement it.

I'm sure no one would have imagined the situation that all European citizenship has had to go through. The COVID pandemic found us unprepared and forced us to reinvent ourselves, to be able to continue working and to deal with this crisis more intelligently, and that intelligent way is to be united. I want to believe that citizens have been aware of the work and effort the European Union has made to be useful in their lives and to solve problems. It has been a year of intense, and sometimes difficult, work for distance and confinement. Now all that effort pays off. And I would like to thank the German Presidency for its efforts to close the most important issues. It's been frantic weeks to close agreements and end trilogs. With motherhood and shared fatherhood, many Members have worked for hours and hours together with the German Presidency, together with the Commission, to achieve what we are going to be able to determine between all of us today. This Parliament has always been open to cooperation and work, also intensely, and to fulfill what was our responsibility. And we will do the same if an agreement finally comes along with regard to future relations with the UK. As I say, a frantic year that we are prepared to assume whenever we can fulfil our obligation for the good of Europe and for the good of the public. I would therefore like to vindicate the role of Parliament. Over the past few months, the main political groups have remained united in pushing the Commission and the Council, and we have achieved unprecedented achievements, historic achievements. For example, a Union budget for the next seven years which for the first time we have managed to increase by more than EUR 16 billion compared to the initial proposal by the Council. We have achieved a legislative mechanism linking the budget with the rule of law. That makes us stronger as Europeans, because it makes our values stronger. We have taken another important step: the European Union has in October made its first issuance of bonds, putting more than EUR 17 billion into circulation in social bonds. And there will be more debt issuance to fund the European Recovery Fund. This is a major step forward in the Union's economic soundness. We have learned a lot from the 2008 crisis: that austerity cannot be the answer, that we cannot set aside those who need us most. It's not about cutting, it's about investing. Because we are investing in the future, in a more sustainable future, that takes into account the need to protect the planet. We are pleased that the Council has accepted the reduction of 55% of emissions by 2030, but we need more ambition if we really want to achieve neutrality, and I remind you that this Parliament has adopted 60% of the reduction in emissions. But we are also laying the foundations for a Europe that is betting on people, with social investment, with a democratic digital strategy that reduces inequalities and does not increase them. And the same is online teaching, which must be the same for everyone and for everyone. I am sure that we are aware of the difficulties that many families have faced during this stage of confinement when they could not cope with the situation of online teaching because they did not have computers, because they did not have internet to be able to do so that their children had equal access to education. This is also Europe, we also have to move forward on this. And we've done everything without having to give up our values. I have insisted many times: we cannot be made to choose between economic recovery, values and the rule of law, because then we will be losing the essence of what the European Union really entails. It cannot be yielded in fundamental values. President Von der Leyen said so, and she deserves our trust, President. The Commission shall be guarantor of the Treaties and not a single case of violation of the rule of law which occurs from 1 January shall be lost. We must be proud, colleagues, of the work we have done in this Parliament. A year ago, Mrs Von der Leyen and her European Commission were president, and we couldn't imagine what was going to happen. It was a roller coaster, and we arrived at the end of 2020 with sadness and concern because many families will not be able to gather at these parties and others will also be remembering those they have lost. We must be aware of so many workers who also face these parties with the uncertainty of their jobs; of so many entrepreneurs, freelancers, small businesses, who have the uncertainty right now of what's going to happen from now on. We know that prudence needs to be maintained, but we can be optimistic about 2021. We have a vaccination strategy that will facilitate democratic, equal and fair access to all people living in the European Union and opens a horizon of hope and recovery in the coming months. All this is true, but we must also escape complacency, we must continue. We can't speed up the pace only when we're hit by a crisis and then have to improvise. In these months we have seen that our Union has shortcomings: now we know, let us continue to work. The Resilience and Resilience Mechanism needs to be approved. The Socialists and Democrats have been calling for a rate of financial transactions for years, and there are possibilities: we have ideas, only political will is lacking in order to succeed them. Because the fundamental question is why are we here, if not to change people's lives and to be on the side of those who need it most. We have already seen that the single market works and we have taken great care of it. All this is fine, but Jacques Delors had been warning for three decades that there can be no single market without the counterweight of a social Europe. That is why we now have six months ahead of us which we cannot waste on Portugal's leadership in the Presidency on the Council's shift. It is a great opportunity to give impetus to this social reform, social Europe, the Europe of rights. And I also hope that we will finally be able to finish the negotiations and begin the Conference on the Future of Europe precisely to listen, to listen to the public and to be able to continue to transform this Europe on which we want to work.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2020-12-16.json", "name": "Dacian Cioloş", "mepid": "197631", "text": "  au nom du groupe Renew. – Monsieur le Président, 2020 a été une année à part, dont il sera difficile de retenir autre chose que la pandémie. Elle a mis à rude épreuve nos systèmes de santé, nos systèmes sociaux, politiques et économiques. Et il faut le dire et le reconnaître: au début de l’année, la crise a montré les faiblesses du système européen et du projet européen, notamment avec le manque de coordination face à la première vague. On se souvient encore de la fermeture désordonnée des frontières. Mais cette année a aussi montré la capacité de rebond et a donné de réelles perspectives pour approfondir notre Union. Le travail de coordination pour la recherche et l’achat de vaccins en est un exemple, de même que le plan de relance qui vient de renforcer le budget pluriannuel. Nous allons reconstruire, mais aussi transformer autour de priorités véritablement européennes, comme le numérique et le pacte vert. Non seulement nous avons travaillé pour réagir à la crise, mais avec ces paquets de mesures, nous prenons aussi des décisions qui vont durablement marquer le projet européen. Je pense en particulier aux nouvelles ressources propres et à la conditionnalité liée à l’état de droit. Cela prouve que, sous la pression de réalités difficiles, nous pouvons progresser en Europe. But before adopting these measures, I want to tell you, Madam President, that both myself and my group listened carefully to your words and I welcome your statement that law prevails over political declaration, because the European Commission must fully respect the treaties. Indeed, its primary function is to do just that and apply the text as decided by co—legislators as soon as it enters into force and without any further constraint. This is extremely important for my group. We are very happy that we have this rule of law mechanism, it should be enforced at the beginning of the year, and in full, as the text provides. I would also like to point out that most of these measures were born here in this hemicycle and that they were able to see the light of day because we were able to build a solid majority to carry them through to the end. I would like to thank my colleagues. We have proved that Parliament can be united when it comes to reinforcing the European Union. This is something that we have to keep in mind, because the work is not finished yet –far from it.  Over and above the many legislative dossiers that are in the pipeline, we must make Europe more responsive. Its decisions must be faster and clearer, and to do that we should use the opportunity of the Conference on the Future of Europe that we have been pushing for since the beginning of this mandate.  This crisis has shown us the structural problem caused by the question of unanimity in the Council, which blocks a lot of important decisions concerning the European Union. This is not about not giving each Member State the possibility to be part of a decision. But if the objective of some Member States is only to block decisions without any strong arguments, then this is not the way to develop Europe.  So let’s not be afraid to debate this and find the right solution. Above all, let us never forget that Europe is most effective when it is united, determined and puts its citizens at the heart of its decisions and ambitions.

The majority resolution that we are about to vote on today is, in my view, contemptuous in tone and dangerous in method, it seems that, for those who live this European dimension as absolute, there is no legitimacy in the body that brings together the Heads of State or Government of the Union – the European Council – which, in my opinion, is precisely the greatest expression of our countries.  Let us not forget that the European Union exists because of the willingness of the Member States to share sovereignty and objectives and that it is the Member States that legitimise the Union and not the other way round. I find it frankly offensive and arrogant that the Council's statements are described as superfluous, as in the resolution, and that we even go so far as to threaten the European Commission and the other institutions if they do not follow the dictates of this Parliament.  I believe that this delirium of omnipotence must be stopped, and that is why – contrary to what Mr Cioloş said – I would like to reaffirm here an indispensable principle, that of the fact that important decisions must be taken unanimously, because this is the only truly democratic method, in my opinion, that protects those who think differently, which allows European democracies to defend themselves against the political and arbitrary use of certain rules.  There is no point in them always defending the rights of minorities in words and in constant resolutions if we then want to impose a dictatorship of one thought and delegitimize those who do not align themselves with it. With today's vote, we have not closed anything, but we are guaranteeing ourselves a future of legal and constitutional uncertainty with an ambiguous role given to the European Court of Justice, always waiting for the hundreds of billions promised, which I fear we will not see until several months.  This muscular test between the institutions, in my opinion, has no winners, but certainly the citizens, our businesses and our territories, who were counting on rapid and concrete support from the Union to emerge from this very serious crisis as soon as possible, will have to be satisfied instead with the adoption of the rule of law regulation, an instrument of political blackmail that has become a top priority for this European majority. , which is celebrating today, the victim of its short-sightedness and political and institutional arrogance, for which we will sooner or later be called to account.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 9, "date": "2020-12-16.json", "name": "Ska Keller", "mepid": "96734", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, dear colleagues, it is good to see that, finally, at the 11th hour, the European Council has given its green light so that support for citizens and economies hit hard by the pandemic can finally start. Neither the European citizens and the economies which have been hard hit, nor the climate, could have waited any longer. But while it’s really good that those agreements have been reached, there are quite some worrying trends attached to each of the decisions, and the past weeks have seen a sad show of obstruction by the governments of Hungary and Poland, which have wanted to take the Recovery Fund hostage for their own anti—democratic agenda.  Mr Orbán and Mr Kaczyński, you neither serve your citizens nor our common European future, and in the light of such blackmail we all need to stay and stand strong. And therefore it is really worrying to see the European Council’s attempt to interpret the political agreement and the law agreed by the European Parliament and the Council. That is highly problematic.  Probably even more worrying is the Commission’s role in this affair. The Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, must reaffirm that its intention is to apply the legislation to the latter as agreed by the co—legislators and without any delay, and that also means not waiting for some judgments until some guidelines are drawn up. We have a law  in place. It needs to be applied without delay – that is crucial.  Coupled with the Presidency’s failure to organise a hearing on the Article 7 proceedings on Hungary, this really makes for a poor track record for the European Union in its tackling of systemic democratic regressions in the middle of our common Union.  I want to stress again that the only law agreed is what Parliament and Council as co—legislators have decided previously. Nothing of that law has changed, nothing of that law will change, and it needs to be enforced as of 1 January 2021 for both the current and the upcoming MFF. On Climate Action, I welcome the fact that the governments managed to strengthen the European 2030 emission reduction targets, though a net decrease of at least -55% is still far short of the scientific consensus which is needed (-65%). Parliament has made a strong mandate of a greenhouse gas emission of -60%, which we will continue to fight for in the upcoming weeks and months because, again, the law has been made according to the normal legislative procedure. However, the target agreed by the Council of a 55% reduction is not an absolute but a net target, which is extremely worrying. And yes, of course we must protect and restore land, forests and other ecosystems in our fight to reverse climate change, but this should never be compensation for lessening efforts by the biggest emitters. If the European Union is to be a global leader in fighting climate change, we will need to do more than just come up with some creative calculations.  It’s regrettable that the European Council gave in to pressure from the usual suspects, I have to say, to endorse in its conclusions gas as a transitional fuel, which it is simply not. If we are to overcome the climate crisis, the future has to be completely fossil fuel-free. The exclusion of all fossil fuels from the Just Transition Fund was a clear signal and the European Council should have followed suit. We expect and we need more ambition to tackle the problems at hand and we need fewer double standards from the Heads of State and Government. I hope this will improve in the future and I count on our common normal legal proceedings in order to draw up a good climate law.

From that mandate, I, together with colleagues, have consistently and actively defended the consensus within Parliament.  Parliament has succeeded in putting its own emphasis on safeguarding and even strengthening the resources for forward-looking programmes aimed at training, innovation, technological innovation and development. These are the programmes in which the EU can create real added value and make a difference.  However, within the multiannual budget, there are still a number of stalled policy choices that continue to demand attention and resources. As far as I am concerned, the shift towards the future could have been even more pronounced. The EU seems to have a bit of a problem with finding the right level of ambition, and so does climate policy.  Europe can and must pull the cart for sustainable transition. Nevertheless, the new target of 55% CO2 reduction by 2030 raises a number of questions. Take the impact assessment of this 55%. No serious analysis at Member State and sector level is yet available. In my opinion, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has also been not sufficiently taken into account, as has the impact on carbon leakage and SMEs.  Moreover, most of these concerns that I have just expressed are also very clearly present in the critical analysis of Parliament's own research centre, the EPRS. I think it would be particularly useful to have a debate on this study.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, winter has begun, and as Europe prepares to celebrate the end of the year, European leaders have decided to tell us a beautiful Christmas tale. Once upon a time there was a historic multi-year budget and recovery plan that, with a magic wand, would save Europe, put the climate catastrophe on hold, protect human rights and put an end to the crisis. So, as it's almost Christmas, you'd want to believe it. But your fable unfortunately distorts reality and knowingly deceives citizens. A beautiful story that ignores a reality that must be restored.  On democracy, first. You are running as human rights knights protecting Europe from the forces of evil. But while our Parliament had demanded an indispensable mechanism to enforce the rule of law, you gave ground in the face of the blackmail of the extreme right by agreeing to push it back and weaken it. The Little Red Riding Hood was eaten by the wolf Orban. The respite granted to Hungary and Poland will set precedents for all those who embark on the path of an authoritarian drift, such as Macron's France, which organises impunity for police violence and brutally challenges freedoms of religion, association and information with its laws on global security and separatism. On the social crisis, then. Once upon a time, the Three Wise Men, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, were presently covering the grateful European peoples. But frankly, what disappointment will they have when the gifts open at the foot of the tree? The 16 billion euro hide-and-seek will do nothing: the multi-year budget loses more than 200 billion compared to the demands of our Parliament and even falls well short of the Commission's original proposal. So many new investments less for agriculture, education, research, ecology, health. The recovery plan, on the other hand, is conditional on the implementation of the austere and neo-liberal recommendations of the European Semester. The financial transaction tax, like any initiative to make crisis profiteers pay, is sent to the Greek calendars. In short, the colorful packaging mostly hides poisoned gifts from Father Fouettard.  But the fable doesn't end there. On climate, you tell us about the extraordinary adventure of a European Union at the forefront of a noble quest to save the planet. But your target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 is already below what Parliament had adopted. Worse, it is also incompatible with the Paris agreements, which scientists say require a target of at least 65%. Not to mention, of course, your accounting hacks to deduce carbon sinks, such as forests, while ignoring the climate footprint of our imports. In short, a beautiful magic trick. On human rights, on the social crisis, on the climate, it was once the European Union dreaming of a heroine, ambitious and progressive, proudly fighting in the camp of the good guys in the face of the wicked. But frankly, no one wants to fall asleep by the European sand merchant with this pretty tale, even at Christmas.

At the moment, this debate is about the future of Europe. We can say that the budget debate has started a conference on the future of Europe. We are not just talking about how to save the economy, but also how to help the people. We are talking about what the European Union should look like in the years to come.  We remember that we started this work two years ago, and then Commissioner Oettinger showed us the financial consequences of Brexit. We also counted the financial consequences of the new tasks. And then the European Parliament presented its very ambitious programme, stating that the European Union should maintain its level of ambition despite Brexit, which is why our 2018 proposal was decidedly clear and understandable. We should defend the European Union, and that is why new measures will have to be found.  Then there were 2 years of very difficult discussion and a pandemic that completely changed the situation. The pandemic has led to discussions about a completely different way of financing. Therefore, a smaller budget, because let us remember that the multiannual financial perspective is smaller. We can't hide it. This financial perspective needs to be strengthened by the Reconstruction Fund, and we are counting on this – we hoped at the beginning – that this fund will compensate for some of the constraints from the budget. He did not really compensate in the proposal, and that is why Parliament has fought to increase the budget itself. We have succeeded in this after many difficult conversations. As you know, we have managed to increase by 16 billion the budget for important programmes on the future of Europe, including research, but also on the Health Fund, on Erasmus, also – which is very necessary today – border protection. That's what we've been able to do. That is why we believe that this must be treated as one package: a budget plus a fund. Let us repeat once again: the budget without this fund, however, is too small. We must make this clear, and that is why we very much hope that now the Member States, and precisely the national parliaments, will ratify their own revenue decisions very quickly, because that is what the mobilisation of the future fund depends on. We hope that, following the Council's decision this week, this whole process will start very, really quickly. We need this because we need to treat this package as a whole. The introduction of the package as a whole also – if we can say so – forces a change in the way we are financed, and that is why we will absolutely need a new own revenue package, which Parliament has also worked on, because this loan will indeed have to be repaid, but a new system of financing for the European Union will have to be built for the future. It was not easy, it was not easy either between The Member States in the Council or it was not easy in Parliament. I would like to make it clear here that if, during the negotiations, the Representative of the Council told us that it was difficult to find an agreement between the 27 governments, we said: imagine how difficult it is to find an agreement in Parliament, where there are Members from different countries, with different political options, with different political sensitivities. We succeeded. Parliament is united, at least almost entirely united, and this is our huge victory, and this is important for the future.  I would like to stress very warmly here, first of all, the role played by the entire European Parliament in this whole matter, and I would like to thank the entire negotiating group, which has been working for two years – it has changed, but it has been working for two years. I would like to thank the European Commission very much for this constructive approach, but I would also like to draw attention to the extremely difficult task of the German Presidency. As negotiators, we have seen that this Presidency is still agreeing everything with the other members of the Council. That is why it was not so easy to reach a final compromise. Therefore, if you allow, I would also like to draw attention to the role of the German Presidency.  For us as Parliament, a new period begins – from 1 January we start a new financial perspective. From the first to 1 January, we can guarantee stability and certainty for all those who are waiting for this money, from 1 January we can already start some activities that do not require long preparation and preparation of projects. We can already start work on Erasmus, we can guarantee farmers that the money will flow, we can also talk about the need to start with scientific programmes.  We are very much looking forward to the decision on the Reconstruction Fund. We ask once again – all those who have worked on this process: a quick decision on own revenue is needed, ratification and, ultimately, the establishment of a fund. All citizens of the European Union care about this. I would like to thank my colleagues with whom I have negotiated very much. I would like to thank the heads of all political groups, including my political group in particular, for their political support, because this has been a two-year political process.

Yes, it was a long and hard job. Because the European Parliament has not dispensed with its ambitions, its political flags. We put first those who elected us, the citizens we represent. We don't betray your interests, your urgencies. We are well aware of the global challenges, the challenges of Europe. From the outhem of people's lives, the protection of jobs, the recovery for a greener, more digital, more social economy.  But also because the agreement at the European Council was slow and difficult. Because some Member States are vocal in their contribution to the EU budget, but they silence what they collect for their membership of the EU, for their membership of the internal market.  Fortunately, the European Commission has released these figures in due course and this has helped in the negotiation.  Because Member States think they are above the law and have made their non-commitment to respect for the rule of law too visible. But by joining the EU, they have taken on respect for European values and therefore respect for the rule of law and fundamental rights. And the European Parliament has not given up its capacity to create the mechanisms that require respect for European values. The European Parliament does not accept that european citizens' money should be used against European values. As we demand transparency in the use of public money and we will do everything against fraud and corruption. We. And this result is a victory for the EP. And it's an EU victory. We succeeded because we were able to mobilise a number of political families, from the outset, in a difficult negotiation process - within our own house, and the EP unit, led by President Sassoli, was decisive (thank you to my co-rapporteur, Jan Olbrycht, and to our teams, the nego-team and the tireless secretariat of the Committee on Budgets) - in a hard negotiation process with the Council, which finally took a safe step in difficult circumstances. We know that the agreement at the European Council was not made in half an hour. And all this because we had a clear mandate and the certainty of the urgency of our ambitions. We succeeded because we have had the European Commission committed to finding the political and technical solutions to embody our proposals. Thank you, Commissioner Hahn and his team also for confirming that the European Commission is the honest brocker in these negotiation processes.  We have managed to maintain the scale of cohesion and CAP policies by paving the way for a new generation of policies that contribute decisively to reaching the objectives we have set ourselves by 2030: a 55% reduction in CO2 emissions; enhancing sectors where the European dimension brings added value such as research, health or the Erasmus programme; support programmes in areas particularly devastated by the crisis, such as culture or rights and values; support investment and give the EU more means to act in the global context by valuing its geostrategic capacity.  But we have also succeeded in introducing new own resources to finance the EU budget - aligned with European political priorities - strengthening the powers of the European Parliament - the debate to be followed on the Interinstitutional Agreement is therefore required - and must respect horizontal principles such as gender equality, the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, 30% climate spending, 10% biodiversity.   Finally, we have created the necessary conditions for the Multiannual Financial Framework to be the \"anchor\" of economic and social recovery, the anchor of the Next Generation EU, and at the same time does not compromise the future EU budget, because the FfM will have the consent of the EP - key to creating the Next Generation EU - there is a debt budget line in the EU budget, we are guaranteed that the fund's costs will not be paid at the expense of European policies, we have strengthened the European Parliament's ability to ensure more transparency and democratic accountability in the NEXT GENERATION EU and introduce new own resources for the payment of the Fund, interest and capital. But the MFF would not enter into force (it would not be effective) without the Regulations of the programmes that integrate it, which are fundamental for good democratic and sound management in the use of European public money. And once again, the EP is committed to the timely completion of all these regulations. Thank you very much to all the rapporteurs of the sectoral regulations.

There are still obstacles to be resolved, but now it is up to the national parliaments: it is up to them now to do their part. By voting on this Interinstitutional Agreement, Parliament endorses the commitment between the three institutions to provide the next financial framework and the Recovery Plan with necessary legislation to ensure its implementation and proper implementation. A commitment which, I would like to recall, is binding on the three institutions. I would like to briefly highlight some relevant aspects of this report. First, the agreement establishes a roadmap for the introduction of new own resources over the next seven years. This has been a demand of Parliament for a long time and, finally, after more than three decades, we have succeeded. Secondly, these own resources are guaranteed to be sufficient to cover the reimbursement and interest of the recovery instrument, so that we minimize the burden on future generations. Third, greater budgetary control of the financing expenditure of the recovery instrument is ensured. Fourthly, cooperation between the institutions is ensured to ensure Parliament's correct participation as a budgetary authority in the management of external revenue linked to the Next Generation EU, as well as full transparency and visibility of all funds. Fifth, the flexibility of the instruments is improved in order to have full capacity to respond to urgent needs, or unexpected crises such as the present one. Sixth, specific provisions for cooperation between institutions are included for the first time during the negotiation of the budgetary framework. In other words, we do what the Treaties say. And seventhly, within the framework of the Resilience and Resilience Mechanism, we clearly point out the need for an objective, fair and transparent legal framework for the selection of projects to be financed. And I would like to highlight the role that local and regional entities must play in making recovery symmetrical, not only between States, but also between regions. In short, ladies and gentlemen, we are faced with a very good agreement. But an agreement which is not understood if it is not within the compromise and solidarity package, i.e. the multiannual financial framework, the Recovery Plan, the Own Resources Decision and the rule of law mechanism. And I want to talk about this mechanism, I want to make two considerations. First, it is born with the confidence and hope of not being used: it seeks not to punish anyone, but to protect everyone. Second, this mechanism also serves to send a message to the world: the economy is important, but without democracy and the rule of law we are no different from Russia or China. This mechanism of the rule of law is the European differential fact. President Michel, President Von der Leyen, I end by expressing a fear to you. The Recovery Plan will be financed with money to be borrowed by the European Union, but which Member States will spend as if it were part of their own national budget. The Next Generation EU is not going to be spent by the European Commission, nor will the European Parliament control its spending. There is something that does not end up working in this formula: things get complicated when the person who spends the money is a different person from the one who borrows it. The least we can demand is that this money serves more than just funding national programmes without regard to European interests and priorities. We have a common plan, not twenty-seven plans, and we should have a common goal, not twenty-seven objectives. Otherwise, we will have opened the door not to the founding of the European Treasury, but to the decapitalisation of the European project itself. Member States may have found in the Recovery Plan an extraordinary means of financing which does not require them to raise taxes or issue national debt. We may be opening the door to an unwanted return to intergovernmental Europe. Listen to what I say: European debt must finance European policy; European debt must finance the European Union. To finance with European debt Member States is to deconstruct the European project.

We have touched the line and, of course, this delay has not been for Parliament, because we have been waiting two years for the Council to start negotiating. Rushing deadlines to the maximum is not good, and I hope that these last months of tension and stress will remain in everyone's retina, so that when we have to deal with the next negotiations, we can do so in optimal conditions.  But in any case, at last, and now I do, I hardly believe it, we have a comprehensive agreement, an agreement which I value very positively and, as far as we are hearing here, the majority of this Parliament too. It is positive because we have managed to negotiate crucial points which were essential conditions for Parliament to adopt this package.  The first thing has been not to take for a closed party, not to take for non-negotiable the Position of the Council in July. This has made us able to improve the budget by EUR 16 billion over the next seven years.

And here's what's important about budgets: getting the programs funded.  The second thing is to have a calendar of own resources. I said it in a previous plenary session. There are many reasons why this agreement could not succeed without a compromise on how we will finance not only the European budget, but also the Recovery Plan.  It's a matter of tax justice. It cannot be that the usual ones are the ones who keep public policies with their taxes and it is also the usual ones who escape from contributing. It is a matter of efficiency, because the establishment of certain taxes only makes sense at European level, under the umbrella of the single market. It is a matter of climate policy, because those who pollute the most must pay more and thus contribute to the right transition. And I do not want to forget anything important that Parliament managed to negotiate in this financial framework. Finally, another historic demand from Parliament: the money from the fines, or at least one part, imposed by the European Union is going to stay in the budget and allow us to improve the financing of European programmes. And thirdly, a point which we have agreed, which is essential for Parliament, and which as rapporteur I am especially excited about: the mechanism which links budgets to respect for the rule of law. Much has been written and talked about the agreement, the vetoes and the Council statement. On the latter, I will say only one thing: the Council's statement is legally irrelevant. Because when we talk about laws, all that matters is the Rules. And this Regulation contains exactly what Parliament had asked for and what we have fought so hard for. We are a community based on common values and must defend and respect them as citizens and as Member States of the Union. This is not an a la carte Europe, as many would like. In this Europe we cannot be left alone with rights and not with obligations. How have we managed to improve the Commission's proposal? We envisage a broader definition of the scope. Not only do we talk about the rule of law in its strict sense, but we link the rights referred to in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. We have introduced preventive status into the mechanism, added a list of examples to clarify and even managed to include tax evasion and evasion among the objectives. And something this Parliament was very much about: protecting the final beneficiaries. We wanted a very scrupulous mechanism with control and make sure that it will be those who commit the violation of the rule of law that will be sanctioned and not the final beneficiaries, neither students, nor researchers, nor companies, nor NGOs. That was our goal. And with these modifications we have managed to provide a safety net to these final beneficiaries. In short, the Rule of Law Regulation, which has had a hard time getting ahead of us, is a big step for Europe. In addition, we know that it will be adopted, because no amendment has been tabled and will therefore be taken for approval without even having to go to a vote.  I am not going to go much further, especially given that, in addition, in another of these intensive negotiations we have ended up at six in the morning in the Council, so we have almost had to come straight here because we still have to close the Recovery Plan, but we're on our way. These marathon negotiations are exhausting and often very frustrating. But we always have to try to keep the best, with the positive, when we get that deal. Because in the end this is our task and we have to be very clear about this: to negotiate, agree, build and define with the regulations the Europe that we want to build among all. So, for my part, I just want to thank the whole team, because it has been a very broad team (financial framework, own resources, Rule of Law Regulation and everyone who is now negotiating the Recovery Plan). Of course to the Commission, the Council and all the teams of the Secretariat and our groups, because one person cannot do only this, neither two nor three. This is a joint work, in which, if we have reached a good agreement and if we have achieved something historic for the European Union - and I will not tire of saying that this is historic - it was because this Parliament has worked as a team and we have had good negotiations with the German Presidency and with the help of the European Commission.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 17, "date": "2020-12-16.json", "name": "Petri Sarvamaa", "mepid": "112611", "text": "  rapporteur. – Madam President, we about to achieve something historic today. For the first time in the Union’s history, we will have a functioning rule of law mechanism that does not need unanimity to work. This is a big victory for us, the co—legislators, but even more importantly it is a big and important victory for all European citizens.  We started this process years ago. Some of you might remember from the previous mandate when the Commission published its proposal for this regulation. We in the Parliament processed it fairly fast, but then we got stuck in the mud waiting for the Member States to form their position. Back then, many thought that the original proposal and the Parliament’s mandate were too bold.  Some thought that this legislation would actually never even see the light of day, but we in the European Parliament were vigilant. We really took the dangers posed to the rule of law seriously because we had noticed the deterioration of our values early. Authoritarianism and disrespect for our basic values had already been on the rise in Europe for years. Considering this, it was high time for us to act. It was high time for a change of pace.  However, the Parliament does not of course have the means to stop this sad process alone. We need the Member States to come along in this change, and a majority of them did. A majority of Europeans were clearly backing their governments in this. There was scepticism along the way and I have to say that at times we were worried – some of us more than others – about some of the turns that took place. For example, the European Council conclusions from July gave some room for speculation and even seemed a blow to our ambitious goals.  However, this past October and November presented another turn of events. We had fruitful and serious negotiations with the German Presidency, who managed to bring to the table the Council’s proposal. Extremely quickly, in about four weeks, we managed to reach a deal that respected the original ideas of the Commission proposal as well as Parliament’s mandate and, most importantly, our values enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty.  I want to thank wholeheartedly everyone involved in this process, my co—rapporteur, Ms Gardiazabal Rubial, Ambassador Clauss from the German Presidency, and our whole European Parliament negotiation team, as well as Commissioner Hahn. I also want specifically to thank the Chair of the EPP Group, Manfred Weber, for his support throughout these difficult negotiations. Now we, as co—legislators, are finally about to adopt this legislation, along with other important budgetary files, Here I want to emphasise the word ‘co—legislators’. The Council and the Parliament are the ones who have adopted this legislation. There has been a lot of a chatter about the European Council conclusions. Let me remind you that the European Council shall not, and does not, exercise legislative functions and therefore any political declaration of the European Council cannot be deemed to represent an interpretation of legislation. Equally importantly, the Treaty is very clear on the role of the Commission. The Commission is bound by the Treaty to adopt the legislation and to implement it, and it will be done as of 1 January 2021. Let me also thank the Commission President for her extremely clear words on this. This is of the utmost importance.  What actually is the rule of law that we are talking about here? It’s quite simply the cornerstone of our democratic existence in Europe, so therefore it is the most important thing that we have. That’s why this step is very important for us. It will not end everything, but it will be the first step on our way.  I hope we can reach a vast majority in this House for this historic law and I want to wish our independent Commission and the guardian of the Treaties wisdom and vigilance in its application of this law as of 1 January 2021.

Viktor Orbán cannot cover that up no matter how loud he actually screams.

Is this European Commission, the guardian of the Treaties, ready to stand up for the rule of law and fundamental rights even when it gets difficult? Will you apply a fully functional applicable regulation that after its adoption will enter into force on 1 January 2021, or is this Commission afraid of the noise of the autocrats and authoritarians in this Union? I can tell you – and I have to repeat myself here – the European Parliament is not afraid. With hundreds of millions of EU citizens we stand up for rule of law and democracy. Listen to us.

Europe's economy is groaning. Millions of jobs are acutely threatened or already lost. But the Heads of Government have no other answer than to indiscriminately pulverize taxpayers' money – as always. Does anyone seriously believe that the incredible EUR 1.8 trillion from the MFF and the reconstruction plan – this unprecedented redistributive – will be able to defuse anything about this crisis?  Nationalization and socialism have never been a working solution, and this debt socialism will not be.

Firstly, EUR 750 billion then into a recovery fund: of course, this is now an absurd theatre, where everyone still praises the fact that this is the right idea, should have borrowed even more. But no one wants to talk about the fact that there have been repeated periods in history where we know what happens with mindless money printing, printing – and it never ends well. Perhaps no one has yet solved the question of how we will pay back this money within 30 years, and the fact is that it requires the introduction of new taxes. Perhaps in order to print the money today as if for a so-called good cause, we are creating a situation where we have to impose new taxes on the citizens of the European Union in a Union-wide way, and that also means reopening and amending the Treaties again. And that, in turn, leads to a wide range of legal and legal questions about whether it is legal at all. For example, in Estonia – in my country – the opening of the Treaties would mean a new referendum. It is the decision of the Supreme Court of Estonia since 2012 that the opening of the treaties, which would need to be done to introduce new taxes across the European Union, would mean a referendum. And I am the first to campaign in my own country for people to say, no, we do not want more federalisation or a concentration of tax policy in the hands of the European Commission. Finally, as far as Hungary and Poland are concerned, I would say that, you know, it is an economic union, not a political, social federation, where we go and teach the Poles and the Hungarians what they have to do there.

Unfortunately, it now seems that the objective set for a climate-adequate level is very difficult for the Commission and the Council. The Council decided its position on the key elements of the Climate Act. The emission reduction target for 2030 was set at 55 per cent. When it comes to the net figure, it means that the actual emission reduction will be much lower than this, 3-10% lower, according to various estimates. It is difficult to understand how decisions are still being taken that are below scientific advice. This is bad news for the climate, but also bad news for business and business. The Climate Act sets us the goal of being carbon neutral in 2050. This objective is also in favour of the Council. If we do not now set the milestone at an adequate level, we will have to repair the target forcefully upwards in the coming years, and this will be much more expensive and much more difficult than setting it at an adequate level now, thereby guaranteeing a stable operating investment environment for businesses, businesses and industry for the coming years, thereby protecting jobs.

After some initially timid reactions, however, the Union has been able to rediscover the spirit of solidarity that is at its root. The multiannual financial framework and the Recovery Fund must shake up our economy. We have achieved important results: investments of EUR 1 840 billion; the decision to move towards a debt shared with recovery bonds, the common fight against Covid-19 mark the turning point between the Europe of austerity and that of solidarity. Citizens, families and businesses have been waiting for concrete answers for months. We have achieved important goals, but not yet enough. In order to avoid further imbalances and to ensure social justice, we need to do more.  If we want a strong Europe, we cannot have a budget worth just over 1 % of our GDP. We must harmonise the system of own resources – I am thinking of the plastic tax – distortions in the internal market must be avoided, but we must propose fair taxation. The giants of the web must not be legibus soluti. Like Robin Hood, we must ensure that the powerful Chinese and Americans pay more to make our citizens pay less.

Without us, this conditionality mechanism would not exist. I really rely on the Commission to apply it directly, and I also believe that it will be.

We finally need digital monitoring and an appropriate IT system or a digital way of tracing funds for the Commission, so that we finally know who is abusing, who is cheating, so that we can also use artificial intelligence and so that we also know who the economic beneficiaries are, who actually gets the money, what concentrations are going on where something may be abusive. We know that it is billions of dollars that are being partly misused. I would ask the Council to go within itself and finally get away from the stagecoach age.

But now, with the Recovery Fund and the Multiannual Financial Framework, Ms von der Leyen, it is very important to ensure that the funds are well spent.  Its Commissioner, Elisa Ferreira, said this week in the Portuguese press that despite the massive support of State funds from Portugal in the last 25 years, in which the Socialists were government in 18 of these, Portugal is a backward country. Now this is the last opportunity for many countries to stop being backward countries and we need to monitor how governments will spend the money: if they are going to spend it in favour of the digital transition, if they are going to spend it in favour of the climate transition. It's critical to know that. And then it is also very important, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to be aware, together with the Commission, of the question of the rule of law because there are many leaders who, despite swearing in love with the rule of law, are more concerned with the funds that come than with the fulfilment of values, and it is essential that we have economic support, financial support , but that it is not done at the expense of those who are the principles and pillars of an increasingly integrated Union.

Above all, I would like to make the link between the recovery fund and our climate ambitions because the recovery is not just the restoration of our economy. We had already agreed before the pandemic that we need a very different economy and a very different society, and this recovery fund should be the guarantee for that. My last words are for the new generation. Because we've all been apart the last year. Many people have had a hard time, but we have not paid enough attention to the young people in our society.

Finally, in a year when we have a Member State leaving the Union and a historic agreement where Europe is raising debt together and we have rule of law conditionality for the EU budget and the Recovery and Resilience Facility, I think this statement rings true. Yes, we are at a crossroads, but it is a road we are crossing together.  The House has stood firm in a legally—binding mechanism that ties EU money to respect of the rule of law in Member States. This is born from a simple and irrefutable logic. Member States that want EU money must stick to the basic values of democracy and the Union. In a community of values, adherence to them in order to reap benefits should not be controversial. In total up to EUR 1.8 trillion will be spent by 2027 to make European economies more sustainable and digital, thanks to the EUR 750 billion Recovery Fund. I think great credit is due to the German Presidency, and particularly Angela Merkel. At  an EPP Group meeting some months ago, when the frugal four or five were in full voice, I remember saying to her that if she couldn’t get it over the line, no one could.

We have additional instruments now on top of the other ones. This is against corruption, against fraud, to find out and to dismantle the end beneficiary.

In sum, allow me to thank you for this very rich debate at the end of this momentous year for Europe. It brings back to me so many memories of the debates we have had this year. I remember coming to this House in the early months of the coronavirus crisis. We all know the picture often looked bleak. The numbers of infections were rising constantly. There was a feeling of control being lost, division between Member States. We remember, in the spring, the doubts about the European Union.  Well today we should take a moment to reflect on how far we have come. Of course we still have work to do, of course we still have challenges and yes, we do have to focus on every detail to make sure that we get it right.  Whether it’s on the economy, the recovery, climate health, vaccination, Brexit – all these topics are there. But we should also pause very briefly and look at the big picture, look at how far we have travelled together.  Thanks to our collective work, Europe is moving forward faster than it has in decades. I want to pay tribute to this House for its ambition, for its dedication – you could feel it today, all day long again – and its real European leadership. This year we have shown that Europe is not only united in diversity, but it is united in adversity too. It is always easier to tear things down, but instead we chose to build something new and stronger. In the face of an unprecedented crisis, Europe stepped up with a massive recovery plan worth EUR 1.8 trillion, Next Generation EU, the European Green Deal with ambitious goals and building our digital decade. This is history in the making, and it is still a big moment here, with a vote that is history in the making. 2020 will be a year to forget certainly, for so many, and for so many reasons, but it will also be a year to remember for the European Union – the year we came together and moved forward together. The beginning of Next Generation EU, the beginning of Europe raising capital on the market to reform and invest together, the beginning of shaping our European future after the pandemic.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the broad support expressed on the comprehensive compromise that is being proposed today. This has been said by many of you: the beginning of 2020 was marked by a crisis unprecedented for many decades. But it is true, it must be admitted, the first days, the first weeks, it is rather in scattered order, on the basis of rather national reflexes, that Europe has behaved. Very quickly, however, because there was this common will in the European Parliament and the Council, with the support of the Commission, we managed to ensure that supply chains were guaranteed. Member States have been successful in taking steps to limit the spread of the virus. And above all, in a few weeks, we managed to mobilize an international conference so that, very quickly, more than 16 billion euros would be committed to support research and probably to enable, in just a few months, probably less than a year, whereas usually it takes eight to ten years, to develop a vaccine to deal with a disease that , until a year ago, was largely unknown to scientists all over the world. In 2020, we have also faced economic recovery and the necessary transformation. As early as July, thanks to proposals from Member States, issued by the European Parliament, and a commission proposal, unprecedented decisions were taken. Never in its history has the European Union had at its disposal a budgetary firepower as is the case today, with 1,800 billion euros that can be mobilised. Not just any way, not to do anything, because we have clear ideas about our visionary role at the international level and on this climate ambition that was anchored in December 2019, with our ambition to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. And then, a few days ago, there was the decision to increase our efforts by 2030, which makes this ambition credible and reinforces the European Union's position as a global leader in the field of climate change. This European Green Pact is more than a project of prosperity, it is also a social project to mobilise all European actors, citizens, young people, businesses, small, medium and large, governments, municipalities... To be together, to stand together, to roll up their sleeves to progress, with this goal, which is so important. And it is true that in the coming months we will also be very mobilized to ensure that we can anchor these values that have founded the European project since its creation, for the dignity of every human being. This dignity goes through the rule of law, it goes through non-discrimination, it goes through respect for fundamental freedoms, it goes through the guarantees of fairness when we are faced with differences or questions. That is what I want to support today and which is probably one of the essential elements of this decision taken at the European Council: not a hair of the legal text of the conditionality mechanism has been affected by the decision. So, of course, I want to say this solemnly and forcefully, the European Council fully respects the division of responsibilities provided for by the treaties. In this context, we also assume our political role because this assembly, which brings together not only the Commission but also the 27 heads of state or government, has the responsibility to give political direction. And when we face difficulties, as is the case today, it is also our duty to take decisions to ensure that we can engage the European Union on the budgetary path, on the path of values and on the path to climate. Believe me that my wish, after a year of modest but exciting experience of working in cooperation, also with Parliament, is to remain committed throughout 2021 to full cooperation with all legitimate democratic institutions and, of course, also with the European Parliament to move Europe in the right direction. I conclude without triumphalism: we know the many challenges that are still before us - COVID-19, climate, digital agenda, social transition - and the implications for our fellow citizens who are also linked to these subjects. But more than ever I believe that, compared to a few months ago, in relation to this COVID-19 threat that has shaken us, which has shaken us, the European Union is standing.

No. The question must be: does this budget respond to the social and climate emergency? Is this budget learning all the lessons from the health crisis? However, on the social side, we have no guarantee that the new European tax will not be borne by workers or break with the market. On the climate front, the targets have been raised, very well, but the means do not follow.

Unfortunately, the Conclusions of the European Council go well beyond its mandate as provided for in the Treaties. I believe that attempting to interfere with the independence of the European Commission by obliging it not to propose measures under the budgetary conditionality mechanism until a possible ruling by the CJEU (therefore not applying EU law by then) and narrowing the scope of this regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council of the EU clearly violates the principle of institutional balance.

According to a study presented by the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry in September 2020, these new requirements will lead to a further tightening of the European emissions trading system. The high CO2 prices have a major impact on industrial companies, which are, after all, part of this emissions trading scheme. If only companies within the European Union have to bear these costs, there is a very high risk that these companies will relocate their activities. So there is a risk of losing these companies to Germany and Europe, and greenhouse gas emissions will not be reduced, they will only be relocated. The CO2 target as a driver, the one-sided focus on electric vehicles with the war against the internal combustion engine has serious consequences for our employment.

However brutal and ruthless the methods of government are and how strong the fear they are of instilling, this cannot resist the prolonged protests of citizens of the whole people of Belarus. \"We woke up and we will not fall asleep again\" you said during the Unity Marches. It's true. Belarus is no longer afraid. The authorities, the government, have also understood this. The people of Belarus have shown that no authoritarianism can block change and the opening of a new chapter in the history of your country.  Ladies and gentlemen, your fight is our struggle and this is not the first time that we have awarded a collective prize to Sakharov Prize winners. In 2004, the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize to the Belarusian Association of Journalists for defending press freedom. I would also like to congratulate them on their constant commitment and the spirit of sacrifice to inform and inform us and on the spirit of sacrifice they have shown over the last few months. In 2006, we awarded the prize to Aliaksandr Milinkevich, who was the leader of the united democratic opposition forces in Belarus at the time, and we remember him fondly. The European Union's message is clear: Belarusian citizens must fully enjoy their democratic rights and live in freedom. We in the European Union have a moral duty to support them. We also have a duty to support all those around the world who are fighting your own struggle.  Before giving the floor to Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, I would also like to congratulate and send a message of support to this year's finalists: the environmental activists of Guapinol and Berta Cáceres of Honduras and Monsignor Najeeb Michaeel, Archbishop of Mosul. I cannot finish without mentioning our Sakharov Prize finalists who are still in prison and demanding their release: Ilham Tothi, Raif Badawi, Nasrin Sotoudeh, who has just been imprisoned again by the Iranian authorities, despite its fragile, very fragile health conditions. We greet them all and we are always and constantly close to them. (Applause) Thank you for your attention and your participation and I now give the floor to Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya for her speech.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 99, "date": "2020-12-16.json", "name": "Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Winner of the 2020 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. – Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, this year the world has seen Belarus awakening. We stood for our freedom, dignity, national identity, but we faced the brutal nature of the regime. Two realities confronted. Peaceful bright people with flags and flowers against armed men in black hiding their faces behind balaclavas. We feel humbled that our story of resistance touched so many people across the globe. On your way to the European Parliament, you could see a shocking photo on the façade of the building. A woman in white falling down to her knees before the riot police. It’s not a wartime movie scene, it’s a ‘peaceful’ Belarus in 2020. People locked inside a cathedral by special forces. It’s a ‘peaceful’ Belarus. Detainees marked with different colours to determine how severely they should be beaten by the police officers, and it is a ‘peaceful’ Belarus. Deliberately infecting prisoners with COVID—19. It is a ‘peaceful’ Belarus – in the heart of Europe. Fear is what one feels hearing those stories. I am one of the thousands of Belarusians who used to be afraid. An invisible wall of fear was built around us. This wall of fear held us back for almost three decades. But this year everything has changed. This year we united in our aspiration for change. United, we believed that this wall of fear can be taken down, brick by brick. United, we overcome our fear on the way to freedom, day by day, week by week, month by month. The photo on the façade of the European Parliament is not a story of fear, it is a story of hope, courage and freedom. For the third time in 20 years, Belarusians have been honoured with the Sakharov Freedom of Thought Prize. What is better recognition that we are freethinkers? What is better motivation for us to keep going? We are bound to win, and we will win. A simple wish to walk freely in the streets of our cities and towns keeps us going. Desire to celebrate holidays with our families keeps us going. The dream of a better future for Belarus keeps us going. A Belarus where justice and truth prevail. A Belarus that our children can be proud of. I am endlessly honoured to speak in front of you. We receive this prize together with the brave Belarusians Maria Kalesnikava, Veranika Tsapkala, Sviatlana Aleksievich, Volha Kavalkova, Ales Bialiatski, Mikola Statkevich, Siarhei Tsikhanouski, Siarhei Dyleuski, Stsiapan Putsila and all the members of the Coordination Council. (Applause) But we are not alone here today. Beside us are thousands of Belarusians who inspire us, give us strength and hope. Many of them are not here today. Our courageous women, workers, students, doctors, teachers, lawyers, writers, journalists and activists – all of them are in Belarus fighting for our freedom. It is to them that this prize belongs. (Applause) Last Sunday, I met with our distinguished Belarusian writer Sviatlana Aleksievich, who is with us remotely today. Sviatlana received the Nobel Prize for telling the stories of a ‘little big man’ in the light of historic events. This is how she created ‘a monument to suffering and courage in our time’. For me, such a ‘little big man’ is each and every Belarusian who takes part in this peaceful protest against violence and lawlessness. Each of them is a hero. Each of them is an example of courage, compassion, and dignity to me.  Freedom is made of simple things and often requires fearless resistance. For Aliaksandr Taraikouski it was protesting against the falsified election. He stood raising his bare hands in front of men with rifles and he was shot dead. Fearless he was. For the artist Raman Bandarenka it was going out to protect the national symbols in the courtyard where neighbours gather. He was kidnapped and beaten to death in the police office. Fearless he was. The journalist Katsiaryna Barysevich and the doctor Artsiom Sarokin dared to unveil the truth about this murder by the regime cronies. This bravery cost their freedom. Fearless they are. Natalia Hershe could not stay on the sidelines and came back to Belarus after living abroad for many years. Out of solidarity, she participated in peaceful protests and was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for taking the mask off the police. Fearless she is. Freedom is victory over fear. Seventy-three-year-old Nina Baginskaya … (Applause)  … has become a symbol of our struggle. Despite countless detentions and intimidation, she has been protesting against injustice for 30 years already, often alone. Truly free she is. Mikola Statkevich … (Applause) … was a presidential candidate in the 2010 election. He has been imprisoned and recognised as a political prisoner for the third time in 15 years. His commitment to the values of freedom is something that no prison sentence can take away. Truly free he is. My friend Maria Kalesnikava tore up her passport and chose prison over exile to remain in Belarus, with our people. Truly free she is. My thoughts are with her every day.  My husband Siarhei Tsikhanouski decided to tell the truth no matter the cost. For that, he was thrown in jail on trumped—up charges. He has not seen his family for seven months already. But these are only some of the courageous people our European nation is extremely proud of. Freedom is also universal. Belarusians have been marching every week since the 9 August election. They march for their future and the future of those who cannot be there. They march for the freedom and dignity of Belarusians, of Europeans – yours, and ours. Without a free Belarus, Europe is not fully free either. We ask Europe and the whole world to stand with Belarus. We call on Europe to be braver in their decisions and support the people of Belarus now, not tomorrow, and not sometime in the future. Standing for human rights and democracy is not interference but is the duty of each self—respecting country. Your solidarity and your voice are important but it is actions that matter. Please, be there for the Belarusians and be assured that Belarusians will do the same for you in the future. I have only one wish this year. I want every Belarusian who is now in jail or was forced to live in exile to return home. The third Sakharov Prize will mark a new beginning for Belarus. Nelson Mandela, who received the prize in 1988 together with the Soviet dissident Anatoly Marchenko, said: ‘I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it’. He believed that brave are those who conquer their fear. Only united we can fully conquer fear on our long path to freedom and build a new Belarus. Every country has its own path to democracy, and this is ours. Long live Europe! Long live Belarus! Zhiv’e Bielarus!

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. We are currently experiencing a health crisis of enormous proportions worldwide, especially in Europe. This morning in the debate, we have sent out a clear signal that we want to come out of this crisis in solidarity and together, that we are also trying to mitigate the serious social and economic consequences of the pandemic as best we can, with a large programme, with a multiannual financial framework – that is, with a lot of money, but also with a great deal of commitment. We all know, of course, that this is not enough. In these days and weeks, we are witnessing a second, sometimes even a third wave, in many Member States of the European Union. In my own country, Germany, we have more deaths than ever before. Today a sad climax: 950 people. Several hundred thousand people have already died, millions of people have been infected, some of them seriously ill. We have introduced restrictive measures in our Member States to protect citizens as best we can. But hopefully one remedy will soon help us say that we have contained this pandemic – and that is a vaccine. Only with a vaccine can we defeat the virus.  But there is still a great deal to be done. Since this virus does not have a passport, as this virus does not care about national borders, it was necessary from the outset to develop European strategies. We have achieved this in the area of the vaccine. First of all, my great respect and gratitude to researchers, but also to companies and companies from Europe, who have helped us to develop such a vaccine in the shortest possible time. Two vaccines will soon be approved in the EU. We know that only the development, production and introduction of safe and effective vaccines will be a lasting and sustainable solution to the fight against this serious health crisis. And we have opted for a common approach.  I know that there has been a great deal of unrest in our people, given that some countries – the United Kingdom, Israel, but also the United States of America – have already been approved. However, we did not focus on national strategies, but we said that we are going down a common European path through the EMA. We do not want us to enter into competition between the Member States, but we want the vaccine to be made available to all citizens of the European Union at the same time.  This will not be easy, because, of course, at the beginning of the authorisation – which I hope will take place very soon, possibly as early as 21 December – there are not yet so many vaccines that all the people who need it can be vaccinated immediately. This is also disputed. There are discussions in all Member States about who should be vaccinated first. And there are also states that are discussing whether to introduce a vaccination obligation. Vaccination plans always focus on: the elderly, medical professionals, people with pre-existing conditions. These are the main target groups that are given priority in Member States' vaccination strategies. I am extremely grateful to the Commission for having managed to generate an option for almost two billion doses of vaccines. It is therefore clear that, no matter where people live in the European Union, with our joint effort, coordinated by the Commission, they will really be given the protection to which they are entitled. I hope that these accesses will also be made available as free of charge as possible. Let me mention another important point, which is already a bit upside down when it comes to the question of who is the first and who is the fastest: communication. I do not know how you are doing, honourable Members. I am sometimes stunned by campaigns – including social media – about how people are scared because they should be vaccinated. The disease itself is certainly far more dangerous than any vaccination. However, we must be careful not to give the impression that the appropriate authorisation procedures and authorisation procedures are subject to political influence. We must trust citizens. We must convince them that as many people as possible who get vaccinated – 60 to 70 per cent – will only provide a guarantee that an entire society can be protected. Finally, the collection of post-authorisation and post-authorisation monitoring data Formal monitoring studies are key elements of a vaccination programme so that all people know what can happen in the event of side effects, and so that new fears do not arise there. We have to take this very, very seriously.  Honourable Members, but we have not only taken care of the security and protection of our own citizens in the EU, but we have, of course, also looked at the global dimension of this crisis, and I am grateful for that too. The Commission has joined the so-called COVAX facility and has contributed to this. In other words, we are showing international solidarity. We know that only if, in our neighbourhood, in the states with which we cooperate, where there is an exchange, this serious pandemic can be combated just as successfully. It should therefore also be in our interest that we help, both financially and organisationally, with those states that do not have the financial capacity that the European Union is grateful to have. So it is our overarching common goal to accelerate the development, production, and delivery of vaccines so that everyone – everywhere – has access to vaccines at affordable prices. Yes, vaccinations are not a miracle weapon either, allowing us to return to a normal life immediately. The old normal will no longer exist – there will have to be a new normal. We must continue to work together for the common good and continue to abide by the rules we have agreed in our daily lives: wear a mask, keep their distance, comply with hygiene rules and, above all, take responsibility for our neighbours, for our loved ones, even now during the Christmas holidays, even if we find it difficult. As politicians, we should also lead by example.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 103, "date": "2020-12-16.json", "name": "Margaritis Schinas", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, we are living in turbulent times. The health situation across Europe is extremely uncertain. The impact of the pandemic on our economies and societies is unprecedented and the threat unfortunately remains very real. As we approach this end-of-year holiday season, it is only natural that families and friends wish to travel and spend time together. But make no mistake. We are still very much in the middle of this pandemic and we cannot afford to be complacent. Yet the prospect of a COVID—19 vaccine provides some light at the end of the tunnel. Allow me to stress once again the three golden principles that are guiding the Commission’s work in this field, namely equal access, affordability and safety. In recent months, the Commission has been negotiating intensively to build a diversified portfolio of vaccines at fair prices and is working at full speed to review their safety and make them available.  As you know, in Europe the decision on the authorisation of these vaccines is not in the hands of politicians nor the hands of institutions, but in the hands of independent regulatory agencies, in our case the European Medicines Agency (EMA). As I think you know by now, we are aiming to authorise the Pfizer—BioNTech vaccine by the end of the year. The EMA has already announced its intention to provide for an authorisation next Monday. If this is the case, the Commission is ready to provide the formal authorisation and placing on the market in supersonic fast procedures. In two days we can do the formal authorisation that normally, for this type of authorisation for placing on the market, can take two months. This means that this vaccine will be the Christmas gift for all Europeans if everything goes well. We also know that, before mid—January, we will also have an opinion from EMA on the other vaccine by Moderna. EMA is also now currently conducting rolling reviews on the vaccines produced by AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson. Once authorised, we will secure access to these vaccines for all EU citizens at the same time. But, for this to happen, Member States need to have all preparations in place and activate their national vaccination plans. We already provided guidance in October in that respect and this is being done in a coordinated manner. All our Member States are making great efforts to put in place robust vaccination plans. These include identification of priority groups to be vaccinated first, ensuring solid supply chains, logistics and infrastructure, training staff or developing electronic vaccination registries. There is still much to do and certainly many challenges to overcome, but the Commission stands ready and committed to help.  We are also providing support to Member States on communication around COVID—19 vaccines. As someone who fought against the virus, not only as a Member of the College, but also from a hospital bed, I wish to say that nobody should underestimate or negate the threat we are facing nor the usefulness of the vaccines. It is important that our citizens understand that we have not cut corners on safety and the vaccines do not pose a risk. Europe will only authorise vaccines for our citizens under the sole condition that they are safe. Building trust is of course key to ensure a high vaccination uptake and everybody knows by now that this is, and should be, our collective priority, because at the end of the day vaccines in themselves do not save lives. Vaccination does.  We must also remember that the European Union has a duty to the world. We know that no one is safe until everyone is safe and that is why we aim to ensure universal and equitable access not only to vaccines, but also to diagnostics and therapeutics for all, including the most vulnerable populations living in the poorest and most fragile countries. No one should and no one will be left behind. Europe has been leading the international solidarity efforts to establish the COVAX Facility. Team Europe, our institutions and our Member States, is now the largest contributor to COVAX to purchase and deliver vaccines to low-income countries as part of a collective objective to buy two billion vaccine doses by the end of next year. The European Union is deeply and firmly committed to multilateralism and joint coordination with multilateral institutions.  We are the European Union and in our values we are guided by the principles of solidarity and unity of purpose. As such, we will donate under the Team Europe approach – we and our Member States – a proportion of our vaccines to our Western Balkan partners in our neighbourhood, as well as for humanitarian assistance and to frontline health workers in the poorest countries. This is a temporary solution to bridge the time gap until vaccines from COVAX are broadly available and we are currently working on a methodology to make this happen.  We will also ensure – and I know that this is an issue of interest to many of you – that intellectual property rights are not an obstacle to universal access to vaccines, including in developing countries that have no production capacity or have limited financial resources. Last but not least, as the European Union, we need to advance rapidly on getting our own European health union off the ground. Several proposals are already on the table. Others will follow. I am grateful to this House for your consistent support for all these initiatives from the Commission.  I wish to emphasise the importance of remaining vigilant. Whilst we advance our work on vaccines – and we are now getting to the later stage – it is essential to keep reducing transmission of the virus through effective testing, contact tracing and isolation until the immediate danger is behind us. Responsibility, both collective and individual, remains essential to get our lives and businesses restarted, but also to reduce the pressure on our heroic healthcare workers, whose immense efforts in the last months need to be not only acknowledged, but compensated. Our European way of life has been severely tested in these eight months, but it did not collapse. It resisted. Our resilient societies, our resilient health systems and the universality of our schools and education proved that, although we are tested we can manage, and we did manage because we are in this together.

I am very angry with the people who are still trivialising Corona and saying that there is no need for a vaccine at all. However, I am also angry at some politicians and, unfortunately, some journalists who are discrediting the process of admission in Europe, mostly without any knowledge of the facts – unfortunately not only tabloid media, but also actually serious media.

After months of suffering and pain we see the light at the end of the tunnel. Thanks to the Commission's concerted action and the support of the Member States, we have achieved equitable access to vaccine doses. This achievement demonstrates what we are able to do when we speak and work with one voice.  We must now articulate a common vaccination process. And as we continue to fight the virus, we must provide an equally ambitious response in the field of international cooperation. If we want to be effective, vaccines must be produced at scale, distributed equally around the world, and affordable for all. Ensuring that all people can be immunized at the same time is a humanitarian imperative and a precondition for ensuring well-being.  The European Union's support for the global CONSORTIUM COVAX, which is promoted by the World Health Organization, is essential for vaccinating in the most vulnerable countries. As long as the disease resists somewhere, it will remain a threat to other places. The implementation of strong and inclusive health systems should be a priority of the Health Union, but also a fundamental pillar of our development cooperation programmes. Now, more than at any other time in the last seventy years, we need to draw inspiration from the principles of solidarity and international cooperation.

And this has been the case because never in history have we known public-private funding of such magnitude to accelerate the discovery of a drug. We have invested a lot of public money to accelerate technical knowledge that already existed, and it is important that European citizens know this, because the best vaccination strategy is for citizens to be vaccinated and, for citizens to be vaccinated, they have to have confidence.  And the European Union has been away from the 'marketing coup'. We have not made any political careers, because we have not eliminated any safety requirements for vaccines to be approved. That is why the European Medicines Agency works with scientific and technical criteria, out of pressure or any other political time.

When are you going to allow Members to consult the contracts signed with the industry so that we can at least see the liability clauses before the vaccination of citizens begins?

Are we just thinking about ourselves? Are we thinking only of the citizens of the European Union?

The European Union and governments, in the context of health-goods, see the vaccine as another source of profitability for monopolies. Safe pharmaceutical companies were subsidised for all stages, from research, manufacturing, pre-purchase to the disposal of the vaccine. They hide the research results from each other, preventing interdisciplinary cooperation that does not fit into capitalist competition.  A question mark is why the issue of treatments and medicines that appear to be contributing against the virus is not being promoted.

Let me start with the three areas where I think we all agree before addressing some of the specific points raised. First, we all agree that the arrival of the COVID—19 vaccines does not mean that the pandemic is over. I think this is a strong message that should come out of this debate. We also agree on the importance of the three golden principles that we set out some time ago, namely equal access, affordability and safety of vaccines. And finally, we do agree on something that is particularly important these days, that in Europe we do not improvise on safety. Nor do we cut corners on the procedures that we have established, and the European model is that independent regulatory authorities have to do their job and politicians have to base their authorisation on sound, scientific evidence. I think the strong support that all of you have shown through this process says a lot.  Let me now address three specific issues where some of you have raised the need for further explanations from the Commission. Let me start first with the issue of confidentiality. We fully recognise the importance of transparency in this process. Transparency is a guiding principle in all our work in the Commission. It is publicly known with which companies we have been negotiating, what type of vaccines and the process through which we have been doing this together with our Member States, but it should be clear that we are indeed bound by the confidentiality clauses in these contracts. Disclosure of any confidential information at this moment in time could undermine the ongoing negotiations we have with other companies, and, as the European Union, we would need to keep as strong a negotiating position as possible.  We cannot unilaterally decide to disclose confidential information such as information on prices under these contracts unless the companies themselves agree to it, and we are in the middle of negotiations which are still ongoing. However, on many occasions Commissioner Kyriakides has confirmed to you in this House that the Commission is ready within the contractual constraints and according to the rules for transmission of confidential information to the European Parliament to make information from these contracts available to nominated Members of this Parliament with specific arrangements once the sensitive ongoing negotiations are concluded.  Another issue that has been raised by many of you is the issue of TRIPS and intellectual property protections. I want to repeat in this House that we will ensure that intellectual property rights are not an obstacle to the universal access to vaccines, including in developing countries that do not have the means to cope. Mr Lange asked for a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer, but I think my answer is pretty clear – that there is an ongoing discussion now in the WTO on the idea of a waiver of intellectual property rights and protections and there are also important flexibilities so that the relevant trade agreement – TRIPS – could allow us to reach the same objective. But, in any case, I want to assure everybody here that we are ready to continue this discussion so that nothing stands in the way and that more vaccines get to where they’re needed worldwide.  Finally, some of you have raised the issue of campaigns. Of course, we are very sensitive and we shall encourage our Member States to continue with their national plans and public information campaigns on vaccination. We will have our own European campaign, if you like, which will be unveiled in the days to come. We do not compete with our Member States on information, but I think we can provide a useful complement to this process. And to that extent we will not only explain factually the benefits of the vaccines that are put on the market, but we would also like to mobilise important role models, important known Europeans. Some UEFA players have already kindly accepted our invitation to participate in our European campaigns, so stay tuned for that.  The rollout of the vaccines is a challenge of historic dimensions. This is a historic moment, and after all the work we’ve been doing for months, I am convinced that we’ll get it right.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 132, "date": "2020-12-16.json", "name": "Michael Roth", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. The debate here in the European Parliament today has shown the breadth of all the arguments: some people are not fast enough, others are already warning – even though the vaccine has not yet been approved – of the possible consequences. Yes, honourable Members, we live in a risky situation, and if every headache remedy has side effects, it cannot, of course, be ruled out that this vaccine has side effects. No one says that this is without side effects. We have invested a great deal of money to shorten the usually long years it takes to allow a vaccine to be researched, to research it, to spend many billions to give people the protection they desperately need.  Nobody in the Council, no one in the Commission, no one who is in his right mind, stands here and claims that there is any solution that promises a 100% guarantee. I am somewhat perplexed when some Members – especially in this segment – stand here and arrogantly ignore the various strategies of the Member States, even though nationalists and populists in particular have repeatedly given the impression that it is a flu, a sniff that immediately goes away, that it is not necessary to take it seriously, that wearing a mask is superfluous. All these demonstrations, where human lives were risked, where police officers were used for violence, there is also a political responsibility for this. I would like to make that clear here.  I cannot just sit down here and say: yes, I have a 100% solution here. What we are doing at the moment remains fraught with risks. My only request to you, honourable Members, is that, at least here, we manage to have a fact-based, reason-based, fear-free discussion as political leaders in national governments, in the Commission, but also in Parliament. Out there, outside this room, the fear is already great enough – we are experiencing this in our own families. That is why we have a responsibility to ensure security, as far as a democracy can achieve. Of course, there are others who are faster. The Russians and the Chinese who vaccinate everywhere. Yes, but these are vaccines, which are not yet approved by us. I am seeing this myself: a Member has just mentioned how some media, but also some political forces, are playing their game with it. We just take our time. We must guarantee that – even if research into this vaccine has gone very, very quickly, really revolutionaryfast – then in the end the risks, including in terms of side effects, are responsible.  Some Members have made it clear once again, for very, very good reasons, that it cannot be enough for us in the European Union to look at ourselves alone. There must always be a strategy for how we can contribute globally. So far, however, I have the impression that the European Union – and everything is still better to do – has already done a great deal. After all, the connection to the so-called COVAX facility also includes specific financial contributions, and some EUR 860 million has already been paid by the EU and the Member States. Of course, it will also be a question of creating the conditions for – once again – access to this vaccine not to be measured by how economically strong a country is, how much money citizens have, or where they live in this world. We, as the European Union, must set an example in this respect. I have understood this message today, and I want to reassure you that we, as the Council, are also trying to live up to this responsibility.  Ladies and gentlemen, there is still a very, very long way to go. If the first vaccine can finally be used, then it is not a miracle weapon either. But it is a very, very important signal to take people's worries away. The economic and social consequences are, of course, devastating.

There is much to learn from the crisis for the future. However, the Commission has managed to do relatively well in the coronavirus crisis on issues where it has decision-making powers and opportunities for action. The clearest example of this is the vaccines currently under discussion. It is thanks to the European Union that large investments in vaccine research and rapid joint agreements on the purchase of vaccines have been possible. Neither Member State alone could have achieved, especially on such a timetable. We would like this to be visible in the future, not only as a greater appreciation of European cooperation, but also in science and research. At the same time, I must say that I am disappointed with the coordination between the Member States, particularly with regard to travel restrictions. The coronavirus will be with us for a long time to come, and it is absolutely essential that member states should be able to act more uniformly in the future in order to contain the pandemic. Cooperation between Member States is key to the most effective and fair distribution of vaccines and to respond to vaccine criticality. The Commission's new opening of the Health Union and the larger EU4Health programme will contribute to closer cooperation in the fight against health threats. The coronavirus is a global crisis to respond to which we need not only action at EU level, but also global cooperation. The European Union must take responsibility in this situation so that the distribution of vaccines can also be made possible in the poorest countries. The Commission is therefore rightly committed to supporting the development of vaccines, medicines and diagnostics and the equal global availability of vaccines.

How will the cold chain be guaranteed from the moment of production of the vaccine until its administration? In addition, the methods of administration are not yet clear: how many doses should be given to people? Other questions concern vaccine prices. Why do some cost EUR 30 per dose, while others, such as the Oxford vaccine, do not even cost three euros? And on time, why has the UK already started vaccinating for over a week, while in the European Union they continue to tell us vague and unsciable dates about approval by the EMA?

Mr President, I would like to thank the Our joint work to improve the security of our citizens and our societies is a constant test, and with the Council conclusions on internal security and a European police partnership, we have launched a necessary process of reflection in order to significantly improve the future of internal security, especially with regard to the European dimension. And we have also succeeded in doing so: together with the joint ministerial declaration of November, which was adopted in the wake of the terrorist attacks in several Member States, and the Council resolution on encryption, this sets the direction for the work that lies ahead, and that will not be easy. We have identified a number of priorities, including instruments that have already been agreed, but which need to be implemented more quickly and better, and, of course, instruments where there are gaps and which need to be better addressed in the future. The recent terrorist attacks, honourable Members, have made it alarmingly clear that the online environment plays a very central role in providing a platform and a voice for violent extremism and terrorism. Several current and future initiatives are making a significant contribution to combating this development, such as the proposal on online terrorist content, on which political agreement has just been reached thanks to excellent cooperation between the European Parliament and the Council, as well as the recent proposal on the Digital Services Act. The attacks have also highlighted the test faced by law enforcement, judicial and security authorities in accessing digital information, especially when it is encrypted. We must ensure that our law enforcement and judicial authorities have the same legitimate powers and powers online and offline. It is in everyone's interest, honourable Members, that the Internet should not become a lawless area or a safe haven for criminals, and there is actually a very, very simple rule, honourable Members, which we simply have to implement: what is illegal offline is and must also be illegal online. Of course, we need to find a balance here, and we do not have a panacea for that either. This is also subject to democratic debate, especially with civil society, with experts. This is the balance between security on the one hand and fundamental rights in data protection on the other. And for this we need a broad inclusive and transparent dialogue between the various leaders, and in this area, of course, the European Union also has a very important role to play in this, also because of cross-border crime. Likewise, the use of artificial intelligence, access to data, the use of big data in law enforcement and internal security are relevant aspects that we need to address very quickly. I would also like to highlight our agencies, which play a very important role in this, in a forward-looking and responsible security agency that also supports the Member States in their tasks. We need to see how we can ensure that all law enforcement officers have access to all the information they need, how we can get more out of the wealth of information already available in our information systems, how we can work together more concretely and exchange information more efficiently across borders every day. Now perhaps some of you will say, 'Yes, why are you talking like this? Could have been done a long time ago.\" Yes! It is also, of course, essentially due to the fact that internal security issues are one of the core competences of the Member States. And there are no automatisms. And, of course, we need to be more preventive here. And we must also learn from serious crimes, especially from the horrific acts of terrorism, because we must of course recognise that these are not national phenomena; these are international phenomena, they are European phenomena. The implementation of all these measures, which I have now mentioned only very briefly, is part of the wider effort to contribute to the Union's objective, enshrined in the Treaties, of providing citizens with a common area of freedom, security and justice. This area, without internal borders, in which the free movement of people is guaranteed – especially now in this serious pandemic – is the purpose of the Schengen area. However, this Schengen area can only will then be permanently preserved in a crisis-ridden and terror-stricken world if we improve security cooperation, put it on a new footing, so that freedom and freedom of movement are guaranteed in the long term.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 139, "date": "2020-12-16.json", "name": "Margaritis Schinas", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, let me tell you how delighted I am to be able to switch from one pillar of the European way of life, normally public health, to another – security.  I welcome this resolution that we’re discussing today. The threats that we face today are many and varied, but they have something in common: they are fast moving, cross—border and cross—sectoral. Most of them work across borders, across national borders, across the distinction between online and offline and across the divide of internal and external security. All this points to the very simple fact that we need a joined—up European approach to cope with this evolving landscape of threats, and this is exactly what we did last July when we presented our new EU Security Union Strategy to be coherent and comprehensive, to break down the many barriers and many silos that stand in the way of the EU delivering security to citizens.  This strategy is our ambition for the coordinated work for the next five years, and we want it to be understood as a single roof underneath which we can build an edifice with individual rooms, that are now being constructed. These range from combating terrorism and organised crime to preventing and detecting hybrid threats, increasing the resilience of our critical infrastructure, promoting cybersecurity and fostering research and innovation. So I can only therefore welcome the opportunity that you give us through this resolution to be able to discuss our work in these areas.  Before I go into the design and implementation of the single roof, let me tell you how important we consider the issue and the place of fundamental rights in security policy. This is the touchstone for all our work and is indispensable as our common purpose. I do not see fundamental rights, being in charge of the Security Union, as an accessory or something that we have to visit ex post. I think that the issue of fundamental rights is a precondition before contemplating any security measures and there are ways to compromise and conciliate these two objectives, which are not as antithetical as some people want to make us believe. Let me now come to implementation. Implementation of the new Security Union started immediately on the day of its adoption, with a presentation on the agenda for the fight against drugs and action against firearms, that was also in the previous Commission. Last week we took another major step forward – the EU agenda on counter—terrorism following the heinous attacks in France and in Vienna. We want to strengthen the EU’s work to add value to Member States’ responsibilities, to anticipate, prevent, protect from and respond to terrorists. It sets out very concrete actions to help us do precisely that and we have also accompanied this proposal with another one for a reinforced mandate for Europol to be able to cope with these new types of threat. Europol, as you know, functions as police cooperation. With our proposal for a new mandate they can do much more.  Let me also welcome the – I would say historic – agreement reached last week on the regulation on terrorist content online. This is something that we need, and it was long overdue. Just three hours ago today, the Commission announced the strengthening of our cybersecurity strategy, which is most and foremost about security. Cybersecurity is not simply a consideration for a market, it’s not a consideration for businesses, it’s a consideration for society and the way we protect our people. The new cybersecurity strategy also includes two legislative proposals for the revision of our tools that need modernisation, like the Network and Information Systems Directive (NIS), and the critical infrastructure, the physical infrastructure. Both these proposals have been presented today. So there our idea is to reinforce and modernise anything that we can do to cope with cyber threats and cyber attacks.  Let me also highlight the importance of enforcement in all of this. For the first time, in the new NIS directive, we have specifically introduced the possibility for fines to facilitate enforcement and make sure that everybody plays by the rules. Last week, we also adopted a product which is very popular in this House – the progress report under the Security Union. This was the first progress report of this Commission and it shows that a lot has been done to support Member States in the past year. But we need to keep the momentum, and the citizens rightly expect not only pledges but also delivery.  There is much discussion and debate on whether this community EU action in the area of security is something that makes the European Union compete against our Member States. I think the Minister put it very right: we do not compete with anyone, we complement and produce added value to allow for the European Union to dissipate, organise and respond to these security threats.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 140, "date": "2020-12-16.json", "name": "Jeroen Lenaers", "mepid": "95074", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, we have a strong set of security rules in place at EU level, but they are only good when they are effectively implemented. These were the words of Commissioner Schinas last week on the presentation of the progress report, and I think it’s the key message that we also need to put out here today. Because he’s right: a lot of work has been done in the past years. We have worked on the EU’s information systems and their interoperability; we have worked on combating terrorism, on protecting borders, on combating child abuse. And yet we see here that the regulations and the directives are in place, but we still have to read – and this is so frustrating – that, for instance, when it comes to the implementation of the anti-terror directive, huge gaps are still there; that there are infringement procedures against 23 Member States for not properly following the rules on tackling child abuse. This is, quite frankly, unacceptable, and we need to make sure that the eagerness with which we adopt rules is at least matched by the eagerness with which these rules are implemented, and that is a call on the Member States. So I strongly support the Commission’s approach on focusing relentlessly on implementation and enforcement. But next to implementation, additional efforts are absolutely needed. European citizens count on and expect us to deliver on security. We need to strengthen Europol’s mandate to be better equipped for today’s security challenges. We need to have more and better information-sharing between Member States. We need to have a better protection for societies against hybrid threats and foreign interference and disinformation, and we need to find a way to make sure that encryption continues to protect our privacy but no longer provides a shield for criminal behaviour.

And I would like to stress that security is a right in itself, a fundamental right enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union in the same article as the fundamental right to freedom and on an equal footing with it.  This Commission Communication places four strategic bets: the future, changing threats, terrorism and organised crime — of course!— and a safe ecosystem which envisages immediate or ongoing initiatives: those relating to the criminal prosecution of child sexual abuse, drugs and, of course, the trafficking in firearms.  But this European Parliament is speaking out in this debate. In the committee I chair — the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs — we have discussed this Commission Communication and made our contribution by pointing out, of course, the commitment to the fundamental rights and founding values of the Union, but also the need to shore up the fight against terrorism and the implementation and implementation of existing legislation , because there is anti-terrorism legislation adopted by this European Parliament.  There is European criminal law: there is an anti-terrorism directive in force, 2012; there is a 2011 Directive against child sexual abuse and child pornography; and a 2012 Victim Protection Directive.  But stressing the importance of implementation and implementation, it is important that we also be minded at the need to strengthen our commitment to terror and organized crime, against child sexual abuse, against trafficking in human beings on dangerous migration routes and, of course, against drugs. And, there, the Commission has effectively committed itself to a new counter-terrorism agenda, with a new anti-drug agenda, with a new cybersecurity agenda. And the committee I chair undertakes to complete the legislative work on the Regulation on online terrorist content. But finally, I would like to make a reference to the institutional dimension, because there are agencies that are operational and subject to the scrutiny of this European Parliament: Europol, CEPOL (the Agency for Police Training) and Eurojust.  Today I participated in the inaugural platform conference to combat the encryption used by organized crime: Europol Joint Research Centre Decryption Platform.

But with my Group Renew Europe, we are advocating more ambitious measures to make Europol the real armed arm of the Union in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, a real European FBI. We propose to increase Europol's powers to collect police data and produce joint analyses between Member States, to increase Europol's leadership role in cross-border investigations and to enable the surveillance of foreign fighters on European soil. I would also like, Mr Vice-President, to share a strong concern about the adequate funding of these measures.

Unfortunately, this threat also lies in our countries, because a few weeks ago we talked about the sale of citizenship by some countries, including the most dangerous criminals. We have people smuggling, smuggling, which today brings more revenue than the arms or drug trade. And what? Member States, through, for example, various NGOs, also support these criminals.

How can the Commission ensure the protection of European citizens when more than one hundred thousand illegal immigrants have already entered Europe this year, forty thousand alone in Spain? I would remind you that two of the Islamist attacks that have shocked Europe the most — the deaths of three Catholics in Nice Cathedral and the beheading of a teacher in France — have been committed by false refugees.  On the other hand, Commissioner, how will measures to combat organised crime be ensured if a new, more effective European order, as well as measures for the recognition of judicial and police decisions, are not immediately implemented? The other day we saw the Belgian courts deny the surrender to Spain of the so-called rapper Valt-nyc, who, in his songs, announced or called for the death of Spanish civilian guards.

We have already achieved a lot, but we need to keep up the momentum, and that’s why I would encourage the co-legislators to quickly adopt some of the interesting proposals that are new and are on the table now. I would make particular mention of the need for a quick start to the discussions and work on the revised regulation on Europol. This proposal is essential to give law enforcement authorities better tools to combat organised crime and terrorism, and we need it sooner rather than later. Let me also seize the occasion to advance some of the proposals that we will be presenting next year in the area of security, continuing to build these individual rooms under the single roof of our Security Union Strategy.  Cooperation depends on information, so the exchange of data will be key, and that means engaging with the right authorities and ensuring that the right safeguards are in place, and Eurojust will be an important focus on this. We will also take measures such as an EU agenda to tackle organised crime and new legislation to effectively tackle child sexual abuse online. In the last quarter of next year, we also plan to make proposals to step up work on the freezing and confiscation of the proceeds of crime, as well as on asset recovery. We will continue to work on police cooperation by putting forward an EU Police Cooperation Code, which will be a key measure to modernise existing intra—EU law enforcement cooperation. Your House, this Parliament’s involvement in all this work will be essential and a key element in our success. Let me finish by referring to the various opinions expressed around radicalisation and the link with terrorism. I would like to ask you to take an interest in our proposal, presented together with Commissioner Johansson, on integration and inclusion. This is an action plan with 60 concrete actions that we would like to see implemented so that our societies are able to offer a chance for integration and inclusion to those vulnerable Europeans that very often fall through the cracks of our systems and become the ideal victims or prey to terrorism. Instead of declaring a priori enemies from the terrorist camp, I think we have a better chance if we strike a deal on integration and inclusion and we use the universality of our education systems, housing and health provision to give a sense of belonging to the most vulnerable citizens in society. This would allow us to shield them from the appeal of terrorism. At the same time, this is a two—way street.

Madam President, commissioner, Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioner for the work he has done on this I would like to thank you all for the debate, because it has once again made it clear that we are developing strategies on a common basis and that I do see a high degree of agreement between the three institutions. Of course, the debate on security for the citizens of Europe is particularly difficult for the Council, because, on the one hand, it is, of course, a question of making the best use of national competences in the interests of the citizens, but on the other hand, there must also be a willingness to significantly expand security cooperation where Europe brings concrete added value.  I am also grateful to the honourable Members who have pointed out a plethora of tests. This is not just about terrorism or drug trafficking, it is about many, many crimes that are serious for people, but which are also a major, big test – especially for our security forces. That is why I agree with everyone that we need to better enable the joint agencies, which we have, to support the Member States in these tasks. I would like to revisit one point, because I had the impression that it was one of the most sensitive, that is the issue of encryption. I would also like to explain the Council's position a little again. Indeed, the resolution on encryption clearly states that the Council wants to ensure that law enforcement and judicial authorities have the same opportunities online to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute crimes, as well as offline. That is the core principle. Once again, what is illegal offline is and must also be illegal online. Secondly, our law enforcement and judicial authorities must have the same powers, both offline and online. These are the two key points for me, where I see great interfaces between the responsibilities of the Member States and the common tasks that the European Union – and therefore, of course, the Member States – has to face. Once again, thank you very much for the discussion. Thank you also for the appeal to strike a reasonable balance between security on the one hand and freedoms on the other.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, dear Helena, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Helena for the excellent work he has done on this report. Yes, it is probably my last speech i can give today, and also the last speech I can make as a representative of the German EU Presidency, and I would like to thank the European Parliament for the opportunity to speak on this subject, which is a matter of great concern to me.  Gender equality – equality between men and women – is not just an issue for women, but men must be equally committed to this task and to this core principle of a united Europe. And that is why it is not just any minor issue that has a secondary role to play, but it belongs in the policy area, in the core area of our political commitment, whether we are talking about development cooperation or international policy, about crisis management or about health policy. Right now, it has become clear – also in view of the restrictive measures that we have to take in the Member States – that violence against women and domestic violence have increased dramatically. And I know that there is also a call in the European Parliament for a separate Council formation on gender equality and gender equality to be set up. It is not my job as The Presidency to decide on Council formations. This is a decision taken by the Heads of State or Government in the European Council. This must be decided unanimously there.  However, I have also had a good experience of the fact that key issues play a role in all Council formations. I would just like to give you one example: I myself have been the Chairman of the General Affairs Council for almost six months now. Now you will ask yourself: what is the General Affairs Council? What is he actually dealing with? We have dealt not only with Brexit, not only with the rule of law and not only with many fundamental issues such as enlargement, but also with the MFF. And when I think of an initiative in the General Affairs Council, it is to make gender budgeting and gender mainstreaming a central part of our budget. This is an initiative that we discussed in the General Affairs Council. Now it could have been said that only the Ministers for Equal Opportunities should deal with this. But no, the Ministers for Europe, who are responsible for the multiannual financial framework, have also done so. This shows that it can also make sense for everyone to live up to their responsibilities – especially on such a large and important issue. But I am also very open about this, because we are also having this discussion in the Member States. We wonder whether we need our own Ministry of Gender Equality, or whether it is just a question of gender equality or whether we do not need to focus on all issues of equality. Because our commitment to equality does not only apply to men and women, but it must not matter who you believe in, who you love and where you come from and how high or how low your income is. So that too would be an approach that we could certainly take to the fore. I would like to reassure you that the issues of gender equality and gender equality were very important for the Presidency. I have already highlighted the MFF, and I say this somewhat enviously: we have a principle with gender mainstreaming and gender budgeting that does not exist at all in many, many Member States of the European Union, including my own country. In this respect, the European Union is setting standards here too and is a role model and a courageous encourager for many Member States – and I would like to emphasise this positively. However, I would also like to draw particular attention to the important role played by colleagues in the Field of Equal Opportunities Ministers. We alone had two policy debates between the Ministers responsible for Employment and Social Affairs on gender equality. On 13 October, my fellow Members discussed the issue of equal participation of women and men in the labour market. As you know, there are many different approaches and also views on how best to promote equality in the labour market. Possible approaches are measures for the reconciliation of work and private life, awareness-raising or wage transparency. However, there is also a further way of a fairer distribution of unpaid care, care and Housework - that's crucial! On 3 December, just a few weeks ago, we had a second policy debate, particularly in the light of the Commission's strategy for gender equality for the next five years. I would also like to express my thanks to the Commissioner responsible, who is also setting new standards here, which, of course, keep reminding us of what is left to do. And that is far from self-evident, because, particularly in the area of employment and social policy, we are concerned with taking measures that achieve a balanced sharing of paid work and unpaid care work.  And we have identified a number of important points. Firstly, it is not only women but also men who benefit from equality – as I said at the beginning. We need a partnership approach. If only women care about women's issues, then we are not making progress on the issue of equality. We need feminism– I may say this now – as a task for both sexes and not just for women. And i do not want to diminish the commitment – the outstanding, courageous commitment – of women. A second point is important to me: in my general opinion, equality means that every person, whoever he or she is, has the opportunity to fulfil his or her potential, and that equality is beneficial for all citizens and for the economy. The Commission is also appropriately in support of this broad approach. And a third point is important to me: in concrete terms, this consensus is reflected in the agreement that we have reached, to my delight, on the Council's conclusions on 'Combating the gender pay gap: assessing and sharing paid gainful employment and unpaid care, care and housework'. We presented this document as part of the annual review of the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action. In this respect, there is still a great deal to be done, especially to combat gender stereotypes. And I say this again for the Presidency very, very clearly: gender equality is not a concept of struggle. It is a matter of course for liberal democracies, for liberal societies, and it should also be a matter of course for all three institutions – for the Commission, for Parliament, but also, of course, for the Council – and I was very pleased to have been able to make a small modest contribution to this over the last six months.  Thank you also for the suggestions I have received from this House, particularly on the issue of equality. This has enriched me, inspired me very much and has also made our Presidency a success.

With regard to the issue of today’s discussion, it is not the intention of the Commission to interfere with matters which are purely internal to other EU institutions. It is for the Council to agree on the need to have a new or different Council configuration. Of course I agree that political debates by ministers as co-legislators are essential to achieve our goals. For instance, ministerial debates allowed for the swift adoption of the work-life balance directive. As a Commission, we have always encouraged presidencies to hold such debates.

We already have such fora in the Parliament and the Commission — it is crucial to have a counterpart in the Council.  Top level political leadership across the Member States is now essential on gender equality. The time for prevarication is over. Women have waited too long. Women can’t wait another 60 years and women and men of our younger generation cannot wait a further 60 years. Issues of equality are often dealt with in the Justice and Home Affairs Council and, as a Minister for Justice, I worked in that Council and gender equality rarely appears on the agenda due to the long list of priorities and competences that fall into the JHA.  To make sure that these priorities are driven forward, a dedicated Council configuration is an imperative, I believe, allowing equality ministers to meet on an ongoing basis, facilitating the discussion, and adaptation of key initiatives and to invest time in that all-important best practice sharing, what the EU is known for and utilises as one of its great strengths. The question of gender equality has been at the heart of the COVID-19 pandemic. Domestic violence, childcare pressures, accessing health care — these issues have not been resolved but exacerbated by the current crisis.

It doesn't make us any less women. Black women are black and women. Women with disabilities have a disability and they are women. Lesbian women are lesbians and women. Roma women are Roma and women. Muslim women are Muslim and women. Trans women are trans and women. Trans women are women. It gives us different experiences. This means that society sees us and treats us differently. But we're still all women. For too long, women have been made invisible and forgotten. The history books forget us. The pharmaceutical industry forgets us. Trouser pocket producers forget us. Well, but that our governments in the European Union forget us, despite the fact that almost all EU governments have an equal minister – no, surely?

She fought for equal opportunities.  I hope that, in its wake, we will continue to fight against gender inequalities and other discrimination. We need to integrate women and recognize their skills in our institutions, including women from minorities. This strong signal is all the more important because there are still deep structural inequalities in our society.  The lack of diversity within the institutions is a good example of the fact that we still have work to do. The Council has an important role to play in this fight.

The S&amp;D Group will stand against those who want to ban this word in European documents, and the same goes for intersectionality.

When these women living in Europe are immigrants, children of immigrants, considered immigrants, when they do not have white skin, when they are not heterosexual, when they do not have the right religion, when they are disabled, when they are poor, when they are fragile, then they suffer even more inequality, injustice and discrimination.

In addition, EPSCO also had a debate on the gender equality strategy. Nonetheless, EPSCO is the Council for Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs.

Thank you once again for having the opportunity to take part in this discussion. And we have also seen how important it is – and indeed only in one speech – because gender equality is still the subject of a fierce political debate in Europe. There are people – and politicians – who think they can make a mark at the expense of minorities, women and the weaker. They ridicule them, they make them contemptuous. At least I have understood our debate today in such a way that we stand together– no matter what our position is on a separate formation for equality in the Council. I respect your view because there are good arguments in favour of your proposal. However, I would like to promote once again that the issue of equality should not only be focused on the issue of gender equality, but should be taken by a broader approach. And I am campaigning for it to be worthwhile, honourable Members, if economic ministers, finance ministers, social ministers, ministers of education, ministers of education and ministers must also deal with the issues of equality. It is a subject that covers all areas of life. I hope that the subsequent Presidencies of the Council will also make good use of the necessary exchanges of ministers for equality. We have done so as the German Presidency of the Council, and we hope that the subsequent presidencies will be able to continue to do so. These are not just conversations. I would like to remind you of a very specific initiative which has still not been implemented. In the face of a massive increase in domestic violence against women and children, The Ministers for Equal Opportunities have called for a Europe-wide number number for victims of domestic violence. This initiative has not yet been implemented. That, too, would be something we might want to tackle in the coming weeks and months. Since you mentioned the Istanbul Convention – which is very close to my heart – I would also like to reiterate, very frustrated, that so far only 21 Member States of the European Union have ratified the Istanbul Convention. And now that I have the pleasure of chairing the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, I would like to say to you that one of our priorities will be to promote the Istanbul Convention. Not that states are leaving, but on the contrary: that more states are committed to the Istanbul Convention because it includes rights that protect women and children – people – from domestic violence. Thank you for this commitment - I wish you all the best. I have a word on my speech paper, and I do not like that at all: it says that equality policy needs patience.
