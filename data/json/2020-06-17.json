As far as I am concerned, I would like to inform you and my colleagues that I have been the victim of police violence by the Belgian police. I consider this to be a discriminatory act with a racist tendency.  Yesterday, as I left the Gare du Nord, I saw nine police officers harassing two young black men. I had my phone in hand, I took a picture of the scene with my phone, which is legal. The police went to me, they ripped my phone out of my hands. Four of the nine armed policemen brutally pushed me against the wall, violently took my purse, pinned me to the wall, legs apart, and a policeman wanted to feel me and search me. They treated me humiliatingly.  When I told the policeman that I was a Member of the European Parliament, he did not believe me, even though he had my two passports, my European Parliament pass and my German passport. He then asked me for the residence card of Belgium. I gave it to him. I took my badge in my bag and I had the badge around me. I filed a complaint today because we cannot allow this police violence to pass. This experience, at a time when the whole world has seen the unfortunate consequences of police brutality, is traumatic for me, but I am here, although I have spent the whole night here in Parliament to write, and I did not have the courage to go out until 6 a.m. I was here yesterday, we can check it out with our badges.

Ms. Fofana did not commit any wrongdoing. If she was molested by a squad of police officers, it was simply because she took pictures of these police officers molesting two young people. This, not to the displeasure of the supporters of the police state, is legal in Belgium and must remain so. And I cannot help but think that the colour of our colleague's skin is no stranger to the very fact that she was arrested and the brutality and disrespect she suffered. We all know how difficult and demanding policemanity is, but it is precisely because the police are one of the arms by which the state uses and exercises its monopoly on legitimate violence that all those who wear it must at all times exercise restraint and discernment. It is at this price that the respect of all will be earned. It is therefore right that our societies stand up en masse against police violence, which is growing in scale and intensity, especially since it strikes people of colour or those who rise up against the established order. Whatever the status of the victim, as Pierrette said very well, facts like yesterday's are intolerable.

The brutal killing of George Floyd was shocking and it has provoked a tide of emotions and protest, not only in the United States but around the world.  I would like to start by using this forum to express, on behalf of the Croatian Presidency and of the Council, my deepest condolences to the family and friends of George Floyd. Let me say loud and clear that we stand in solidarity with victims of racial discrimination across the world. Black lives do matter and systematic racism and discrimination have no place in our society.  The events that triggered the recent protests raised, first and foremost, the issue of police treatment of African-American people and, more broadly, their place in society. Because of each country’s history and social and political context this situation cannot be transposed to Europe one to one. Equality, human dignity, respect for human rights, together with tolerance, gender equality and the prohibition of discrimination are founding values of the European Union. Among the tools we have to fight racism, the main one is the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which protects citizens against any discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, ethnic origin and religion or belief. The Racial Equality Directive, as the first new-generation equal treatment instrument extending legal protection against discrimination beyond the grounds of gender, is the key instrument at EU level. Not only did it pave the way for extending protection to new grounds and fields, it changed the European human rights infrastructure forever by requiring all Member States to designate national equality bodies to promote equal treatment. The Presidency is strongly committed to fighting racism. Therefore, it gives me great pleasure to announce the marking of the 20th anniversary of the adoption of this crucial legislative instrument, organised by the Croatian Presidency and in cooperation with the European Network or Equality Bodies, the Commission and the Council on 29 June, the exact date of the adoption of the directive by the Council.  The EU has so far developed a robust legal framework, including specific legislation on combating intolerance and hatred, such as the 2008 Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia. In June 2016, the Council invited Member States to ensure the effective transposition and implementation of the Framework Decision and other relevant hate-crime laws at national level. In addition, it asked all Member States to develop effective methods to report and ensure proper recording of hate crimes. In conclusions adopted in October 2017, the Council also welcomed the measures coordinated by the Commission’s High Level Group on combating racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance. All these countermeasures need to be accompanied by anti-racist education and youth work and, more precisely, the need to develop democratic resilience, tolerance and conflict-resolution skills in the learning process. To sum up, we have the tools, legislation, knowledge, education, counter-narratives, but also condemnation of any form of racially motivated violence, hate speech and discrimination. At the same time, however, we in Europe must be vigilant in the face of a worrying increase in the number of manifestations of hate speech and racism affecting minorities. The Fundamental Rights Agency report, ‘Being Black in the EU’, released in November 2018, revealed the unacceptable challenges black people still face in our countries. The inclusion of black people is hampered by several obstacles: discrimination against them during their job search, mismatch between individuals’ educational level and their current jobs and access to housing. We are therefore compelled to take such matters extremely seriously. It is our obligation to lead an uncompromising fight against racism in our Union.  The European Union is deeply committed to fighting all forms of discrimination within its borders as well as in the world at large. In March 2019, the Council adopted EU human rights guidelines on non—discrimination in external action. This provides guidance to enhance the effectiveness of EU human rights policy in combating discrimination on any grounds, including race, and to increase the visibility of awareness of EU values and action in combating discrimination in its external action. Abuse of power has to be denounced and combated everywhere. Societies which pride themselves on representing the rule of law, democratic principles, fundamental freedoms and human rights should set an example in this respect. All societies must remain vigilant against the excessive use of force and ensure that incidents such as the killing of Mr Floyd are addressed swiftly, effectively and in full respect of the rule of law and human rights. We trust in the ability of the American people to come together to heal as a nation and to address these important issues. Racism is not just a problem in the United States, as I said, and as the protests in many European countries and across the world have shown. The responsibility for combating racism rests with all of us: politicians, teachers, civil servants, students, parents, policemen, citizens. With all of us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 25, "date": "2020-06-17.json", "name": "Ursula von der Leyen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the Commission. – Mr President, I do not know what it is to be black.

C'est incroyable! La plupart d’entre nous dans cette salle ne le savent pas, mais nous savons une chose: beaucoup de gens, eux, le savent et ils nous disent à pleine gorge que nous tolérons le racisme depuis beaucoup trop longtemps. Cela doit cesser. Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, les gens qui manifestent dans nos rues, dans nos pays, des deux côtés de l’Atlantique et dans le monde entier élèvent leur voix, désireux de se faire entendre. Il est grand temps de faire plus qu’écouter, plus que condamner, il est temps de parler du racisme ouvertement et honnêtement et voilà pourquoi je tiens à vous remercier d’avoir inscrit ce point à l’ordre du jour de la session plénière et de l’avoir mis à la première place de votre session. Honourable Members, as a society, we need to confront reality. We relentlessly need to fight racism and discrimination: visible discrimination, of course, but also more subtle racism and discrimination – our unconscious biases. All sorts of racism and discrimination! In the justice system and law enforcement; in our labour market and the housing market; in education and healthcare; in politics and migration. We should join forces at all levels: European, national, regional, local, public and private, business and civil society, and each of us individually, as citizens, to build a Europe that is more equal and more humane, more fair. And let me be very clear: in our Union there is no place for racism or any kind of discrimination. This is for sure. (Applause) And honourable Members, together, we need to answer difficult questions: why do racism and discrimination endure in our societies? Why are there political parties supporting xenophobia and racism that win elections? Why are members of ethnic and religious minorities underrepresented in political, social and academic institutions – and overrepresented in poverty, illness and law-enforcement statistics? What can we do in the fields of education, employment, healthcare, housing and more, to build an open, fairer and more conscious society? What can we do so that our institutions better represent the diversity of our European societies? This is not the work of a sectoral policy, of a single person, or of a single Commissioner. This is why I am here, as President of the European Commission. I want to get to the bottom of these questions. Next week, we will have a structured debate on racism in the College and let us look around here in this very Chamber. The diversity of our society is not represented and I will be the first to admit things are not better in the College of Commissioners or among the European Commission staff. And this is why I say we need to talk about racism and we need to act. It is always possible to change direction if there is a will to do so. Let me take one small example of a small step in the right direction that I witnessed when I was Defence Minister in my home country. At the time, in the German armed forces, a recruiting system had been in place for decades that always favoured the same. We had some excellent candidates who would bring valuable assets to our armed forces – sometimes rare assets, like speaking Arabic or Farsi – and yet, somehow, those assets were not valued. Not at all. And in a mission abroad, such skills could save comrades’ lives. But at the time, the attitude was: ‘Ah, but the system does not allow for this and we have never done this before.’ But then, analysis and reflection started and finally led the German armed forces to change the recruiting system and it was for the better of the German armed forces, it was for the better for society! It has now become a fairer system for those soldiers, so we can change if there is the political will behind it. There is a way to do it. We need to talk about racism with an open mind. The good news is: we do not start from scratch. In the European Union, discrimination is prohibited at the highest possible legal level: I mean our Treaty, our Charter of Fundamental Rights, both on grounds of race and ethnic origin. We also have European laws against racism, ethnic discrimination and hate speech: our Racial Equality Directive; our Framework Decision on combating forms of expressions of racism and xenophobia, to name just a few. We have cooperation tools involving experts from all Member States, a High-Level Group on combating racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance, and a European Network of Equality Bodies. Here again, to name just a few. And we have European funds. But we need to try harder. I am glad to live in a society that condemns racism. But we should not stop there. If we encounter it, we must sound the alarm and act immediately. And we must be aware that vigilance and awareness begin on a very small scale, with each and every one of us. Awareness includes examining ourselves. Awareness includes speaking up in cases of discrimination. Awareness includes questioning privileges we may take for granted, which are anything but.  The motto of our European Union is: ‘United in diversity’. Our task is to live up to these words, and to fulfil their meaning, and this is why I am looking forward to listening to you for a better Europe. United in diversity. Unie dans la diversité.

The violent death of George Floyd has rekindled the worldwide need to affirm the rejection of racism and the rejection of the abuse of police force.

What is happening in the United States with Georges Floyd, the aggressiveness of his death and the lack of respect for human life that this reflects should allow us to look more closely in our European court. With different socio-historical roots, racism and discrimination exist in both the west and east of our Union.  All too often, fear of the other is accompanied by deep, structural, institutional discrimination, socio-economic inequalities that end up harming our society as a whole. And unfortunately some politicians also play with this fear to maintain this feeling and use it for electoral purposes. A society in which one must be afraid if one is different from others is not a society that allows human development.  The Europe I want is a Europe that makes diversity an asset and a force for evolution. It is not enough to legislate respect for diversity, non-discrimination, but above all it must be cultivated, not imposed by force, but cultivated with common sense. I believe that first of all we must start with ourselves and, on behalf of my political group, I would like to propose that the three European institutions work together on this issue. Parliament, the Commission and the Council must sit down at the same table and ask whether our institutions inside sufficiently reflect the diversity of our Union.  I therefore ask the Council, as well as you, Madam President, to support the initiative of a task force on this subject.

It has created deeply rooted prejudices and inequalities that still prevail and de facto kill people. Of course, structural racism in the EU is different from the US. We don’t have the same horrific history of slavery and lynching, but we do have documented atrocities in our colonial history, which still resonates today through discrimination and police brutality. In addition, we have a recent history of systematic persecution and mass murders of minorities, of Jews, of LGBTI persons and of Roma people, to name a few. No one is free unless all are free. We need to send a strong signal to the US, but also to sweep in front of our own door.

It is therefore, if we want to root out evil, an entire mental continent that we must continue to deconstruct, and it is also a whole system of economic violence that must be combated because, as we observe, social inequalities continue to intersect racial inequalities.

So I focus on three topics. Firstly, the flagship text, the Anti-Discrimination Directive, the Anti-Discrimination Directive, which has been stalled for eleven years because the Council does not want to evolve on the pretext that fighting all discrimination would be too expensive. This must stop either with Member States that better measure the seriousness of the issues or with a new legislative proposal. Secondly, the text of our resolution lacks, from my point of view, a reference to the indispensable actors that are NGOs fighting racism and discrimination. I believe that by supporting them better, we could avoid certain communitarian excesses. Finally, the text addresses the issue of ethnic statistics. I believe that we must be very careful, from this point of view, first of all for a constitutional concern in some Member States and also because these statistics are photographs at a T moment which cannot at any time replace real economic and social proposals to reduce inequality.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 53, "date": "2020-06-17.json", "name": "Irène Tolleret (Renew).", "mepid": "197547", "text": "   Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that we are having this debate today.

We are here to speak louder than the mini-Trumps, the half-Bolsonaros, the ventriloquists of Le Pen or the Salvini at the foot. Vote after vote, debate after debate, resolution after resolution, we will not give up a comma, not a word, to racialist and xenophobic ideologies.

I think it was very obvious from what the President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said in her opening speech: no place for racism in our Union. The Commission condemns all instances of racist or xenophobic hatred and violence. But let me also be clear that we condemn violence in general, wherever it comes from, and that the police needs to do its demanding job but always within clear limits of the law. Racial or ethnic profiling and selective approaches should not be tolerated. And, by the way, our Fundamental Rights Agency already published, I think two years ago, very useful guidelines which would serve as a training for the police and for the armed forces to avoid this kind of treatment. Yes: black lives matter because all lives matter. Everyone, black, white or any other race or nationality, deserves the same chance to be able to participate and pursue happiness in our social environment. We all should be able to say to our children and grandchildren: ‘do not worry, nobody will kill you because of the colour of your skin’. But this debate is also about where we are in Europe with racism and xenophobia, and we have a lot of data, for instance, from the already mentioned Fundamental Rights Agency in its latest report which brings clear evidence that people with minority backgrounds continue to experience harassment, violence and ethnic and racial discrimination in different areas of life in the EU. Indeed, As Members said several times here, we have strong legislation but the legislation cannot do the whole job. We have legislation at the highest possible level, as President von der Leyen mentioned, the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We have 20 years since the adoption of the Racial Equality Directive and over 10 years after the adoption of the framework decision on racism and xenophobia. We have strong legislation and the situation is still worrying, remains worrying. We indeed need to promote and to get adopted the Equal Treatment Directive, which was mentioned here many times. It’s a shame, I would say, that this directive waits 12 years for adoption and I fully rely on my colleague, Helena Dalli, who was here a while ago, that she will be very determined to convince the Member States to take a unanimous decision, because this this directive requires unanimity. The legislation itself is so important, its implementation and proper enforcement, but we need much more, because what’s our problem? It’s deep-rooted prejudice and thinking grounded in stereotypes. We need awareness-raising, we need education, we need culture and we need equality bodies, which were strengthened by our legislation in the last mandate and which should do the good job. We need trust from the people belonging to minorities to report on the cases of harassment and violence against them. They do not trust, they do not report and next week we will also update our strategy on implementation of the Victims’ Rights Directive to encourage victims to report. But we should do much more not to have the victims. It’s late to respond only with criminal justice. We have problems in all the Member States. I would say this is a pan-European problem but with country-specific symptoms. We only have 15 Member States at this moment which have a strategy against racism. We have to talk seriously about that; it has to be changed. We also had to work much more with the digital world because we saw a lot of increase of hatred online. We have quite efficient instruments against hate speech and we have the platforms cooperating, but we need to do much more in this direction. This year, as you know, as per the work programme of the Commission, we want to uphold our European Charter of Fundamental Rights by adopting the strategy on charter implementation. We will also update the strategies on Roma inclusion and LGBTI equality later this year. And, if you noticed, also in the proposal for the EU New Generation budget, there is a very clear line that it must have social dimension and nobody should be lagging behind, and everybody should get the chance to avail themselves of EU funding. We will have the European Social Fund, which is also hopefully well equipped to help minorities. We cannot trivialise the matter. This is not about which political colours we are wearing, but about very basic human rights, the right to be treated equally, regardless of colour of skin, our religion or sexual orientation. We politicians should be put more under pressure. We politicians and opinion leaders who have the influence on what society thinks and how the people approach matters related to minorities, we have to refrain from spreading racially charged hatred for political gains and invest in long-term education and culture and do many more long-term measures. As Ursula von der Leyen said, I can also confirm I don’t have a clue how it feels to be black. I have never experienced any kind of discrimination. That’s why, whenever I go to the Member States and I speak, for instance, to young Roma people, I always ask those who managed to study at secondary school, who managed to study at university. My question is: ‘how did you manage that’, because I know that their starting line is so difficult, much more difficult than the starting line of my children or the children of many of us here.  And they always tell me there were three moments: ‘at some moment I realised I do not want to live the life of my parents. I want to do something more. I want to get out of the trap of, usually, poverty’, poverty was the problem. The second very important thing and condition: ‘I needed to find a helping hand’. Those who managed always found a helping hand. In their local community it was the mayor, it was the NGO, it was the teacher or director of the school. They could not manage without the help. So, zero tolerance for discrimination and zero tolerance for racism cannot be enough.

As we emerge from the height of the health crisis, we now face a different, yet pressing, task: creating the conditions for a successful economic and social recovery. We need to support the sectors and regions most affected by the pandemic to kick-start the economy and lay the ground for a sustainable recovery across Europe. Yet we also need to ensure that other vital priorities for our Union, such as the green and digital transition, are met and matched by the right resources. That is why the EU recovery plan, presented by the Commission at the end of May, is so important, and why it will be the main focus of our efforts in the weeks ahead. We will shortly be called on to agree not only on the instruments of the recovery, but on the entire Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the coming years, and this is no small task. The Council and the European Council are fully mobilised behind this common effort. Members of the European Council will hold an orientation debate on the EU recovery package on Friday through video conference. The President of the European Council wants to give leaders an opportunity to discuss the various aspects of the overall packages and prepare the subsequent summit, which should, if possible, be a physical meeting. While the President of the European Council launched the political consultations at the highest level, following the Commission’s proposal, we also immediately started work in the Council. The Croatian Presidency has organised a series of meetings, both at technical and political levels, in order for the delegates to closely examine and present their views on the building blocks of the package. This technical and political work on the proposals is needed to pave the way for the leaders’ discussion. These discussions in the Council have helped clarify many issues and were held in a positive atmosphere. Delegations are willing to look at both the MFF and the recovery plan as a package, taking into account the effects of this crisis. Continuous cooperation with the European Parliament will remain crucial if we want the package to enter into force already in January 2021. The ambition is for the European Council to provide its political guidance to the Council before the summer break, which would allow us to promptly seek the European Parliament’s consent. Let us be honest: this is a very ambitious approach. Positions are still apart on a number of issues, but together we have to make sure and do our utmost so that the MFF and the Recovery Instrument swiftly bring tangible positive effects for our citizens and businesses. While the EU recovery package will be the main focus of the leaders’ discussions on Friday, they will also touch upon other issues. In particular, let me note that President Michel will update the leaders on the state of play of the EU—UK negotiations on the future partnership. Unfortunately, so far we have not have not achieved as much as we had hoped for. That is the case in all four crucial areas: the level playing field, fisheries, governance and internal security, as well as foreign policy and external security, to which you rightly devote a section in your recommendation. Since the UK Government has confirmed that they will not consider an extension of the transition period, what is ahead of us is about four months of further negotiation, taking into account the time necessary for a proper ratification process. The fact that we are left with so little time is not the choice of the Council, nor of the Parliament, but we have to respect it. The mandate and political declaration that are guiding our negotiator, as well as your resolution on the subject, are anchored into the situation created by the United Kingdom. The UK has a choice: either to preserve enough alignment with the Union and retain substantial access to the single market, or choose its own path – not only in terms of sovereignty, but also in regulatory terms, which would reduce the scope and the depth of the partnership that can be concluded. We believe that the negotiating mandate, adopted by the Council last February and largely echoed by your resolution, provides for enough flexibility to find an agreement in the little time left. This is also why we support the decision of the negotiators to intensify the pace of negotiations over the summer so that, by October, we can see a draft partnership emerging. Before I conclude, let me finally stress that, as also pointed out in your draft recommendation, we have causes for concern in the current implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement. Needless to say, progress in the partnership negotiations has to go hand in hand with progress in the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 68, "date": "2020-06-17.json", "name": "Ursula von der Leyen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the Commission. – Mr President, the negotiations with the United Kingdom always promised to be difficult, and they have not disappointed. On Monday, President Sassoli, President Michel, and I discussed the way forward with Prime Minister Johnson. The Prime Minister confirmed that he does not want to extend the transition period beyond the end of this year. We, on our side, have always been ready to grant an extension, but it takes two to tango. This means that we are now half-way through these negotiations with five months left to go, but we are definitely not half-way through the work to reach an agreement, with little time ahead of us. We will do all in our power to reach an agreement; we will be constructive, as we’ve always been, and we are ready to be creative to find common ground where there seems to be none. What we are not ready to do is to put into question our principles and the integrity of our Union because it is our duty to protect the interests of the European citizens. Michel Barnier has done an outstanding job over the last month and has explained many times why the four outstanding issues are so crucial. First of all, the level playing field. The fundamental issue at stake here is fair competition. We are ready and willing to compete with British firms. They are excellent and our firms are excellent too; but it cannot be a downward competition. Just think of labour standards or environmental protection. It should be a shared interest for the European Union and the UK to never slide backwards and always advance together towards higher standards. Second, on fisheries: no one is questioning the UK’s sovereignty in its own waters, without any question. But we ask for predictability and we ask for guarantees for fishermen and fisherwomen who have been sailing in those waters for decades. It is very clear that there cannot be a comprehensive trade agreement without fisheries, without a level playing field or without strong governance mechanisms. Governance may sound like an issue for bureaucrats but it is not. It is central for our businesses and our private citizens, both in the UK and in the European Union. It is crucial to ensure that what has been agreed is actually done. Finally, on police and judicial cooperation: we want our citizens’ liberties, fundamental rights and data to be safeguarded in all circumstances and this is why we expect a role for the European Court of Justice where it matters. These are objectives, not only in our discussions with the UK but in any relationship with any partner because these are principles at the heart of the European Union. Fair competition, rising social standards, the protection of our citizens and the rule of law, this is who we are and it is not going to change. Honourable members, I am particularly glad for the unity that all institutions have shown and for this Parliament’s full support throughout this process. This will be even be more important than the next phase of the talks. No one can say with certainty where these negotiations will be at the end of the year, but I know for sure that we will have done everything to reach an agreement and to have a good start with the UK as a third-country neighbour. Meine sehr geehrten Damen und Herren Abgeordneten! Unsere britischen Freunde sind leider entschlossen, einen Schritt zurückzugehen. Sie wollen die Europäische Union und den Gemeinsamen Markt verlassen. Wir werden weiter daran arbeiten, die wirtschaftlichen Folgen für unsere Union abzufedern, und gleichzeitig fordert uns die Gesundheits- und Wirtschaftskrise in einer noch nie dagewesenen Form heraus. Die Europäische Kommission ist in die Verantwortung gegangen. Mit Next Generation EU haben wir einen ambitionierten, einen mutigen Vorschlag präsentiert. Next Generation EU ist ausgewogen, es hilft jenen, die viele Kranke und Tote zu beklagen haben, aber es hilft ebenso den Staaten, die indirekt schwer betroffen sind, weil Lieferketten gerissen sind, weil Fabriken stillstehen, weil die Arbeitslosigkeit steigt. Next Generation EU ist aber weit mehr als ein Rettungspaket. Es ist ein Beschleuniger für Wissenschaft, innovative Forschung und Investitionen in Zukunftstechnologien. Wenn wir es richtigmachen, wird Next Generation EU nicht nur zur Erholung unseres Binnenmarkts führen, sondern seine Wettbewerbsfähigkeit und seine Innovationskraft voranbringen. Was uns wichtig ist, ist, dass wir damit die längst überfällige Modernisierung beschleunigen. Wir wollen nicht in den Zustand vor der Krise, sondern wir wollen nach vorne gehen in einer modernen Wirtschaft, in einer innovationsfähigen Wirtschaft, die uns nach der Krise stärker macht, als wir vorher waren. Next Generation EU ist auch ein Vertrag zwischen den Generationen. Ja, es stimmt, wir müssen jetzt gewaltige Investitionen tätigen, um uns aus der Krise zu wuchten, aber wir bauen mit dem Geld ein besseres, ein nachhaltigeres und ein digitaleres Europa. Europa geht voran. Andere Regionen in der Welt verfolgen ganz genau, was gerade hier passiert, und auch deswegen haben wir Next Generation EU so ausgerichtet, dass es Europas Position in der unmittelbaren Nachbarschaft ebenso stärkt wie auf der großen Bühne. Wir haben jetzt die Chance und die Verpflichtung, ein Europa zu bauen, das besser in der Lage ist, den globalen Stürmen zu trotzen und künftigen Generationen eine sichere Heimat zu sein. Meine Damen und Herren, ich hatte schon mehrfach die Gelegenheit, Ihnen den MFR und Next Generation EU zu erläutern. Das werden wir auch am Freitag im Europäischen Rat tun. Next Generation EU wurde in seinen Grundzügen positiv aufgenommen, auch die Reaktion der Märkte darauf war sehr positiv, und mir ist klar, dass es gleichzeitig sehr wichtig ist, dass wir diese Aufgabe angesichts ihrer Größe und Komplexität ausführlich erklären und ausführlich diskutieren, auch hier in diesem Haus. Mir ist insbesondere wichtig: die Rolle des Europäischen Parlaments, das richtige Verhältnis zwischen nationalen Reformanstrengungen in den Mitgliedstaaten und unseren europäischen Prioritäten – insbesondere dem European Green Deal, der Digitalisierung und der Resilienz – und drittens die Bedeutung neuer Eigenmittel für die Union in einem fundierten Rückzahlungsplan. Es ist meine feste Absicht, mit Ihnen dazu im intensiven Gespräch zu sein. Wir müssen alle an einem Strang ziehen, wir können uns keinen Verzug leisten. Lassen Sie uns das gemeinsam anpacken für Europa!", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 69, "date": "2020-06-17.json", "name": "Kati Piri", "mepid": "37229", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, 204 days: that is the time we have left to reach a deal on our future relationship with the United Kingdom. We are now halfway through the transition period, we have held four rounds of negotiations, and it seems we have reached a stalemate. What is needed now is an injection of new energy and dynamism: a paradigm shift in these talks. And although the joint declaration of last Monday didn’t give us many clues, in this House we all hope that the high-level meeting did just that: create a new dynamism. For this Parliament, a comprehensive agreement means guarantees on fair competition with clear social, environmental and labour protection, and this is what Prime Minister Johnson and the EU signed up to only months ago in the political declaration. None of this should be in any way controversial. With zero tariffs, zero quotas, comes – logically – zero dumping. An ambitious and comprehensive future partnership is in the best interest of both the UK and the EU citizens. We, of course, welcome the latest enthusiasm and euphoria of Prime Minister Johnson and his drive to finalise a deal within six weeks – but the Prime Minister did not explain how. We very much look forward to hearing the details on that. Over the past few months, the European Parliament has shown its commitment and has taken its responsibility in reaching this deal. With the UK Coordination Group, two lead committees and 17 opinion-giving committees, we have developed a unique and unprecedented procedure for the report, prepared by Christophe Hansen and myself, that reflects how serious we take our role as the European Parliament. Our President this week took part in the high-level meeting to also present our position, and I’m proud to say that Parliament stands united on a strong text with a clear political message. And that message is simple: yes, we want a deal, but we will not simply consent to just any deal. Our consent is conditional on the UK Government’s adherence to its own commitments. The UK must respect the political declaration and ensure the full implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement. Let me be very clear: the UK’s expectation to keep the benefits and rights of a Member State, without agreeing to any obligations, is not realistic. It’s only logical that, if you want to have access to the market of 450 million citizens, this will come with conditions. The UK Government made a conscious decision to leave the Single Market. We respect this, but so should the United Kingdom, and without a level playing field and fisheries, there cannot be a trade agreement. I do not see a divide between the people of the United Kingdom and those of the European Union. The division I see is between those that have a vision and seek a comprehensive deal, and a UK Government that backtracks on its commitment and continues to put ideology over the interests of its own people. The way forward is clear: we stand united in our demand for an ambitious and comprehensive future partnership with clear conditions and red lines, as formulated. The European Union is united and continues to stand ready to negotiate in good faith: constructively, as an honest broker. Our chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has our full support, and we hope that finally the time has come for Mr Johnson and the UK Government to join us and deliver. We are ready.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 70, "date": "2020-06-17.json", "name": "Christophe Hansen", "mepid": "193419", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, almost exactly four years ago, on 23 June 2016, the Brexit referendum took place in the United Kingdom. Since then, we have been treated to four years of drama, witnessing the UK’s painful coming-to-grips with the reality of unwinding decades of membership of the largest single market in the world and, in my humble opinion, the best cooperation project – even with its imperfections – that mankind has so far created. The Global Britain that Brexiteers dangled before the British people is no longer a viable project – if it even ever was – in a newly polarised world, where the institutions that underpin the multilateral order are being hollowed out and where protectionism is growing in the wake of the coronavirus. While the political Brexit happened last January, the economic Brexit still looms large at the end of this year, following the UK’s ideological decision not to extend the transition period. Our message for the ongoing negotiations is crystal clear: the European Parliament stands behind our chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. The UK claims to seek an agreement rooted only in precedent, yet their proposals in areas such as financial services or professional qualifications go well beyond what the EU has ever conceded in any other FTA. The UK refuses to engage with the EU on topics such as public procurement – notwithstanding commitments taken in the Political Declaration – and refuses to speak about SMEs, yet they do so with other negotiating partners, the latest example being the UK’s objectives for negotiations with Australia, published today, and including government procurement and SME chapters. What a surprise! Any agreement without robust guarantees for a level playing field or without an agreement on fisheries simply will not fly. And let’s be clear: a level playing field does not mean a copy/paste of our rules and regulations, but rather that we take our common point of departure as a point of no regression, following which we jointly managefuture divergence to guarantee equivalence, not necessarily identical rules for all players. We stand firmly behind the Commission’s approach to press for a comprehensive agreement. We reject the UK’s piecemeal, sectoral approach as it is well known that salami tactics lead to a cluttered spaghetti-bowl agreement. The implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement remains key and the European Court of Justice must remain the sole referee of EU law. Indeed, the EU is no less sovereign in its decision-making and decision-taking than the UK is.  Finally, allow me to thank my co-rapporteur, Kati Piri, for the excellent collaboration we have had in this exercise. I would also like to thank the 17 committees which gave an opinion for their valuable input. I sincerely hope that there will only be one last Brexit resolution: to consent to a balanced agreement no later than November this year. Personally, I remain confident that the legendary British pragmatism will prevail over ideology in the interest of all UK and EU citizens. The unilateral, staged introduction of border controls for EU goods coming into the UK, announced last Friday, to give corona-hit businesses time to adapt seems to indicate that. So let’s use this new momentum very wisely.

It seems nowadays that that’s the position of the UK, whereas before, half a loaf was definitely not better than the entire loaf. Prime Minister Johnson said yesterday, in a press conference, that he wanted a more dynamic nature to these negotiations. He wanted more ‘oomph’. Well, that’s just a metaphor for the UK’s lack of cooperation in the last four rounds, the lack of transparency and also for its lack of commitment to the political declarations that were signed. Prime Minister Johnson: he who rides a tiger is afraid to dismount! Decisions have consequences, and the European Parliament is committed to protecting the best interests of its citizens.  The UK’s participation cannot be a Swedish buffet. We cannot allow cherry-picking. We cannot allow a piecemeal approach. Such decisions have consequences. But no one will take away the UK’s role in the unification of this continent. We all look around and know the fact that this Parliament is sadder without its British colleagues on the benches and we also know that four years ago Jo Cox was slain at the hands of a murderer, and Jo Cox said to us, ‘that which unites us is more important than that which divides us’.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 72, "date": "2020-06-17.json", "name": "Pedro Silva Pereira", "mepid": "124747", "text": "  draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. – Mr President, after several months, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union continue without significant progress on the most sensitive issues, re-emerging the scenario of a non-agreement.

So if Boris Johnson's government really wants a deal, its negotiating attitude has to change. The European Parliament fully supports Michel Barnier's team in seeking a good agreement and also makes clear what it does not want: the bad agreement that does not safeguard the single market or our environmental, social and labour standards.

For my country alone, forty-two thousand jobs are at stake and for the EU that is 1.2 million in the event of a hard Brexit. The draft report before us today can and must facilitate an agreement. This text reflects the principles for a new partnership. Firstly, I would like to stress that the withdrawal agreement must first be implemented clearly and in its entirety. SMEs need to be assured. Secondly, I would like to stress that a new partnership agreement must respect European internal market rules. Thirdly, compliance with the agreement must be permanent.

I have been responsible in the Committee on Transport for this issue. It is quite clear that it is important that we get an agreement in place that guarantees continued good relations between the EU and the UK.  Every year there are over 4 million lorry journeys by freight to and from the UK. More than 54 million passengers travel between the EU and the UK every year. So it is absolutely essential to maintain these freight and passenger transport. At the same time, however, the United Kingdom has chosen to leave the Union, and then it cannot retain the same rights without any obligations whatsoever.

Mr President, Mr Monsieur Barnier, Cher Michel! Let us not deceive ourselves: Brexit is and will remain a huge historical mistake – it will only know losers. As is so often the case in history, it will become apparent that separation and secession can only bring loss. Only cross-border cooperation can bring real added value to the people of Europe. The last 70 years have shown us this impressively. But now even a disorderly Brexit is in the house. This has even become very likely. In this case, I would like to see our small and medium-sized enterprises protected, because they and their employees can do absolutely nothing for this situation. These small businesses, like the big players, can't respond quickly and flexibly to changing trade relationships. So we need quick tools for small and medium-sized enterprises in the event of a hard Brexit that no one wants. In December, in the Committee on Regional Development, we proposed and supported the use of the Solidarity Fund in this case.

This is a major economic and social issue as tens of thousands of jobs are at stake. This is an issue for our territories, which live off this activity, these exceptional know-how, and which could be weakened by an exit without agreement.

The message of Parliament is clear: we cannot compromise on our values, the continued adherence of the UK to the European Convention on Human Rights and on the role of the European Court of Justice.

Monday’s political momentum and the decision to intensify talks in July is good news in this context. So now there is a physical space, and I personally believe also political space to finalise the process, but I also want to emphasise that what is at stake is the quality of our future relationship.

Equivalence and voluntary regulatory cooperation on financial services cannot be put into a free trade agreement.

But I would also like to refer to the European Council. Ladies and gentlemen, time is pressing. On the street, people are clear about it. And this Parliament, too. I hope that the few reluctant governments in the Council will also understand this and reach an agreement in July, at the latest. We cannot go on holiday without activating the recovery plan and agree on the budget so that it can start implementing as soon as January. The amount proposed by the Commission, EUR 750 billion, is the minimum. Same as the amount of $500 billion for subsidies. All international agencies warn us that it is not time to spare efforts but to invest to revive the economy. Even our fellow conservatives and liberals who in 2008 advocated austerity now recognize that it would be a big mistake. All right, because rectifying is wise, and now it's time to row them all in the same direction. We can build on this momentum to transform our economies and adapt them to the new digital context and environmental emergency and ensure a fairer society, with stronger public policies. The route is clear: invest in ecological and digital transition to modernize our economies. Governments in the Council now need to have vision and courage, because where there is no vision the people suffer. This Parliament has the vision, and we are not going to give in. Because we can't afford it and because citizenship wouldn't allow it. That is why we are not going to accept a bad agreement in the Council. And also because we have to continue to insist on Parliament's role in these decisions. I am referring to key issues such as the management of the European Next Generation EU Recovery Instrument. No crisis can be an excuse to undermine democracy. On the contrary, more democracy and more accountability are required to resolve it. And so the only conditionality that must be imposed on the recovery plan is respect for the rule of law. Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to know how to combine our objectives and principles with the reality of the facts.

This is once again proof of the inefficiency and inadequacy of the European institutions in responding to the crisis. Let us de-develop the Commission's proposal, which is already a highly inadequate proposal. We are talking about EUR 400 billion in subsidies as well, and three quarters of this money will not arrive until 2023, that is, 3 years after this crisis has broken out, when companies have already broken their job. I believe that, once again, this is proof of how the decision-making process within the European Union is not suitable for responding to citizens and businesses and, moreover, this effort, this money would be given in exchange for new European taxes, taxes that will be levied on businesses, about seventy thousand companies within the European Union, and therefore not just multinationals. , and they will weigh on consumption, because of course companies will turn them back on consumption.

No one really expects anything to happen at this European Council with regard to the recovery plan.

Even the President of the European Council gave up on any outcome even before the summit had started. It’s quite shameful really that, when our Heads of State and Government come together, no one expects anything much to happen.

We have an unforeseen crisis in the EU, and we all know that we need to act urgently in order to mitigate the economic impact. The EU as a whole needs to have, and provide, funds for this. The funds need to be targeted into the economy that we want to have tomorrow, not the one that puts profit over planet and people. A major effort is needed, but the benefits are great, especially if we link the investments to the challenges that we anyway have to face, namely the climate crisis, biodiversity loss, social inequality and digitalisation.

So it is not about COVID-19, but about distributing a lot of money from Brussels. This means more power for the Commission, a higher EU budget and new European taxes. That is the purpose of the recovery fund. There is a long ratification process and somewhere along the way there is someone with the hammer.

This is by no means a criticism of michel Barnier's excellent work, which I greatly appreciate, but an analysis of the current situation, which, because of the British position – I would like to stress the British position – only allows the conclusion that we will see either a bad deal or a hard economic Brexit at the end of the year. I would like to say here, on behalf of the Left, that an agreement that opens the door to social dumping, environmental dumping, tax dumping or which contributes the security of private data to the fair is completely unacceptable to us. However, the Johnson government wants such an agreement. That is not an option for us, and I hope that this is not a real option for anyone in this House. That is why it is now time to consider an emergency plan to protect the regions and sectors particularly affected by Brexit, in order to provide the hundreds of thousands of workers and businesses with the necessary protection. And on the Council, people are still waiting for a clear signal of solidarity and unity. Next Generation EU is so far more of a bet on the future than actually a generational contract. The clearest signal would be to abandon and abandon the Stability and Growth Pact once and for all, which in the future will only lead to further cuts in public services and social security or to further privatisations. On the other hand, we need public investment, tax loopholes must be closed, tax justice must be achieved. The ECB should be able to directly support public finances, and super-rich speculators and companies should play their fair share of reconstruction by introducing a comprehensive financial transaction tax, a strong digital tax, and a wealth levy.

Madam President, while the situation seems to be stabilizing on the health crisis, the economic challenges remain major. For me, we now have two options: either we negotiate at national level to end the crisis, and then each Member State defends its interests, or we accept that the only solution is to build together. That is the logic of the stimulus package and the multi-year budget that we support. Because, yes, we have to be clear, we are not asking for the dusting of funds, we will have to target where the funds should be allocated. It will also be a matter of conditioning for reform, so that this European solidarity is the engine of a genuine joint recovery. However, I do not hide my concern from you. We are about to borrow 750 billion euros on the financial markets without knowing exactly how we are going to repay that money. Indeed, to envisage an increase in national contributions or a reduction in the funds allocated to future European policies would undermine the whole European project. Therefore, for us, only the rapid implementation of real own resources would strengthen the credibility of this recovery plan, but also ensure the sustainability of the European project. I do not hide from you that the proposal on the European multi-year budget is far less ambitious than we expected and the very existence of a recovery plan is not enough to compensate for the weakness of this proposal because even if it is a package, the objectives are still different. While the recovery plan will allow us to get back in the saddle, the new European budget will define our ability to cross the finish line.  Therefore, only an ambitious budget would provide a structural response to the many challenges we face and would determine our ability to assume both economic and strategic independence. It would finance major European projects such as the battery project or the hydrogen project. It would allow such projects to come into being.  Today, however, I am concerned because some programmes which aim to finance such essential projects as research, digital, the single market or defence remain too lowly funded. The same is true for social projects or for projects that concern young people, for example. So I will end by pointing out that my group will not support a European budget that continues to provide funding to European governments which, every day, turn their backs on our values and undermine democracy and the rule of law.

As you know, our political group immediately welcomed the 'Next Generation EU'. For us, the Commission's plan is the minimum trade union or, if you like, a good starting point, and it has elements that deserve attention.  I will cite two for brevity. The first is the EUR 750 billion, a large part of which is not lost, in order to restart our small and medium-sized enterprises, to help our workers, to give a perspective to the people who have lost their jobs. Secondly, the possibility of common European debt, guaranteed by the Union's own resources, which are not, as some would have us believe, new taxes for the citizens, but the possibility of making those who have not paid taxes so far pay the cost of the crisis as much as they should have paid, or paid them where they wanted – I am thinking of the multinationals – or to finally combat environmental dumping on our products. People are asking for help at every latitude. This emergency has affected everywhere in Europe, but it has struck differently. However, do not think of the so-called frugal states that this is a good reason to leave the countries most affected and therefore the most fragile to their fate. Here we all save together. Value chains are integrated, our economies too interdependent and, if even the smallest state in Europe collapses, the whole of the internal market collapses, and the productive realities of countries that today feel invulnerable will also suffer. It is not just solidarity and mutual convenience. Therefore, in view of what we have been through in these difficult months of lockdown and the road ahead for a recovery that is slower than we think, I would like to reiterate from this House an appeal to the Council not to weaken or slow down the launch of this recovery plan.

He asked for a European response. These principles are an integral part of the Commission's proposal.  Second challenge: to find a political agreement on the future of the European Union budget and has a bad proposal for the second period of the framework. The decision on one and the other is urgent.

Do you believe this would allow for a fair competition?’ The answer was of course, ‘no, this is not what we want’. We want fair competition and fair play is what every good sportsman should aim for in a competition. This Parliament wants the closest possible cooperation with the United Kingdom. This is in everyone’s best interest. We will remain constructive and will be ready to discuss the fair and balanced compromises that will hopefully emerge in the coming weeks here in Brussels and in London.

First and foremost, I would like to thank you for your support because it’s very important for our discussions with the European Member States, and also with the public, and I really would like to reassure you that we are not losing any minute from the time between now and what I hope will be a very important historic, unprecedented and ambitious deal on both the MFF and Next Generation EU in July. We are not losing any minute because we are talking to the governments at different levels, we are engaging with the citizens, and I personally approached all representatives of the national parliaments on Tuesday in the format of COSAC when I was explaining to them the construction architecture of the proposal and the importance of national parliaments and the European Parliament’s approval ratification in the end.  Of course, for us solidarity is a must, and I believe that this European Council videoconference will allow us to narrow the differences which are still there on the table, and to prepare the ground well, what I believe will be a decisive move forward, an agreement in July. On the second topic which was raised by the rest of the honourable Members, I would just like to inform you about how we are going to implement the Withdrawal Agreement. As you know, I am representing the European Union in this joint committee with Michael Gove, who is representing the British Government. And here we are talking about the agreement which was approved, signed and ratified by this Parliament and by the UK Parliament, and once there was a clear statement by Michael Gove that there will not be any extension of the transitional period, I did the same. And what I heard from our rapporteurs, Ms Piri and Mr Hansen, but also from Mr McAllister was that we need to accelerate our work and to make sure that the Withdrawal Agreement is properly implemented.  I’m very glad to report that the discussion of the joint committee was in a very positive atmosphere and that we could state that there is good progress in the area of the financial provisions, on the Protocol on Gibraltar, on the Protocol on the sovereign base areas of the UK in Cyprus and also on citizens’ rights where I know how important this issue is for the European Parliament and for our citizens and I believe we will be able to resolve our differences definitely before the end of the year. What is the most challenging issue is of course the application of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, and here I was very clear and I made it very clear also to the UK delegations that what we need is some more operation, because we understand the aspiration, which has already presented to us. But for us, it’s very important to have very concrete responses on how the UK is going to implement the VAT regime, excise and customs obligations, which are clearly stated in the Withdrawal Agreement. I’m glad that the response I got from Michael Gove was that we will work very hard over the summer, that we will have another specialised committee session on the Irish Protocol in July, and we will come back overall what I believe will be progress in early September. So there is a lot of work, but I believe that when it comes to the Withdrawal Agreement, both sides are realising that the proper implementation is the key to trust-building, to confidence-building which we need for the good future relationship between European Union and the United Kingdom.  And how will this future relationship look? If you allow, Madam President, I will pass the floor to Michel Barnier because he’s negotiating day and night with our UK colleagues and he will be able to give you the best picture.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 119, "date": "2020-06-17.json", "name": "Michel Barnier", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   head of the task force for relations with the United Kingdom. Madam President, good evening to each and every one of you and thank you to Maroo for the good cooperation between us. I would like to say a few words at his side on the issue of this very complex, extraordinary Brexit negotiation. First of all, thank your Parliament, Madam President, the 17 committees that have committed themselves and their rapporteurs. As David McAllister said, this is the first time, and I think it is time, and so I would like to thank Kati Piri and Christophe Hansen very warmly for the rather complicated synthesis work they have done and congratulate them on it.  We need the vigilance, the determination of the European Parliament in this period. It is this determination that your President David Sassoli expressed on Monday at the high-level conference organised with the Chair of the Committee, Ursula von der Leyen, Charles Michel, the President of the European Council, yourself, and Boris Johnson. And then, I think it was Nathalie Loiseau who said it, you will have the last word, once again, when we have, I hope, reached an agreement with the United Kingdom.  As we have just pointed out, we have taken note of the negative position of the British Government to possibly extend, as we did, as we still have the possibility until 30 June, this transition period, which is in fact the period of negotiation. And so this puts us in the middle of the ford: there are four months of negotiations behind us, there are only four months of negotiations before us, Kati Piri said 204 days earlier.  So it's difficult. This remains possible, the time is very short and I share the sense of urgency expressed by Boris Johnson and that is why we have decided, with my counterpart, David Frost and his negotiating team, which is, like ours, very professional, to intensify in July, August and September, these negotiations, to have more concentrated discussions. , more focused, with the objective and the obligation for us, but you know that this is my rule, to have the same transparency with your Parliament, your coordination group, your committees and also with the 27 Member States on whose behalf we are negotiating. What are the next steps? One thing is clear, as the three presidents of the three institutions pointed out when they met Boris Johnson on Monday, what matters to us even before the process is a step forward on the merits.  It is up to the UK to choose what it wants and whether it wants a deal. As you said very well, Madam Minister Nikolina Brnjac, just now at the beginning of this session, it is the choice of the United Kingdom to want or not to want an agreement because the terms of an agreement are already known. We have approved them with Boris Johnson and every comma, every word has been negotiated bitterly in the political declaration to commit us to an ambitious and lasting partnership to which your Parliament is also attached.  Not only is there an unprecedented trade partnership, zero tariffs, zero quota on all goods - a first in the Union's commercial history - but with an agreement on fisheries, Mr Bellamy has pointed out, and with an agreement on the level playing field, which will deal with state aid, tax issues, but also social and environmental rights. As Christophe Hansen said at the time, an agreement on fair play, economic and social, and this agreement will also cover energy, transport, security and defence issues, and on the basis of this unprecedented offer, we also want the conditions for access to our market to be fair.  This political statement, these principles, we have made them our own in our mandate and our draft agreement published on March 18, and it is not open to negotiation. After four years of negotiations, we can see, ladies and gentlemen, what the strategy of the British Government is. First, he refused any discussion on important topics, defence, security, development. I interpreted this as the idea of focusing all the negotiation on economic issues alone and therefore on the defence of its economic interests.  And then, in this strategy, the United Kingdom seeks to negotiate, in certain areas, a status very close to membership of the single market, quasi-member of the single market of the customs union and Schengen without having any of the constraints or disciplines. This is what we call cherry picking, on rules of origin, on mutual recognition, financial services, professional qualifications, data flows or electricity exchanges. We will not accept not cherry picking.  The second part of the UK strategy is to reject all clear and strong commitments on level playing field in order to be able to keep the freedom to deviate from the current EU rules and to compete with the EU, some even say that this is the raison d'être of Brexit and we can see this strategy on data.  I know Parliament's very strong position on this issue, on financial services, on state aid, where the United Kingdom has so far given no indication of the future national framework for state aid, I also see it on food standards and, in this context, the United Kingdom has even wished to reopen the issue of geographical indications, which are clearly protected in the withdrawal agreement referred to by Maro-S.A.  All this is not compatible with the foundations of a lasting, ambitious agreement with a great country that will, in any event, remain our friend, our ally and our partner. And yet I remain convinced, ladies and gentlemen, that an agreement is possible for the long term, as Danuta Hubner has said. We have wanted this from the beginning and we want to give this negotiation every chance, as evidenced by this intensified process.  But, ladies and gentlemen, as you have set the direction for me in your resolution, we will not agree at all costs, that is what Bernd Lange said earlier. We will never sacrifice , I repeat the words of our President Ursula von der Leyen - the long-term economic and political interest of EU consumers and businesses for the benefit of the United Kingdom.  At the same time, we want to see tangible progress on the implementation of the withdrawal agreement referred to by Maro-S-F-ovic, both the guarantee of citizens' rights and, Madam President, this issue so important for peace in Ireland that is the proper application of the protocol. Finally, if our priority remains and will remain to reach an agreement, we also have the responsibility, as Mr Arimont and Mr Schiderwan said earlier, to prepare collectively for all possible scenarios, at the end of the year, in the event of an agreement or in case of disagreement. In any case, we have to prepare and we will prepare. I wanted to thank you for your confidence, the confidence you have in the European Commission's negotiating team, which is, never forget, your negotiating team. In the coming weeks, which are going to be decisive, we will have to demonstrate certain qualities. Ms. Piri asked me to be humorous; I recognize that I have some room for improvement, but it is important at my age to keep room for progress. The calmness to which Mr. Danielsson invited me, our patience; the calm and patience on my side are inexhaustible.

With the adoption of your recommendation, our negotiator should be in a better position to engage in the very intense phase of negotiating that is coming, as it is clear for both our institutions that progress in the partnership negotiations had to go hand in hand with progress in the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement. This means that we will have to remain vigilant as regards, first and foremost, the preservation of citizens’ rights, be it during the transition period or under whatever future relationship with the United Kingdom. But our vigilance will have to be no less thorough when considering the intended economic partnership, where strong, safeguarded and robust governance will be called for to protect the integrity of the EU single market and the competitive position of EU firms. We will therefore count on your cooperation in this respect as well. In negotiation with the UK on our future relationship and partnership, our common efforts and commonality of purpose will provide the support required by our negotiator and help ensure an outcome to the benefit of the Union and its citizens. Coming back to the MFF and recovery, the President of the European Council wants to pave the way for a deal by providing the leaders with an opportunity to discuss the MFF and the recovery package. Therefore, the Friday meeting will be an orientation debate, during which the leaders will have the opportunity to explain how they see the Commission’s new proposals and whether the overall package meets their expectations. This debate will inform the work of the President of the European Council and help him bring together the necessary elements to prepare the final stretch of negotiations and build a successful compromise. I take from this debate that we will share a sense of urgency and of ambition. We are actually aware that there is still a lot of work to be done to reconcile different interests and points of view in order to build a compromise. Ultimately, our goal is to agree as soon as possible on what is an unprecedented financial package to face an unprecedented crisis. In the remaining days of our Presidency, we will continue to be fully committed to doing our utmost to facilitate all the steps leading to such an agreement, and to do so in a way that is mindful of Parliament’s views.

Above all, this demand that The United Kingdom, as a sovereign state again, submits itself not to an independent arbitral tribunal, but to the highest court of its contracting party, the EU, runs counter to both the practice of international law and the practice of the EU itself.

There is nothing more menial than attacking those on the front lines for lives in times of danger to all.

Further negotiations should be based on a political declaration, which is now a reference to the negotiations and defines the parameters of a flexible partnership. Interinstitutional cooperation must ensure the safety of our citizens living in the UK. It is essential that both parties to the future agreement maintain current EU standards on consumer protection and citizens' rights in line with EU legal achievements. The agreement should ensure the protection of citizens of both countries through the obligations of entrepreneurs recruiting workers from outside the UK, in particular from Central and Eastern Europe, many of whom live in the British Isles. We must also do everything we can to ensure that the principles of free movement of persons between the EU and the UK are applied after the transition period. The UK's notification of a derogation from this rule is very worrying. The future partnership should include provisions on the movement of persons based on full reciprocity and the principle of non-discrimination between Member States, and the UK's access to the Internal Market of the Union should be proportionate to the commitments made to facilitate the mobility of persons, taking into account the principle of reciprocity in bilateral relations.

In a historic crisis, it is justified that we use all the means made possible by the EU to revitalise our common internal market. However, there is still much room for improvement in the package. Personally, I think it is important that the Fund should provide member states with more loans than proposed and only a small amount of direct payments.  In order not to obscure the responsibilities of the Member States, the commitment to good economic management must be included in the criteria for allocating funds. At the same time as we agree on expenditure, a clear decision must also be made on the plan to repay the loan. Increasing the EU's own resources is a worth a proposal, and I welcome, for example, the idea of a tax on non-recyclable plastic. However, taxation requires a unanimous decision by the Member States, which has so far not been achieved. It is now important for member states to find a common position on future own resources and taxes on them. If the repayment of the loan remains open, it could lead to cuts in the EU budget over the next few periods, reducing funding for all EU programmes.  The most crucial thing for recovery is to channel the funds so that they support industrial renewal, digitalisation and sustainable growth. It is advisable to channel as much of the package as possible through existing EU programmes. This is important not only for efficiency, but also for ensuring transparency and parliamentary control.  It is good that the Commission's latest proposal partly increases funds to achieve climate neutrality. At the same time, however, I am disappointed that the proposal cuts from the CEF programme, which funds cross-border transport, energy and digital infrastructure.

The situation has no doubt radically changed since we last had a chance to discuss the issue in this plenary back in January. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has, in the meantime, left deep marks on our societies and economies, leaving no one and nothing unaffected, including the plans we had for the conference.  For obvious reasons over the last few weeks and months, we had to focus our attention on the most pressing priorities for our citizens; foremost the health emergency and its economic and social consequences. If anything, however, the crisis has shown us how important it is to reflect together on the future of our Union. The Presidency therefore remains strongly committed to reaching a consensus in the Council as soon as possible, with the aim of finding an agreement with Parliament and the Commission on the timing and manner of launching the conference and on its overall concept. However, I want to strongly underline that we are doing our best to find swift agreement in the Council on this important issue. That work is still ongoing and has intensified over the last week at COREPER, ministerial and other high political levels. On 9 May, in his address to mark Europe Day, the Croatian Prime Minister, Mr Plenković, stressed the paramount value of the future of Europe open debates with our citizens and other stakeholders for shaping the vision of our common European future. He invited all EU Member States to reach a consensus as soon as possible, as well as the agreement with Parliament and the Commission.  On 26 May, the Presidency also included a discussion on the conference on the agenda of the informal videoconference of Ministers of European Affairs.  As it emerged from these exchanges, the design of the conference will of course need to take into account the recent developments. The Presidency is therefore working on the revised text of the Council’s position in order to also reflect the COVID-19 reality.  We take note of Parliament’s new resolution on the conference on which you will vote in this plenary which similarly seeks to reflect the new reality. At the same time, we believe that the nature of the conference should not fundamentally change in the light of the pandemic. The conference should contribute to the development of our policies in the medium and long term, so that we can better tackle current and future challenges while taking into account as many views of different stakeholders as possible.  While the lessons of the COVID-19 crisis should be included in our reflection, we also consider that the crisis has further highlighted the importance of the already identified priorities of the 2019-2024 strategic agenda. These priorities range from strengthening our single market to successfully delivering the green and digital transition, and delivering concrete results for the benefit and well-being of our citizens. Most importantly, we remain convinced that the upcoming conference should be an inclusive process involving our three institutions in full respect of the interinstitutional balance and of our respective roles. Likewise, Member States should be involved equally, including their national parliaments, and shared ownership remains important.  Finally, let me reiterate that to deliver on our priorities, as well as defining a vision of Europe in 10 to 20 years, cooperation among institutions will be imperative. As the coronavirus crisis has reminded us all, divisions make us weaker. Only by overcoming them will we be able to proactively shape our future.

Since then, our world has changed significantly. We are not yet out of the crisis, so we cannot be certain of the impact that this will have on our work for the moment. My key message to you today is that the Conference on the Future of Europe is now more important than ever before. It is an exercise in democratic participation, which showcases the European way. Our common rights and values are central to the resilience of our societies and will be the basis on which we build our recovery from the corona crisis. I am convinced that we must continue to move forward together with ambition and vision. I see my job as reaching out to each and every European citizen. The COVID—19 pandemic shows us the importance of solidarity. It has also shown how together we can recover, repair and come out stronger from this crisis, as President von der Leyen recently said here in this very Chamber. I agree and would add that only together can we build the present and the future that citizens deserve. And please note this: the present and the future. The Commission has proposed a clear, structured plan that aims to lead us out of crisis and into sustainable and long-term economic growth, based on a green transition and a digital transformation, as requested by the European Council. The recently-announced comprehensive package for European recovery, with its overall budget of EUR 1.85 trillion, will help Europe recover from the crisis and support multiple European sectors as we emerge from this period of constraint. This includes major initiatives like Next Generation EU, which will boost the European budget in the first crucial years of the recovery and contribute, together with the reinforced budget for 2021—2027, to making it sustainable, inclusive and fair for everyone, including those in disadvantaged areas and those who were hit hard by the crisis. Together we will come out of the crisis. The Conference on the Future of Europe is an excellent tool to engage and involve all Europeans. I look forward to the joint declaration by the Parliament, the Council and the Commission and later – as soon as possible – to launching the Conference on the Future of Europe. Let’s be honest. Politics is no longer business as usual. We must be brave, have the courage of our convictions and deliver for the citizens. They demand it of us and we have a mandate to respond. We need to strengthen our representative democracy even more by offering an opportunity for enhanced participative democracy. I rely on your support for making this joint declaration a reality as soon as possible. We need to agree on the structure, scope and main principles of the Conference and establish principles for those who want to become our partners in this exercise. Yesterday, at the COSAC meeting, the national parliaments made it clear that they want to be partners in this joint endeavour, and we need to consolidate this partnership approach. We are not competing for influence here. We need to work together to be able to reach out to as many citizens as possible. They count upon the Council of Ministers to reach an agreement on a mandate to enable us to start as soon as possible the negotiations on the joint declaration so that the Conference can be launched as soon as possible. This is the Commission standpoint. In this context, I would like to say a few words on democracy and the Conference on the Future of Europe. During these times, people feel left behind. They blame democracy itself sometimes. While unfortunate, this also shows the importance of democracy and its relevance in our daily lives. Who present here today could have imagined the way in which COVID—19 has infected our European Union in so many different ways at so many different levels? Surely this current crisis shows now more than ever that democracy and democratic institutions have a key role to play. We understand that citizens’ trust in democracy cannot and should not ever be taken for granted. Citizens have been asking for greater participation in policy-making, and we need to listen to this call. By involving citizens and civil society even more, we will help to reinforce democracy in the European Union. Let us have the courage to put innovative tools to work for democracy and citizens, starting with the Conference on the Future of Europe. To conclude, I will end by reminding you why we are having the Conference on the Future of Europe. It is for the current and the next generations of Europeans. Together we – citizens and institutions – will find ways to give Europeans a greater say on what the Union does and how it works for them. Let us have the courage to make a success of the Conference on the Future of Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 134, "date": "2020-06-17.json", "name": "Paulo Rangel", "mepid": "96903", "text": "  on behalf of the Ppe Group. – Madam President, the Council and in particular the Vice-President of the Commission would also like to thank the President for the words. Firstly, which I think is essential to say here, is that it is very good to understand that the groups, I would say pro-Europeans of this house, were able to find to give a new impetus to the Conference on the Future of Europe and therefore this was the first point i wanted to underline. It is that we are clearly united and have a vision that is a shared vision of what should be the conference. Secondly, I would also like to say that today, as the Council seems to have discovered more recently now, the Conference on the Future of Europe is more important than it was six months ago and six months ago it was already much needed, but it is now more important. Why?  Because the pandemic is not that it has created new problems, it has made much more patent the problems that already existed and therefore it is necessary now.  There is an awareness on the part of the people, of the citizens, of the problems that Europe is experiencing, in particular the problems that have to do, on the one hand, with what should be the great objectives of the European project, what are the new major objectives and, on the other hand, also the problems of democracy, the problems of the rule of law, the problems of citizen participation and , therefore, these which were, shall we say, the great objectives and principles of the conference are clearly more necessary today than before. Secondly, it is very important: it is essential to realise that, in these circumstances, we must involve the citizens in it and we must follow-up and draw consequences from this conference.  There are two points which are also in the resolution, but the most important point, and here I have to go to the Council and accompany the Commission: ask the Council to take a decision, to ask the Council to finally take a position on this, because, my dear friends, only beautiful words are not enough. We have always heard very beautiful words from the Presidency, but we have seen no progress, no action and we continue to see great hesitation in the Council.  This is also a signal to European citizens. The Council cannot complain about the lack of democracy and then be delaying the Conference on the Future of Europe more and more.

Inequalities, pandemics, climate change, digitization are challenges we face regardless of where we live. We also need to accelerate the change in the Union's decision-making system, moving from unanimity to the majority system in some crucial respects. Before the COVID-19 crisis, we were raising it: a European conference that reflects and defines its future.  This conference is now more necessary than ever. COVID-19 has highlighted some serious shortcomings in the Union, which must be addressed, including lack of competition in health matters, chaotic border closures and also lack of solidarity. If we add to this the risk that there will be no agreement between the Member States to approve the recovery plan, then we will face an unprecedented economic and social crisis.  Unfortunately, the Council continues to give lengths. While Parliament and the Commission have been ready since January to launch this conference, the Council has not yet been able to launch an agreement. Ladies and gentlemen, we need to have a stronger European Union in the future, and we cannot do this alone in the European bubble.

I hope that the Council this time can reach an agreement so that we can launch this conference, because let’s be honest, it becomes more and more like the monster of Loch Ness. From time to time it appears, then it disappears, it is more like an illusion, like a fantasy and we must avoid that. This is serious business, this conference is not one or other little instrument for the European Parliament. This conference is vital, it is crucial for the future of our European Union, because let’s face it, this Covid crisis is another illustration of it. This Covid crisis will change the world. It is a world that will be completely different, a world that will no longer be dominated, I think, by the United States of America who is withdrawing from the international scene for the moment. It may well be dominated by China who wants to become, and who already is, a world power and who wants to dominate the world and international scene.   Between America and China there will be Europe stuck between them and if we don’t want to be stuck between the US at the one hand and China on the other hand, and if we want really the instruments to defend the interests of our citizens, we need another European Union. This European Union is not fit for purpose. Not fit for the future and we all know it. The Council knows it, the Commission knows it and certainly our citizens know it.  So it’s time now to start really this exercise because we have not a lot of time, maybe we can tell that to your colleagues in the Council. There is the Covid crisis, there are precedent crises, tomorrow there could be another challenge.

It is true that the Treaty of Rome and its signatory countries were hopeful about the European project, but it all seems so far away. What if the crises we are experiencing mark the swansong of this federalist and technocratic Europe? The European Union falls from Charybde to Scylla: health failure in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, failure on border issues and deconfinement, and a failure to date also of consensus on the recovery plan. But make no mistake, the failures are not, alas, new. So what future for Europe? To decide where you are going, you have to know where you are coming from. The roots of Europe, its culture, its wounds and its greatness are not a negotiable legacy, globalization has made our continent a land of passage and repentance. The people are attached to their land, their country, their great men. Ultraliberal dogma has lived, federalism must be reviewed in the light of the lessons of the past.

That’s the same amount that the European Council took to discuss the outcome of the last major exercise of citizen consultation. We talked to hundreds of thousands of Europeans in over 1 600 citizens’ dialogues. When I read now the draft Council mandate, I have to say that I am shocked the outcome of the two-year debate on the conference should simply be another discussion of the Council behind closed doors. How do you explain to citizens that we are having a debate on the future of Europe, but that you don't really want them to change anything, that we’re excluding the possibility of treaty change, of real change, before the debate has even started? I think that’s absurd.  So we are in a situation where, for the second time in a decade, we are slipping into the worst economic crisis. Millions of Europeans are losing their jobs, particularly young people. Many of them had just gotten out of the last crisis. The question now is: can we or do we want to afford losing another decade, or are we finally going to address the structural shortcomings of this Union, and make sure that we get out of this crisis faster than the last one. I hear in the Council that the conference has become a bit of a running joke, a running gag. I think this House has made it very clear that citizen participation is not a joke, that meaningful reform of the Union is not a joke, and that coming out of this crisis stronger and more united is not a joke.

In reality, however, there has long been a progressive uniformity of cultures, opinions and collectiveity in Europe.

Eight months have passed since the President of the Commission promised this conference to the people of Europe. The European Parliament immediately began to work very how we can move this conference. Many questions about the future organisational and institutional structure and constitutional mandate of this conference still need to be clarified, so time is simply pressing and we have to move, or we, as EU institutions, are not only making ourselves look ridiculous, but are further shaking up confidence in the democracy and capacity of the European Union to participate. The EU's system of government suffers from a number of serious shortcomings – as we all know – that have become apparent over the last decade: the euro crisis, the migration crisis, the rule of law deficits. Moreover, the EU is facing further crises with Brexit. Certainly, we also have differences of opinion: on enlargement, on the new Multiannual Financial Framework, on the ECB or on how to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Both the old and the new crises are only exacerbated by the institutional weaknesses of the EU's current constitutional architecture. And this urgently requires that citizens test the EU's ability to act and make effective and legitimate changes in a transparent manner. That is why I believe that we need this process of self-reflection. That is why we need consultation with citizens in this conference, so that we do not just set up a consultation mechanism and a dialogue again, but that we can come up with real changes to deal with these issues of the future.

Look at the impact on citizens, on families and societies. Why can’t we discuss this openly? Can I just say the words ‘as soon as possible’ were used by the Council — asap. When I hear that, to me it means now, not in a year’s time, today.   So please, you are hearing the frustrated voices of this Parliament collectively, except for one or two, who want you to move forward and to sit down with the Parliament to engage with national parliaments, with citizens, with the Commission and create a better Europe. It is not about more, it is about better.

I think that your feedback is very important to our work and I really do appreciate what I heard today. I appreciate your contributions and your will to make the Conference happen, so thank you once again. Let me remind ourselves that when the Commission communication shaping the Conference was adopted on 22 January earlier this year, the Union was in the seventh consecutive year of growth and forecasts pointed to an expansion in 2020-2021. Today, with millions of citizens slowly coming out of confinement and the global recession unfolding, the perspective has radically changed. However, our determination to engage with citizens and ensure their voice is heard has not changed from that moment.  A key message from me today is that the Conference on the Future of Europe remains crucial. In fact, I would go so far as to say that because of the pandemic, it is now more important than ever before. European citizens should have greater say on what the Union does and how it works for them. Answering the difficult questions helps to save lives. Let me stress that we want the Conference to be an open, inclusive and transparent and structured debate.  I referred earlier to the Commission communication on the Conference. The principles stated in it are still valid. The Conference should allow citizens to focus on what they consider to be important. The Commission’s political priorities and the European Council Strategic Agenda provide a broad framework. Having already held many dialogues with citizens, I am convinced that issues such as healthcare and the European Union’s response to the public health crisis will now have a more prominent role in the dialogues among citizens.  Despite challenging circumstances, we aim to launch the Conference on the Future of Europe as soon as possible. Or, as Ms McGuinness said just now, once the Council has adopted its mandate, we can agree on a joint declaration. We are committed to follow up on what is agreed by the Conference. This will be the measure of our success and I commit to it fully. Prior to the Coronavirus outbreak, I was on a listening tour of the European Union. I had planned to visit all 27 Member States but I did only 10. In the first six months of my mandate, in my mission, I was focusing on national and regional examples of where citizens are structurally involved in decision-making processes because getting the feedback mechanism will be key for the Conference on the Future of Europe this time. A feedback mechanism is one of the most important things in this Conference and this is different from previous consultations.  We need to make sure that ideas found in local discussions can be meaningfully discussed at European level. Just like the honourable Members today said, I insist that the Conference on the Future of Europe must be representative of geography, gender, age, socioeconomic background and level of education of citizens. It must also be inclusive of minority populations. All are part of our Europe’s diversity.  It is important to keep an open mind. As I have said to you before, I believe that we should not predetermine the outcome. This is what we agreed many, many months ago, so we should not predetermine outcome or restrict the issues for discussion.  This is an important moment for us. We have the potential to lay the ground for a new type of politics, for a new dynamic to complement representative democracy together. Only together can we do this. Together, we can reinforce the link between European Union policymaking and the citizens’ increased trust. Increased trust, increased legitimacy. Let us make the Conference on the Future of Europe a real success for our citizens.  Thank you once again for your contributions and I’m looking forward to the Council agreeing on a joint declaration and then we can start; I think September would be the best timing to start this.

I have listened carefully to your views on this important subject and I have taken good note of them.  The Presidency is completely dedicated to finding common ground in the Council. The conference is very important to all of us, but personally I regret very much that we were not able to launch it in Dubrovnik during our Presidency. Before the outbreak of the pandemic, the Croatian Presidency sparred no effort when it came to the facilitating an agreement towards the Council mandates on this issue. Let me reassure you that we will continue to work with vigour and ambition in this direction.  The conference is a new project and some of the stakeholders have far-reaching ambitions for this exercise. It is expected that Member States approach it with different ideas, views, experiences and priorities. In any case, we are seeking consensus.  As this is a very important and emotional debate for the Presidency, and my last plenary as minister-delegate, allow me a few words in my native Croatian. Dear Chairman, in the first Croatian Presidency of the Council we faced a challenge not seen since the founding of the European Union. I am proud of our joint swift response, of the commitment of all colleagues, I am proud that we have ensured the continuity of decision-making in the Council, but also the constant communication of ministers in all Council formations.  Today I would especially like to thank all MEPs and MEPs who continued to work together with their colleagues in the Council and the Commission, at the height of the crisis, in order to adopt the first packages of measures to deal with European health, the economy and society as a whole with the COVID-19 pandemic. I hope that together we will work equally successfully on a recovery plan for the European Union. Thank you for enthusiastically supporting the Croatian programme and the priorities of the presidency. Your cooperation has been invaluable to us over the past six months.  Let me finally express my firm belief that by the end of the month we will find consensus on the Council's position on the Conference on the Future of Europe.  A healthy, resilient, responsible, strong and secure Europe, tailor-made for our citizens, must be our first priority.

Despite the strong catch-up afterwards, the EU was unable to get a grip on the various measures taken by the Member States at the beginning of the crisis. We must not be blind to this and we must dare to learn lessons. In order to overcome the socio-economic consequences , which are the biggest since World War II, we also need a great deal of resilience and a strong Union that can act decisively. Today I call for a thorough debate on the role of the European Union in cross-border health crises, so that we are better prepared in the future.

They revealed numerous shortcomings both in the management system of the Union and in the areas of competence it has.

They should, in my view, provide for a greater delegation of competences and institutional conversions m.in to the Union, including the abolition of unanimity in the Council, entrusting the European Commission with the role of a genuine EU government by limiting the role of the European Council, reducing the composition of the Commission and making it dependent on the results of the EP elections.

It is important that all EU institutions, while respecting their Treaty competences and, equally, the Member States, look at the future of Europe. We must not forget the national parliaments, their participation will strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the conference. The future of Europe is a community of nations, where individual traditions are appreciated, aware of their history and roots.

Since the 2008 economic crisis, the long 2010s have been a series of virtually different crises – economic, financial, migration crises, the proliferation of terrorist attacks and the current epidemic situation. Europe, the European states, must become more resilient and effective in dealing with crises. Work needs to be made to solve problems that benefit European nations and European citizens. The principle of an ideological 'ever closer union' should not be allowed to tie up thinking about the future of Europe. European states are currently facing a number of challenges. They must become competitive on the world market and provide security for their citizens. Find answers to the demographic challenge of their society's ageing. They must say no to mass migration, which denies the values of European culture. They need to restart their economies, in which they are doomed to cooperate. We therefore need a Union that helps European nations in this. The Conference provides a good framework for the conduct of debates, but it can only be effective if no one owns it.

When we talk about the future of Europe, one of the first and most important questions that we need to put on the table is this: how long are we going to allow such a deep gap between member states' public health systems? What kind of European community is one of its citizens three times more likely to get a hospital infection than its European citizen, who lives just a few hundred kilometres away?  When we think about the future of Europe, we need to be able to answer whether it is right that in an Eastern European Member State, due to the protocols and quality of care in force, a European citizen's cancer is less likely to be diagnosed in time than to the west.

They pledged to do everything that is necessary to protect our citizens and overcome the crisis by preserving our European ways and way of life.  Members of the European Council also welcomed the Commission guidelines on the screening of foreign direct investment and called on the Member States to take all the necessary measures to protect strategic assets and technology from foreign investments that could threaten legitimate public policy objectives. In the words of the leaders, this will contribute to the EU’s strategic autonomy during the crisis and afterwards.  It is clear that the European Union will not get out of this crisis by closing its doors to international trade and investment. Many European companies are fully integrated in the global supply chain and a significant share of our employment is made possible thanks to international trade and investment. Global trade and investment will therefore remain fundamental for Europe’s recovery and growth. The European Union needs to diversify and solidify its global supply chains to ensure the continuous flow of goods and services and to be better prepared for future crises. However, at this time the European Union also needs to be particularly vigilant to ensure that we preserve those assets that are crucial to our security and that are part of the backbone of our economy. This will directly affect our capability to recover fast.  The economic crisis resulting from COVID—19 has weakened many European companies who have seen their stock prices fall. The danger of predatory takeovers by foreign companies, in particular those in state hands or with strong state support, is very real. The EU’s openness to foreign direct investment therefore has to be balanced with adequate tools and protection. EU rules already provide a framework to guarantee the protection of legitimate public objectives and Ministers for the internal market and industry regularly discuss the competitiveness of the EU economy and in particular its industry.  The discussion focused on strengthening the European strategic economic sectors and value chains and, in this context, also the protection from foreign takeovers. Ministers have welcomed the new industrial strategy for Europe that was presented by the Commission in March. They support the action announced by the Commission to reinforce the EU’s strategic digital infrastructures, to develop synergies between civil, defence and space industries, to secure the supply of pharmaceuticals and their ingredients, and to broaden EU access to raw materials, to give just a few examples.  At the informal video conference last Friday, 12 June, Ministers from the internal market and industry also discussed the Commission’s communication on the recovery plan package adopted on 27 May. They welcomed the measures proposed by the Commission to strengthen EU resilience and strategic autonomy across key technologies and value chains, while preserving the benefits of an open economy.  Ministers also welcomed a new European Strategic Investment Facility under InvestEU to support European resilience and investment in strategic industrial chains, notably those linked to the green and the digital transition. The Ministers took note of the Commission’s intention to propose a reinforced foreign direct investment screening mechanism, which would help the EU to protect its strategic assets, infrastructure and technologies from foreign direct investments that could threaten the security of the public order. The existing FDI screening regulation was already a priority file for the three institutions during the past legislature. This regulation was agreed very swiftly and in a very consensual manner by the co—legislators. Our collective engagement in this dossier has made the EU better able today to face the challenge in front of us. As you know, a significant and increasing number of Member States already have a screening mechanism in place and many others are accelerating the creation of their national contact points. The cooperation and exchange of information among Member States and with the Commission about potential foreign takeovers affecting our security or public order has increased sharply.  The Commission is regularly analysing and reporting on investment trends in an expert group, as foreseen in the regulation. Moreover, the upcoming Commission White Paper on an instrument on foreign subsidies will be a good opportunity to address the issue of state subsidies from third countries that have the potential of further disrupting the level playing field in the EU single market. The examples I have just mentioned show how institutional cooperation has improved the situation on the ground for our companies.  Finally, allow me to reiterate that the Council and the Member States will take all the necessary measures to protect strategic assets and technology from foreign investments that could threaten legitimate public policy objectives.

And I think we all realise that the current geopolitical context, the global economic environment, is probably the most difficult in recent history. Openness to trade and investments and to a rule-based multilateral order, they are all being challenged.  So today, the European Commission has adopted a White Paper, which launches a public consultation on ideas for future rules to make sure that foreign subsidies won’t undermine the level playing field in Europe’s single market.  Right now, as we start to rebuild from the damage that the coronavirus is doing, we need the single market more than ever.  Foreign investment is an important source of jobs and growth and very much welcome in Europe, but when foreign governments give subsidies to support investment and operations in the single market, that can affect our level playing field in several ways. To give you a couple of examples: if businesses are being subsidised that are already in Europe; if businesses are being helped by foreign subsidies to buy European businesses; subsidies can help foreign companies to outbid rivals in public tenders and some subsidised companies can even get access to money from the European budget. In this White Paper, we produce three different modules with three different ways to deal with these situations.  Module 1 is a general market scrutiny instrument to capture all market situations where foreign subsidies would distort the single market. The competence would be shared between Member States and the Commission and if a subsidy is found to distort the single market then redressive measures could be imposed. Or if the subsidy investment or economic activity has a positive impact that outweighs the distortion, the Commission could decide not to pursue it further. And this is what we call the EU interest test. Module 2 specifically addresses distortions caused by foreign subsidies facilitating acquisitions of EU companies.  The Commission would be the competent supervisory authority and a transaction could not be closed whilst the Commission’s review is still pending. Here, commitments might be accepted to allow for the acquisition and also here an EU interest test could be applied. Module 3 addresses the issues that might arise in public procurement and sets out a mechanism where bidders would have to notify any financial contribution received from third countries.  The competent authorities would then assess whether there is a foreign subsidy and whether that has made the procurement procedure unfair. The bidder would be excluded from the procurement process on this basis.  Finally, we also propose to look at access to EU funding in the context of foreign subsidies, both when EU funds are implemented by the Member States and when they’re implemented by the European Commission directly. Obviously, these are complex matters.  So, we are launching a public consultation. It will be open for 14 weeks until 23 September. And we hope to get a wide range of views and suggestions and this obviously is the best possible way of starting this consultation by getting the views of the European Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 164, "date": "2020-06-17.json", "name": "Phil Hogan", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, as my colleague, Executive Vice-President Commissioner Vestager, has said, the debate in the European Parliament this evening is very timely, for the reasons that she has just outlined, but also, we are living in a global public health challenge that is having profound consequences on our economies and on our daily lives. The COVID-19 emergency has exposed our vulnerability in many respects, and one of them is the resilience of our strategic industries in their capacity to respond to the vital needs of the European people.  We all agree that investment, including foreign direct investment (FDI), will play a central role in our economic recovery in each Member State, but foreign direct investment will also contribute to bridging the gap of domestic financing for the EU’s economic recovery and future ambitions, including greening our economy and making it fit for the digital age. In addition, foreign direct investment turbocharges research and innovation. Foreign—owned firms account for a quarter of business in terms of R&amp;D in France, Germany and Spain, between 30% and 50% in Portugal and Sweden, and more than 50% in Austria, Belgium and Ireland. But foreign investments should not happen at the expense of our own internal security. This is where our FDI Screening Regulation plays a very important role in addressing the concerns when foreign investment may put European security or public order at risk. The Commission is closely following developments in the European Union, and at the end of March, we issued, as the Council President has said, special guidance to Member States on the protection of Europe’s strategic assets, ahead of the full application of the FDI Screening Regulation in October 2020. It reminds Member States of the interdependencies that exist in the European single market. It calls on all of them to seek advice and coordination in cases where foreign investments could, actually or potentially, now or in the future, have an effect on public order or security. Those Member States that have screening mechanisms should take full advantage of that and use them, and those that do not should certainly put them in place as soon as possible.  Europe has a strict and unique system of state aid control and transparency in place, but there is increasing concern that some third countries do not shy away from intervening in our markets with massive amounts of subsidies, and such third—country subsidies will then distort the European Union’s internal market. So investors receiving such subsidies could aim to acquire EU companies and could, thanks to their state financing, outbid other companies, including European companies. As Executive Vice-President Vestager said, the Commission has today adopted a white paper, which launches a very important public consultation on the ideas for future roles to make sure that foreign subsidies don’t undermine the level playing field in Europe’s single market.

Mr President, Madam Executive Vice-President, Commissioner, dear representatives of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in December 2019, President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the Commission she will chair will play a strong geopolitical role. The white paper you are presenting today on foreign subsidies is really a step in that direction, and I would like to welcome it, especially in the current context where the European Commission is working intensively to manage the crisis, particularly through the temporary framework of state aid. In the annual report on competition policy, of which I am rapporteur and which will be voted on tomorrow, we call on the European Commission, together with colleagues, to strengthen competition policy in globalisation and to ensure reciprocity with third countries in terms of public procurement and state aid. Our observation is clear: we must adapt our rules to the current situation to remedy two legal loopholes. Firstly, our state aid rules do not apply to non-European operators who have full access to our single market, and finally, neither antitrust rules nor the control of EU mergers take into account foreign subsidies. Imagine, ladies and gentlemen, a football match where the rules of the foreign team welcomed would be much more lenient than those of the team that plays at home. You don't have to watch the game, because without being flashy, you already know in advance who will win it, but in a totally unfair way! The COVID-19 crisis has alerted us to the need to preserve our key sectors in order to achieve a resilient Europe. The hostile takeovers of companies weakened by this crisis cannot be commonplace, on the pretext that we have not been able to prevent them, and I welcome the avenues put forward today by the Commission, which will enable this type of predatory behaviour to be investigated and prevented. However, there is still a long way to go, and I hope that the public consultation will answer these questions, in particular: what distribution of powers between the Commission and the Member States, what freedom for Member States which, from now on, willingly accept foreign investment or the buy-backs of their national flagships by largely subsidised foreign companies?

So I think we should try to start amending our investment screening mechanism once it comes into force in October and we could learn a lesson from this. In addition, I think in order to protect our strategic sectors we must also protect their supply chains, and there it would be interesting to learn from Japan where they’re investing into relocating in order to protect supply chains, and they do that together with ASEAN countries.

So in that respect the foreign direct investment screening mechanism that will come into effect in October needs to be strengthened. Also I think if there were two issues that we need your assistance on, then it would first of all be to respond in a very clear way and in a very strong way to the White Paper that has been issued by my colleague Commissioner Vestager today, in terms of getting a good response about how we need to do more in dealing with the issue of farm subsidies and that they are competing on an uneven playing field with the European companies.

It gives us choice, it gives us affordable prices, it gives us innovation. But in the same vein, of course we will not let go of fair competition.

I also hope that you will insist that we get better procurement rules, because procurement is a competition, and those who are the most efficient, with the highest quality, they should win: not those who come with a subsidy in their luggage.

The vision of the Commission for the recovery of tourism and transport, as we gradually emerge on the other side of the Coronavirus pandemic. I am sincerely happy to be back with you. As the summer holidays approach, it is clear that we need to consider transport and tourism together. How would we physically go on holiday if no trains, boats, planes or cars were moving, or indeed moving across borders?  However, getting the economy moving requires people moving too, and that requires trust and coordination. What we need to offer citizens is clarity, non-discrimination and seamless connectivity.  We all know too well that the transport and tourism sectors have been the hardest hit by the pandemic, and particularly passenger transport. Traffic across modes has been down by at least 80% compared to the previous year. Transport is a vital enabler for many sectors, including tourism, and ensures the transport of goods that we all depend upon. It is in fact the backbone of the single market and economic activity as such. So restoring transport in the EU and beyond must be accelerated, while keeping health requirements in mind.  Our guidelines of 13 May set out a common framework for the progressive and safe restoration of transport services and connectivity. They provide general principles applicable to all transport services and specific recommendations for each transport mode. We have also proposed guidelines on the safe resumption of tourism services across the entire ecosystem, such as in hotels and restaurants, or for tour operators.  Additional guidelines were presented for restoring free movement and for making vouchers more attractive. With these guidelines we have all the necessary tools at hand to restart with this important part of our economy, as of now, well ahead of the economically so important summer of 2020. No endeavour can ever be risk free. However, our guidelines and the protocols developed by our agencies take all precautionary measures and provide the best available practices for reducing risks, all while making the resumption of passenger transport possible. These guidelines should be complemented by widespread information about the measures taken, so that each European can make responsible and well-informed decisions about how to limit health risks while travelling.  Any measures imposed in the transport sector have to be proportionate and risk-based. It is very important that Member States are, as of this week, leaving the general transport bans or internal borders restrictions behind and favour instead more targeted measures. This means increasing cleaning, using protective equipment, prioritising electronic ticketing or avoiding crowding in hubs. Cumulatively, these targeted measures can provide the much needed trust for people to restart travelling. Because of the unique nature of aviation, the EU Aviation Safety Agency and the European Centre for Disease Control have published additional operational recommendations based on the Commission’s general guidelines. It clarifies that a number of appropriate measures should be taken. This can, in conjunction with inbuilt features in aircraft, such as hospital grade filters, permit the reduction of risks to acceptable levels. Acting together is key, since transport is by nature a cross-regional and cross-border activity. It goes without saying that restoring links must always be coordinated, in particular we need to ensure that any measures applied at points of arrival and departure are mutually acceptable, otherwise travel will become prohibitively burdensome, expensive and in some cases impossible.  In this regard, we will also continue our good cooperation with Member States through our network of transport contact points established at the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis in the context of the Green Lanes guidelines. Safety is not the only thing needed to inspire trust. Trust is also built on precedent and the precedent we wanted to defend is that consumers should be protected in the EU at all times. The Commission has been clear throughout this crisis that the rights of passengers to reimbursement shall not be restricted. Consumers, especially those who have been hit economically by the crisis, will only get back to travelling for leisure and tourism if they can rest assured that their travel packages and flights are to be reimbursed if cancelled. In addition to all that, resuming passenger transport and tourism requires business continuity for all the sectors. Securing working capital, funding of operations, public support for businesses to maintain investment pipelines are all vital economic prerequisites for regaining connectivity and building a transport system that is fit for the future.  The Commission has therefore proposed a robust and comprehensive package for the recovery of the EU economy. Although specific economic sectors do not have ring-fenced funding in the recovery package, it is clear that those economic ecosystems, such as transport and tourism, will be able to benefit from several funding opportunities. I therefore seek your support in adopting this package swiftly. It provides a unique window of opportunity for funding in transport, tourism, automotive, aeronautics, and ship manufacturing, as well as all other industries needed to ensure sustainable, resilient and affordable connectivity for 2020 and beyond.  I will devote all my efforts in convincing Member States and private stakeholders in using the EU instruments available, to increase liquidity and to get firmly on a recovery path. The Commission’s proposed recovery package to kick-start the European economy contains an array of opportunities for transport under the EUR 1.1 thousand billion MFF and the EUR 750 billion in the Next Generation EU programme. The recovery package includes a reinforced budget for the Connecting Europe facility, with an additional EUR 1.5 billion for the general envelope to stimulate further infrastructure investment. It will accelerate the completion of the Core TEN-T network due by 2030. It will stimulate the Digital and Green Transition with clear priority given to the most decarbonised modes, rail and inland navigation, and it will accelerate the deployment of clean technologies such as alternative fuel infrastructure, in line with our Green Deal agenda.  We are also proposing an enhanced InvestEU with an increased budget of EUR 31.6 billion. This will include a new Strategic Investment Facility, the InvestEU’s fifth window to support critical infrastructure and the development of resilient value chains, including for new clean technologies that are essential for the transport sector.  In addition, the sustainable infrastructure window has almost doubled in size in our proposal and now has a EUR 20 billion guarantee which can stimulate private investment in sustainable transport infrastructure and fleet renewal.  With a total budget of EUR 560 billion the recovery and resilience facility can benefit all sectors of the economy, including transport. Member States will submit their plans — recovery and resilience plans — by April next year in order to receive grants or loans. I am sure that investment in sustainable transport systems will be high on the recovery agenda of Member States, as this is mentioned in almost all country reports of the EU Semester on which the national plans will have to be based.  Of course there is also the solvency support instrument under the European Fund for Strategic Investment with EUR 26 billion which can mobilise additional private capital to support eligible companies in the sectors most impacted by the Coronavirus. All these instruments will continue to support our priorities of sustainability and digitalisation — the focus of our upcoming Strategy in Transport communication. The Coronavirus changed a lot, but not the need for smarter sustainable mobility. 80% of the CEF budget for transport is already contributing to climate action. For the entire MFF and the Next Generation EU we propose an overall target of 25% climate mainstreaming. For transport it could be even higher.  I would like to conclude by commending you for the European Parliament resolution highlighting many of the challenges and solutions taken. As we look forward, we are of course learning lessons from our experiences over the last few months. The situation was unprecedented, and I would dare to say that we are now wiser and better prepared. I am looking forward to your questions and comments.

Tourism intercepts transport, culture and economic development. There is one particular issue – I will not repeat myself – an issue that strikes me and which I believe must be the subject of specific funding in the Recovery Fund, it would be a mistake not to foresee them: the protection of the professionalism of the human capital of the myriad small businesses, which in the tourism sector, have struggled over the years, have built up very capable staff and who could lose today.

As so many have said, \"If this is to work, it requires that those who travel, those who are going to travel are safe. On the flight, on the trains, on the bus, at hotel facilities and so on.

In my own country, Italy alone, it accounts for 13 % of gross domestic product. There has been a lot of talk about how to intervene economically. In truth, it could also be done at no cost, simplifying legislation through the legislative power that the Commission has in Brussels.

In Sweden, for example, we have a government that has handled the pandemic so terribly badly that we are not welcome to some countries simply. Swedes are not allowed in.  I therefore believe that we must realise that it will take time before we come back again, when tourism will be as it used to be. We won't see the end of this pandemic for quite some time to come, I'm afraid.

I think we are all on the same page here. We all recognise the importance of the sector of tourism and the sector of transport for all our economies. We are all worrying about how this is going to unfold in the future and how we are going to emerge from this crisis.  I said in the beginning, I gave some hints, well, you know, I’m thinking, and I’m sure many of you are doing the same thing, that we need to develop a sort of an emergency plan so that next time if, God forbid such a thing will come again, we will be prepared, for the second one.  And then we have to debate the lessons learned and I think this is also something very important that needs to be done very soon. We have to learn from the lessons that this crisis taught us in order to become better, and as has been said, it showed us our limits.  But on the other hand, now we are talking about tourism because it’s been hit so hard. It’s true that it’s a long debate on subsidiarities and what each of the Member States of the European Union should deal with and what is the degree of implication.  Of course, usually, when problems occur, everyone is looking towards Brussels and I would really have wished that we would have had the money to step in, but we didn’t have the money, at European level, to step in for the liquidity crisis. So we had to ask the Member States. We put forward this flexible framework for State aid, to step in and help with liquidity. We had to protect the consumers while we were helping the companies with liquidity.  I heard several of you - and this is a floating idea going around - because it is a lesson learned, that what you do with the liquidity issue - if a huge amount of reimbursement or compensation would be asked for in case of cancellation. And I know there is this idea of a European fund. But it has to be in a budget and of course if the Member States would like to put money together for such a fund that’s one thing, on the other hand, with all the complicated discussions we have with the budget, with the MFF and everything, I haven’t seen any true appetite for creating new things at the European level.  We have to admit the fact that there are several - at national level - several schemes of guaranteeing these kind of packages and I think that here, this can be shared, and lessons learned by Member States should include also the fact that we cannot live without having a fund to guarantee all of this, or else it won’t work and the liquidity problem will be very difficult to solve.  There are, and probably you are right, we are thinking about this, that by using State aid, it might create disparities or imbalances in the competition in the market because of some Member States having a larger fiscal capacity to step in and help companies, others less. Then we feared creating an unbalanced situation for the future.  But that’s why, for example, we imagine that we proposed the solvency instrument, which would be aimed through the European Investment Fund, especially to step in and help, including by buying equity, those companies which were less helped and they would be in need of better help at the European level because they didn’t receive it at the national level.  So, we are advanced and we are engaged with the European financial institutions, with the EIB, to map and see how all the instruments we have put in place, which is quite an exhaustive list, can be used for various situations.  But anyway, our aim is to support those who are not helped and there are viable companies to be helped through this financial instrument at European level.  Transport workers are critical and I think from the very beginning, from the very first guidelines we put forward, we stressed the importance of them being treated as critical workers. So that’s why we didn’t have them put in quarantine when they’re crossing the border or one or the other. We, in all the guidelines we had for each mode, we insisted on the protective measures to be taken, especially for workers in transport. And I think this is the same for tourism and for the hospitality industry, because if the workers are getting sick or if they are not protected, it makes it a no-brainer.  So, I think everyone started that. We have to have them safe in order to have them providing services. So this is something I’m totally supporting. For small and medium-sized enterprises, we had put very quickly in place some instruments - by my colleagues, of course, in the Commission. For example, we have the SURE programme, which is an instrument to support, especially jobs. We put in EUR 100 billion in loans for SURE, especially to support short-time work schemes and to help the Member States to protect the jobs, the employees and the self-employed against the risk of dismissal and loss of income. Is it enough? I don’t know. We are of course in a continuous process of evaluating how all these proposals we have had are actually working.  And also, the idea behind the creation of the Next Generation EU fund is especially for the recovery, it is foreseen for recovery. We have been thinking of front-loading a lot of money at the beginning of next year or so from the MFF. So this will be an injection of capital and funds, which would translate ultimately into jobs and profitability for the companies in economic sectors.  I think this would cover more or less some of the issues you have raised. Of course, we would love to see simplified procedures.  There are also messages from you, which I will take to my colleagues in the college, so that we can further reflect on the situation.  While we are talking about the future, you will receive our strategy; you will see that we are aiming at putting it to consultation. By the end of the year, you will receive our strategy for sustainable and smart transport. I would add also resilient.  So that will be a great opportunity for us to look to the future. But the future cannot be but sustainable and smart. So also when we are talking about tourism, I think, for tourism itself, the future has to be sustainable, and this is a debate we will have to have, because I don’t want to forget about that.  There are also lots of schemes at regional level for tourism - because we saw, in relation to the situation with the crisis, it has a footprint, which is regional and the necessities and challenges are different from one region to another. So, through the regional funds, I know that financing was made available. Finally, let’s not forget that this is a health crisis. This is a health crisis. And the situation with the virus and the epidemiological situation is so different from one place to another. We need to trust. We need to make people understand that as long as we don’t have a vaccine or a viable treatment, there is a risk. And we have to continue to live with the virus.  So this is the situation and a most unfortunate one. But we need to adapt and try to be safe and restart the connectivity and the services in tourism and in transport.  Thank you very much for having me this evening and I’m looking forward to our next encounter.

Travel restrictions have already distressed the entire tourism value chain and affected approximately 27 million employees. To counter the devastating impact of COVID-19, we need to use the crisis as an opportunity to develop a comprehensive and future-proof European strategy that stabilises and rebuilds the sector and incorporates the European Green Deal. We must re—establish our citizens’ trust by ensuring consumer and passenger rights and protection. The European Commission has already clarified the voluntary nature of travel vouchers, but enforcement and widespread communication of this rule is lacking. A European Travel Guarantee Fund would address this issue by securing the financial liquidity of the tourism and travel sector while also guaranteeing consumer rights. Further, the establishment of uniform EU health guidelines along with Member State specific guidelines is vital for passenger protection. We must also develop a roadmap for sustainable tourism and travel by focusing on the creation of a non—toxic circular economy, urgently pushing the aviation and maritime industries to cut emissions, investing in digitalisation, and investing in sustainable tourism schemes for businesses – particularly SMEs, which must be guaranteed immediate access to liquidity and support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 207, "date": "2020-06-17.json", "name": "Andor Deli (PPE)", "mepid": "124714", "text": "  in writing. – Tourism is extremely important and Member States are doing their best to help their companies, and small and family businesses. The EU must help and supplement these efforts, through the Recovery programme. But true recovery can only happen if we rebuild the trust of travellers. To achieve this, coordination between the Member States is key. The Commission should facilitate this process, but it must remain within the remits of the national authorities to decide on lifting or introducing travel restrictions in view of their own assessment of the situation. There cannot be a one—size—fits—all solution, because it can backfire through an increasing number of infections. In the light of social distancing and lower capacities I am convinced that we must broaden the variety of European travel destinations. Therefore, in the coming weeks we must promote a much wider range of cities and regions. I am counting on the Commission to support such efforts. That would not only broaden the number of destinations and help the local hospitality sector, but it would make European tourism more sustainable and balanced, stopping over—tourism at certain locations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 208, "date": "2020-06-17.json", "name": "Tomasz Frankowski (PPE)", "mepid": "197513", "text": "  I would like to write to the Commission. \"The crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has taken a toll on all of us. The restrictions caused by quarantine, the movement ban and the dramatic slowdown in the economy have contributed to the decline of many transport and tourism companies. I would like to thank the European Commission for a number of recommendations enabling the gradual and coordinated provision of travel services and services and transport services. It is important that, when reactivating the European economy, it should be a priority to protect businesses and to promote jobs as actively as possible. Small and medium-sized enterprises make up 99% of all companies in Europe, creating two-thirds of all jobs. In this respect, more flexible administrative requirements and better access to financial assistance are needed, as it is these companies that are able to revitalise European tourism. I would also like to call on the European Commission to increase its support for the cultural and sport sectors, which play an important role in the development of tourism.

In Poland, the transport industry yates about 15% of GDP. The transport and tourism sectors are the sectors most affected by the coronavirus crisis. Restrictions on movement and travel following the pandemic have resulted in a 60%-80% decrease in international arrivals. It is estimated that the decline in hotel and restaurant revenues could be 50%, tourism operators and travel agencies 70%, and shipping lines and airlines 90%. As a result of the pandemic, 6.4 million jobs in the EU are at risk. Businesses are fighting for survival. That is why it is so important to guarantee them rapid specific support by providing credit lines to maintain liquidity, as well as revolving loans that finance the payment of remuneration. In the long term, however, measures are needed to ensure that tourists can travel to and within Europe again. It is also necessary to maintain strategic transport infrastructure, such as ports and railways, in order to protect it from foreign takeovers.

The 2020 Capitals - Rijeka and Galway - have sadly missed out in a special predicament, because of the pandemic. They need to rapidly adjust their programmes prepared for years in advance.

The European Commission has already drawn up recommendations for tourism to help the sector emerge from the Covid-19 crisis. In order to withstand other crises, in order to have a common approach, to attract as many tourists as possible from outside Europe, it is necessary to have a common tourism policy, with harmonised rules, with the categories of tourist entities enjoying the same standards on operation and infrastructure. At the moment we do not have a similar approach to the protection of tourists or industry personnel, because all these things are at the discretion of each Member State. In this case, a solution must be found that does not involve a treaty change, but rather indirect ways.

In Greece, which is one of the most popular tourist destinations, there has already been a decrease in inbound tourism of 5.6% while in the corresponding receipts the drop reaches 17.1% compared to the same period of 2019. The Greek government has proved that it is making a championship in the control of the pandemic, which is an optimistic for the resumption of the tourist season, an important factor in the economy of Greece and the EU. However, at this very critical point in time, one step ahead of the global opening of the tourist season, liquidity is still needed. Greece has supported the European Recovery Programme from the outset but the tourism sector needs direct funding, with subsidies that will allow all tourism businesses to reopen normally and hundreds of thousands of people to return to their jobs.

A tourism strategy must also have financial resources, so the call made in the EP resolution on a budget line dedicated to sustainable tourism in MFF 2021-2027 is crucial.  I welcome the Commission communication on tourism and transport, as well as the package of measures aimed at overcoming the crisis caused by coronavirus in these areas.
