Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I come to present this report on equality between women and men, or rather, the reduction of inequality.   Indeed, this report is the result of a long work and intense collaboration with the shadow rapporteurs whom I would like to welcome: Mrs Gabriel for the EPP Group, Mrs Bilbao Barandica for the ALDE Group, Mrs Vallina for the GUE/NGL group, Mrs Lunacek and Mr Urtasun for the Greens/EFA group, Mrs Aiuto for the EFDD group and Mrs von Storch for the EC Group.  In fact, it is through their work that this report is effective, concise and structured.   It starts from a very simple observation: while we are in the aftermath of International Women's Rights Day, equality is still a long way off. Indeed, at the rate we are going to Europe, we would have to wait until 2038 to reach the target of a 75% women's employment rate, and 2084 for equal pay. But let us rejoice, parity in national parliaments, in European institutions and in the boards of European companies should be possible in 20 years!   It is high time to go beyond the good words to take concrete action. This report calls for a set of measures to be taken to achieve real equality much faster. We therefore urge the European institutions and the Member States to include the gender dimension in policy-making, particularly in the context of the European semester, the budget and the allocation of funds. This is a prerequisite for achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, from which we are still a long way off. The second point I would like to stress is that Member States and the European institutions need to implement more effective inclusion strategies to address the gap between pension rates and reduce the risk of poverty that affects women much more, and single mothers in particular. Real action against poverty requires promoting women's participation in the labour market through quality jobs. I would like to point out here that equal participation of men and women in the labour market would result in an increase of more than 12% in gross domestic product by 2030. This is an economic argument to take into account at a time when we are still struggling in times of crisis. Employment is fundamental, but it's not just work in life. Promoting work-life balance for men and women must be a priority, including investing in nurseries, reception centres, as well as supporting the updating of the maternity leave directive and the creation of paternity leave. Real equality between women and men requires respect and non-violence, including non-violence in the domestic environment. That is why I urge the Member States to ratify the Istanbul Convention as soon as possible. Only eight Member States of the European Union have already done so. What are the others waiting for? It is also essential to create a European Year solely dedicated to the fight against violence against women. I have, in fact,, together with other colleagues, including many shadow rapporteurs, launched a written initiative on this subject, which I invite all my colleagues here and those who have left the Chamber to sign. We must also combat gender stereotypes, because it is from childhood that inequality develops, rekindles, in all aspects of our society. The proliferation of laws will be of no use if they are not supported by a public opinion that is aware of the issue of gender. Finally, this report recalls the right of women to dispose of their bodies. I know, ladies and gentlemen, that many of you have received messages from some lobbyists that go against our values and women's rights. But this report is not just about that. It is equality and reducing inequality that we really need to focus on. I therefore call on all colleagues to support this report, which is a strong signal to the European institutions, to national governments but also and above all to the citizens, especially since the report last year, remember, had been rejected. This had been a bad signal given by Parliament. In conclusion, I would like to thank the collaborators who have been very valuable to me in this matter: Marie Ramot, my assistant, and Emmanuelle le Texier, of the group S and D, who have really ensured that this work is well supported.

I would also like to thank Mr Tarabella and other Members of Parliament for the report, which clearly identifies remaining challenges and future priorities. Before outlining my priorities for the coming years, I would like to mention the achievements so far. Equality between women and men has progressed over the last years in the EU. Women have entered the labour market in large numbers and contributed to the EU’s economic growth and competitiveness. Changes have not happened automatically, but are a result of strategic policy initiatives at European, national and local levels. In line with its obligations under the Treaties, the EU promotes gender equality in all its activities, from education to work, and from research to external policy. It has combined legislation, policy measures and funding. I dare to say that the EU is now a good address for women. Despite progress, however, gender equality still remains very much unfinished business. It is necessary to recall the scale of gender inequalities and the unacceptably high levels of violence against women in Europe. Gender inequalities affect our society. They can have a damaging effect on employment and growth rates, on well—being and on social cohesion. Therefore, I share Mr Tarabella’s concerns, and gender equality will be a priority of my mandate. In particular, I agree that we will have to pursue our efforts to facilitate work-life balance and to close the gaps in pay, employment, pensions and decision-making. These are still very valid objectives. The proposed directive on improving gender balance on the boards of listed companies remains a priority for me and for the Commission. I am delighted that the European Parliament, as well as more and more Member States, support this initiative, and I am confident that we will see this directive adopted this year. I also welcome the recent German Bundestag decision adopting the law on gender balance, and I hope this will lead also to Germany taking a more welcoming approach towards the EU Commission proposal. We might also need to take a fresh look at the way we promote gender equality. The report mentions issues such as the increasing poverty of men and women, the very difficult situation of single mothers, and gender stereotypes.  The Commission is ready to help Member States to advance in these fields. I also very much appreciate Mr Tarabella’s vision on work-life balance policies. These policies are not only a women’s issue. They should help both men and women to reconcile family and work throughout their lifetime. I am strongly encouraged by the news that there is movement on the proposal to improve the Maternity Leave Directive. I am aware of significant efforts in this House to build consensus around a fresh approach. This seems to me to be a very good and reasonable basis for discussions with the Council. I will be happy to facilitate fast progress on this file in cooperation with the Latvian Presidency, the Parliament and the Commission. The Parliament has repeatedly asked the Commission to step up its efforts to combat gender-based violence. I am convinced that the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence provides a good legal framework for all of us. I also agree with the rapporteur that the EU needs to grant sufficient resources for awareness-raising activities. A European Year on violence against women could be one way of achieving this. To be of clear added value, such a year would require appropriate funding, consultation of relevant stakeholders and clear preparation. I am not ruling out this possibility but I think it is too optimistic to launch such a year in less than ten months. Gender equality is a long-lasting commitment for the EU. The results of a recent Eurobarometer show that nearly all Europeans agree that equality between women and men is a fundamental right, and a large majority of citizens believe that tackling inequality between women and men should be a priority for the EU.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 22, "date": "2015-03-09.json", "name": "Mariya Gabriel", "mepid": "96848", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first of all, to thank my colleague Marc Tarabella for his excellent work, as rapporteur, both in substance and in form. A fruitful collaboration is all the more important because this report allows us, once a year, to take stock of the progress made, but also on the challenges that remain. I hope that tomorrow we can all, as an institution, vote in favour of this very good report. From 2013, we will note among others the following progress: we have seen that legislative pressure works, with the draft Women on Boards directive. Since the directive has been on the table, there have been more women on boards. The Commission provided an update on the application of the 2006 Equal Treatment Directive in the labour market and made recommendations. Finally, the Fundamental Rights Agency carried out the European study on violence against women. We have a database now. Focus on the stock! So we're seeing positive momentum, but the challenges remain great. In this report, we propose new ideas.  First, women's participation in the science sector as well as in the information and communication sector. We must also focus on using the digital strategy as a lever to promote gender equality. Secondly, to encourage women's entrepreneurship to fully realize the economic potential they represent, noting that it can contribute to the renewal of structures and the functioning of the labour market in favour of a better balance between work and family life. Beyond the European Social Fund, the proposal to consider the use of European funds as a lever to improve women's participation in the economic and political decision-making process. And finally, the eternal fight against gender stereotypes, especially the role of education and the media.  I hope that these proposals will be given special attention by the other institutions and member states. In this regard, I would add that, in order to achieve real progress on gender equality, it is crucial that action is taken at the most appropriate level. The competences of Member States must also be respected. That is the meaning of my group's amendments, but I am counting on the will of all of us to vote in favour of equality between men and women.

It has made me very uncomfortable, because even though we women have been given the right to vote, and we are allowed to drive and we get work, we have not caught up with our rights. Yes, we get to work – but preferably part-time. The employment rate for women has only increased by 4% in 13 years. Women are paid 16.4% less than men. A few women are in positions of power and decision-making positions. In this house, we're only 33 percent women. There are nine female Commissioners out of 28, and only 5% are women of the Presidents of the Board of Directors of the European Union. One in two women has been the victim of sexual harassment and violence. In addition, women do not have the right to decide about their own body. I'm sure if it were the men who gave birth, it would have been natural long ago for them to have to decide on their bodies themselves. Do I sound pessimistic? Yes, we have raised the same problems that exist in the Tarabella report year after year since I became a Member in 2004, without major changes from us in this House.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioner for his excellent work and for the work she has done. Unfortunately, I cannot add myself to the great praise for this report. Firstly, the European Parliament is calling for measures to be taken to ensure that social media does not use sexist language. Is the EU language police coming now? Is the offence of insult no longer sufficient? Are compliments now banned? Can a man say to a strange woman \"You look wonderful!\" or \"I like your dirndl extraordinarily well!\"? Can he still tell her to carry her suitcase, or is it the gender stereotype sexism that is now to be persecuted? Secondly, the European Parliament calls on men and women to share professional, family and social responsibilities in a more balanced way. Are we here in Parliament being paid to dictate to adult men and women in Europe how they should do their housework better, who should do the washing up and who is bringing the rubbish down? Are we being paid 750 men and 70 interpreters to talk about and translate this nonsense here? There is no state in the world or parliament in the world, whether my husband or I hangs up the laundry! Thirdly, the European Parliament notes – literally – that traditional gender roles restrict the development of women and therefore cannot fulfil their potential as human beings. The traditional gender role of women is probably traditionally that of mother and family man. So a mother and a family man can no longer fulfil their potential as human beings? This is in a way inhumane that it scares me. I cannot imagine that we can agree to this. However, I am glad that we have a roll-call vote so that we can determine exactly who supports this nonsense.

Eskerrik asko, Marc. Thank you for proving that you know that being different doesn't mean being unequal. Europe cannot wait until 2038 for 75% of women to have jobs or equal pay until 2084. Nor that in 2034 they feel here, or on the advice of big companies, as many women as men. Hopefully, in 2054 we will distribute household chores to 50%. Meanwhile, one in four women will continue to be ill-treated. That's how we lose competitiveness, because our economy gives up the talent of millions of women. We lose the ability to innovate and finance our social protection system, because precariousness slows our birth and ages us. Democracy suffers because inequality is a violation of a more widespread basic right in Europe. And justice suffers, because inequality is the source of violence against women and all the deficits described in this report that are reflected and accentuated, every day, with a very improved treatment of the female image in the media. That is why I support this report. That is why I encourage the European Institute for Gender Equality to obtain approved data across Europe to learn more and better evaluate.  That is why I propose a work that details what and how much women and women's management contribute to the economy. This will certify that equality is an investment. And that is why I stress that defending freedom of access to sexual and reproductive health is not a campaign for abortion: it is part of the United Nations post-2015 goals for smart and sustainable development.  Let us encourage governments to bet on conciliation, stereotype-free education and a commitment to women's entrepreneurship and gender-based violence. We should all be concerned that violations of marital domicile in Lithuania, Estonia, Hungary or Poland are still a private matter. We should all be concerned that the alleged crimes of mistreatment committed by a goal scorer will be celebrated in a football field.

But I would also like to say that to this day, with the amendments that have been tabled, there are certain dangers in our view: and one is to dilute the responsibility of the European Commission and its failure to develop the Strategy for Equality between Women and Men 2010-2015.  Moreover, from the People's Group they want to eliminate the report of the lack of promotion of conciliation policies, and there is also a strategy, especially from the PPE Group, which aims to eliminate all paragraphs requiring the European Union to take some form of action, such as the accession of the European Union to the Istanbul Convention on action measures against sexist violence, measures to combat gender stereotypes or the inclusion of gender equality between women's rights in agreements with third countries.  It is also intended to mention Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and a Parliament Resolution of 10 December 2013 to make it clear that public health policy falls within the competence of the Member States, which on the subject of abortion would leave the situation as is, which is of genuine vulnerability in certain Member States. It is intended to impose restrictions on the right to easy access to contraception and abortion, which would affect freedom and the right to decide, which are provided for in the Treaties in the form of the European Union's respect for fundamental rights, including the right to health and reproductive health.  We, on the other hand, defend the protection of reproductive and sexual rights; maternity protection; maternal and paternal leave; work-life balance; equality policies and prevention policies as a fundamental pillar of affective-sexual education.

We are living in a serious situation, in which rising inequality—inequality between men and women, in terms of work and professional matters—is also leading us to growing inequality in many fields of life. Today, moreover, we must point out that the withdrawal of public services is causing women to have the bulk of the adjustment, the bulk of the burden of reproduction tasks. And that is leading us to reproduce again, in some Member States, some trends in patriarchy that we thought were forgotten. Therefore, the new strategy must be ambitious, coherent and very brave to reverse this situation. I would like to join in congratulating Mr Tarabella's report, with which we have worked well and with which we have been able to define a good position of Parliament in relation to the strategy in many things: in the implementation of gender equality within the framework of the Europe 2020 Strategy, emphasizing to promote more equality between men and women at the labour level, in decision-making, in the need to reconcile working and personal life, and in the fight against gender-based violence. And also — and this is an essential point of the report also for my group — that sexual and reproductive rights could have been included in the report, recognizing the right of women to decide on their own reproduction and health, while calling for more measures and actions to ensure women's access to these services, while informing them of their choices and rights. I have to tell you that, as a thirty-year-old man, I cannot understand certain positions at this point. Women's freedom to decide on their own bodies is a fundamental right. A fundamental human right. And it would be very bad news if this European Parliament did not recognise it as such and that is why I would like to explicitly support paragraphs 44 and 45 of this report, which I believe are extremely important. I would also like to point out that the report calls very clearly for the Commission to help unblock the legislation which the Council is currently blocked. The Maternity and Paternity Leave Directive is not a luxury in times of crisis. You cannot have it in REFIT and I am glad that the report will point it out in a very clear way, as well as the Directive as regards quotas in large companies.

There are massive differences of opinion on the way in which we want to get there – as I am following this discussion here. This report is full of ideological nonsense.

Contrary to the style and tone of this report, this socio-political change can only be made if it is done without coercion and without quotas. This change can only be brought about with incentives and gradually. It is very important – and I have said this for a long time – to promote the approximation of the salaries of men and women. Equal pay for equal work is one of the highest commandments and must be our goal. However, we also see in Austria, in a socialist and ÖVP-influenced government, that we have not been able to achieve this for decades.

Today we are debating the European Parliament's report on the progress of gender equality in the European Union in 2013. The observation is clear: much remains to be done, for we are far, too far away, from the full emancipation, in all areas, of women in our societies.  This emancipation must be achieved through education, training, access to employment and the implementation of proactive policies in this area. Reducing wage gaps and pay gaps at all stages of life, eliminating gender stereotypes and discrimination, strengthening our fight against violence - all violence - against women, breaking glass ceilings, these must be our priorities.  Women expect us, MEPs, to make a strong commitment, and indeed, for example, to declare 2016 the European Year of Combating All Violence Against Women would be a very significant sign in this regard. I thank Mr Tarabella for his report and for the spirit in which he conducted his work. Too often, this annual report of our chamber was the occasion of unnecessary and sterile polemics which, in reality, harmed the cause of equality between men and women. Last year, for example, I was unable, like a majority of the members of this house, to vote in favour of Mrs Zuber's report.

As the epp Group coordinator in the Committee on Women's Rights, I will vote in favour of the Tarabella report. I invite all my colleagues to do the same.

Our task should be to empower women, inter alia, by supporting parenthood, motherhood and ensuring a family-promoting policy that supports motherhood and parenthood.  Secondly, I call on the States of the European Union not to ratify this harmful, ideological Istanbul Convention, because this convention does not solve the problems of violence, but introduces a socio-cultural notion of gender, obliges states to fight stereotypes, and considers the role of a woman as a mother, a man as a father, to be a stereotypical role. In addition, it identifies tradition, family, religion as sources of violence. The proper sources of violence lie, inter alia, in alcoholism, drug addiction, increasing violence and sexualisation of the image of a woman. Unfortunately, these issues completely omit the convention. Thus, under the guise of fighting violence, new ideological content is introduced that undermines what is valuable in our culture and civilizations rooted in Christian roots.

It is unquestionable that we can improve the accuracy of the terms used, and that certain aspects addressed continue to drag an ideological ballast that sometimes clouds our mission of public representatives in the service of the general interest.  But let me highlight what I consider to be the three pillars that vertebrate this analysis.  The first is equality in the workplace: the growing wage gap is an unsustainable injustice, we cannot wait seventy years to guarantee the same wage for the same job. Board of directors and administration cannot continue to dispense with half of talent and competence. Nothing changes if something doesn't change, and that something is the law. If the demand for parity quotas seems to us to be a great achievement in the electoral lists that make up democratic parliaments and governments; How can it not be good to set quotas in the corporate governments of the companies that govern our economy? The second is equality in girls' and women's access to quality comprehensive education, as an essential tool for sustainable development that makes equal benefits for men and women. I would like to stress the importance of a lay sex and reproductive education that guarantees girls and women the knowledge and control of their bodies as a sine qua non condition to ensure their independence and autonomy. It is up to us to ensure the legal and health means to do so. And, lastly, equality in family, social and media development.

The original objective of protecting women's rights is misguided here for ideological and economic purposes. Ideological, because Mr. Tarabella forgets what men and women have specific and makes them complementary. Economic, because the objective is to have more and more people in a constrained labour market that is weighing down wages.  The reality is that the first of the violence against women is to deny their otherness. It is to want to create, for example, a non-transferable paternity leave, paternity leave which will de facto take time off maternity leave, because it is obvious that in the long run, the two leaves will have to be of the same duration - a matter of equality, of course. Violence means forgetting that a baby needs its mother first. Violence is to take it away from him and send him into work that is often underpaid. As for the Commission, it is directly contributing to the deterioration of the plight of women with its \"violence without borders\" policy.  The mass arrival of people, who have neither the same values nor the same customs, contributes greatly to the plight of women. I would like to take as an example my last speech, right here, on excisions now practised in Europe. What has happened since then to expel those responsible for such barbarities? Of course, nothing! On the other hand, creating a real parental income to enable women to really choose how to balance motherhood and career would have been an interesting lead. Of this, not a word. Your will, Mr Tarabella, and that of the Commission come together: to make all women interchangeable with all men, ignoring individuals and differences. Your goal is to create generic beings alienated from an increasingly deregulated labour market.

What progress is being made in each Member State? I think it is good that we are discussing this here. I say this also to the right-wing populists in this House: of course we still have problems! Without end! Violence against women, forced prostitution has increased, old-age poverty, the pay gap between men and women – everything has been given.

Abortion issues are a matter for the Member States, they are not a European issue.

Women have become the queens of part-time work and unemployment, as shown by the data contained in the report. Full-time women in Europe are 54%, while men are 72%. In contrast, part-time women are 76%, while men are only 24%.  Women's unemployment in Greece is 31%, while men's unemployment is 23%. Why is this happening? Firstly, because austerity has destroyed the scarce state childcare benefits, the elderly, the family. On women's backs is the burden of closing the holes in the social state and secondly because flexibility policies push women into poor quality jobs with reduced pay and rights.

The pension gap has not improved at all, 39%, that is an alarming number and I think it clearly shows how women in socio-economic positions are doing. I mention these figures because we must be concerned about changes in these areas, in which the European Union also has competences.

Paragraph 45, which deals with abortion, is one of the issues that could separate us, but indeed this report addresses others such as employment or equal pay, issues on which we have fought and legislate in Europe for fifty years and, although there have been achievements, they are not yet how effective they should be. There is a pay gap that can go in The Member States from 3% to 30% for work of equal value. And, therefore, we will have to continue working in this field. It also addresses quality employment, so that there is true equal opportunities in this field. And also everything related to co-education, with educating in equality. I've heard some comments here about stereotypes. When there are stereotypes, it's because you don't co-educate on equal opportunities. That's why it's important to break stereotypes and educate on values, which is to educate on equality. Another challenge is conciliation. Much has been legislate on this subject, but it is one of our outstanding subjects.

The participation rate of women is lower, women are much more likely to work part-time with forced work, women are under-represented when it comes to filling management positions, and the issue of old-age poverty is also a consequence of women's non-equal rights.

By directly promoting abortion, the report falls outside the competence of the EU and internationally agreed definitions of the term 'reproductive health'. The European Union uses the official definition of \"reproductive health\" agreed at a 1994 UN conference in Cairo that explicitly excludes abortion from the term sexual and reproductive health. If the European Parliament accepts such a report, it violates the principle of subsidiarity and encroaches on the rights of the Member States of the European Union to decide independently on these issues to which over 153 000 citizens responded in just a few days in the petition and asked members to have abortions expelled from this report. The report does not support men and women who choose to start a family and have children, nor does it sufficiently problematize women's unpaid work at home; women and men who work for several weeks without a day's rest are also not taken into account.

Mr President, first of all I would like to say to Mr Chauprade, who has already left, that I am not French like him, as he said. I am not offended that people say I am French, but I am a Belgian elected official. I am one of the 40% of Belgians whose French is my mother tongue. But more seriously in relation to this debate: two particular points, often mentioned, and a general observation. First, quotas. It has been talked about many times, and the first to do so was Mrs Atkinson who said, \"We do not need quotas. In fact, at home, Ukip, we are a good example.\" I notice that she does not know how to calculate, because Ukip is 6 women out of 23 elected, i.e. 30%. This is less than the average of many political groups. In this regard, in his political group, I would like to salute the Movimento 5 Stelle, which includes 8 out of 17 women. In other words, almost half of the elected officials are elected.  On quotas, I would like to pay tribute to one man: it is a European conservative named Ansgar Gabrielsen, Norwegian Minister for Industry and Economy. In 2001, he found that in 1993 there were 3% women on the boards of large corporations in Norway. When he became a minister, he said, \"That has to change.\" He introduced quotas to the general criticism, especially from the Conservatives, and what happened? In 2008, there were 43% women on the boards of large corporations in Norway. It is the highest rate in the world. We had to have quotas. They are a necessary evil, but they can no longer be questioned, since society is not evolving as quickly as it should.  Secondly, the principle of subsidiarity, often mentioned. This is not where we are starting it, it is a report of initiative. So we are not going to change the laws in the Member States, we are not going into their domestic policy, in their competence. However, it is normal that when we talk about women's rights, and therefore inequality, we can address all rights and take stock at European level. If we do not talk about this issue in this chamber, we will not talk about it anywhere.  General observation: I thank all the colleagues who generally appreciated the report.

And not only does it take them seriously, so that it is mentioned in the various committees and committees that are around the house here, but that it becomes a horizontal approach so that, whatever kind of policy we are talking about – for example, as today with competition policy – it becomes a natural element. We are currently seeing, in the field of aviation, for example, how, in several EU countries, not to say in all EU countries, we are being challenged fiercely, how employees are being pushed to the limit and sometimes beyond what is acceptable. I am glad that in such a sensitive area we have nevertheless been able to find a formulation that all groups can live with, and I expect that to be the case tomorrow.  Another element, of course, which has not been dealt with before, all the while it has not existed before, is what has gradually become a vernacular: Luxleaks. In other words, the whole question of how certain Member States have used tax policy to attract businesses and thus tax dollars. For me, as rapporteur, it is important to stress that this issue is very important, but that it is also a theme that can be dealt with in the field of competition policy, which must be manageable in the field of competition policy! When we vote tomorrow, I know that this is something that can divide the house a bit: should we use it as leverage for a common harmonised tax policy that some groups want, or is it something that we can deal with within state aid rules? In my mind, it's the last. I clearly believe that using your tax policy to discriminate against competing companies is a breach of state aid rules.  A third element which is important to mention and which I believe plays a major role in many of our countries also in the election campaign is the question of how we use the structural funds. When companies are supported by the EU, it should be on improving conditions where businesses are located, not moving jobs out.  I welcome the fact that all these elements have been addressed in this report, just as I welcome the fact that many of the areas where citizens expect more proactive action have also been clarified in relation to the need to implement the third energy liberalisation directive, otherwise it makes no sense to talk at all about an energy union and the benefits that lies in it, within the economic potential of building a digital single market. In this context, I would also like to thank Kaja Kallas very much for the enormous contribution she and the IMCO have made to this report. And now that we are at the digital, it is clear that there is one digital player in particular that has played a very special role: Google. I would like to thank everyone, not least Ramon Tremosa in Balcells, for his constructive approach to this particular issue, and I am pleased that a compromise has been reached. And then I would like to stress one thing: in this report it is not Google that is, as such, on trial. What we are concerned about is that we have now negotiated – or have seen the negotiations run for four years, that we have seen the Commission make one move after another and that the matter has still not been resolved. So what is really on trial here is the Commission's confidence that we can continue to trust that the Commission will handle such cases within a reasonable period of time and in a proper way. I hope that tomorrow we will be able to put an end to and, by a large majority, to be contented in this report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "da", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 134, "date": "2015-03-09.json", "name": "Margrethe Vestager", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs and Mrs Kallas, who have drawn up the opinion for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. I think this is a very solid piece of work. It reiterates the values and the very solid platform of our competition policy, but it also points to some of the very important sectors that we have been discussing in recent years. On the values, the basics and the platform of our competition policy, I think it is very important that it stresses how competition is part of our democracy, and this prevents great concentration on capital and ensures that those who have the talent and the initiative who want to make their case can actually do that in an open market.  I think it is very important to stress – as is done in the report – that, in times of crisis, competition rules should not be relaxed. On the contrary, we need to keep our markets open to give everyone a fair chance. As the rapporteur mentioned just now, competition policy is a very important tool in achieving a number of goals, namely an energy union and digital single markets as well as capital markets. We have plenty of knowledge to share. I very much look forward to the debate today and also to standing by my promise from the hearing to listen to, and work with, Parliament when it comes to the way forward. I will say just a few words on three very high priority areas: firstly, an energy union. The aims are relatively simple: independent, secure, cheap and sustainable supply. It is very important that we implement the legislation that we already have. Then we have a solid platform on which to build our energy union. The role of competition policy is, among other things, to keep an eye on energy companies that re-erect barriers to the internal market to ensure that companies cannot shield themselves from competition. On the digital single market, it is quite obvious that we need a single market because we have very national markets today and it is, of course, consumers and small businesses who pay the price. We need to make sure that we have full-blown competition and to make sure that new technologies can actually reach the citizen. Competition helps our small companies to challenge large and dominant players. Last, but not least, as was mentioned, tax fairness and transparency. To work with tax, with competition tools, is not a question of using the back door. It is straightforward and out in the open. We need the transparency to make sure that we do not use tax policy to create unfair competition. I am very much looking forward to the debate today and I think it is part of the working relationship between Parliament and Commission.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 135, "date": "2015-03-09.json", "name": "Kaja Kallas", "mepid": "124697", "text": "   rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. – Mr President, I am very glad that the Commissioner addressed the values that the competition policy is based on: freedom and a level playing field for all.

As rapporteur for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) opinion, I am happy that the important elements from my report are here: fair competition in the public procurement markets and access for SMEs, but also completion of the digital single market and guarantees of net neutrality are vital to boost competition and foster innovation. As a Liberal I am, however, disappointed that this report focuses too much on more regulation: more regulation, for instance, for the sharing economy, for the internet economy, which is actually one of the few sectors that still grew during the economic crisis. We seem to forget that we are representatives of millions of consumers but also of millions of business owners who rely on the EU competition policy to have the necessary confidence to start and run businesses. EU competition policy needs to contribute to building the right environment for innovative businesses to grow. What we need is a strong European competition authority which is proactive in adapting to the new, challenging and fast-moving markets of the digital economy. What we certainly do not need is to replace it with more regulation that will eventually only harm our most innovative businesses.

In this report, we are dealing with 2013, that was Mr Almunia's time, and you, Mrs Vestager, are now facing the debate here for the first time. I think it is important to note that, according to all the treaties, the European Union is committed to an economic policy with an open market economy with free competition. We have to keep this in mind time when we are debating here. And the European Commission has extensive rights in merger control, in the prohibition of cartels, in illicit price fixing, in the control of state aid in order to enforce the four freedoms of the internal market for goods, goods, persons and capital and services. What is missing – and this was also our request in the hearing – is the democratic legitimacy of many foundations, guidelines and regulations. So far, this is not in the codecision procedure. And that is a problem with the power that the EU Commission has in these matters: individual fines of up to EUR 1 billion to Microsoft! Given the plethora of these competences, the guidelines must be democratically approved. That is one of the demands that we face. I believe that the European Commission has been too hesitant in the final years of Mr Almunia's term of office. Market shares have been defined in the telecommunications sector, but Google has been delayed for many years. Unfair tax competition has already been mentioned – also a difficult issue. Then there is the question of the extent to which national authorities are responsible for recovering state aid. I just want to mention the keyword Nürburgring, you know that.

I would also like to thank you for the fact that, as a result of the amendments and compromises, the report has come much closer to the compatibility of competition expectations with social aspects. That is why I find it particularly sad that the Group of the European People's Party now wishes to weed out the social aspects from the report. All that today protects the social interests of workers and European citizens in general. This is completely unacceptable to us.  However, we continue to have problems with paragraph 85 of the report, which is not sufficiently elaborated and misinterpreted and misinterpreted.

Competitiveness is an essential part of Europe's economic development. This is essential in relation to energy prices affecting the economic development of the Union.  In this respect, we are extremely far from competition and, above all, from energy prices compared to the United States. Electricity in Europe is on average twice as expensive as in the US. By contrast, the price of gas increased 2.5-fold against the U.S. price. But there are countries in the European Union – even mine, Poland – where the price of gas is 5 times higher than the American price. This is the main brake on economic growth, exacerbating Europe's economic crisis.  The Union's approach to climate policy, which is treated as an ideology, leaves little room for competitiveness.

I welcome the work of the rapporteur, Mr Morten Messerschmidt, who did a great job in collecting a lot of good ideas to improve the report and negotiating with all the shadow rapporteurs to have this final and good report. In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs this competition report got 51 votes in favour and only 2 against, so I hope that this huge vote will be confirmed tomorrow with a very broad majority and, as we did last year, that Parliament will send a very strong message to the Commission. Commissioner, if we want to avoid new regulation, the antitrust tool must act faster. Regarding the Google antitrust case, I welcome your meetings with all the complainants, including Google last week, to get a fresh look into the case. Nevertheless, time is not unlimited. I hope the Commission’s decisions will be announced soon, possibly today in this debate. In the Google antitrust case, a lot of people forget that among the dozens of complainants there are several US companies. Some of them, like here, have no problem going public. Others do not want to attack Google openly because they fear retaliation measures such as demotion or exclusion by Google. We met several US companies, victims of these practices, which explained how they simply disappeared from a Google search for several days, with a huge economic impact for them. I want to stress once again that this is not a European versus American company war. I am not ideological against Google or any other US company: I am simply against monopolies. Google has a 90% market share in some European countries and is de facto a gatekeeper of the Internet for European SMEs and European consumers. The preferential treatment of Google-owned services is not a fair practice. Google does not always have the best and the more pertinent choices for consumers. To conclude, I am convinced that Google only will move with the threat of a fine or with the threat of an amending regulation so, Ms Vestager, will you call for a statement of objections in the Google antitrust case?

Our abstention is because the report should go further and denounce that competition policy cannot be the battering ram with which public services are dismantled or industrial development in poorer regions is prevented. With its widening application of the principles of competition, the Commission contributes to the destruction of thousands of jobs, while ignoring the massive business concentration of which Europe is a victim and, especially, certain countries, such as Spain. We have tabled amendments in Parliament's plenary, among other issues, because we want to give Europeans the opportunity to know whether or not majority parties give priority to employment, public services, what the position is before investment arbitration courts or the theft of preferred ones.

First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Messerschmidt, for his very fair work, and Also to thank the other shadow rapporteurs. Given the extent of the differences in content, these were very fair negotiations with a good result. I would like to single out three points of this, which are perhaps even more important for the future than for the past, when we drafted the report for 2013. The first is that we are in favour of investigating aggressive tax competition. It is a bizarre twist that we are discussing this report here on the day that the Luxleaks Committee meets for the first time at 9 p.m. I wonder whether such a special committee, rather than a committee of inquiry, as we actually wanted it – at least a quarter of the House has signed for it – which then starts at 9 p.m., really corresponds to the intention that we are adopting here when we demand an investigation into aggressive tax competition. I do not believe that this is enough. On the subject of net neutrality, this report says that it is of the utmost importance that there is no discrimination on the network and on data traffic. This is especially important for start-ups mentioned in connection with Google. If we create a network in which we can buy a lot of priority, it is particularly important for small European start-ups, and it is a particular burden. If your colleague, Commissioner, now refers to the defenders of net neutrality as the Taliban, it is a foretaste of the fact that, perhaps in the next few years, the Commission will not be moving in the direction of net neutrality. I would ask you to work in this direction. Perhaps you will still have the opportunity to give an opinion on this now. The third issue is energy. We are in favour of promoting renewable energies, of taking sustainability into account. How can this be reconciled with the approval of the support for the Hinkley Point nuclear power station, which is far above what renewable energy can receive in Europe? This is a massive distortion of competition, approved by your predecessor, Mr Almunia, who, in his last appearance before this House, told Parliament the untruth in this regard. Here, too, more decisive action must be taken. It is now a Russian decision.

Its people are struggling. All across this wonderful continent there are families who are finding it difficult to eat. One sees the unemployment, and one sees their children leaving, trying to find a life for themselves in a pressurised world. Competition is an essential part of small and medium-sized businesses for those people to try and find work, for them to be able to have enough money in their pockets to pay their gas and electricity bills and feed their families, and so it is always welcome when you see a report undertaken by an individual like Mr Messerschmidt who, I know, cares about issues such as this.  But unfortunately, in this Chamber, in this institution, such reports will always fall on deaf ears and have no capability to achieve the goals that people want, because at the end of the day this Chamber and the people working within it have rules that are effectively run by the corporations. They have the power and the influence to have preferential access to the Commissioners and the parliamentarians.  I have seen them swan across these buildings, both here and in Brussels, where they have access to MEPs and put their ideas forward. They can put rules and regulations in an unelected Chamber that bring in high barriers of entry for small and medium—sized businesses.

Competitiveness is certainly the key driver of economic growth and employment in Europe. Both parameters, which are today the great challenges of this House and of the whole of Europe. Both parameters, which are not at their best in Europe at the moment. Europe is losing competitiveness in the global context. Let me give you a few examples. Europe now has twice as high an unemployment rate as the US. In the last five years, 6 million jobs have been lost in Europe, and only 1 million jobs in the UNITED States and Japan combined. As has already been said today, energy prices in Europe are twice as high for electricity, three to four times higher in the gas sector than in the USA, India or Russia. The average tax burden relative to GDP is 50% higher in Europe than in the US, 30% higher than in Japan. I am certainly not surprised if I tell you that there is also a huge deal of support in the area of research and development between Europe and the United States, namely USD 100 billion every year. Europe is lagging behind in direct investment, we have seen a huge decline over the last fifteen years, as well as access to finance and the efficiency of public administration. The rapporteur has therefore identified some very good points in his report, namely strategic priorities for this parliamentary term. These are: fair and clear competition rules, respect for subsidiarity and respect for national court decisions, the fight against cartels and monopolies, clear rules against market abuse, reform of state aid regulation and a coherent, pro-competitive tax policy.

It is good that the European Commission is keeping its finger on the pulse, especially when you see that in economically difficult times Member States still tend to give state aid and to create barriers between Member States. And, in response to what Mr Woolfe said, I am pleased to have a European Commission that can monitor this.  The first to suffer from the departure of a Member State from the European Union are small businesses, small and medium-sized enterprises, which no longer have access to fair rules in the large single European market. And then of course you have to keep up with the times, so also in the digital market you have to guarantee fair competition and tackle fragmentation. Enough has been said about it. At the moment, it seems that Member States are more important to the financial interests of a number of large companies than net neutrality and fair access for citizens and consumers to the Internet for all.  Another point of attention to be mentioned in this debate is the new economy of sharing that those who see it emerge. If I jump into an Uber taxi in one city, I'm completely fine, if I do that in another city I'm doing it illegally and in most cities in Europe I don't really know what grey area I'm in. I therefore think it is also important for the European Commission to look at this kind of new development critically and thoroughly, but to draw conclusions from it for new policies.

It is often said that competition policy should lead to a level playing field for companies, regardless of their size and regardless of their country of origin, so I am pleased this report recognises that there can be no level playing field when some firms are able to evade or aggressively avoid paying their taxes.  The Lux Leaks scandal showed how some multinational firms were able to reduce the rates of tax they paid to almost nothing. These firms are not necessarily more efficient, but they were able to bring down their costs through purely artificial means. Competition here, I would suggest, is like a 100 metre race where one competitor has to wade through treacle while the other sits in a Formula One racing car. We have to take action against these impediments to competition. I am also very pleased that this report recognises where liberalisation and competition may not always be appropriate. Governments must be able to provide infrastructure that is essential for growth, whether that is in education or healthcare, or indeed in quality social housing where the market has failed to deliver. There is, after all, no point in having a level playing field if all the grass on it has been torn up. Finally, governments must have the freedom to act against the biggest civil challenge of our time: climate change.

I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on a very very exciting report. Competition policy is, after all, one of the eu's absolute core areas. It is at the heart of EU cooperation, it is at the heart of the new Commission, not least by the commissioner responsible in this area, Margrethe Vestager.  Competition policy, as I said earlier, is one of the many many areas in which EU cooperation brings positive and visible benefits for individual citizens, all of us. It is therefore also so positive that the rapporteur writes so clearly in the report here that the Commission must have more powers over the Member States, and it is positive that the rapporteur stresses that the Commission must have the financial resources to carry out these key and essential tasks. I am very pleased that the rapporteur emphasises the important role of the European Parliament and even that the European Parliament should be given even more powers. It is quite clear in the report in paragraph 104 that this democratic deficit cannot and must not be tolerated. I'd like to acknowledge that. So when the rapporteur argues that the Commission should have more powers over the Member States, that the Commission should have more resources and that the European Parliament should have more powers, Then I fully agree, because it all represents more Europe and not less europe.

Competition is one of the core elements of our economic form.

That is the honourable task that you, Mrs Vestager, have now taken on. I wish you a happy hand when it comes to developing rules of the game and ensuring that these rules are respected by all market participants. That is what we can expect from competition policy. We have very big challenges, for example in the area of tax law. We have set up a special committee and we are, of course, pleased that the Commission has also opened investigations against a number of Member States. Faced with a change in the digital age with completely new challenges, because it is no longer easy to assign where value creation takes place, which rules of the game must be adhered to. You have a very great responsibility here. I want to mention not only the example of Google, but the overall challenge of digital work. And, of course, we must also ensure that we in Europe do not weaken ourselves with a misunderstood competition law. I sometimes wonder whether it is wise, in many places, to weaken companies that are engaged by means of competition rules, so that they can no longer compete in international competition.

Unfortunately, we have to note that in many areas there are still inexplicable technical and regulatory barriers, which in fact prevent the proper functioning of a dynamic, efficient and innovative internal market capable of stimulating economic growth and the creation of new jobs.

I believe that the democratic deficit is unacceptable in this area and I propose that it be overcome as soon as possible by means of interinstitutional agreements on competition policy.

Such large price differences can hide abusive practices by both manufacturers and distributors of medicinal products. Certainly, such large price differences show a fragmented market for medicines.

In fact, the Commission states here that low prices for consumers are essential when it comes to assessing whether mergers are acceptable to the Commission. In Denmark, two telecommunications companies have joined forces in matrimonies, and I know that their application is currently on the Commissioner's desk. I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner how much market share the Commission thinks two companies can have before a duopoly-like state occurs? And how will the Commissioner ensure that allowing the two companies to merge does not lead to worse competition and higher prices for the consumer?  To the rapporteur for the report, I would like to thank the rapporteur for an intriguing report, Morten Messerschmidt, and I, like others, am surprised by the very pro-EU tone of the report, including the fact that the rapporteur wants more power for the European Parliament.

I believe that both Mr Messerschmidt's report and the Commissioner are moving in the right direction. I would like to point out as a Greek MEP that the structure of the internal market plays a huge role in the final economic outcome. But, of course, not everything is the responsibility of the European Union, governments and societies themselves must be interested.  I believe that, according to the experts' estimates, one of the reasons Greece failed to get out of the adjustment programme so well, so quickly and with the same success as Ireland and Portugal, which had their own programmes, was the problems in the structure of the internal market. In other words, many sacrifices were made, wages fell, but inflation remained at a level of 2.5% for 2010-2014, despite the fact that nominal labour costs fell by around 12% and Gross Domestic Product fell by 20%.  It is therefore of enormous importance how each economy works, how we limit its dysfunctions. So the question is whether, from the right political initiatives we take, we will be able to become concrete. For example: why is Russian natural gas imported into Greece one of the most expensive in the European Union? Why is the reduction in energy costs not shown in the public electricity company's tariffs?

In the absence of activity at Community level, we would constantly face restrictive measures and even trade wars between Member States. Not only consumers, but also the European economy as a whole would be affected, and the new Commission's statement on this area is to be welcomed. We must bear in mind that companies will use all available means to strengthen their position on the market. However, the past year has highlighted the problem of tax havens, including in particular the financial policies of some Member States. The LuxLeaks scandal has shown that some governments are individualising tax law in order to attract investors, thereby avoiding taxation. When you look at the list of companies that have taken advantage of the opportunities offered by Luxembourg, you can see that they were companies with hundreds of millions of euros in profit. The offer created by that State therefore amounted to a real tax loss for a number of Member States.  I agree with the rapporteur that transparency of tax law is an important element of competitiveness and that the European Commission should be equipped with instruments to identify unfair practices.  I also wanted to draw attention to the mechanism that distorts competition in the single market, which I missed in this report. In recent days, information has emerged about the huge price different prices of Russian gas for individual Member States. We need to realise that fair competition between companies is not possible if some pay $308 per 1000 cubic metres of gas and others 26% more. It should be borne in mind that this price is not based on any objective reasons, but is merely a derivative of the Kremlin's political will.

In the field of new technologies, European justice is bogged down without any effective sanctions being taken, as is the case with Google. SMEs are still the big forgotten, deprived of access to the most important public markets and put under pressure by large groups as well as in the mass market.  Last but not, because of the Commission's control over public aid, it is not possible for a sovereign state to pursue a policy of economic patriotism by supporting its strategic industries. I will simply cite, in France, the example of SNCM, which was ordered last year to repay 400 million euros - at the behest of Brussels - and which had to file for bankruptcy.

It is rightly noted that in most cases small and medium-sized enterprises are unequal to large consortia. Of course, some omissions and inaccuracies can be admitted in such work, but they are not essential. The Commission needs to address the issues of different levels of interest on loans, not only for companies but also for individuals. In Bulgaria, interest and servicing costs of loans can reach up to 50%, while in countries such as Germany they are no more than 15%.

In the electricity sector, the liberalisation and the end of vertical integration of production and distribution in public companies has brought increases in energy bills for companies and households, to the extent that the profits of monopolies – previously public, today private – have also increased, holders of these companies. In transport, liberalisation has been causing monopolistic concentration on a European scale in less than half a dozen large multinational companies, which dominate both passenger transport and cargo. They're just two examples. This is not, nor could it be, in this report.  At the same time, serious sprains of competition, for example in the field of agriculture, are still still being tackled, especially as a result of the current common agricultural policy, in which national production is destroyed.

I think it has shown the depth and the commitment of Parliament when it comes to our competition policy and the rules in the Treaty. And we do have rules in the Treaty. I very much appreciate the point made by Mr Werner Langen that according to the Treaty there is no co—legislation with this Parliament. I am firm though in my commitment that as long as we have that Treaty we will work by its rules but I will also work as much as possible with Parliament taking things forward both in cases that were closed in the debate about competition policy and, of course, in cases where we may move forward on some of the proposals that are being debated right now. Second, as was said by Mr Morten Petersen, this is a crucial competence for the European Union. Yet again it also highlights the fact that we need to cooperate very closely with national authorities because in that interrelationship we can solve things that can otherwise not be solved. For instance, regarding foods, where national authorities play a crucial role but may not have any reasonable tools when it comes to large corporations. And that, of course, is one of the things that has been mentioned in the debate over and over again tonight: whether or not competition policy is strong enough to enable small and medium-sized companies actually to make their case, to use their talent, to use their competences to be in the market. I think that is a very good point because it sort of highlights the goals of competition policy, not just to enforce because of enforcement but to enforce in order to enable people to make their choices and for their businesses to thrive. On the question of the differences in drug prices: we made a sector enquiry, or the previous Commission did, regarding the rules in that sector and how things were handled when it came to patent. Some of the price differences actually may be ascribed to the differences among Member States in how drugs are subsidised. Of course, we will be happy to follow up on that as we do with our sector enquiry in patents – we do follow-up reports every year. Tax has been another issue which has been at the centre of our debate tonight. I will of course do my best to use the competition tools to get into the cases where we see fiscal aid and where tax rulings are being used to enable unfair competition because we think that is against the basis of our competition values. When it comes to energy a number of commitments have been made which has made, I think, the desirable effort to open up our markets. Last but not least, also in this area, we have imbalances between the competences of the Member State and the competences of our common Union. For instance, when it comes to the energy mix, we may have differences in how we view nuclear power for instance. But it is within the scope of the Member State to decide their energy mix. What we are doing when it comes to state aid is of course to make sure that there is no overcompensation and that taxpayers’ money is not overspent. And as the last and most important thing, and I hope it will be appreciated in a Parliament working so hard on transparency, that with state aid modernisation we get a much larger degree of transparency with regard to how taxpayers’ money is used so that not only the media but also the citizen can follow their money in order to make their politicians accountable. I think we will come back to the digital market also of course when we start to debate the digital single market and the proposal that the Commission will put forward relatively soon.

I am talking here to my two Danish colleagues, but at least one might have taken the trouble to find out who is tabling which amendments. Well, that's the way it is!

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the oral question tabled with the support and consent of many of my fellow Members, whom I thank, is inspired by the article on endocrine disruptors published by the British newspaper The Guardian on 2 February. The article denounces the European Commission's cover-up of the proposal that DG Environment had prepared in 2013 and which would have led to the development of criteria for classifying a substance as endocrine disruptor, thus initiating a new strategy in this area. With this proposal, DG Environment, in accordance with Article 5 of the Eu ropean Union Regulation on the placing on the market and use of biocidal products, bound the Commission to define the criteria for the identification of substances with endocrine disrupting properties by 13 December 2013. However, as a result of external pressure but also from other Directorates-General of the Commission, dg Environment's proposal appears to have been blocked and replaced by an impact assessment, which unfortunately will not be finalised before 2016, which therefore appears instrumentally aimed at circumventing the obligation to submit the criteria. In addition, there are further critical issues regarding the roadmap prepared for the impact assessment. In it, the Commission has included an option concerning the introduction of socio-economic derogations for the placing on the market of substances containing endocrine disruptors, thus leaving open ground, for example, to the use of pesticides.  In view of the fact that in its report of January 2013 Parliament strongly argued that the authorisation of substances containing endocrine disruptors should be restricted, I would ask the Commission why and who authorised the derogations for the placing on the market of these substances. The Guardian article argued that as many as thirty-one pesticides could be banned, causing obvious and significant negative economic spillovers to the industry. It is easy to see how the development of criteria for defining endocrine disruptors would have had economic consequences not only on the pesticide sector but on a very wide range of other products with which we impact in our daily lives and which contain endocrine disruptors: packaging, skincare products, cosmetics, building materials, electronic equipment, furniture and floors. What are the costs of not drawing up criteria for the health of European citizens? They seem to be very high. In fact, it has been shown that in the last twenty years the increase in cancer, infertility, early puberty, cardiovascular diseases and fetal and genital abnormalities may be associated in some way with exposure to chemicals that act as endocrine disruptors. Costs in terms of health costs and lower productivity at Community level are also affected by the failure to develop the criteria. According to a recent study, they amount to one hundred and fifty-seven billion euros. It goes without saying that the presentation of the criteria could therefore bring important benefits both for the health of citizens and for the European health system. How, then, does the Commission intend to take account of the potential benefits that the introduction of the criteria could have in its impact assessment? Furthermore, does the Commission intend to carry out further studies on the benefits of introducing these criteria? In view of the fact that the criteria will not be drawn up quickly, I would like to know whether the Commission intends at least to raise public awareness of endocrine disruptors, for example by making recommendations to citizens to reduce exposure to them. Indeed, I believe that, while waiting for the criteria to be drawn up, guidelines should be developed at European level as soon as possible to deal with this silent pollution, which is too little considered by public opinion and citizens, who do not currently have sufficient information to protect their health. I myself, moreover, expressed these demands for clarity, awareness and protection in my question in October 2014, in which I expressed my deep concern at the presence of endocrine disrupting phthalates linked to alarming health problems, including in toys and children's articles, in order to improve their flexibility, modelability and durability. They also have very extensive applications and are present in cosmetics as fixers, in the health and pharmaceutical industries and in numerous other industrial applications. Finally, recent research on bisphenol A has shown the need for greater coordination in programmes dedicated to endocrine disruptors. Indeed, I find it difficult to understand how it is possible that the national agency French for food safety presented alarming studies on this substance between 2013 and 2014, and European experts have recently established that exposure to bisphenol A does not present any risk to people. Therefore, for all of the above, does the Commission not consider it necessary to set up a research centre on endocrine disruptors in order to carry out research into these substances and to coordinate knowledge on the subject at Eu ropean Union level, as Parliament proposed in its 2013 resolution?", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 178, "date": "2015-03-09.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, I am pleased to attend this plenary session today to discuss with you the issue of endocrine disruptors. I would like to start by quoting Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. ‘A high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities.’ This is a fundamental rule applicable to all our policies. The issue of endocrine disruptors reaches to the core of this principle. Therefore, I would like to assure you that, as Commissioner for Health and Food Safety and all the more as a medical doctor, I will only make decisions which respect this very principle; there can be no compromises on health. Now let us turn to your question. Endocrine disruptors are a highly complex issue. The decision that we take will have a significant impact on health, the environment, agriculture, trade and on a wide range of other sectors. Therefore, this is a priority file for me and my services. I would like to start by clarifying the current situation and its genesis as regards endocrine disruptors, rather than commenting on an article in The Guardian which refers to some so-called EU paper, on which I cannot respond. To date, the Commission has not adopted or published any official Commission document on the issue of defining endocrine-disrupting chemicals. I would like to present the work that I have been doing since the beginning of my mandate, which started four months ago, as well as explain my intentions for the future. Back in June 2014, the Commission defined a road map for the development of the criteria for endocrine disruptors. The road map, which I need to respect and follow, describes the legislative background and policy options that will be evaluated for the endocrine disruptors in the disruptors criteria. The road map also makes provision for an impact assessment. The work for it started already in 2013 under the joint responsibility of DG Environment and DG SANCO. As of November 2014, it was placed under my full responsibility. Let me briefly explain the reasons for carrying out an impact assessment. Many countries have raised concerns regarding endocrine disruptors but in terms of transposition of the concerns into legislation we, the European Union, are pioneers and world leaders. The EU co-legislators have already set interim criteria which ensure protection of human health and the environment until a permanent decision is taken. The precautionary principle of this approach, which they followed, is one I support. Our future decision will set an example, and therefore it must be made in full knowledge of the facts. Yet endocrine disruption is quite a recent way of looking at the toxicity of chemicals. We see divergent views amongst scientists and regulators worldwide. There are studies being published every day. Just last week new scientific information on the potential high cost to human health and society caused by hormone-disrupting chemicals was published in the press. We monitor these developments and take them into consideration. The new criteria will also affect several other pieces of EU legislation and different kinds of regulatory actions will be triggered. All these reasons objectively justify the need for the impact assessment. I would also recall that the seventh environmental action plan adopted by the European Parliament in 2013 asks the Union to develop harmonised results-based criteria for the identification of endocrine disruptors, which means criteria applicable to all chemical legislation. This is yet another reason for us to undertake an impact assessment in such a sensitive and complex situation. The assessment, which will evaluate different scenarios to define the endocrine disruptors, is already on trial. The first phase of external studies was launched in November 2014. The Joint Research Centre Institute for Health and Consumer Protection is developing a methodology for the criteria to identify the endocrine disruptors. The second phase of the study has already started and will be done by an external contractor. I understand that it will take some time until we complete all the actions set in the road map, but we need to make informed decisions and make them in full transparency. We have organised a public consultation and received 27 000 contributions. They are public and already available via a website. My services are working hard summarising their input. Speaking about transparency, a website dedicated to the issue of endocrine disruptors will be made available very shortly. Additionally, I will be holding a round-table public conference very soon to discuss the outcome of the public consultation. In preparation for this conference we will also hold preparatory meetings with the main stakeholders, Members of the European Parliament and NGOs. If need be, I will organise more than one public meeting on the issue. I am committed to do my job seriously and in full transparency. In parallel, since the beginning of my mandate, I have discussed the issue of endocrine disruptors with a number of Members of the European Parliament and a wide range of stakeholders. I have encouraged European ministers to formulate their approach to the question of endocrine disruptors. Just last week I met the French Minister and discussed the issues with her. It is a complex, difficult file and the Members’ questions show their concern. I invite Members to cooperate with me, to exchange views with me and my services, and to participate in the debate and future events that I mentioned earlier. Meanwhile I am active on this issue. I will do my job in full transparency and will make no compromise on health.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 179, "date": "2015-03-09.json", "name": "Jens Gieseke", "mepid": "124807", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Commissioner Andriukaitis, ladies and gentlemen. Friday 13 December 2013 was not a good day for Europe. That was the day by which the Commission should have developed criteria for endocrine disruptors. This mandate has been given to the Commission by Parliament. However, a glance at the calendar shows that this deadline has simply not been met. It is precisely from the point of view of the citizens, who have to comply precisely with deadlines with regard to the administration, that such a delay is unacceptable. I would like to make it quite clear at this point that there is a clear potential for improvement in the Commission's compliance with deadlines. For far too long, different directions have been worked within the Commission. Valuable time was wasted. The action now being brought against the Commission will certainly be successful on this issue. However, as legislators, we should not be right. We are called upon to make sensible and balanced legislative proposals. However, the differences of opinion within the Commission services and also in the scientific community show how controversial the issue of endocrine disruptors is. As you have just mentioned, Commissioner, there are no simple solutions, and that is why we need a comprehensive impact assessment. The Commission's decision to carry out such an impact assessment should certainly have been taken sooner, that is clear. Our hormonal system is extremely complex and neither the Commission nor science nor industry has a simple solution. If we as a Parliament want to be taken seriously, we must support the Commission in drawing up the impact assessment. We need the impact assessment for good legislation. We should not now make the mistake of having ideological debates and outdoing ourselves with blanket recriminations to the Commission, science or industry.

Nothing more except to see a real sea snake concerning this issue which is not only - as I said - a health scandal but also an economic scandal. It is worth remembering, as the author of the oral question, Mr Caputo, said: decline in male fertility, early puberty, obesity, diabetes, birth defects, breast cancer, it is more than 157 billion euros, or about 1.23% of the gross domestic product of the European Union, that are involved with these endocrine disruptors. Until recently, observers and scientists indicated that 31 pesticides should have been banned in the European Union. A few days ago, in France, it was said that apple cultivation, which is intensive in a number of European countries, would have serious health consequences, including for our children, who eat these apples in our school canteens, all over Europe.

I thought about it very carefully, and one of the reasons is that it presupposes that the criteria for classification of substances as endocrine disruptors is a simple scientific decision that everyone in the scientific community can agree with. Well it is not. The author of the question attested just tonight that if the criteria for EDCs had been published, the entire issue of endocrine disrupters would have been solved, and this is clearly not the case. It is simply not the case. I have just come from the meeting of the Committee on the Environment where Mr Timmermans has been extolling the virtues of impact assessments, with seemingly the majority of Members agreeing with him, so I can assume that the signatories are not against impact assessments per se. I can only conclude that it is part of the ongoing campaign to oversimplify this issue by ignoring the safeguards that are already in place, not least through legislation such as REACH.  So what is this all about? The wording asserting that 31 substances would be banned if a blocked EU paper on hormone—mimicking chemicals had been acted upon comes straight from a document produced by the NGO Pesticide Action Network. This pan—analysis has been challenged by many scientists. This will always be the case. Sometimes scientific consensus emerges, but very rarely complete agreement. This is an ongoing discussion in the scientific community, which is divided on how best to identify and regulate endocrine—disrupters.  The World Health Organization has acknowledged that existing data are not able to demonstrate a causal link between exposure to EDs and adverse health effects. They quite clearly say that. The issue is further complicated by the different regulatory processes that exist in different pieces of sectoral legislation – a hazard—based approach in plant protection products and a risk—based approach in biocides – so we cannot even get that right.  I think the Commission is taking a sensible approach to this very difficult issue. I have been contacted by constituents in my region expressing concern about the potential socio—economic effects, and I do not think that those should be ignored.

Instead, what we hear is that the European Commission is proposing to release an impact assessment in 2016. It is disheartening to hear yet again another story of the Commission bending to its corporate bedfellows instead of implementing rigorous regulation to protect consumers and the environment.  There is no excuse for any delay. There is plenty of scientific evidence to support the immediate suspension of the use of certain harmful substances, and it is a view which is also held by certain influential Member States. So, given that EDCs are used routinely in everyday household items such as toiletries, cosmetics, food containers, plastics and pesticides to name but a few, it is extremely urgent that the precautionary principle be upheld and that action be postponed as the Commission plans. EDCs have been linked to a wide range of diseases and conditions such as – as we have heard – foetal abnormalities, infertility, autism, diabetes and hormonal cancers.

Mr President, Commissioner, we all know that the health cost of endocrine disrupting substances is enormous. This has already been proven by studies carried out by the World Health Organisation and UNIP, which was proven by the study of Professor Kortekamp, who was requested by the Commission's DG ENVI, and this has also been proven by the study made public last week and referred to by you and Mr Pargneaux. The scientists say very clearly that this cost is at least 157 billion, 1.23 % of gross national product. According to these scientists, endocrine disruptors do indeed provide a lower IQ, more obesity in adults and at least 5% of all cases of autism. The situation is therefore very serious.  The European Parliament has always endorsed Professor Kortekamp's recommendations. There is a need for clarity on the definition of endocrine disruptors. In 2009 and 2011, the Council and Parliament already set provisional criteria, but in 2009 the Commission was also instructed to come up with permanent criteria by the end of December 2013. In the meantime, five years have passed, five years of debate, five years of industry lobbying to the highest circles of the European Commission. As far as endocrine disruptors are concerned, incompetent scientists have caused the sowing of doubt, a tactic that we also know from the tobacco industry. Murder and fire screamed the industry. The Commission's Secretary-General, Mrs Day, first decided to launch an impact study. But that's incredible: an impact study on scientific facts! It's like looking for where the cancer comes from and asking the industry that makes the carcinogens: how is it that that cancer is causing it? No, you have to be with scientists for something like that.  The Commission is therefore failing in many respects. She's not fulfilling her legal obligations. A case is before the Court of Justice initiated by Sweden, supported by Parliament and supported by the Council. Secondly, it does not approach the issue horizontally, as imposed in the Seventh Environmental Action Programme and in the roadmap. The Commission is limited to pesticides and biocides.

I would like to point out that reach legislation on EU chemistry had decreed a continental-wide ban on the use of pesticides that have an endocrine disrupting effect, and the Commission was called upon to take all necessary measures to protect public health.  However, the previous DG SANCO tried to circumvent, with all the instruments at its disposal, the eu's imminent ban on pesticides acting as endocrine disruptors. It is only superfluous to remember that these substances alter hormonal regulation, causing effects on behavior, reproduction, the incidence of cancer and also on the onset of birth defects. Despite this, instead of providing safety criteria and a detailed list of endocrine disruptors, DG SANCO has been working behind closed doors to circumvent the ban on REACH legislation, with the support of the European Food Safety Agency. That is why, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we decided to support Sweden, which is suing the European Union for circumvention of this ban, as a result of which there has then been a certain impact on the fertility of so many young people and girls. However, the question remains of the role played by DG SANCO and also by EFSA, which have not acted to protect public health, thus completely betraying their mandate.

The most recent, published on 5 March, presents the annual consequences of these chemical molecules on the territory of the Union: 25,000 deaths, 96 new cases of obesity, 618,000 use of medically assisted reproduction. Obesity, diabetes, autism, cancer: lives are at stake.  Deaf to public health issues, perhaps the Commission will hear the economic argument. In the same study, the cost of endocrine disruptors is estimated at up to 269 billion euros per year. And again, this study admits to ignoring all products or all their effects. If the Commission is unable to protect our health and our economies, it must leave member states free of their policies.

A number of high-profile organizations, such as the World Health Organization or the American Academy of Pediatricians, have drawn attention in recent years to the high danger that endocrine disruptors and other chemicals assimilated to human health pose to human health. Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that, once in the human body, prevent its normal growth and development, bring negative changes to metabolism, leading to various forms of cancer, infertility, obesity or diabetes. The European Union as a whole has a duty to make the health of its citizens a priority. In this respect, I believe that the impact studies launched by the Commission in this area must have as their main objective the potential implications of endocrine disruptors on human health and in no way the economic implications for the industry or trade. We may ask ourselves: what good will a high-productivity high-productivity agriculture do us, but with a sick population. Certainly, we would say, to nothing. I therefore believe that it is necessary to adopt clear rules on combating endocrine disruptors, banning them and replacing them with some substances considered safe, so as to strike a perfect balance in order to ensure the continued protection of human health and the environment and, at the same time, to provide farmers with the plant protection products they need.

The European Environment Agency, in its most recent report, has shown that the current level of exposure to endocrine disruptors is one of the quality indicators with a negative trend. It is clear from the exchanges of emails between senior officials of the European Commission published by The Guardian newspaper at the beginning of February that the Commission has delayed the application of the criteria identified by dg Environment for the enactment of the appropriate delegated acts. Their adoption would have led to the elimination of 20% of the active ingredients used and would have involved the production of triazoles and dithiocarbammates, which represent 80 % of the fungicide market worth EUR 8-9 billion per year. In total, it is estimated that 31 dangerous pesticides used in agriculture would have been banned if the criteria developed had not been blocked for economic reasons.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. As Chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I put the following questions to the Commission on the impact of Russia's restrictions on foreign road hauliers and would like to justify them as follows: on 7 August 2014, the Russian Federation issued a ban on imports of certain food and agricultural products, including from all EU Member States. For the transport sector, the embargo means a ban on the entry of vehicles transporting agricultural products and foodstuffs, thus a significant loss of contracts. The Russian Federation is also hindering the transit of food and agricultural products to which the embargo applies via its territory to third countries, for.B exampleby requiring escorts for such transports, increasing the price of guarantees for companies transporting goods affected by the embargo by ten times, and even by preventing such transits altogether. The Russian market is economically attractive for EU international freight companies, especially those based in Russia's neighbouring countries, due to proximity, size and development potential. The Commission has already responded to these restrictions on Russia by introducing short-term market support measures worth well over EUR 155 million to address market surplus problems for fruit, vegetables and dairy products. However, the impact on the market for the transport of these products has so far been neglected. It should be noted that the goods imported by the Russian Federation, mainly food and industrial products, are mainly transported by land. For hauliers who specialize in the transport of food and have invested in appropriate fleets and refrigerated vehicles, Russia's embargo means the loss of most of their contracts. At the last meeting of the Road Transport Group of the International Transport Forum, which was held on 25 May.  and 26 September 2014 in Paris, a Russian representative also announced that Russia would further restrict cross-border road freight transport on its territory by reducing the number of ECVM permits valid on Russian territory from 67 to 16 from 1 January 2015.  Therefore, my questions: 1. In this context, is the Commission aware of the seriousness of the current situation and is it aware of all the consequences that these Restrictions on Russian Road Transport Companies have for EU hauliers? 2. Can the Commission provide precise information on the losses to the EU economy as a result of these restrictions on Russia, particularly in the transport sector? 3. What measures does the new Commission intend to take to prevent a further deterioration of the situation for EU hauliers? 4. Given the impact of these restrictions on the EU economy as a whole, in particular in the transport sector, how does the new Commission intend to act in the light of the impact of these restrictions on the EU economy as a whole? 5. Does the Commission intend to take measures in the Trade Policy Committee to prepare a complaint against Russia in the WTO? Thank you for your attention and I look forward to the answers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 210, "date": "2015-03-09.json", "name": "Violeta Bulc", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the Russian ban on the import of certain agricultural goods from the EU and from some other countries has had an impact not only on the agricultural sector but also on specialised road transport operations in the EU, in particular in countries with a high volume of agriculture exports to Russia. Before the import ban took affect, Russia was, after the US, the second biggest importer of agricultural goods from the EU.  In terms of value, almost half of the agricultural exports from the EU to Russia, worth EUR 5.1 billion, are affected by the Russian import ban. Above all, this concerns meat and meat products, fish and seafood, milk and dairy products, and prepared fruits and vegetables. In addition, the transit of the banned products through Russia to markets in Central Asia or the Caucasus is also severely restricted, which effectively extends the ban to EU exports of the products concerned of these countries. Road is the main mode of transport for getting EU exports to Russia. More than 80% of all agricultural exports from the EU to Russia go by road, in both value and volume terms.  In addition to the producers of agricultural goods, it is above all road transport operators who are suffering because of the Russian import ban. I and my team are fully aware of this. Just how much they suffer is a question that is difficult to answer and that depends on individual circumstances. It is clear that many of the banned goods which would have gone to Russia are now redirected and sold on other markets.  In some areas, the price of the banned goods in local markets has fallen significantly due to the oversupply that has been created. In particular, road transport operators specialised in the export of agricultural products to Russia and who invested in equipment such as refrigerated vehicles may face real difficulties in the wake of the Russian import ban, but again this depends on how much they were able to redeploy their transport fleet.  How can we help the road hauliers most severely affected by the Russian import ban? Let me be clear. There is not much in terms of direct financial assistance we can offer at EU level. Unlike my colleague in charge of agriculture, I do not have an emergency fund for transport operators. At a national level, however, road hauliers in need may benefit from some state aid.  De minimus rules allow state aid for road freight transport companies of up to EUR 100 000 over a period of three years. There are some conditions attached but such aid does not have to be notified to the Commission. State aid above this limit can only be considered under very strict conditions and would have to be notified to the Commission. Road transport relations between the EU and Russia are still largely governed by bilateral agreements between Russia and individual Member States of the EU. It is therefore in the hands of Member States to see what they can do on the basis of their bilateral agreements. There is no EU-Russia road transport agreement, nor a corresponding policy dialogue. This issue can only be addressed with Russia in the context of our overall EU external policy towards Russia. In the context of the EU external trade policy, the Commission is monitoring the WTO compatibility of the various restrictions applied by Russia very closely, including the restriction on the transit of the banned products through Russia.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none"}, {"id": 211, "date": "2015-03-09.json", "name": "Elżbieta Katarzyna Łukacijewska", "mepid": "96791", "text": "  On behalf of the PPE Group. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by The introduction by the Russian Federation of a ban on imports of a certain catalogue of agri-food products from the European Union has resulted in a significant deterioration of the situation of many companies in the commercial, processing, livestock and agricultural industries, as well as to a large extent transport. The entry ban on vehicles carrying these articles results in the inability of any cargo to pass through Russian territory, resulting in millions of losses and often causing the bankruptcy of many companies operating in the transport sector.  It should be borne in mind that, in addition to factors considered in purely economic terms, social factors must also be taken into account. This is the specter of unemployment for many people who will sooner or later require social support, if only in the form of benefits. This is a great misfortune and uncertainty for a number of entities producing goods exported to Russia and many owners of transport companies, employees and their families. These problems do not apply only to companies Polish, although to a large extent these losses are generated by companies from my country. I therefore believe that it is important that we, in solidarity as the European Union, take action to find solutions that will effectively protect the interests of economic operators with regard to the introduction of restrictions. The lack of mechanisms to counteract the negative effects of the embargo may disrupt the functioning of the European Union's transport market as well as other markets, given the strong links between transport and other industries. At the 2014 Transport Council meeting, Poland proposed to implement concrete solutions to support transport companies affected by the Russian embargo, such as the use of a higher permitted state aid rate or support for those who decide to withdraw part of their rolling stock due to environmental factors.

I join my colleagues in the Committee on Transport and Tourism who draw attention to the effects of these restrictions on the market for international road hauliers of agri-food products. We cannot understand the seriousness of the situation if we neglect the economic loss caused by supply contracts concluded and lost by European carriers operating on the Russian export market. The cumulative impact of oversupply of agri-food products on the internal market, the loss of these contracts and the significant increase in the cost of transport in transit to third countries affect the entire European economy, not just one sector of it. The Central and Eastern European states are most affected by this situation and, due to the sources of the internal market, the effect is felt throughout the EU.

This is not just a single country problem, it is not just a local problem, it is a European problem and countries such as Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, the Czech Republic or Bulgaria, or Greece, or finally my country, Poland, are losing a lot of money on this embargo.  Suffice it to say that since August 2014, when the embargo was introduced, the losses of the Polish transport sector amounted to EUR 22 million, and in November they have already increased to EUR 48 million. The Russian side makes it difficult or completely impossible to transit agri-food products to other countries, and I would also like to draw your attention here to a certain asymmetry in the treatment of transport between the European Union and Russia, because if European transport companies are embargoed, they are controlled in detail, this is not the case with Russian companies. It would certainly be worth considering what to do to ensure that this asymmetry in these relations between Russia and the European Union in this area disappears. Finally, it is very important. European carriers have been taking ticks for several months now, because on the one hand, the minimum wage in Germany, which is hitting transport companies in Europe significantly, and on the other hand, the Russian embargo. I would therefore like to appeal here and ask the Commissioner – and I am pleased that you have said very openly here that she is aware of these problems – but I would like to call on the Commissioner, however, to consider a compensation scheme or, for example, to relax the rules for supporting road hauliers in the context of de minimis aid for the restructuring of credit or leasing obligations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 214, "date": "2015-03-09.json", "name": "Gesine Meissner", "mepid": "96870", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to take a iendled with the ALDE Group. Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner Bulc, you have basically already given the answer, namely that it is difficult at the moment to do something on your part. It is very important for me to point out on this issue that this is not about us not depriving the sanctions to be right. We will now discuss again on Wednesday what this looks like, especially after the assassination of Boris Nemtsov, which must be done in order to maintain further sanctions. The problem is that in this case we are affected by certain sectors. We have already discussed the concern of the agricultural sector and compensation payments there. Commissioner, you yourself have said that there is a crisis pot, and that there is no such thing in the transport sector. A quarter of all EU agricultural exports are affected. These are all exports that are transported in refrigerated trucks. You can't necessarily just repurpose these refrigerated trucks for anything else. Attempts are already being made to find new markets for agricultural products, and in some cases to sell more in the EU. But that is not the same from now on. And if they are new markets, then the question arises as to whether it is of any benefit to Russia's most affected neighbours. It is indeed the case that Lithuania, for example, affects 40% of exports, which is a huge figure. The Baltic States, Poland and Finland are generally the most affected. Of course, we need to think about what can be done. Commissioner, you pointed out that nothing can be expected of the EU, because we do not have a pot for it, that must go through the Member States themselves. Sure, that's one thing. Since we have a European transport market, an internal market, we are also considering how we can perhaps act in solidarity here, because we also share the sanctions against Russia. You yourself said that the data is not yet fully available. Perhaps we can gather even more and then try to find a solution on how to strike a balance together, and not just leave it to the Member States. For example, to have Lithuania compensated alone with 40% would be unfair if you look at the whole of the EU. So there is a certain helplessness here.

Mr President, the question from the European Parliament's Committee on Transport to the Commission - which we are debating today - shows that there is a selective memory in this Chamber. Our committee is talking about the measures to restrict imports and transport of agricultural products taken by Russia on 7 August 2014, forgetting that these were a response to European sanctions against Russia in connection with the Ukrainian crisis a few days earlier, on 31 July.  It is also typical that colleagues in the Committee on Transport are now also calling for restrictions on the movement of goods within the World Trade Organisation. But if anyone has violated the Agency's regulations first, it is the European Union, since Regulation 833 of 2014 on sanctions against Russia does not even mention specific and even essential security interests of the Union or its members affected by Russia's actions in the Ukrainian crisis to justify the imposition of sanctions.  The bottom line is that sanctions have proved ineffective in influencing Russian politics and the only result of the trade war is to harm European producers and carriers. Therefore, either the measures should be mutually lifted or else the European Union must pay full compensation to those affected for as long as Regulation 833 of 2014 remains in force.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure"}, {"id": 216, "date": "2015-03-09.json", "name": "Peter Lundgren", "mepid": "124996", "text": "  On the other: The EFDD Group.

But we should also be perfectly clear what it is. This is a result of the arc being strained by the EU against Russia. Russia's side, of course, responds with this embargo, it is not terribly difficult to figure out. I can also understand that Member States that have a haulage company operating on Russia are concerned about this, but at the same time I find it difficult to believe that we in the European Union will be able to change this, as the Commissioner also confirms to some extent. Another thing i am also thinking about: it is the case that these hauliers who have been affected have invested a lot of money in special vehicles adapted for refrigerated and cold transport. The Russian embargo will then also have the effect of losing the majority of its transports. That is exactly what is happening in my country. Now we are talking about the inside of the EU, where Swedish hauliers have invested a lot of money in what they call \"megatrucks\" here.

The Russian embargo on European food products was introduced on 6 August 2014, while the first economic sanctions by the European Union against Russia date from 17 March 2014. They were then extended by Brussels six times until 31 July 2014. The National Front opposed the sanctions in March, deeming them inappropriate, ineffective and dangerous to the economies of the EU Member States.  This question shows that the National Front was right to oppose it, since the Russian embargo was only the direct and legitimate response to the sanctions imposed by the European Union. Road hauliers in the European Union are therefore the first victims of the absurd sanctions imposed by Brussels. Rather than complaining about their consequences, as Mr Cramer does, I would rather ask the Commission to lift these sanctions. And, I take the gamble, the Russian embargo will be lifted in turn.

At the moment, Europe and, in fact, the whole world is suffering from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. We have chosen in Europe to combat this conflict with sanctions. It hurts. Many different sectors of the economy in Europe are noticing the adverse effects of these sanctions. But, as Mr Cramer also says, we must comply with the international treaties, and we cannot do that without pain.  Of course, the Commissioner is right: agriculture has its own emergency fund. There are several entrepreneurs who can make use of this, and I welcome them to do the same. But we are dealing here with the transport sector and, in particular, the transport sector of our Polish colleagues is suffering enormously from these sanctions. I regret that the Commissioner does not go beyond listing the facts because it does not yet offer any solutions.  That is why I have three questions for her: what are the contacts between her and Mrs Mogherini? The EU has a lot of emergency funds, Mrs Mogherini in particular.

What is less well known to citizens is the huge problem that has been created in the transport sector.  For Greece alone, we estimate 10 million euros, on an annual basis, the lost profits. You understand that in the enormous economic crisis that Greece is going through and in conditions of, many times, unfair competition, this situation can be the final blow. The Commission's response in December 2014, which refuses all assistance and urges the industry to adapt to a different business model, sounds like a mockery.

I think that sanctions should continue, and on behalf of the Committee on Transport, I can only say what is at stake today. This is about the fact that Russia has long before sanctions taken discriminatory approaches to road transport, especially in food transport, even by dividing the Member States of the European Union by different regimes. It is a question of this if, in agriculture, we have a reallocation of agricultural fund money and at the same time we have the resources of the Globalisation Fund, which Mr van de Camp also mentioned, in cases where the processes of globalisation have been impacted by business, then in turn, we do not have any solidarity instruments for such political processes to apply to the road transport sector, which seems absolutely inconceivable.

Allow me to refer to Members’ comments relating to the Globalisation Fund. The Globalisation Fund is intended to support employees laid off as a consequence of the global market opening. As it stands today, it is not designed to compensate for losses brought about by situations similar to those we are discussing today, especially the Russian embargo. Regarding the fourth point, relief measures at national level are possible but they have to respect the relevant EU law. The Commission is open to assessing possible state aid schemes. I know that this is not a perfect solution but at this point the EU does not have its own budget to manage transport policy. The next point is that in EU road transport the EU has only limited means at its disposal for external policy actions. We therefore have to work closely together with the Member States to try to avert the most serious consequences of actions taken by third countries. A quick and lasting improvement in relations between the EU and Russia would of course be desirable, but at this point I can only hope that the political situation supports us in our efforts as soon as possible.

These losses mainly affect small and medium-sized enterprises. Although the decrease in imports will result in cheaper domestic products in our stores in the short term. However, the sector must also face the long-term negative consequences of this measure. We must also remember that the Russian market is one of the most important markets, especially for the countries of the Union further east. The embargo will provide a competitive advantage for non-EU Member States. Circumvention of the ban by delivering products through these countries will trigger an increase in the black market and illegal activities (repackaging, re-labelling). The market support measures provided by the Commission to compensate producers in part for the profits that have been made out are welcome. At the same time, it is necessary that not only producers receive eu assistance, but also the transport and logistics sectors.

The third round of EU compensation for the mitigation of market damage caused by the Russian agricultural embargo at the end of last year Hungary also omitted, similar to Croatia, Slovenia and Romania.  In Hungary, the volume of preliminary applications received last September was more than 10,000 tonnes, i.e. in order of magnitude higher than the quantity envisaged for the country in the second round. To alleviate this, the free-to-use 3,000-ton frame provided in the second round was Hungary only partially exploited due to the shortness of time. This framework is no longer available to my country, and it would be very justified. The overproduction crisis caused by the Russian embargo continues to cause serious damage to the Hungarian, Croatian, Slovenian and Romanian fruit sectors.

Mr President, today I have to raise before the European Parliament a very important issue that has to do with Cypriot shipping, but by extension with European shipping. For years Turkey has, in a pirated, illegal, arbitrary and cynical way, imposed a maritime embargo on ships flying the Cypriot flag and, by extension, imposed an embargo on European ships. It is unacceptable and inconceivable that Turkey should remain undisturbed and unpunished from violating the Ankara Protocol - which it signed and which had to date essentially recognised the Republic of Cyprus and opened the ports and skies - and thus to insult and substantially challenge the European Union itself.  We, as Cyprus, have enormous maritime and economic costs. This cost is also already being already in place.

The Commission's arguments on this approach are very vague. The application of this monitoring entails, under European Union law, exceeding critical thresholds in terms of: the current account balance, the actual change in the exchange rate, the external financial position, the change in the market share of exports, the consolidated debt of the public and private sector, the unemployment rate and the change in liabilities of the financial sector. None of these indicators have reached the critical threshold in my country, so they need to be included in the monitoring.  Romania is in its fourth year of economic growth, has stability on course, has one of the smallest deficits, has export growth, has no bank failures and there are institutional reforms under way. Can we conclude that the romanian government's decision not to extend the agreement with the Monetary Fund may be the cause of Romania's inclusion on the monitoring list?

Again, we note the lack of democratic respect, because among these countries we are surprised to see Turkey, whose eventual accession raises many questions among our compatriots, but which has benefited from a budgetary envelope of almost 5 billion euros. But if I speak on this subject, it is to talk about agriculture, which is one of the sectors financed by this pre-accession aid instrument. The European Union is therefore involved in the development and modernization of the agriculture of these countries, preparing the introduction of their production - I am thinking of Turkish fruits and vegetables for example - on our market.

Already in 2009, a food price monitoring tool was introduced with the aim of increasing market transparency in the food chain. However, the Commission still does not have statistics on retail food margins across the Union.
